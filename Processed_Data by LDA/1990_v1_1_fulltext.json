President Bush endorsed Mr. Reagan's commitment. **********Money Is Frozen **********But the rest of the $15 million has been frozen by Representative Neil Smith, Democrat of Iowa, and Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, who strongly oppose Federal financing of trade fairs. Mr. Smith and Mr. Hollings are the chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees, which allocate the money. **********In 1992, Spain will be host not only to Expo '92 as part of celebrations of the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage to the New World, but also to the Summer Olympics in Barcelona. The absence of the United States from the first of these events would dampen Spain's celebration of its new self-image as a mainstream European player. **********Though several American corporations are planning to take part, Spanish officials are increasingly concerned that the United States Government may not occupy the 90,000-square-foot site allocated to it, the second largest after Spain's. **********''We are worried because the United States is a star participant,'' said Emilio Casinello, president of the Expo '92 State Corporation. Referring to the fair's theme, ''The Age of Discovery,'' he added, ''How can the United States stay away from the age of discovery when they are the discoverers and innovators of modern times?'' **********U.S. Officials Anxious, Too **********Mr. Casinello said the United States trade deficit could grow if it stayed away from Seville while all its major competitors were represented. American officials are also anxious. ''It would send the wrong signals not just to Europe on the eve of economic unification,'' Marvin Stone, commissioner general of the United States national section at Expo 92, said in a telephone interview. **********Mr. Stone said that ''at this point it's a possibility'' that the United States might not attend. **********But Spanish officials say they are confident that the United States will officially confirm its attendance. **********''Every Western country, every member state of the O.E.C.D., every NATO member will be there,'' said Inocencio Arias, Under Secretary General of the Spanish Foreign Ministry.

Corporations issued a total of $72.6 billion, down from an anemic $73 billion issued in the third quarter of last year, according to the Securities Data Company. **********The poor showing for the quarter did not drive the underwriting results for the year to date below those for the period last year. Securities Data reported that $238.09 billion has been raised by corporations so far in 1990, compared with $217.18 billion in the first nine months of 1989. **********Investment bankers said that the bad results in the third quarter were caused largely by the world events that have thrown the financial markets into turmoil. **********''This quarter the new-issue market clearly has been dominated by the events in the Persian Gulf, the increased prospects for a recession and, more recently, problems in the banking system,'' said Mark A. Seigel, a managing director with Morgan Stanley & Company. **********Industrial Companies Active **********Wall Street analysts also said that most issuers were large industrial companies. ''The industrials were the bulk of the issuance,'' said Edson Mitchell, managing director at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. ''The financial issuers were not active.'' **********In some ways, the appetite among the industrial companies for debt issuance reflected the difficulties of the ''junk bond'' market, which virtually collapsed over the year, underwriters said. With hostile takeover bids financed by junk bonds becoming more a memory than a threat, the investor interest has focused again on investment-grade debt, they said. **********Reflecting that change, the demand for private borrowing through the bond market climbed slightly in the third quarter. According to Securities Data, $68.55 billion in debt was issued during the quarter, up from $63.36 billion in the period last year. **********But corporations have been much less able to issue debt that is not secured by assets. Only $19.76 billion in unsecured debt was issued in the third quarter, compared with $27.81 billion a year earlier. **********That drop has been made up in part by mortgage and asset-backed debt.

Only $3.3 billion in stock was issued in the period, compared with $6.1 billion a year earlier. **********Indeed, the difficulties in the financial markets have slowed the trickle of initial public offerings to a near standstill.

Cline, said in an interview that the operations \"made some sense then,\" referring to the post-war period when the Soviet menace loomed large in the minds of American policymakers and when Western military forces were weak in Europe. **********Although the agency declined to comment on the operations today, older officers recalled that there had been a real concern about a Soviet invasion of Western Europe at the beginning of the 1950's. Described in Colby Memoir **********The \"stay behind\" operations are briefly but precisely described in a 1976 Senate document and also in a 1978 memoir, Honorable Men, by William E. Colby, who became director of the C.I.A. in 1973. The recent West European press reports have provided details about the continuance of the \"stay behind\" networks in some West European countries well into the 1970's and in some cases beyond. **********At the time the \"stay behind\" program was begun late in 1950, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was only a year old and could field few troops. \"N.A.T.O. was pretty feeble,\" Mr. Cline said. **********The Greek civil war had recently come to an end, as had the Soviet blockade of Berlin. North Korean troops backed by the Soviet Union and China had invaded and occupied most of South Korea. The Truman Administration was living through what it officially called \"a war scare.\" **********\"The possibility that the Soviets would overrun Western Europe was there,\" Mr. Cline said. \"I never thought they would, but the possibility was there.\"  Matching Wartime Maquis **********The idea was to create units like the French wartime Maquis and have them in place before and after a Soviet takeover, he said. Then, according to the plan, American teams would parachute in to establish liaison and help activate the resistance groups armed from caches already in place. He said the program was designed in the context of psychological warfare operations to \"stiffen the spines\" of Western Europeans by showing that the United States was resolved to defend and assist them. **********The American liaison concept had been developed by the Office of Strategic Services in the latter stages of World War II. It was successfully practiced in the 1944 invasion of France when some 90 teams of three men each parachuted in with two-way radios to operate with Maquis units in blowing up German rail lines and ambushing convoys. Mr. Colby was a member of one such team. **********In November 1950, he was mobilized by the C.I.A. to develop \"stay behind nets\" in Scandinavia to fight in the event of a Soviet invasion. After training in clandestine skills, he was posted to Stockholm. His was part of a program that also built such nets in France, West Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy. **********The program had its origin in policy discussions in the late 1940's involving Roscoe Hillenkoetter, the first C.I.A director, Secretary of State George Marshall and George Kennan, the State Department's Soviet affairs specialist, according to Senate documents. It was implemented by the agency's next director, Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, under an April 1950 policy directive. Former Director Had a Role **********The \"stay behinds\" were organized under the agency's Office of Policy Coordination, as the covert operations branch was then known, and directed by Frank G. Wisner. Mr. Wisner was assisted by Richard Helms, who later became a director of the agency. **********In 1976, the Senate select committee that had investigated American intelligence activities published a short history of the C.I.A. which contained the following passage: \"Until 1950, O.P.C.'s paramilitary activities (also referred to as preventive direct action) were limited to plans and preparations for stay behind nets in the event of a future war. Requested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, these projected O.P.C. operations focused once again on Western Europe and were designed to support NATO forces against Soviet attack.\" **********The budget for the Office of Policy Coordination's worldwide operations, including the European \"stay behinds,\" rose from $4.7 million in 1949 to $82 million in 1952, while its personnel increased from 302 to 6,954 in that period. **********As the C.I.A. station chief in Bonn in the mid-1960's, Mr. Cline, among others, recommended that the program be phased out. By Then, 'Men Too Old to Fight' **********He recalled that by the time he had come in contact with the stay behind operations in West Germany \"they were just a list of names,\" which he said might have numbered a thousand but \"more likely were in the hundreds.\" **********\"What I discovered was no organization, but a lot of men too old to fight,\" he said. \"A lot had already died or were in work where they wouldn't conceivably want to be in the Maquis. A lot of guns and ammunition were in the depots for a long time and there probably weren't any more people to use them. It was scaled way back.\" The small arms and munitions were drawn partly from United States Army stocks and partly from European weapons depots, he said. **********Mr. Cline, whose highest post with the agency was Deputy Director for Intelligence, said he was under the impression that his recommendation for phasing out the stay behind program had been accepted by Richard Helms, then the head of the agency. He said he was somewhat surprised to learn from press reports this week that elements of the program had survived for another decade or longer. **********Mr. Helms said he did not want to talk about the program, partly \"because I can't remember anything about it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/23/business/business-people-tektronix-head-ousted-poor-earnings-are-cited.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 361, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Tektronix Head Ousted; Poor Earnings Are Cited", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   Tektronix Head Ousted; Poor Earnings Are Cited", "body_text": " **********Three years after his surprise promotion to president and chief executive of Tektronix Inc. over higher-ranking colleagues, David P.

The shortage has led to street demonstrations and reportedly to riots in some cities. Philip Morris's shipments will begin as early as the end of this month, and RJR Nabisco's may begin by the first week of October. **********The American cigarettes are destined for the Russian republic, which has half the Soviet population, but presumably that would free scarce domestic cigarettes for the rest of the Soviet Union. **********Cigarettes are sold for widely varying prices in different countries and are heavily taxed. But if the two companies' shipments were valued at 1989 United States prices, excluding taxes, the cigarettes to be sold to the Soviet Union would be worth about $1.9 billion, or a little over a dollar a pack. **********It is an indication of the Soviet Government's strong desire for the cigarettes that it has agreed to pay in scarce hard currency and ''counter-trade items'' that can easily be sold for cash. A Philip Morris spokesman declined to say what those items were but said the company was ''very comfortable with the items because they are readily and clearly marketable.'' Oil is one possibility, because the Soviet Union is a large producer of oil. It is unclear why the Soviets could not sell the items in question for the needed cash. **********Neither the Philip Morris Companies nor RJR Nabisco would disclose all the terms of the transaction, partly because the Soviet Union is still negotiating with other tobacco companies in the United States and other countries. But Philip Morris said it planned to ship Marlboros, the world's best-selling brand, as well as a selection of its other brands yet to be determined. RJR Nabisco plans to sell Winstons and other brands. **********The Tobacco Merchants Association, a trade group, estimated that Soviet consumption totaled about 418.5 billion cigarettes in 1989, or about 80 percent of the 524 billion smoked in the United States. **********Raymond J. Pritchard, chairman and chief executive of Brown & Williamson, the nation's No. 3 cigarette maker, said the Soviet shortage could be equivalent to a shortfall of perhaps 200 billion cigarettes a year. He said he had learned while traveling in Bulgaria that 11 of 20 Soviet cigarette plants had been shut down for repair or maintenance. ''It was a major bureaucratic screw-up,'' he said. **********Problem in Bulgaria **********In addition, Bulgaria, which provided nearly all of the 55 billion cigarettes the Soviet Union usually imports, started experiencing shortages of cellulose acetate, a material used for cigarette filters, because of a lack of hard currency. ''The imports from Bulgaria dropped very dramatically, worsening the shortage that was already apparent in the Soviet Union,'' Mr. Pritchard said.  Brown & Williamson, a unit of B.A.T. Industries of London, is also negotiating with the Soviet Union for a large order of cigarettes but will probably sell the less expensive cigarettes known as generics. The company said that by yesterday it had not received word on its bid. **********The shipments by Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco, which are the largest single export orders ever for both companies, may take as long as two weeks to ship to ports in Europe like Antwerp, Belgium. It may take another two weeks for land transport to the Soviet Union. Both companies are considering air freight for speedier shipment. **********Worldwide exports for Philip Morris are about 360 billion cigarettes and about 101 billion for RJR Nabisco. **********U.S. Production Capacity **********The Soviet order will tax Philip Morris's production capacity in the United States because demand is already high for many of its brands, especially Marlboro, said John A. Dollison, a company spokesman. The cigarettes produced for Russia will be made in American factories, and an undetermined number of Philip Morris factories in other countries. **********''We will be looking to do deals with other republics of the Soviet Union,'' Mr. Dollison said. ''We are only too keen to talk.'' **********The Philip Morris cigarettes will be sent between late September 1990 and December 1991 and the RJR cigarettes between October 1990 and September 1991. **********Philip Morris also announced that it planned to sell cigarettes to the Soviet Union over the long term as well. It said that it signed two agreements with the Soviet Government. One provides for ''the continuing supply of significant quantities of cigarettes'' to the Russian republic between 1992 to 1995. The second agreement provides for Philip Morris to provide technical assistance to modernize antiquated Soviet cigarette factories. **********RJR Nabisco is also close to signing similar agreements, said Brenda H. Follmer, an RJR Nabisco spokeswoman. The company may produce Winston cigarettes at the existing Uritsky cigarette plant in Leningrad and may help with the modernization of other cigarette factories, Ms. Follmer said. **********No Health Warning **********While Phillip Morris and RJR Nabisco said the cigarettes destined for the Soviet Union will be identical in every way to American cigarettes, they acknowledged that the cigarettes would lack the Surgeon General's health warning about cancer and other diseases linked to smoking. ''We put whatever labels are required by local government authorities,'' Ms. Follmer said. **********It is unclear how much the American cigarettes will sell for, but there were reports that a pack of Marlboros were selling for up to 20 rubles, or $32, on the Moscow black market. The average monthly wage for a Soviet worker is 240 rubles. **********Earlier this summer, the cigarette shortage added to public outrage over shortages of basic foodstuffs. Last month, state-run newspapers said that Soviet authorities were cracking down on black marketeers hoarding cigarettes and that a Moscow factory was running overtime to produce 45 million cigarettes in 24 hours. **********Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov sought to assure the Soviet Union's 70 million smokers that more cigarettes - both domestic and imported - would be available soon. **********But street demonstrations have grown in Leningrad and especially in Moscow."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/19/business/company-news-changes-to-cut-pillsbury-jobs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 229, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Changes to Cut Pillsbury Jobs", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Changes to Cut Pillsbury Jobs", "body_text": " **********In a move to improve the operating efficiency of its Pillsbury Inc. division, Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. today announced a $140 million plant modernization program that will result in the elimination of up to 1,300 jobs as outdated production operations are closed. **********The move is intended to modernize and consolidate Pillsbury's outmoded manufacturing and distribution system. **********The need for such a large-scale revamping ''points out just how far behind Pillsbury was in making themselves an efficient operation,'' said L.

Milken, was greeted with a yawn in the financial markets. **********The Dow Jones industrial average dipped Monday as rumors of Drexel's problems spread, but the market's moves were gentle thereafter, and the Dow ended the week down just 12.61 points, to 2,635.39. It was news that Drexel would no longer be a player, but it was already clear - since the Campeau bankruptcy, if not before - that the game had changed. **********Some good news on the economic front may have helped share prices, as retail sales rebounded and business inventories fell, reversing trends that had sparked recession worries. And the trade deficit shrank in December. **********In a volatile financial world, few firms could claim a longer history than Drexel, dating from 1838, when Francis M. Drexel of Philadelphia began dealing in currencies issued by state-chartered banks. Just twice in that history, each time under the guidance of a dynamic young financier, did Drexel become a major power on Wall Street. The difference in directions taken in those two eras helps to explain why Drexel's current problems proved fatal. **********J. P. Morgan joined Drexel in 1871 at the age of 34, and the New York outpost of the Philadelphia firm was renamed Drexel, Morgan & Company. Railroad bonds were that era's financial craze, and many defaulted. In helping to get the rails reorganized, and the investors protected from rail bosses whose ethical standards earned the epithet ''Robber Barons,'' Mr. Morgan gained wealth and fame. **********In 1969, 23-year-old Michael Milken was hired as a bond analyst by Drexel, Harriman, Ripley, the firm that had evolved from the Philadelphia Drexel firm after it separated from Morgan. **********Mr. Milken, too, was confronted by bond-market disasters, and he concluded that the ''junk bonds'' of his era were trading too cheaply. He was right, and for a time he and his customers prospered. **********From his experiences, Mr. Morgan concluded it was essential for a company to be financially secure, with enough resources to withstand a ''panic,'' as depressions were known in those days, and for it to have an unquestioned reputation for honesty. In 1907, both the Government and Wall Street relied on Mr. Morgan to stem that year's panic. **********Mr. Milken learned a different lesson. Having seen that companies in trouble could survive and meet their obligations, he became an evangelist for debt, arguing that both borrowers and lenders would prosper as billions in new low-grade bonds were issued. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., as the firm became known, followed his lead. Its profits were spent, not saved, and corners were cut in ways the Government concluded were illegal. **********By 1990, the lessons of Morgan had been long forgotten. When the junk bond panic arrived, the lenders vanished and Drexel, with no financial cushion, could not stay in business."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/09/business/home-resale-drop-is-1.6.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 299, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Home Resale Drop Is 1.6%", "print_headline": "Home Resale Drop Is 1.6%", "body_text": " **********Ex-isting house sales declined 1.6 percent in the first quarter, a real estate trade group said today, as mortgage rates anchored themselves in double digits and prices in many areas continued to rise. **********The National Association of Realtors said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.81 million units in the period, down from 3.87 million units in the fourth quarter and 3.90 million in the first quarter of 1989. **********At the same time, the survey showed the median price of existing houses rose 5.2 percent, to $95,900, up from $91,200 in the corresponding period of 1989.

''Manic-depressive'' would be the diagnosis. One moment all is well; the next brings obvious and overwhelming reasons for fear. **********Consider the stock market. Less than two months ago, the newsletter writers surveyed by Investors Intelligence of New Rochelle, N.Y., saw a bright future for stocks. Now the proportion of bears has more than doubled. The economic outlook really hasn't changed much over that stretch, but weakness in stock and bond prices proved terrifying to that band of gurus. **********When opinions are that widely held, they often end up being wrong. So it may be no surprise that stocks have stopped falling and started to recover. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 45.50 points, to 2,648.20 last week, its second gain in as many weeks, as long-despised technology stocks led the way up. **********The real stars so far this year, however, have been energy stocks, a group out of favor for a decade. They held up well when most stock prices fell in January, and are drawing in more cash from buyers now. ''It's a major shift in market leadership,'' said Ken Spence, Salomon Brothers' chief technical analyst. ''It's an environment similar to the late 1970's.''

By the time last week's Treasury refunding approached, there was fear of blood on the Street. But the auctions went reasonably well, and a spirit of joy returned, at least in the Treasury market. ''Junk bonds'' still suffer from a dearth of buyers. **********Many of the trends and facts that engulf Wall Street go almost unnoticed on Main Street, where most people spend their days far away from a Quotron terminal, blissfully unaware of the nuances of the latest changes in producer prices or German interest rates. When they make investments, it is not with a view to scalping a quick profit before lunch. **********It was the public that snapped up Thursday's issue of 30-year bonds, while the pros were cautious. Bids that did not set a rate - the so-called ''non-competitive tenders'' that are the hallmark of individual investors - bought 9.6 percent of the bonds, which will pay 8.5 percent interest. Not since the double-digit interest-rate days of the early 1980's has the public been that enthusiastic. Some of those tenders may have been from small banks, buying Treasury bonds because they don't have many attractive loan opportunities, but a big part of the demand came from individual investors. **********Wall Street would like everyone to believe that the public is always wrong, the better to persuade investors to hand over their cash to a professional.

Investment bankers don't have engineering degrees. Shaky bridge loans these days have more than a few Wall Streeters quaking, and played a role in Friday's stock market tumble. Rising interest rates and worries over inflation also played a role, as producer prices were reported to have risen 4.8 percent in 1989, the largest annual gain since 1981. The interest-sensitive Dow Jones utilities average has fallen 6.1 percent so far in 1990, its worst fortnight since the 1987 crash. But fear that easy takeover financing is at an end may be the biggest reason that the Dow Jones industrial average ended the week down 84.04 points, to 2,689.21. **********The most prominent bridge loan is the $400 million that the Campeau Corporation owes to First Boston, Paine Webber and Dillon Read. That loan, which helped Campeau spend too much in buying Federated Department Stores, got lots of press last week as Campeau teetered on the edge of bankrupcy. **********But First Boston and its friends are not alone on high bridges. As Shearson Lehman Hutton prepares to sell stock to raise capital, one money manager confesses to finding the shares cheap but adds that he is worried about Shearson's $500 million bridge loan to Prime Computer. **********A bridge loan is supposed to tide over an acquirer until permanent financing is arranged. Once it seemed like a great way to make money. Now it seems like a financial form of Russian roulette, in which the investment bank makes a little money if all goes well. If not, it loses a lot more than it can afford. **********Some on the Street blame Michael Milken for bridge loans. Not that Drexel Burnham Lambert pioneered them, but the competing firms needed a way to assure clients that they could complete offers, as Drexel was able to do with its letters saying it was ''highly confident'' it could sell junk bonds to finance deals for its clients. So bridges were built. **********When the music stopped at the takeover tango, Drexel had egg on its face as it was unable to raise cash it promised for some deals. Its competitors have black holes on their balance sheets. Egg is better. **********The question now is whether the dance is over, or just waiting for the band to finish its break.''I think we're getting a permanent disappearance of the junk bond market'' as a takeover tool, said John Paulson, a partner in Gruss & Company. Gruss used to concentrate on speculating in takeover stocks. Now it plans to focus on trading bonds of troubled companies. ''We think that will be the great opportunity of the 90's,'' said Mr. Paulson. **********Even a decline in interest rates might not help the takeover market now, since the credit cutoff reflects default fears, not Federal Reserve tightening. But the Fed is probably less likely to lower rates with inflation fears again rising, and with interest rates climbing around the world, higher rates in this country may be needed to protect the dollar.

Baker 3d today defended his handling of arms control negotiations with Moscow, saying that those who have accused him of giving too much to the Soviets are people who were never interested in arms reduction agreements with the Kremlin in the first place. **********Mr. Baker, smarting at suggestions that he had been snookered in his talks last week with the Soviets, used a White House briefing about the coming summit conference to try to smother a brushfire of criticism from conservative columnists and the Republican right that he was too generous with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. **********Defending the compromises he struck in Moscow last week in order to conclude a treaty limiting long-range strategic nuclear missiles, Mr. Baker said they had the full support of the United States military. **********In addition, he said, the compromises came after a series of concessions by the Soviets that will force them to cut their heaviest missiles by 50 percent and will allow Washington to protect its most valued programs, like cruise missiles and ''Star Wars''. **********Moscow Delays a Vote **********Mr. Baker also announced that he had just learned that the Supreme Soviet has not scheduled a vote for May 31 on a pending bill codifying freer emigration. When he was in Moscow last week, Mr. Baker was told that the bill would be on the calendar for that day, causing a bit of consternation in the White House. **********At the Malta summit meeting in December, President Bush promised that as soon as this bill was passed he would waive the Jackson-Vanik trade restrictions, thereby allowing the Soviet Union to export products to the United States at the lowest tariff rates possible. Since then, however, the situation in Lithuania has arisen. **********While Administration officials have declined to say so publicly, they have concurred that until the tension between Mr. Gorbachev and the Baltic states is clearly on the road to resolution, it would be preferable for the President not to waive the Jackson-Vanik provisions, no matter what happens with the Soviet emigration bill. **********Administration officials are concerned that President Bush will waive the Jackson-Vanik restrictions and that the Soviet leader will crack down on the Baltics a short time later, leaving the White House looking foolish. In addition, officials believe that even if the President wanted to waive the trade restrictions, he could run into serious opposition in Congress as long as the Baltic situation is in turmoil. **********Administration officials were therefore dreading the idea that the Soviets would pass the bill on the second day of the summit meeting. Mr. Gorbachev would then ask President Bush to fullfill his Malta promise and the President would be forced to say no. Officials said they still have not been able to sort out whether the postponement of the vote in Moscow was purely a scheduling matter or a decision by Mr. Gorbachev to avoid an embarrassing situation. **********White House on Defensive **********But it was on the question of his handling of arms control negotiations, not trade, that Mr. Baker was most animated. The criticism of his negotiating strategy, symbolized in today's issue of The Washington Times with the banner headline: ''Baker 'Sellout' in Arms Talks Feared,'' has put the Secretary of State and the White House somewhat on the defensive a week before Mr. Gorbachev's arrival. **********Answering a question about the compromise he struck in Moscow last week in an effort to close a treaty limiting strategic long-range nuclear weapons, Mr. Baker said with a jab at some of his Reaganite critics, ''First of all, let me say that I don't think you should look just at one negotiating session.'' **********''We've had a number of negotiating sessions on Start, going back into the Reagan Administration,'' he said, referring to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. **********There is, he added, ''very strong support for this agreement among the military leadership of the United States of America - support for it as a good agreement that is very much in the national security interests of the United States. And it would appear to me at least that most of the criticism is coming from those who in the past, from time to time, have simply rejected the concept of arms control generally.'' **********The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, Mr. Baker said, ''is shaping up largely on original United States concepts and original United States proposals.'' **********'All the Other Way Round' **********''It's been quite some time, I think, since anyone would even argue that we've made concessions,'' he said. ''It's been pretty much all the other way around. **********''Let me remind you that this treaty will achieve a 50 percent cut in SS-18's, the heavy missiles that the Soviet Union has and that we don't have. They've got 308 of them and they'll only have 154 after this treaty, and that's very important from the standpoint of the United States. And it will represent a 50 percent cut in Soviet ballistic missile warheads as well. **********''You may have forgotten,'' Mr. Baker continued, that at the Wyoming United States-Soviet ministerial meeting last September the American side convinced Moscow to drop its demand for a formal link between a strategic arms treaty and one that would limit the United States Strategic Defense Initiative, or ''Star Wars,'' program. **********''People said in the aftermath of that meeting, 'Gosh, that couldn't be true, it's too strongly held a position by them, and the two sides were at loggerheads,'' Mr. Baker said. ''And yet they came to our position. You may have forgotten the Krasnoyarsk radar, which was a stumbling block for a number of years and which the Soviets agreed here in one of our negotiating sessions not long ago was indeed a violation and they said they'd take it to the ground.'' **********''And perhaps you've forgotten,'' he continued, that differences over air-launched and sea-launched cruise missiles ''hung this treaty up for so many years, and we've got what we want, and we've got a treaty that protects us on'' both nuclear-tipped and conventionally armed cruise missiles."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/06/world/evolution-in-europe-bush-gains-time-as-moscow-delays-law-on-emigration.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Rosenthal", "pub_date": "1990-06-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1069, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  BUSH GAINS TIME AS MOSCOW DELAYS LAW ON EMIGRATION", "print_headline": "EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;   BUSH GAINS TIME AS MOSCOW DELAYS LAW ON EMIGRATION", "body_text": " **********A conflict between the White House and Congress over the trade accord signed at the Washington summit meeting was averted today when the Soviet Parliament said it would probably not take up a new law permitting unfettered emigration until September. **********Because passage of the Soviet law is a condition for expanding trade ties with Moscow, the White House said today that President Bush would not submit the accord that he signed on Friday with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to the Senate until September at the earliest, assuming that the Soviet legislature, the Supreme Soviet, acted then. **********Political Breathing Space **********The likely delay will give the White House political breathing space to shore up support for the trade agreement. Presidential aides greeted the news from Moscow with obvious relief. **********As the results of the summit meeting were tallied, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union announced today at a meeting of foreign ministers in Copenhagen that the Soviet Union would withdraw a small number of its short-range nuclear weapons from Central Europe. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d lost little time in dismissing the military significance of the Shevardnadze announcement. [Page A10.]  Soviet officials said the decision to postpone the vote on the emigration bill could conceivably be changed, but the legislation was not on the agenda of the Parliament's current session, which ends on June 14. The Parliament does not convene again until September. **********On the trade treaty, some American officials said the Administration was aware before it signed the accord that the Soviet Union, which delayed passage of the emigration bill before, could well do so again. That would give Mr. Bush time to deal with Congressional opposition to the treaty. **********But Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said this consideration ''didn't have any influence'' on Mr. Bush, who he said had ''no idea'' beforehand that the vote would be delayed until September. ''We didn't have any indication of a timetable,'' he said. ''We assumed it was totally unpredictable, just like our own Congress.'' **********At a meeting today with Congressional leaders, Mr. Bush defended his decision to sign the trade treaty. He has been criticized by some lawmakers for not linking the signing of the treaty to a resolution of Moscow's struggle with Lithuania over its declaration of independence. Senator George J. Mitchell, the majority leader, accused Mr. Bush of ''abandoning Lithuania.'' **********Several of the lawmakers who met with Mr. Bush said they warned him that the treaty would not go through the Senate as long as Moscow's dispute with Lithuania was in a stalemate. **********''Even after they codify their emigration practices, if the Lithuania or Baltic problem is not resolved, then I think it will become a matter of great concern in the Congress,'' said Senator Bob Dole, the minority leader. **********Administration officials said they saw the Soviet Parliament's action today as a temporary reprieve from the political battle over the trade agreement and expressed hope that Mr. Gorbachev might be able to make progress toward resolving the Baltic dispute by the time the Soviet Parliament votes on the new emigration law. **********The news today from Moscow on the Parliament's agenda was the latest twist in the tortuous history of the treaty, which sets rules for Soviet-American commerce, establishes protections for American companies doing business in Moscow and would increase the volume of trade by leading to the lifting of longstanding barriers, including higher tariffs and restrictions on Soviet access to American financial markets. **********Officials said that Mr. Bush warned Mr. Gorbachev five weeks ago in a letter that the proposed treaty was a political land mine because Congress was unlikely to approve it without a resolution of the Lithuanian situation or at least a lifting of Moscow's economic sanctions against the Baltic republic and the start of negotiations. The sanctions were imposed after Lithuania declared independence on March 11. **********An Implied Warning **********The letter's implied warning that no trade agreement would be signed at the Washington summit meeting was made explicit just before Mr. Gorbachev arrived, the officials said. Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, the Soviet Ambassador to Washington, was told last Wednesday that the treaty would not be among the documents Mr. Bush was willing to approve at a signing ceremony with Mr. Gorbachev that was scheduled for Friday, an official said. **********But there were sentiments within the Administration that the treaty should be signed, and even as Mr. Bessmertnykh was given the warning, the Administration was considering the option that was finally adopted - signing the treaty but holding up Senate consideration until the new emigration law was adopted, officials said. **********''There was a sense that not to sign it at all would be a rebuke to Gorbachev at a time when we are trying not to show a loss of support for perestroika,'' an official said. Then, over two days of talks with Mr. Bush, Mr. Gorbachev made the trade agreement a personal issue between the Presidents, officials said. **********Members of the Soviet delegation threatened, meanwhile, to scuttle a long-term grain agreement if the overall trade accord were not signed, officials said. **********Mr. Fitzwater said of the delay of the emigration law: ''That may not be bad in the sense of it gives them a little time'' to work out the Lithuanian dispute and issues related to emigration. These include Mr. Gorbachev's suggestion that he might consider delaying Soviet Jews' emigration visas unless Israel guarantees that they will not settle in the occupied territories. **********Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Gorbachev's warning is ''contrary to our policy'' and added that Mr. Bush told Mr. Gorbachev that the United States wanted to see unfettered Jewish emigration. **********During a discussion on human rights, Mr. Bush also expressed concern about what he perceived as rising anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union, officials said. He suggested that both leaders ''speak out against it,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. **********''President Gorbachev said he would look for an opportunity to do that, but that was it,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/12/business/bonn-s-point-man-on-currency.html": {"writer_name": "Ferdinand Protzman", "pub_date": "1990-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1581, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bonn's Point Man on Currency", "print_headline": "Bonn's Point Man on Currency", "body_text": " **********West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's call last week for talks with East Germany on creating a single German currency was a bold political maneuver - plus a daunting economic and financial challenge. And the challenge of putting the proposed monetary union in place, of making the West German mark the official currency of East Germany, would land on the doorstep of the Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank. **********Karl Otto Pohl, the 60-year-old president of the Bundesbank, seems to be a reluctant conscript in Mr. Kohl's drive for a monetary union, which would sharply accelerate the pace of economic reunification of East and West Germany. When the Chancellor announced his proposal on Tuesday, Mr. Pohl branded it ''a very fantastic idea.'' **********Indeed, even before Mr. Kohl's announcement, Mr. Pohl and other Bundesbank directors had cast doubt on the merits of monetary union in the near future. First, Mr. Pohl said, East Germany needed to build its economy up to a level closer to the West's; he had doubts that shifting to another currency alone would solve East Germany's problems. For Bonn, he warned, a rapid currency union involved serious risks of rising inflation, higher interest rates and deepening budget deficits. **********Abrupt Change of Rhetoric **********But Mr. Pohl, a central banker of proven political skills, having risen in the Government ranks as a protege of Helmut Schmidt, changed his rhetoric abruptly after the West German Cabinet backed Mr. Kohl on Wednesday. The Government set up a ''German unity'' committee to pursue negotiations with the East German Government on monetary union. Afterward, Mr. Pohl explained pointedly that his differences with the Kohl Government were mainly over matters of timing, not substance. **********''One must not look at currency union with a shopkeeper mentality,'' Mr. Pohl said in a radio interview. He called Mr. Kohl's plan ''a historic decision that could not be approached with a faint heart.'' **********Mr. Pohl's changed tone is largely a compromise with reality. Established in 1957 and modeled closely on the United States Federal Reserve System, the Bundesbank has, by law, a high degree of independence, but it is required to support the general economic policy of the Government. **********Besides, any move to create a monetary union would be a political decision for East and West Germany. The Bundesbank could not veto the move, regardless of the qualms of its top officials. Indeed, though Mr. Pohl sat in on the Wednesday Cabinet meeting, no Bundesbank representative will be on the Government's ''unity'' committee, set up to map out all aspects of reunification, beginning with monetary union. **********'Really Irresponsible' **********The Bundesbank, economists say, now finds itself in a difficult position. ''What the Bonn Government has done is really irresponsible,'' said Jonathan Hoffmann, an economist with Credit Suisse-First Boston in London. ''Having an independent central bank gives them the opening to make an extravagant political promise, and then step back and leave it up to the Bundesbank.'' **********Still, reservations about the proposed monetary union extend well beyond the Frankfurt headquarters of the Bundesbank. Many crucial particulars have not yet been discussed, notably the appropriate exchange rate. Beyond that, serious questions remain about how it will work and if it will have the desired effect of shoring up the East German economy enough to stop the steady drain of its citizens to the properous West, at the rate of nearly 2,000 a day. **********The thinking behind the proposal is that monetary union would restore the flagging confidence of East Germans that their economy would be formally integrated into West Germany, giving the East Germans reason to stay home. **********In East Berlin, there are clearly misgivings about a rapid monetary union. The economic integration that comes with the shift to a single currency, for instance, may bring widespread layoffs and higher prices as inefficient East German state industries fall by the wayside and subsidies are trimmed. For East Germany, a monetary union would amount to giving up its economic sovereignty. **********'Social Consequences' **********With an eye on the March elections, the Economics Minister of East Germany, Christa Luft, said ''a union has such huge economic and social consequences that a Government with only a few weeks left in office understandably cannot give its blessing.'' **********''Politically, the proposal could be a solution, but economically, I have my doubts for both sides,'' she said. **********For the Bundesbank, the main worry about a rapid monetary union - and the economic reunification that would inevitably accompany it -is that it poses a severe inflationary threat. The most obvious, but less significant, source of inflationary pressure associated with monetary union would be the printing of more West German marks to exchange for Ostmarks. **********Until a rate of exchange is decided, it is impossible to say how much additional money supply will be created. But it would not seem to be a big problem for the Bundesbank. For example, if one West German mark was issued and exchanged for five East German marks, the addition to the nation's money supply would be about 3 percent, by some estimates. **********''The financing problem is manageable,'' Mr. Pohl said last week. **********Larger Inflation Threat **********But the larger inflation threat linked to monetary union would be posed by the huge amount of spending required to lift the East German economy toward the standards of the West. The forecasts are guesses at best, analysts admit, but the numbers range up to more than $600 billion over the next several years. Most of that money would presumably come from West Germany, through some combination of private and Government investment. And the higher spending, particularly by the Government, could well fuel inflation. **********For an institution that has been called ''the world's financial conscience on inflation'' - fighting it even when there is none - the genuine prospect of inflation is a chilling matter. **********Like other central banks, the Bundesbank is charged with regulating the amount of money in circulation and of credit supplied to the economy with the aim of maintaining the value of money. The Bundesbank takes its marching orders seriously indeed, helped by a powerful anti-inflation consensus in West German society. **********Here, the word ''inflation'' has a tenacious grip on the national psyche. Many German families still have some memory of the hyper-inflation of the 1920's - the wheelbarrows full of currency that bought a loaf of bread or bowl of soup. That clearly colors the thinking of the Bundesbank policy makers, and even modest upturns in inflation are viewed with alarm. **********In the late 1970's, West Germany's trading partners, particularly the United States, urged Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's Social Democratic Government to act as an economic locomotive to pull Europe out of recession. While economic growth rose, so did inflation. By 1981 it was running at a 6.3 percent annual rate. **********Playing on Fears **********A year later, Mr. Schmidt was gone, replaced by Mr. Kohl and his center-right coalition, which made effective use of inflation fears in its election campaign. **********That lesson was not lost on Mr. Pohl, a Social Democrat who was appointed president of the Bundesbank in 1979 by Mr. Schmidt. During the 1980's the Bundesbank kept its monetary policy fairly tight. Inflation dropped steadily, and in 1986 West Germany actually had deflation of two-tenths of 1 percent. During Mr. Pohl's tenure, West Germany has had the lowest inflation of any industrialized nation, and it is now running at a modest annual pace of about 3 percent. **********Because of its success in limiting inflation, the Bundesbank is held in high esteem by most Germans. **********Accordingly, its critics have been almost exclusively foreigners. For example, James A. Baker 3d, when he was Treasury Secretary in the Reagan Administration, would often accuse the Bundesbank of being obsessed with inflation, undermining the world's economic growth. The French Government has also pricked the Bundesbank from time to time about slow growth. In the French view, inflation of up to 8 or 9 percent is a sign of a robust economy. **********Moderate to Rabid **********Within the Bundesbank's 19-member central bank council, the views seem to range from moderately to rabidly anti-inflationary. Helmut Schlesinger, vice president of the Bundesbank, is often singled out as a true hard-liner. Mr. Baker once accused him of leading a cadre of inflexible monetarists on the Bundesbank's council that would fight inflation at any cost, including economic growth. **********The council meets every two weeks at Bundesbank headquarters in Frankfurt to set monetary policy. It is headed by either Mr. Pohl or, in his absence, Mr. Schlesinger, and consists of the 8 bank directors and the presidents of the 11 state central banks, for a total of 19 members. **********The composition is intended to represent fairly the federal structure of West Germany. Decisions are made by a simple majority of the votes cast. While the state central bank presidents usually take their cues from the Bundesbank directors, there have been instances in which the council went against their wishes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/30/world/upheaval-in-the-east-lithuania-offers-to-discuss-a-vote-on-its-sovereignty.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1990-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  LITHUANIA OFFERS TO DISCUSS A VOTE ON ITS SOVEREIGNTY", "print_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;   LITHUANIA OFFERS TO DISCUSS A VOTE ON ITS SOVEREIGNTY", "body_text": " **********Leaders of this republic's embattled independence government sent a signal of compromise to the Kremlin tonight, saying they were ready to discuss the difficult issue of a referendum on secession if President Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed to talk with them. **********The Lithuanian President, Vytautas Landsbergis, conceding that the Kremlin had greeted his pleas for negotiations with a ''concrete wall,'' appeared to be searching openly for a conciliatory note that might entice Moscow to the negotiating table. **********''There are no questions that cannot be discussed except the question of Lithuanian independence,'' Mr. Landsbergis said at a news conference. ''The problem of the referendum could also be discussed.'' **********Meeting Gorbachev's Complaints **********The republic's Parliament declared Lithuania independent of Soviet rule 18 days ago without holding a referendum among Lithuanian citizens. This has been a particular complaint of Mr. Gorbachev as he continues to denounce the republic's secession as illegal and therefore nonnegotiable. **********Mr. Landsbergis had previously belittled the referendum issue. He has said that Lithuania is not seeking permission to secede, but rather reclaiming the independence it lost 50 years ago when it was forcibly annexed by Stalin as a result of a Soviet nonaggression pact with Hitler. **********An additional suggestion of compromise today was the outright endorsement of an independence referendum by Algirdas Brazauskas, the leader of the Lithuanian Communist Party, which broke away from the Soviet Communist Party in December. Mr. Brazauskas, also a Deputy Prime Minister of Lithuania, is viewed by the public as one of the few accomplished politicians here capable of dealing with the Kremlin. **********'An Additional Ace' **********''A referendum would be an additional ace in our negotiating position,'' said Mr. Brazauskas, who appeared at the Lithuanian President's side to propose that the independence issue be put to the voters. **********Moscow is drafting a law on procedures for secession by Soviet republics. It includes requirements like a referendum, a five-year waiting period, satisfaction of economic claims and approval by the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies. The Baltic republics have said the draft law is unacceptable. **********There has been no sign that Moscow is entertaining the notion of compromise as the dispute over sovereignty continues. But Mr. Brazauskas noted that in his last visit to the Kremlin, on March 13, Mr. Gorbachev argued that Lithuania's failure to put the independence issue directly to the voters further weakened its position. **********Buying Some Time **********''He was insisting on the necessity of a referendum,'' Mr. Brazauskas said. While a vote might not change Mr. Gorbachev's opposition, the Lithuanian party chief said, it would make the republic's case much more emphatic. **********Lithuanian leaders have repeatedly said that a referendum would show overwhelming support for independence. About 80 percent of the republic's people are of Lithuanian heritage, and the only real opposition to independence comes from non-Lithuanians. A referendum might give Mr. Gorbachev a bit of time and perhaps a chance to preserve the illusion that Lithuania is following Moscow's rules, as other independence-minded republics anxiously watch the struggle. **********The political chemistry at the press conference was interesting. Mr. Brazauskas, a bluff party careerist, showed a positive zest for political detail and speculation. **********Mr. Landsbergis, a music professor who came to politics by way of the independence drive and prevailed over Mr. Brazauskas when a president was selected, maintained an icy, untrusting reserve toward the Kremlin. He reiterated that the Soviet authorities were waging a war of nerves in the republic, and he assailed the arrests of young Lithuanians who had deserted the Soviet Army in the name of patriotism. **********Party Chief Projects Confidence **********Mr. Brazauskas talked confidently of approaching Moscow with ''a certain compromise, a certain firmness.'' **********''I do not think Mr. Gorbachev has a very bad attitude toward Lithuania,'' he said. He said that despite the recent harassment of Lithuanians by the Soviet military, the Soviet President was ''seeking a way out.'' **********The joint press conference raised the question of whether a new strategy was being attempted by the Lithuanians. **********Was Mr. Brazauskas, with his timeworn party credentials and populist appeal, finally assuming the role of realistic broker in the standoff between Moscow and Vilnius? **********Deferring to Mr. Landsbergis, the party chief said he had his own government portfolio, the economy, not the role of political negotiator with Moscow. Mr. Landsbergis left the issue unresolved, lightly replying that Mr. Brazauskas was ''not my employee.'' **********Even so, Mr. Brazauskas's presence at the head table was certain to shore up popular enthusiasm for the hard-pressed independence drive, whatever the reaction from the Kremlin. **********Soviet Army Offers Amnesty **********During the day, the Government-controlled press in Moscow maintained its heavily propagandistic coverage of Lithuania. The reports emphasized calls for direct rule by Moscow from officials of the loyalist, rump Communist party, which was discredited in recent republic elections. **********Moscow also offered amnesty today to Lithuanians who had deserted from the Soviet Army, pledging that they would not be punished if they returned to their units and resumed service. Those who do not return will be ''searched out, detained and be subject to criminal punishment in accordance with current law,'' the Soviet press agency Tass quoted Defense Ministry officials as saying. **********Hundreds of Lithuanian deserters have been in hiding in the republic. Noting that such soldiers are being taken into custody at the rate of 7 to 10 a day, Lithuanian officials said that Moscow's offers of amnesty rang hollow. **********In some cases, the Lithuanian officials charged, Soviet patrols have been breaking into family homes to search for soldiers. Tass reported today that 51 Lithuanians had been sent back to their units, although it did not specify whether their return was forced or voluntary. **********Asked how long Lithuania could reasonably hold out as the Kremlin ignores pleas for talks, Mr. Landsbergis cited polls demonstrating the popularity of the independence drive. **********Mr. Brazauskas offered a more detailed reply, reporting that there had been ''no deterioration in the supplies of gasoline or oil'' provided by the national Government. He said the republic was managing despite banking restrictions imposed on the republic's accounts under a Moscow mandate. **********Prague Offers to Mediate **********PRAGUE, March 29 (Reuters) - In a message today to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Landsbergis, President Vaclav Havel said the Czechoslovak Government was prepared to act as a mediator to help solve the Lithuanian standoff."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/19/business/madison-avenue-where-humor-can-get-some-respect.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Bloom", "pub_date": "1990-08-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1628, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Madison Avenue, Where Humor Can Get Some Respect", "print_headline": "Madison Avenue, Where Humor Can Get Some Respect", "body_text": " **********Humor on Madison Avenue is no longer a laughing matter. It has evolved from whimsical fad into an established marketing tool that is now taken very seriously, something akin to product demonstration, celebrity endorsement, the sexual tease or the adorable child. **********''It has become part of the repertoire,'' said Clay S. Timon, vice president and director of worldwide advertising at the Colgate-Palmolive Company. Indeed, consumer surveys show that comedy is now a common element in a majority of the most popular advertising campaigns, including the Energizer battery-powered bunny who bursts unannounced into other commercials and the ''Bo Knows'' commercials for Nike shoes, whichcarry Bo Jackson's athletic prowess to ridiculous extremes. **********This is so despite the negative reputation comedy has had among advertisers in past years, when it was accused of making people laugh but also of making them forget the product they were supposed to buy. The case against it was perhaps made strongest by David Ogilvy in his influential 1963 book, ''Confessions of an Advertising Man.'' ''People don't buy from clowns,'' Mr. Ogilvy said. **********But humor is getting respect now because of a growing need to stand out from the crowd. Advertising executives concede that they have created an enormous clutter of ads. There seem to be few media untouched by commercial messages (though in one promising development a Chicago company, the Viskase Corporation, found no takers for its offer to print edible-ink ads on hot dogs). **********Humor helps ads break out of that clutter, especially in giving a new or obscure product quick recognition. When ASI Market Research recently compared the viewer recall of several types of television commercials, those with humor were remembered by 17 percent more viewers than the average commercial. Two years ago, when Video Storyboard Tests asked viewers what kind of commercials they found persuasive, 58 percent chose funny ones; 44 percent named the nearest competitor, those with children. **********The reasons for comedy's success are many. Carol Moog, a psychologist and advertising consultant, offers this theory: ''Humor gives people a way to vicariously express their aggression. It reaches them above the base consumer level. It appeals to their intellect, and makes them feel bright.'' **********There is, however, a risk. A failure, like the ''Herb the Nerd'' campaign that Burger King launched in 1985, can subject a company to ridicule. What follows is a look at some creators of funny advertising whose work ranks among the most successful. **********Cliff Freeman has used humor to lift several clients from obscurity. Of course, his famous slogan did not make Gary Hart laugh during his first Presidential bid, which Walter Mondale derailed by asking, ''Where's the Beef?'' But when uttered by the grouchy Clara Peller, the line written by Mr. Freeman as a copywriter for Dancer Fitzgerald Sample vaulted Wendy's into the upper echelon of fast-food chains. **********The campaign is one of several from Mr. Freeman - now chairman of Cliff Freeman & Partners, a division of Saatchi & Saatchi - that have worked for underdog clients. Advertising from the nation's largest corporations, like McDonald's and General Electric, tends to be sentimental, as a way of reinforcing good will accumulated over years of market leadership. But upstarts cannot afford to play safe. ''With a limited media budget,'' Mr. Freeman says, ''we have to do advertising that has a tremendous impact immediately.'' **********Thus, when Philips Lighting sought to break General Electric's stranglehold on the light bulb market, it turned to Mr. Freeman. The Philips ads show the perils of life with shorter-lived light bulbs (like making a pass at the wrong person in a dark elevator - the dumpy cigar-chomper instead of the beautiful woman.) As for the criticism that the viewer may remember the joke but not the product, Mr. Freeman says the problem is solved by repeated showings, and that it is humor that makes this bearable. With a less engaging commercial, ''you could mention the name of the product 20 times, but no one would want to watch.'' **********JO SEDELMAIER, a 57-year-old Chicago director, is the man from whom Mr. Freeman says he learned the most about comedy. They have collaborated on several commercials, including ''Where's the Beef?'' and, for the Little Caesar's fast-food chain, ''Masseuse'' in which roly-poly men compare pizza prices while being kneaded and slapped about like so much dough. **********Mr. Sedelmaier, who is currently spoofing airline foibles - like the trays that dump food on your lap - for Alaska Airlines, made his reputation through commercials for Federal Express, notably ''Fast Paced,'' which stars an executive whose manic speed-talking symbolizes the pace of business that requires the speed of Federal Express. **********The director is no fan of emotional advertising. ''So much of what I see embarrasses me,'' he said. ''It's mawkish. There's not that much to be serious about.'' What must be serious to him are the facial expressions of his characters. ''You play everything straight,'' Mr. Sedelmaier said. And he tends to cast quirky people, like Clara Peller, rather than glamorous ones. In one slapstick spot for the drink Tang, a slight man tangos with an enormous woman, played by a man, whose weight sends the couple crashing through the floor. **********Mr. Sedelmaier concedes an element of meanness in some of his work. But, he said, ''I hear the same criticism of Chaplin. I'll stand in that company.'' **********Ask people in the advertising business to name their all-time favorite commercials and odds are they will mention Roy Grace's ''Spicy Meatball'' commercial for Alka-Seltzer. In it, an actor filming 60 takes of a spaghetti-sauce commercial needs relief. And they will probably cite Mr. Grace's ''Gorilla'' commercial for American Tourister luggage about the ape who hurls a red suitcase around his cage Mr. Grace, an art director who with Diane Rothschild runs Grace & Rothschild, made the classic ''Spicy Meatball'' and ''Gorilla'' ads two decades ago while at Doyle Dane Bernbach. He said of ''Spicy Meatball,'' given the heightened sensitivity about the portrayal of ethnic groups: ''You'd have a problem with that now. There's nothing mean-spirited about it, but it is a stereotype.'' **********The 53-year-old Mr. Grace remains committed to humor, but of a more urbane sort. For a print campaign for J&B Scotch, he and Ms. Rothschild have illustrated a series of straightforward headlines with visual puns. In ''A J&B Toast,'' the red letters of the logo pop out of a toaster. An upcoming ad for Range Rover parodies the infamous Infiniti ads that showed lots of pretty scenery but no car. In the spoof, with a similarly beautiful pastoral scene, a voice asks quietly: ''What more could you ask for?'' A British voice answers: ''quite a bit actually,'' and a Range Rover bursts into view. Mr. Grace admits that he is nervous about the ad, but says humor is worth the risk: ''When it works, there is nothing as sweet.'' **********Working through her own company, Joy Radio, Joy Golden, who is 60, has become a pre-eminent radio copywriter and producer. Her best-known campaign was for Laughing Cow cheese, a client of TBWA Advertising. In one ad, a woman tells this story: ''I went home and said, 'Look, Stuart, I brought you a little Laughing Cow in a red net bag freshly wrapped in wax with an easy-open French zipper.' He said, 'Enid, don't talk naughty to me.' Then he ate all 10 mini-cheeses and said they were the best treat he ever had in bed. So I smacked him.'' **********''Good comedy,'' Ms. Golden said. ''You take on an affinity for the product.'' **********TRANSLATING QUINTESSENTIAL BRITISH HUMOR FOR AMERICANS **********While most Americans say they dislike advertising, polls show that the British seem to enjoy it. One reason, advertising people say, is the higher portion of humor and the softer sell in British ads. **********Among the most popular figures in British advertising is a comic actor well-known to Americans: John Cleese, who is the spokesman for Schweppes soft drinks in the United States and Britain. Neither campaign bears any resemblance to the ads featuring the dignified, bushy-bearded Commander Whitehead; they were developed by David Ogilvy in the United States in the 50's and ran for 18 years. **********The new, self-deprecating campaigns accept the notion that advertising is inherently silly. The British ads, which Mr. Cleese co-wrote for Saatchi & Saatchi, begin with a voice-over in which he talks about the haggling that went on over his contract. He then appears on a beach flexing his biceps, in a parody of typically exuberant soft-drink commercials. **********One of Schweppes's American ads, created by Ammirati & Puris, mocks British and American stereotypes. Mr. Cleese plays a stuffy British aristocrat who sips Schweppes by his fireplace and pontificates indecipherably. Then, dressed in shorts and a Hawaiian shirt, he takes on the Americans. He bursts through a Schweppes poster at a beach and lip-syncs to an ebullient voice-over that exhorts the viewer to ''Buy a truckload today!'' **********This final version is more hyperactive than the original, Mr. Cleese says; in testing, American audiences did not recognize the parody. **********''In England,'' Mr. Cleese saids, ''having someone scream out to buy something would be considered rude, and a bit vulgar.'' Advertising, he said, has its limits: ''You can't sell in an advertisement. You can interest someone in a product by giving them a favorable association.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/21/business/proxy-firm-founder-pleads-guilty-to-theft-and-fraud.html": {"writer_name": "James Ferron", "pub_date": "1990-03-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 454, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Proxy Firm Founder Pleads Guilty to Theft and Fraud", "print_headline": "Proxy Firm Founder Pleads Guilty to Theft and Fraud", "body_text": " **********Donald C.

But the intensity of feeling on all sides of the issue has underlined how regionalism continues to trouble Spain after more than a decade of democracy. **********E.T.A. Poses Biggest Problem **********The most acute problem is posed by the Basque separatist guerrilla group known as E.T.A., which began fighting for independence during the long, highly centralized rule of Gen. Francisco Franco and has continued its terrorism since the dictator's death in 1975, causing more than 600 deaths in 21 years. **********Support for E.T.A. and its methods has waned since the new Constitution allowed the Basque country to negotiate a high degree of autonomy, including the right to raise its own taxes, create its own police force, speak its own language and elect its own parliament. Yet nationalist sentiments remain strong. **********The current debate began last month, when a standing committee of Catalonia's local Parliament approved a resolution that endorsed self-determination. The sponsors noted that only days earlier the 12-nation European Community, including Spain, called for ''self-determination'' in East Germany. **********Jordi Pujol, the conservative nationalist who is President of Catalonia and whose party backed the resolution, subsequently played down its importance. ''I never talk of self-determination,'' he said. ''I talk of nation and state, of autonomy and independence, which are clearer concepts. We don't ask for independence but greater autonomy.'' **********But the issue was quickly taken up in the Basque country, where the local Parliament is to vote next month on two competing draft resolutions proclaiming the right of the Basque people to self-determination. The debate gained momentum from Lithuania's demands for independence from the Soviet Union. **********More Than a Semantic Dispute **********The more moderate of the two resolutions, sponsored by the right-of-center Basque Nationalist Party and the Basque Left, emphasizes that self-determination is ''a dynamic, gradual and democratic'' process and calls for revision of the autonomy agreement with Madrid. **********The other measure, backed by the centrist Basque Solidarity party as well as by E.T.A.'s political wing, known as Herri Batasuna, or People's Unity, goes much further. It affirms the Basque nation's right to ''territorial political unity'' in four northern Spanish provinces and three provinces in France's Basque region. **********Government officials said that while the more radical resolution was not likely to be approved, the political agitation stirred by the debate in Madrid and in the provinces had made it impossible for the Government to accept even the notion of constitutional reform. They argued that Basque nationalists were playing into the hands of E.T.A. extremists. **********Prime Minister Gonzalez asserted that with Europe moving toward greater unity, it was ''nonsense'' to talk of self-determination in Spain. ''On this I will be inflexible, whether in government or opposition,'' he said, ''because when you reach a certain age it is difficult to change convictions and I am convinced that Spain's unity cannot be questioned.'' **********Yet with the issue of nationalities dominating headlines in Europe, the debate seems likely to continue. Pasqual Maragall, the Mayor of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia, went so far as to declare: ''I do not consider myself Lithuanian. I do not consider myself in the same political situation as a Lithuanian who is oppressed from a national point of view.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/17/business/company-news-value-of-a-usx-spinoff-is-disputed.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1990-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1529, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Value of a USX Spinoff Is Disputed", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Value of a USX Spinoff Is Disputed", "body_text": " **********The USX Corporation's sprawling plant along the shore of Lake Michigan here is the foundation of what many consider to be among the most efficient steel operations in the United States. **********Yet some analysts say the nation's largest steel producer would have difficulty continuing to outperform the industry as an independent company, spun off from USX as proposed by Carl C. Icahn, its largest shareholder. They also doubt that a spinoff would make each existing USX share worth $48 - 40 percent more than the current price - as Mr. Icahn stated in proxy material sent to shareholders early in April. **********''If the value of the company were $48 with a spinoff of steel, the stock price would reflect a value closer to that,'' said Jeffrey Miller, an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago. **********Shareholder Vote Set **********Shareholders will vote at the company's annual meeting on May 7 whether to spin off at least 80 percent of the steel business into a separate company called the U.S. Steel Corporation, the name used by USX for 85 years until 1986. Under Mr. Icahn's plan, each existing USX share would be replaced with two types of shares - one representing the steel company and the other an energy company composed of USX's large oil and gas holdings. Management would be under no obligation to carry out the plan if it was approved. **********Mr. Icahn, who urged management to put his proposal to a vote in lieu of his waging a proxy fight, is eager to rid USX of the steel business, which accounts for one-third of the company's sales and earnings. During a down cycle, he argues, the lagging steel unit could weaken the earnings of the energy subsidiary. **********He believes the market would value a pure energy and a pure steel stock higher than it now does a hybrid USX, which he contends is trading at less than its fair value because few analysts understand the intricacies of both businesses. **********Mr. Icahn has valued a separate steel company at $9 a share and the energy company at $39 a share. [Shares of USX closed on the New York Stock Exchange Monday at $34.50 each, up 37.5 cents.]  But some analysts believe the stock is already overvalued, run up by the presence of Mr. Icahn, who owns 13.3 percent of USX. And most say the value and virtue of spinning off the steel group depend on how certain issues regarding taxes and retiree benefits are resolved. **********Other analysts agree that steel should be sold, but question the timing of a sale. They say the unit would bring a higher price if the steel market were healthier. Some believe that Charles A. Corry, chairman and chief executive of Pittsburgh-based USX, opposes Mr. Icahn's proposal because he would rather sell steel when the market improves. **********While shareholders are expected to defeat the spinoff proposal by voting with management, as they usually do in these situations, Mr. Icahn could get support from some institutional investors. Like Mr. Icahn, some of these investors are irritated that USX's stock has risen only 8.4 percent in the last 15 years, lagging behind the 308 percent increase in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index during the same period. **********They contend that a restructuring undertaken by USX in 1987, after Mr. Icahn proposed taking over the company, was not radical enough, and welcome his latest threat as a much-needed catalyst for change. Under the restructuring, which management promised would raise the value of the stock, the company repurchased shares and placed its faltering Texas Oil and Gas unit up for sale. That unit is still unsold. **********Earnings Improve **********But management argues that the company is healthier than it has been in years. It earned $965 million last year on sales of $18.7 billion, up from net income of $756 million on sales of $16.8 billion in 1988. **********Also, since Mr. Icahn began to invest in USX three years ago, the company's stock price has increased 66 percent, compared with the 37 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's 500 during that period. **********And the oil and gas business, entered into in 1982 with the purchase of the Marathon Oil Company to protect against the cyclicality of the steel sector, now accounts for nearly two-thirds of USX's sales and earnings, up from 58 percent in 1988. **********Operating earnings of Marathon, the centerpiece of USX's energy holdings, have climbed significantly since 1987, to $862 million last year. They should continue to grow with the anticipated improvement in oil production and demand, analysts said. **********''Marathon is a valuable energy company with significant growth potential,'' said Rolf Wagner, an analyst at Scott & Stringfellow in Richmond. ''If the steel business were separated, none of that would change.'' **********The steel business has also staged a turnaround. After losing more than $2 billion during the four-year industry slump that began in 1983, the company became profitable in 1987 -helped by widespread layoffs, new equipment, improved demand and Federal restrictions on imported steel. It earned $432 million in 1989. **********Evidence of Revival **********Here in Gary, it now takes only 3.5 hours of labor to produce a ton of steel, down from 10 hours 10 years ago and significantly less than the domestic industry average of 6.6 hours. USX has pruned its work force to about 20,000 people, from 75,000 a decade ago. And by next year, Gary's output will be produced entirely by continuous casters, the equipment that casts steel far more efficiently than the old method, in which ingots were used. Now, more than 60 percent is continuously casted. **********But management calculates that operating the steel group as a stand-alone company could cost an additional $100 million to $200 million a year. Without the energy assets, analysts said, the steel company would have more difficulty raising the equity and debt capital it needs to keep pace in technology and modernization. It likely would also be saddled with more than $1.5 billion in debt at a time when steel earnings are expected to fall. **********Management is also concerned about losing $900 million in tax-loss carry-forwards. In the proxy materials, Mr. Icahn said USX's tax carry-forwards could be used up by the end of this year, before the spinoff. **********Question of Pensions **********But Mr. Icahn did not address several other concerns, such as how the steel company could cover its enormous retiree and medical benefits. Last year alone, the company paid $972 million in pension benefits. **********''It may be necessary for USX to create a trust fund, or to make a commitment to fund retiree benefits beyond the time of a steel spinoff,'' said John C. Tumazos, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. ''That would have some impact on the results for the energy segment's performance.'' **********What is more, while issuing stock in the entity would invite an acquisition, top management and analysts say the steel business might be worth more in the second half of this year, or in 1991, when auto demand is expected to pick up and the steel market, which began to soften in the last quarter, bounces back. **********Based on their longstanding interest in the United States steel industry, Japanese steel companies are among the most likely acquirers, according to analysts. Japanese steel companies have ownership stakes or joint ventures with all of the large, integrated steel producers in the United States, including USX. **********USX officials say that Japanese companies have expressed interest in acquiring the company's huge plant here. But Mr. Corry has opposed a piecemeal divestiture. **********Interest From Europe **********Company officials say there is also growing interest from steel companies in Europe. That was underscored last month when the LTV Corporation, the nation's third-largest steel producer, said it was talking about a possible sale of part of its steel unit to Groupe Usinor-Sacilor, the giant French steel company. **********Hans Mueller, an industry consultant and professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University, in Murfreesboro, Tenn., said candidates for a purchase or joint venture include Thyssen Stahl A.G., the large West German steel company, and British Steel P.L.C. **********However, several European steel officials say that the smaller, specialty steel companies in the United States are more likely targets than companies like USX, because their margins are higher. ''It seems that an investment in a large, integrated steel producer in the United States is not the best way to make money,'' said Heinz Kriwet, chairman of Thyssen. **********Still, some foreign steel companies say that USX's mill here would be a significant foothold in the United States market. ''The Gary facility,'' said a senior official at another West German steel company, ''is now something to look at seriously, considering the activity of Carl Icahn.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/14/business/company-news-lockheed-shares-rise-but-far-from-40-bid.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Lev", "pub_date": "1990-11-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 399, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lockheed Shares Rise But Far From $40 Bid", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Lockheed Shares Rise But Far From $40 Bid", "body_text": " **********Shares of the Lockheed Corporation increased $2 today, to $31.75, on the New York Stock Exchange after the investor Harold C.

Papitto, its chairman, consented to an injunction and said the company would pay back the amount the S.E.C. says it made as a result of lying in 1987 about when it acquired stock in a company it was trying to take over. Those who acquire more than 5 percent of a company's outstanding shares are required to disclose their holdings within 10 days by filing Form 13-D with the S.E.C. **********The S.E.C. action may do little to deter other potential violators. If the S.E.C. charges are valid, Nortek is no worse off economically than it would have been had it complied with the law. It will pay $503,000, plus interest, with at least some of the money going to investors who were hurt by the inaccurate disclosures. **********The S.E.C. charged that Nortek lied in early 1987 about when it purchased a block of shares in the Rexham Corporation, a maker of machines for the paperboard industry. By misstating the date of purchase, it was able to delay the 13-D filing and keep accumulating stock without tipping its hand and sending up the price of the shares, the S.E.C. said. **********There was, of course, no way to learn of that from reading the S.E.C. filing; that required an investigation. Since Nortek filed lots of 13-D's, involving holdings in many companies, one might have expected the agency to begin an inquiry to see if there had a pattern of violations. But while S.E.C. officials would not comment yesterday on whether such investigations had been made, one said that they would amount to ''piling on'' and be pointless. **********The most the S.E.C. could hope to get, he said, was an injunction against violating the law, and now that such an injunction has been filed there is no point in investigating previous cases. If the company violates the law in the future, however, a contempt citation could be sought. **********Nortek's chairman, Mr. Papitto, issued a statement saying the company agreed to the judgment without admitting the charges ''in order to bring an end to the continuous drain on management time and to avoid incurring additional legal fees.'' Mr. Papitto, along with Richard L. Bready, Nortek's president, and Richard J. Harris, its treasurer, were ordered not to violate securities laws in the future. Company officials declined further comment. **********Nortek acquired a reputation in the 1980's as a small-scale conglomerateur, buying and selling subsidiaries at a rapid pace. But it seemed that for every company it bought, there were several in which it took only a stake. **********Its run at Rexham ended in April 1987, when Nortek, having offered to buy the company for $43 a share, agreed to sell its stock back to Rexham at $42 a share. **********The S.E.C. said the $503,000 Nortek is to pay is equal to the profit it made on the 62,950 shares of Rexham it purchased after it was required to disclose its holdings, but before it did so. Rexham's share price shot up after Nortek filed its 13-D. Investors who sold Rexham shares from Jan. 27 through Jan. 30, 1987, will be eligible to claim part of the payment, the S.E.C. said. **********The S.E.C. accused Nortek of concealing the facts regarding its purchases by having a subsidiary hold shares and then having it sell the shares to the parent company. By not reporting the subsidiary's transactions, the filing appeared to be in compliance, the S.E.C. contended. **********In another aborted takeover try in 1987, Nortek aroused the ire of many takeover speculators, but did not provoke S.E.C. action. In that case, involving Stanline Inc., Nortek's S.E.C. filing said it held more than 5 percent and was considering a takeover. But Nortek did not report that the day before the filing, Stanline's president had told Mr. Papitto in a phone call that Stanline would resist a takeover attempt. **********As arbitragers leaped in to buy Stanline shares after the filing was made, Nortek was the principal seller, a fact it disclosed a few days later, along with the statement by Stanline's president. Mr. Bready later told a reporter that Mr. Papitto had failed to mention the phone call to other company officials, so the company did not know of it when the original S.E.C. filing was made. **********Nortek, a maker of building products and aerospace components, has not done all that well in recent years.

Shortages are certain to increase as the oil industry's need for geologists, especially those with master's degrees, grows. **********Samuel Root, professor of geology at Wooster, said there was increased interest by students in the environment and such problems as water contamination and waste handling, both of which require geologists' skills. **********''There is a tremendous increase in the numbers of geologists working on cleanups,'' he said. ''Many recent grads work with small environmental companies. Now, with the oil situation, we will need even more.'' **********He said that when he first joined the Wooster faculty in 1983 there were 20 to 25 geology majors. ''That dropped to 7 after a couple of years and now it has almost doubled, to 13 this year,'' he said. The liberal arts college has 1,800 students. **********''Students find out from friends about good jobs and they get excited and declare a major,'' he said. **********Today's geology majors, Dr. Root stressed, ''need a lot more chemistry, several courses in computer science as well as a course in the flow of fluids.'' **********Professors of geology also need to take more courses, he said, especially refresher courses, which are often given by professional associations. **********''I now teach a hydro geology course,'' he said, ''Next week I am going to a three-day program in Sarasota, Fla., given by the National Water Well Association on the subject of contaminated waters and how to clean them up. I will work the material into my course. **********''With the gulf crisis and higher oil prices, I think we are looking at a long-term need for more geologists. We will need more research and development in other energy areas -coal production, for example.'' **********Dr. Root has an academic as well as a corporate background. He received a master's degree from the University of Manitoba, Canada, and holds a doctorate in geology from Ohio State University. For several years, he worked for Exxon, mostly in South America. **********''Students often ask what I did working for a large corporation and what interesting assignments I had,'' he said. **********Samuel S. Adams, professor of geology and geological engineering at the Colorado School of Mines in Denver, says that students make up their minds about majors while they are in high school and even grade school these days. **********''Students catch on quickly to economics and it filters down through high schools,'' he commented. For example, he said that in his department, before retrenchment by the oil companies and low oil prices in the mid-80's, there were 60 geology majors in each of the junior and senior classes, but that there were now about 15 majors in each of the classes. Students generally do not declare majors until the end of their sophomore year in college. **********He explained that during that retrenchment, young people in Colorado watched their fathers and other relatives lose jobs in the oil industry, and turned away from the idea of becoming geologists or petroleum engineers. **********But he says those effects are starting to wear off. ''Even without the gulf crisis we have turned the corner,'' he said. ''Geology majors now are getting jobs, research funding is moving up, interviews on campus are increasing.'' **********Mr. Adams explained that environmental issues had ''opened up jobs for our students, all of whom are also trained as engineers.'' **********''The word is getting around,'' he said. Aided by a grant from Amoco, he had brochures printed explaining careers in geology that his undergraduate students are handing out at Colorado schools. ''They are also giving talks,'' he said. ''Very young people don't want to listen to a gray-haired old fellow like me. My students are almost their peers.'' **********He likened the differences between geologists and petroleum engineers to the differences between linguistic experts in Romance languages and Slavic languages. **********But geologists and petroleum engineers can work together effectively through computer graphics, he explained. ''We geologists are detectives and historians,'' he said. ''I can represent my views graphically by computer and the petroleum engineers can overlay their ideas on it, also graphically.'' **********Dr. Adams, who received his doctorate from Harvard, explained that cooperation between these professionals had become much easier because of $2 million in computer hardware and professional help provided by the International Business Machines Corporation to establish the I.B.M. Center of Geo-science Computing on campus."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/26/business/the-media-business-advertising-accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Judge", "pub_date": "1990-09-26", "snippet": "LEAD: * Haagen-Dazs Co., Teaneck, N.J., to BBDO, New York, with billings between $13 million and $15 million.", "word_count": 34, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;\n\nAccounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;\n\nAccounts", "body_text": " **********LEAD: * Haagen-Dazs Co., Teaneck, N.J., to BBDO, New York, with billings between $13 million and $15 million. *********** Haagen-Dazs Co., Teaneck, N.J., to BBDO, New York, with billings between $13 million and $15 million. *********** Baltimore Orioles to Trahan, Burden & Charles, Baltimore.

Critics say the American military attack on Panama, justified in part as an anti-drug initiative, has only fragmented what is already a largely ineffective effort. **********Despite the lack of sympathy for Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega of Panama, Latin America was clearly shaken by the latest case of United States military force in the region. Peru dramatized that reaction by pulling out of an Andean summit meeting on drugs with President Bush, set for February, and briefly halting an anti-drug effort with the United States. **********Because Peru grows 70 percent of the coca plants processed into the cocaine that is smuggled into the United States, its withdrawal from the summit talks dashed hopes for a start on a cohesive regional plan. **********Peru Could Become Sanctuary **********Colombia and Bolivia, the other two major cocaine producers in South America, say they still plan to meet with President Bush in February. But without Peru's cooperation, narcotics experts say, the drug war cannot succeed, because the country would become a huge sanctuary for growers and drug traffickers pursued by the two neighboring countries. **********Trying to knock Panama off the cocaine-distribution map by taking out General Noriega, who has long been linked to the drug traffic, was not a fair trade for the alienation of Peru, critics say. Panama's importance in the drug trade was waning as tension between General Noriega and the United States grew and drug traffickers and money launderers left for more tranquil points in the Caribbean, Mexico, Canada, Europe and Asia. **********Mr. Bush's campaign to stop cocaine at its source in the Andes, part of a broader drug strategy announced in September, includes $2 billion in economic aid to Peru, Bolivia and Colombia over four years and $261 million mainly in aid to the military and police in those countries. **********But four months into the campaign, the picture is bleak. **********Cocaine is flowing as freely as ever to the United States, where the appetite for crack remains ravenous, and it is becoming increasingly clear that for the Andes nations themselves, cutting cocaine production and exports is by no means the No. 1 priority. **********Colombia has embarked on a campaign to arrest its major traffickers and seize their assets, but for every trafficker who falls, another replaces him, overseeing the processing of the coca leaf at jungle laboratories and arranging for the shipment of cocaine to North America. And the coca plant continues to be cultivated in Peru and Bolivia, where poor farmers have discovered its value as a cash crop. **********In an interview, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, characterized the Administration's campaign as ''little more than a paper initiative.'' **********''The United States,'' he said, ''must launch a genuine plan for the Andes, not just a laundry list of disjointed initiatives.'' **********The Administration's response is that the problem of cocaine smuggling from Latin America has been building since the early 1970's, and that it will take time to solve. ''We can show some little successes, but over all it's going to take several years,'' said a United States official in Peru. ''We're just getting into the ballgame, just starting to get the resources we need.'' **********Some Administration officials working on drug issues in Washington say they do not expect to see any measurable effect on the flow of cocaine into the United States until late 1990. ''That's just a realistic assessment of how long it takes government to work,'' one said. **********Some Bush aides acknowledged that the Panama invasion has not been a plus for the drug war, and one said it was ''catastrophically negative'' and indicated that Washington was holding out hope that Peru would ultimately decide to join in the Andean summit meeting now that it has resumed its anti-drug program with the United States. Colombia One Kingpin Down, But Many to Go One of the most notable successes in the drug fight came in mid-December, when Colombian security forces chased down and killed Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, a powerful and violent leader of the Medellin cartel, which controls much of the world cocaine market. It was a major accomplishment for Colombia, and it bolstered public support after drug bosses had repeatedly escaped police raids and terrorized the capital, Bogota, with nightly bombings. **********In the last two weeks drug terrorism has dropped significantly. And there is some evidence that drug-ring leaders are now fighting each other. But the American and Colombian authorities say Mr. Rodriguez Gacha's death will have little effect on the export of cocaine because someone will win the battle to succeed him and simply pick up the slack. **********And Colombian traffickers, who control most of the cocaine industry worldwide, are moving their jungle factories, where paste from the the coca leaf is processed into powder. The refineries are being set up in Peru and Bolivia and even along the frontiers of Brazil and Ecuador, which until now had been relatively free of drug traffic. **********Scores of smaller Colombian drug processers and shippers and some of the major traffickers who have operated quietly and without violence have been left alone by the Government. Should the level of terrorism remain low for an extended period, some Colombian experts predict, the Government will declare victory and permit the peaceful drug traffickers to go about their business. **********In Colombia, as in Peru and Bolivia, political power and economic conditions are more important concerns. **********''We are fighting two wars in Colombia,'' Carlos Lemos Simmonds, the senior member of President Virgilio Barco Vargas's Cabinet and the President's chief political adviser, said in an interview, referring to the war against drugs and the war between drug traffickers and the nation's leaders. **********''The deadlier war is the one of the drug barons against our own politicians, our judges, our journalists,'' he said. ''They want to be the ones who govern the country. They want to make Colombia into a narco-state, so they can handle their business more easily. Both wars are urgent. But we have to stop these people from killing other Colombians. This has priority.'' Peru and Bolivia A Profitable Habit Hard to Break Presidents Alan Garcia of Peru and Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia argue that the solution to the drug problem lies not in force but in broad economic development - road building, electrification, agricultural services, the introduction of industry - along with price supports to make other crops more attractive than coca. **********The high profits from cocaine have made the Bolivian and Peruvian Governments reluctant to move against it, and few farmers have been willing to switch to other crops. Some Bolivian farmers have taken United States and Bolivian money, offered as an inducement for destroying coca plots and cultivating other crops, and moved to remote fields to plant more coca. In Peru, the Upper Huallaga Valley is the world's most fertile ground for the coca plant, and farmers there have virtually halted the cultivation of any other crop. **********The $2 billion in economic aid pledged by President Bush to Peru, Bolivia and Colombia over four years works out to about $166 million a year for each of the countries, an enormous jump. But Mr. Garcia and Mr. Paz Zamora are talking about $500 million a year and more. **********For Peru, the gravest concern is the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla movement that has been terrorizing the country for nearly 10 years. Mr. Garcia argues that pressure on coca farmers only provides recruits for the guerrillas, who exploit the cocaine trade by protecting the farmers and then ''taxing'' both them and those whom the Shining Path permits to export the drug. **********Bolivia's economy has forced many workers to protest conditions. The nation is under a state of siege, imposed after teachers began demanding raises that would have upset a long-range restructuring of the economy away from central controls. **********Colombia says it needs good prices for its main legitimate export, coffee, and fewer restrictions on its exports to of freshly cut flowers and textiles to the United States. But under pressure from American coffee makers for more advantageous prices and different mixes of beans, the United States has walked away from an international coffee agreement on price supports. **********World coffee prices have plunged, and Colombia says it will lose about $500 million a year unless the agreement is restored. Administration officials say they are trying to find a way for Colombia to recoup its loss, but the talks involve dozens of countries and are going slowly. **********Senator Biden proposes that to assist the drug-producing nations in reorganizing or bolstering their economies, a ''debt for drugs'' swap should be made. The United States would pay off the big foreign debts of the cocaine-producing countries under the plan in exchange for a program of coca-crop eradication and encouragement of alternate crops. United States Lack of Agreement And Coordination In the United States, the Bush Administration is confronted by competing interests among Washington agencies. Some, like the Commerce Department, show little active interest in the South American drug problem, despite the coca crop's inevitable intertwining in Andes economics and trade. Some, like the Pentagon, are not in agreement on the wisdom of the United States involvement in the Andes drug problems. **********Critics say the Administration's efforts are disjointed. At least six United States Government agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the State Department, are working against drugs in the three countries. **********Each agency has its own procedures and intelligence sources. Theoretically, the United States ambassador coordinates the drug war in his country. But in practice, central direction is weak and each agency goes its own way. **********''We are far from having a strategy,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics. **********William J. Bennett, the nation's drug-policy director, has been criticized by politicians and experts in drug treatment for failing to take his advisers' counsel and take charge of an overall drug plan. A Government expert said, ''Bennett has done fine on the bully pulpit talking about the drug problem, but he seems unwilling to seize the power needed to really do anything.'' **********Donald R. Hamilton, the chief spokesman for Mr. Bennett, said the director had exerted sweeping influence on how the United States is dealing with drugs. ''He has good access to the President and when he's gone to the President he's gotten his way almost every time.'' **********Within the United States armed forces, opinion is divided over whether the military should be involved in the drug war in South America. Many officers, remembering Vietnam, worry that the military will be drawn into an unwinnable war. **********''We will be down there 20 to 40 years,'' said a senior planning officer in the United States military headquarters in Panama. **********Some officers think the armed forces could become a scapegoat if the anti-drug war fails. ''It is easier for politicians to shift the burden to the military than to get tough with their own drug-using constitutents,'' said a Pentagon officer who bitterly oppposes using servicemen in the drug war. **********Despite the misgivings, the Defense Department has ordered stepped-up training, reconnaissance, intelligence sharing and logistical support in the three Andean countries. The Andes The Divisive Issue Of Who Will Fight Mainly because of unextinguishable bad memories of gunboat diplomacy, the leaders of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru oppose the presence of American combat troops on their soil, and they want strict limits on any American military presence. **********Of the three countries, only Colombia has been willing to mount a real armed offensive of its own. Peru and Bolivia continue to equivocate on waging any kind of warfare on an industry that provides an income for hundreds of thousands of peasants. **********A key to the United States strategy is to engage the armies of all three countries in the drug war, but these forces have historically insisted that drug trafficking is a criminal matter for the police to confront. Friction between the police and the armed forces runs deep; they seldom work together, and when they do they blame each other for what goes wrong. **********In Peru the army actually prevents the police from operating in the Upper Huallaga Valley. Disturbing the coca farmers, the army says, would help the guerrillas by driving the farmers into rebel ranks. But tantalized by the potential of as much as $40 million in United States military hardware for an anti-drug campaign, the army now contends that through its war with the guerrillas it should be regarded as actually fighting cocaine. **********While drugs have been a police concern, most police officers have been assigned to other duties. Of the 80,000 members of the police in Colombia, for example, only about 3,500 are assigned to anti-drug units. In Peru, there are about 500 anti-narcotics police officers, and in Bolivia there are 700 to 800. Mexico New Way Stations South of the Border A United States official in Bogota who specializes in narcotics estimated that cocaine shipping from Colombia was still down about 25 percent from what it was before the Government of President Barco declared war on the drug traffickers last August. **********But he said new processing centers in Peru and other countries, especially Mexico, may have lifted the region as a whole back to where it had been. **********As United States patrols and radar networks have slowed traffic in the Caribbean, cocaine smugglers have been funneling their goods into the United States through Mexico. The Colombian cartels have formed alliances with Mexican smuggling gangs that have long dealt in marijuana and heroin. ''You have organizations on both sides of the border who have been involved with smuggling for decades,'' said a United States official in Mexico. **********Drug Enforcement Administration officials estimate that 50 percent to 70 percent of all South American cocaine entering the United States goes through Mexico, as opposed to 30 percent only a few years ago. **********Nearly 300 planes were seized in the raids in Colombia, but American officials say the traffickers have replenished their fleet by buying and stealing replacements all over the hemisphere. One of the most popular smuggling planes, the officials said, is the Gulfstream Aerocommander 1000, a twin-engine turboprop plane that can carry up to 2,000 pounds of cargo. **********Most of Mexico does not have radar coverage. Planes land at hundreds of dirt airfields and often keep one engine running as the cocaine is unloaded. Usually, the drug is hidden at the airfield for a few days, then smuggled across the border by truck. **********The United States has been putting up a barrier of radar balloons along the Mexican border; seven are to be up within weeks. The balloons can detect a plane as far away as 150 miles. **********In all three Andes countries and in the United States, politicians as well as scholars and economists talk of what they regard as the impossibility of significantly reducing the production and export of cocaine as long as demand remains strong. **********The most optimistic analysts estimate 5 to 10 years of heavy spending and perhaps much bloodshed, not to eliminate cocaine in South America but to contain it until consumption falls. **********''We're buying time,'' said one United States Embassy official here."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/01/business/company-news-pic-n-save-corp-in-buyback-plan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 164, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Company News;   Pic 'N' Save Corp.

Brazil, Argentina, Chile and several other third world nations have been at Washington's side in putting pressure on the European Community to slash farm subsidies. **********But that support has its price.

Lower tariffs should help raise trade in third world farm commodities battered by low prices. **********Many officials of developing countries are less than enthusiastic about liberalizing trade in services.

Manuel Antonio Noriega subsides. Among other things, the circumstances under which Mr. Endara and his two vice presidents took power - as the invasion by United States troops began last month - is certain to be used against them as Panama's traditionally anti-American nationalism reawakens. **********In a particularly complex Panamanian play of race and caste, Mr. Endara is also likely to find himself denounced as the leader of the privileged few against the vast ranks of the poor. **********On the Night of Dec. 19 **********But there are aspects of the new President's personality and career that suggest that he may be able to rally the country in what many agree will be the difficult months of reconstruction ahead. **********Mr. Endara said that when American officials told him late on Dec. 19 that the invasion was imminent and that they wanted him to take the oath as President, ''I felt like I had been hit in the head with a sledgehammer.'' **********''It would have been very easy for me to say, 'I'm not going to take this job under occupation by American forces,' '' Mr. Endara said in a recent interview in his office overlooking the Pacific. ''But I knew that I couldn't do that. I had to assume the responsibility of Government - the people chose me to be President. I couldn't simply tell the U.S.: 'You pick the Government. You are the occupying power and you do what you want.' '' **********''History may speak horribly of me,'' he said of his decision. ''I certainly knew that Latin Americans weren't going to be very fond of me. But morally, patriotically, civically, I had no other choice. I had to do it.'' **********A Reputation As a Great Lawyer **********A year ago, before he agreed to run as the civilian coalition's nominee for the presidency against General Noriega's candidate, Mr. Endara was virtually unknown as a political commodity, except for two things. **********Political insiders knew him as the longtime behind-the-scenes secretary for his idol, Dr. Arnulfo Arias Madrid, the charismatic, Peron-like figure whose presence and views - a curious mix of socialism, fascism, racism, mysticism and resistance to United States domination of the Panama Canal - dominated Panamanian politics for half a century. **********But in the capital's financial center, bankers, businessmen and would-be businessmen knew Mr. Endara in a more pragmatic incarnation, as one of the best corporate lawyers in town, smart and well-connected. **********Both pursuits seem to have taught him the fine art of quiet compromise, a skill he has reportedly put to use in recent weeks settling differences between himself and his First Vice President, Ricardo Arias Calderon, leader of the formidable Christian Democratic Party; and the Second Vice President, Guillermo (Billy) Ford of the Nationalist Liberal Republican Party, a splinter group known by the Spanish acronym of Molirena. Under a pact said to have been signed Dec. 21 by the three men, decisions are being made not by Mr. Endara alone, but by consensus of all three. **********Some politicians say the country is apparently being run by a less-than-efficient junta, not a president. ''They're trying to play the piano with six hands,'' complained one critic, Carlos Ivan Zuniga, an opposition politician who heads a small, conservative political party known as Papo. **********But others are hopeful about Mr. Endara's skills at conciliation. **********''Over the years, I've seen him act many times as a bridge between competing groups,'' said Fernando Manfredo, who began serving this month as the first Panamanian administrator of the Panama Canal Commission, although in an acting capacity. In 1983, Mr. Manfredo recalled, Mr. Endara, representing Dr. Arias's Authentic Panamanian Party, managed to get a roomful of bitter political adversaries, including a Communist group, to agree on a complex change in the Constitution. **********Brilliance at School, Success at the Office **********Mr. Endara, an only child, was born May 12, 1936, to upper-middle class parents in the capital. By all accounts a brilliant student, he attended secondary schools in Argentina and a now-defunct military academy in Los Angeles, Calif., eventually graduating first in his law class at the University of Panama. **********He also studied law for a time at New York University, returning home to open a law practice in 1963 with an older lawyer, Galileo Solis. Mr. Endara was 27 at the time. **********The firm, now called Solis, Endara, Delgado & Guevara, had always specialized in corporate work, although in its early growth years, ''they took on just about anybody who walked in the door,'' said a Panamanian lawyer familiar with the firm. **********Solis Endara was thus well-positioned to take advantage of the explosion in commercial activity in Panama that occurred after the military coup of 1968, which toppled President Arias on his 11th day in office; it was the third time he had been deposed by the military since 1941. **********Much of the success of Panama's financial center in the 1970's and 80's, Mr. Endara readily acknowledges, was a result of the Latin American drug cartels, which brought billions in cocaine and marijuana profits to be laundered in Panama. But the President says that neither he nor his law partners ever knowingly worked with drug traffickers or accepted their money. **********In the interview in his newly renovated office at the presidential palace, which only a month ago had been occupied by American combat troops, Mr. Endara also dismissed press reports in the United States that Second Vice President Billy Ford's brother, Henry Ford, was associated with a Miami accountant who was convicted of laundering money for the Medellin cartel. **********Others familiar with Mr. Endara and Billy Ford, from childhood friends to longtime political adversaries, say that whatever their faults, they are not corrupt. **********''I know Billy Ford since we were 10 years old,'' said I. Roberto Eisenmann Jr., a businessman and publisher of the fiercely anti-Noriega newspaper La Prensa. ''I know basically everything he's done in his professional life, including all the temptations he has had, and I know he has never broken under them.'' **********Mr. Endara said of his own law firm: ''We did legal work under the dictatorship without any help from the Government, but we have done no business with narcotraffickers or anything like that that we know of.'' **********''But,'' he said, ''like any lawyer, I cannot vouch that every client who comes through our doors is a saint. **********''Like many other law firms in Panmama, we are often asked to do company work, such as incorporating companies,'' he went on. ''It's possible that we might help someone incorporate a company - and then maybe they would use the company for something else. **********''The fact is, I'm not sure of everybody I do legal work for, but I do try to avoid shady characters.'' **********According to a presidential spokesman, Louis Martinez, Mr. Endara remains a partner of the firm, but suspended his working relationship at the beginning of the political campaign last year. ''He will not be returning until he leaves public office,'' the spokesman said. **********A Close Friend And an Atlanta Arrest **********Mr. Endara said he remained ''close friends'' with Carlos Eleta, a wealthy Panamanian businessman who was arrested in Atlanta last April on charges that he conspired to set up a major cocaine smuggling ring. He was released on bail pending his trial. **********People here who know Mr. Eleta remain puzzled by his arrest, saying that the idea of drug smuggling seems totally out of character for him. Some Panamanians, like Guillermo Sanchez Borbon, political columnist for the daily La Prensa, suggest that he may even have been set up by General Noriega or people close to him. **********''Carlos Eleta is a friend, but we have nothing in common with him in the sense that we are not partners with him in anything, anything that I know of,'' Mr. Endara said, ''although he may have shares in some company that I might have shares in. **********''He's a friend, but I have many friends in Panama.'' **********The law firm's current clients, Mr. Endara said, include a cross-section of major Panamanian companies. **********''We're not a big firm,'' Mr. Endara said. ''In addition to the partners, we have another lawyer and some secretaries. In all, 12 people working in the office.'' **********Asked whether he had felt apprehensive about being offered the presidential nomination last year, Mr. Endara sighed heavily. ''I was not apprehensive, I was surprised,'' he said. ''I had not sought this nomination. **********''A group of politicians felt that somebody representing Dr. Arias - his prestige, his authority with the masses - should be on the ticket.'' **********Nearly two years after his death in Miami at the age of 86, Dr. Arias - or simply ''Arnulfo,'' as Panamanians commonly refer to him - still exerts an eerie gravitational pull on public life here. **********After Dr. Arias's young widow, Mireyea, turned down repeated offers that she run for the presidency as the candidate of the National Civic Crusade, Mr. Endara said, the job was thrust upon him. He says he accepted it philosophically. **********''I remember Dr. Arias always saying to me and to others that responsibilities for the country were things that came upon oneself by force of destiny. **********''It's sort of like karma. You know about karma? I'm not an Orientalist, I'm not a Buddhist, I'm not anything like that. But I've read books, and I learned that karma was something that you have to accept. I was surprised, but I felt an obligation to do my best, to finish the work of my teacher, my maestro, my mentor. And that is still my thought here.'' **********Mr. Sanchez Borbon of La Prensa said he believed that whatever his political skills, Mr. Endara's easy-going ways might be exactly what the country wanted right now. **********''After all the horror we've had, I think he is a good choice,'' Mr. Sanchez Borbon said. ''He's a very humble man, very placid - anything but charismatic. But he may surprise people.'' **********A New Friendship And a New Life **********Some would say he already has. A few weeks ago, Mr. Endara was observed in a booth of the Marriott Hotel coffee shop with a dark-haired young woman who, reporters agreed, was definitely not Marcelita, his 26-year-old married daughter. **********Soon after the much-talked-about sighting, Mr. Endara announced that he was dating the woman, 24-year-old Ana Mae Diaz. He has been a widower since June, when his wife, Marcela, died of a heart attack, a month after the abortive May 7 elections that were followed by street clashes in which her husband was beaten by paramilitary toughs. **********Mr. Endara and Miss Diaz had met in September, when she went to visit him during his two-week hunger strike against the Noriega Government. At the time, Mr. Endara, who says he lost 30 of his 265 pounds on the liquid-only diet, was usually flat on his back on a hospital bed in the window of a downtown office building, where skeptics could see for themselves that he wasn't eating. **********''We're still getting to know each other,'' the President was quoted as saying of Miss Diaz this week. **********That is a good description, many Panamanians say, of the relationship between Mr. Endara and the people of this close-knit country of 2.4 million as it struggles to reconstitute itself as a independent civilian democracy. **********''In essence, I really don't care what reputation I acquire,'' President Endara said, sounding a bit like his beloved mentor. ''What is important to me is to do my duty to the Panamanian people, to act in their interest and according to their will.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/09/world/serbian-voting-today-could-signal-a-major-turn-in-yugoslavia-s-future.html": {"writer_name": "Celestine Bohlen", "pub_date": "1990-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Serbian Voting Today Could Signal A Major Turn in Yugoslavia's Future", "print_headline": "Serbian Voting Today Could Signal A Major Turn in Yugoslavia's Future", "body_text": " **********Voters will cast ballots on Sunday in Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics, to deliver a verdict on a government whose raw blend of old-style one-party rule and aggressive nationalism has made it a central issue for the country's uncertain future. **********The vote in Serbia completes a year of free elections held throughout Eastern Europe on the ruins of now-defunct Communist systems. With the exception of Albania, this Balkan republic of 9.5 million will be the last not only in the region but in Yugoslavia itself to undertake the initiation into democracy. **********The Serbian election comes at a time when the survival of Yugoslavia is increasingly in doubt. Slovenia, a republic that borders Italy and Austria, has set Dec. 23 as a date for a plebiscite on whether to break loose and become fully independent. A recent poll in the republic shows 80 percent of potential voters favoring the move. **********The Yugoslav Army has announced that next week it will reassert control over territorial defense in paramilitary units now under republican command in Slovenia and Croatia.  Election Could Be Decisive **********With signs pointing to a showdown in Yugoslavia's protrated crisis, the Serbian elections could prove decisive, given the instigating role played by Belgrade, capital of the republic, in disputes between the country's hostile nationalities. **********Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, who rose to head of the Communist Party in 1987 and has since built up considerable popularity as spokesman for a resurgent Serbian nationalism, is considered the favorite for re-election, although his party -- now renamed Socialist -- may not win a majority of the seats in the 250-seat Parliament. A second round of voting is set for Dec. 23, the same day as the plebiscite in Slovenia. **********Mr. Milosevic's main rival is Vuk Draskovic, head of the Serbian Renewal Movement, which staked out an extreme nationalist position early in the campaign. Recently, however, Mr. Draskovic, a 44-year-old novelist whose shoulder-length hair signals a provocative style, has toned down his jingoist language, some say as a prelude to a possible coalition with other opposition forces against Mr. Milosevic in the second round. **********Mr. Draskovic and other opposition candidates have turned the election into a frontal attack on the Communists, ignoring the Socialist Party's claim to having reformed itself. In a televised speech this week, Mr. Draskovic said the campaign was \"a battle between the Cross and the Red Star.\" At a rally here Thursday, he vowed \"to stop the Bolshevik powers and their tanks and guns with the election ballots that are the bullets of democracy.\"  Ex-Communists Defeated **********Although former Communists have been voted out of office in elections held in every other Yugoslav republic this year, some political analysts wonder whether Serbia may not have more in common with its Balkan neighbors, Bulgaria and Romania, where the old ruling parties were kept in power by a conservative electorate. **********In the campaign, Mr. Milosevic has tried to portray the Socialist Party as the bulwark of stability in a changing and turbulent time. \"A Socialist defeat could unleash dark forces from the country's past,\" said Mr. Milosevic, who has also warned of the possibility of a civil war. **********Economic uncertainty, which in much of the rest of Eastern Europe followed political change, is already a real specter here. Although Serbia has so far resisted the painful aspects of economic reform, some observers predict that industrial workers will look to the former Communists for protection against market forces. **********Mr. Milosevic may have a powerful ally in the Yugoslav Army, which is dominated by a Communist-indoctrinated officer corps, 70 percent of whom are Serbs. In an interview this week, the Defense Minister, Gen. Veljko Kadijevic, said, \"The future, historically speaking, belongs to the idea of socialism, and the experience of developed nations shows that it is one of the most civilized achievements of the contemporary epoch.\" Scattered Violence **********The Serbian elections are taking place in an atmosphere of controlled tension, amid scattered incidents of violence, some within the republic's borders, other in clashes involving ethnic Serbs in neighboring republics, particularly Croatia. Opposition spokesmen blamed politics for the shooting death of one Serbian Renewal campaign worker in southern Serbia this week, although others have played down the significance of the incident. **********National hostility -- between Serbs and Croats, Serbs and Albanians, Macedonians and Serbs -- have flared up throughout Yugoslavia in recent months, partly as a result of fears that Serbs, who dominated the Yugoslav state between World War I and World War II, are once again bent on asserting their power as the country's most numerous group. **********Kosovo, a region inside Serbia that has been the most troublesome of Yugoslavia's hot spots, has been quiet recently. Albanians, who make up more than 90 percent of the population there, are boycotting the election in protest against the Serbian government's move to strip the region of its political autonomy. **********In the debate over Yugoslavia's future, the Serbian government has opposed proposals by Croatia and Slovenia for a looser confederation, arguing instead for a strong federal system that would keep all the Serbs in Yugoslavia -- inside and outside the republic -- in a single state. In his interview this week, Defense Mininster Kadijevic supported a strong federal Yugoslavia, saying \"the people will not accept recipes\" for the breakup of the country \"from self-styled messiahs and political adventurists.\" Calls for Negotiations **********The Reform Party, founded by federal Prime Minister Ante Markovic as a counter to the nationalist and Communist parties, is making a pitch to Serbian voters' Yugoslav sympathies and calls for negotiations between the national groups, including Albanians. **********But with the exception of Vojvodina, a region populated by a mixture of ethnic groups, the Reform Party has failed to pick up wide support in Serbia. Nationalism has proved to be too powerful a lure -- which explains why other opposition groups, including those with liberal, pro-Western platforms like the Democratic Party, have supported the Milosevic government's position on Kosovo. **********Since Mr. Milosevic finally agreed this year to open Serbia to the democratic process, the opposition has complained that it has had to compete under unfair conditions. Much of the mainstream press -- including the once-respected daily newspaper Politika -- and the television in Serbia have remained firmly under government control, although competing candidates were alloted time for a televised presentation of their views. **********In recent weeks, Mr. Milosevic has chosen to stay out of the limelight, declining for instance to take advantage of his one-hour television time. Although widely criticized throughout Yugoslavia as having been the first to ignite national rivalries, Mr. Milosevic has portrayed himself in the campaign as a voice of moderation and a peacemaker in comparison with his rivals."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/08/world/upheaval-east-envoy-besieged-spying-inquiry-called-security-risk-ousted.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Wines", "pub_date": "1990-02-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1078, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Envoy Besieged in Spying Inquiry Is Called Security Risk and Ousted", "print_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;   Envoy Besieged in Spying Inquiry Is Called Security Risk and Ousted", "body_text": " **********Felix S. Bloch, the American diplomat who came under intense Federal investigation last year when officials said he was photographed with a Soviet spy, was told today that he was being dismissed because he is a national security risk, the State Department said. **********The action came after six months in which Mr. Bloch was publicly identified as a suspected Soviet intelligence agent, besieged by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and reporters, and barred from his Washington office, but never charged with a crime. **********Mr. Bloch has been on leave with pay from the State Department's bureau of European and Canadian affairs since June 22. Today, the department removed him from its payroll and said he would be dismissed in 30 days. **********The State Department announcement leaves Mr. Bloch with the choice of accepting his dismissal, and implicitly conceding guilt, or contesting it without guaranteed access to details of the allegations that led to his ouster. Under Federal laws governing dismissal of employees suspected of being security risks, the State Department is required to submit a summary of charges ''stated as specifically as security considerations permit.'' **********Under the law Mr. Bloch can contest the decision through administrative hearings at the State Department, including an appeal to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. Should he fail, he would then have the option of taking the matter to Federal court. It was unclear today what Mr. Bloch would do. Mr. Bloch's lawyer, John M. Bray, said his client had no comment. Mr. Bloch did not answer the telephone at his home near downtown Washington. **********Trail Growing Cold **********The State Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said today that the inquiry into allegations of espionage by Mr. Bloch remains active. Officials have conceded, however, that they so far lack the evidence to make a court case against their target and that his trail grows colder each day. **********Federal officials denied that a motive in dismissing Mr. Bloch was the hope that the move would produce additional evidence of wrongdoing through administrative hearings, court battles or other steps he might take to contest the action. Dismissal is the strongest action that can be taken against Mr. Bloch short of filing criminal charges, which the available evidence does not support, law enforcement officials say. **********It is ''farfetched indeed'' to think Mr. Bloch's dismissal is a Federal ploy to force the disclosure of new evidence against him, Michael Schatzow, a Baltimore lawyer who prosecuted John A. Walker, the master Soviet spy, said in an interview. Indeed, he said, the Government has abandoned similar proceedings in other cases to avoid disclosing classified evidence. **********''In these proceedings the burden usually goes the other way,'' he said, meaning the Government must show that its actions are justified. ''Mr. Bloch obviously has a good lawyer. He's not going to stick his foot in his mouth now.'' **********An Eerie Composure **********For the State Department, Mr. Bloch's dismissal was also dictated by financial considerations. Officials noted that Mr. Bloch receives an $80,000-a-year salary for a job he is barred from performing. **********Through it all, the balding, 54-year-old bureaucrat has maintained an eerie composure, repeatedly declining opportunities to deny that he was a spy and challenging investigators to find enough evidence to prove otherwise. **********A State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, today refused to describe the specific allegations of wrongdoing that led to the decision to dismiss Mr. Bloch, saying those charges are confidential under privacy laws. **********The Federal law covering Mr. Bloch's case allows the removal of employees ''in the interests of national security.'' An Administration official said today that the State Department had not previously used the law, and that its last known use, in 1983, was by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. **********State Department lawyers have been studying the agency's options under the law since at least last autumn, an Administration official said today. **********''It's a pretty complicated legal issue because it involves balancing the national security and due process,'' the official said. ''We do feel like we moved promptly in terms of the work that had to be done, but cautiously.'' **********Mr. Baker decided last week to invoke the Federal law, and the agency's Under Secretary for Management, Ivan Selin, ordered the dismissal. **********If Mr. Bloch is dismissed next month, the State Department would consider taking action under another law to reduce or eliminate his pension, the Administration official said. **********Mr. Bloch was the second-ranking American diplomat in Vienna during much of the Reagan Administration. In that job, he effectively ran day-to-day embassy affairs in a city that is a center for sensitive arms negotiations and other strategic matters. **********Charges Go Back to 70's **********Since 1988, he had worked in a Washington office that deals with European economic relations and restrictions on technology exports to the East bloc. **********American officials have said they believe that Mr. Bloch began spying for Moscow in the 1970's, when he was an officer at American embassies in West and East Berlin. But officials said he came under F.B.I. scrutiny only last spring, when he turned up in a secret videotape of a known Soviet agent whose European movements were being followed. **********Mr. Bloch was immediately placed under heavy surveillance, and his automobile and telephone were wiretapped. Officials said the automobile wiretap later recorded Mr. Bloch telling his wife, Lucille, that he had accepted money from the Soviet Union. **********Numerous news reports said the inquiry also turned up evidence that Mr. Bloch had spent large sums of money, well beyond the means of a mid-level diplomat, for a prostitute's services during much of his stay in Vienna. **********The Soviet agent appears to have cryptically told Mr. Bloch in a telephone conversation last May that he was under surveillance by the F.B.I. Shortly after the tip, the State Department suspended Mr. Bloch. **********Last July, reporters detected the heavy surveillance, and a horde of writers and photographers joined Federal agents in a round-the-clock siege of Mr. Bloch's home."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/02/world/upheaval-east-moscow-sends-armored-vehicles-through-tense-lithuania-capital.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1990-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1269, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Upheaval in the East;   Moscow Sends Armored Vehicles Through Tense Lithuania Capital", "print_headline": "Upheaval in the East;   Moscow Sends Armored Vehicles Through Tense Lithuania Capital", "body_text": " **********The Kremlin sent a column of armored personnel carriers through the Lithuanian capital today, strengthening both the Soviet military presence and the psychological pressure on Lithuania to retreat from its claim of independence. **********The latest move in the war of nerves over the republic's sovereignty occurred in midafternoon, a day after President Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed to Lithuania to ''annul'' its declaration of independence as the price for negotiation or invite ''grave consequences'' on both sides. **********Other Issues Are Open **********Officials in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, reiterated today that while a retreat from independence was out of the question, all other issues were open for negotiation. **********The two sides remained far from a common path toward talks, with the situation remaining tense but somewhat fluid. **********Officials of the Lithuanian government avoided hard-edged oratory today and again admitted to the theoretical possibility of a referendum on independence, a referendum that Mr. Gorbachev has insisted is a minimum condition of his negotiating on the issue. **********At the same time, a commentary on Vremya, the Soviet Government's main television news program, suggested tonight that the time had come for talks and that they did not have to be arranged on a presidential level but rather might begin at the level of legislative deputies. **********Such nuances of possible moderation, however, tended to be lost in the sound once again of Soviet armor moving through the tense republic. **********Witnesses in Vilnius said that more than two dozen tank-treaded armored personnel carriers proceeded noisily through the city from the railroad depot to the main Soviet military base on the northern edge of the capital. Earlier, about 3:30 A.M., other armored troop movements awoke residents of some city neighborhoods as leaders of the heavy Soviet military presence made further adjustments in deployment, officials of the Lithuanian government said. They could offer no detailed description of the vehicles or their mission. **********Before Lithuania's Parliament declared independence on March 11, an estimated 30,000 Soviet troops were normally stationed in the republic. But the contingent has been reinforced with an undetermined number of troops from neighboring republics as the crisis has continued, even though officials in Moscow insist they do not intend to use force as long as Soviet lives are not threatened. **********Significantly, perhaps, the Lithuanian President, Vytautas Landsbergis, made no comment on the latest troop movements. Other officials also appeared to be focusing on whatever promise of negotiation might evolve from Mr. Gorbachev's Saturday statement rather than on denouncing the latest Soviet pressure in the streets. **********''This army has been imposed on us, and no one knows how large it is or what its movements will be,'' Deputy Prime Minister Kaziemir Motieka said. ''This situation must be changed through the process of negotiations.'' **********While the troop movements once again served to highlight the standoff, various political factors were more quietly a part of the sovereignty crisis. **********Chief among these was the fact that Soviet officials are to travel to Washington this week to prepare for the coming summit meeting of Presidents Bush and Gorbachev. Any stepping up of Soviet military action in Lithuania would seem likely to threaten the summit meeting. **********An additional political factor is the resumption on Monday of the Parliament session in Tallinn at which Estonia has been charting its own, more cautious approach to independence, a slower pace that legislators deny is related to Mr. Gorbachev's pressure on Lithuania. **********Estonia Parliament to Meet **********The Estonian Parliament is to take up a resolution of support for Lithuania and condemnation of the Gorbachev Government. Any hedging in its language would be closely studied for its effects on the Lithuanian crisis and on Mr. Gorbachev's attempts to contain it and prevent its becoming a precedent for other separatist republic movements in his troubled nation. **********President Landsbergis already has found his appeals for official recognition ignored by the major democracies, which have, however, been admonitory over the Soviet troop forays occurring almost daily in Vilnius. **********Many potential flash points remain to be weathered if the crisis is ever to reach some stage of conciliation. One of them looms in the form of the spring draft of young Lithuanian men into the Soviet Army, a drawn-out process that begins this month. **********Lithuanian officials suffered a setback earlier when young Lithuanian men heeded the separatist movement's call to republic patriotism and deserted the Soviet ''army of occupation.'' The army has since been arresting many of them, with the Lithuanian government unable to make good on promises to protect them. **********The Soviet authorities continued to try to restrict information about the republic, with Western journalists removed and individual foreign volunteers beginning to receive notice that they must leave. William J. H. Hough 3d, a lawyer from New York City who had been advising the Landsbergis government, said he had been informed by the Soviet authorities that he must leave by Monday because of his activities. **********Troops Avoid Key Bastions **********Soviet troop initiatives have been the main factor in rising tensions in the republic, with a half dozen buildings in Vilnius seized in the last week in unresisted nocturnal paratroop forays, which have thus far avoided the key independence bastions of the Parliament and the television center. **********Troops moved into the republic prosecutor's building on Friday, and the situation there remained confused, said Aidas Palubinskas, a spokesman for the republic. He said the soldiers had been unexpectedly admitting justice officials of the pro-independence government, and a more accurate picture should emerge this week of whether the Gorbachev Government will try to take over the courts. **********Likewise, the effect of the troops' seizure of the main printing plant should be made clearer on Monday, with officials wondering whether the main pro-independence newspapers will be interfered with. Normally they do not publish on the weekend. **********In commenting on the referendum issue, Mr. Motieka said the republic's strong support of independence had been made clear enough in the recent elections, in which the separatist candidates of the Sajudis national front scored the heaviest in favoring immediate independence. The position of the breakaway Communist Party, which placed second, was that a slower pace should be taken toward independence with the republic's economy treated as a critical factor. **********Mr. Motieka noted that current law allows for referendums, providing that 300,000 voters request one. The Sajudis movement had such a petition under way earlier and collected 400,000 signatures, he said, before the elections forced the pace of independence. **********Mr. Gorbachev has made this a special point of complaint in dismissing the republic's declaration of independence three weeks ago as illicit. He says the troop movements are part of the national Government's duty to preserve law in what remains a Soviet republic. Self-determination, he says, is an issue to be settled by mutual agreement under pending constitutional provisions. **********As they are being shaped by Gorbachev officials, however, these provisions threaten to add years of political hurdles to Lithuania's course. **********Lithuanian officials insist that their sovereignty is unchallengable by Soviet authority because it amounts to a restoration of the independence lost 50 years when the Baltic republics were forcibly annexed by Moscow as part of a secret pact between Hitler and Stalin."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/06/world/us-military-cancels-leave-after-slaying-in-philippines.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Military Cancels Leave After Slaying in Philippines", "print_headline": "U.S. Military Cancels Leave After Slaying in Philippines", "body_text": " **********The United States military canceled off-post leaves today for American servicemen in the Philippines after a Marine was shot and killed outside the Subic Bay naval base.

Wilson, Kellogg's associate dean for master's degree programs and student affairs. **********Then the market crashed, and campus interest in Wall Street crashed along with it. In 1988, investment banking classes barely filled up. Corporate finance, by contrast, became the hottest ticket on campus, and marketing and management were getting hefty signups as well. **********By this past September, things had finally settled down. Investment banking was hot again, but not nearly so hot as in precrash days. And the corporate finance class, the management courses and other non-Wall Street classes all filled up. **********''We are finally seeing an equilibrium of interest,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''And in that sense the crash was a disguised blessing for the schools, for the students, for industry, for the whole profession of management. Students are finally paying attention to what they really want to do, not just to high salaries and prestige.'' **********It is a sentiment echoed on business campuses across the country, as schools try to assess the impact of the October 1987 stock market crash and many of Wall Street's other recent trials and tribulations on the latest generation of M.B.A.'s. **********The impact on students already in school when the market crashed has been well documented: Wall Street went from the hands-down employer of choice to an unsafe career bet. Wall Street recruiters spoke to half-empty rooms in the spring of 1988, as job-seekers flocked to presentations by management consulting firms, computer companies and consumer product corporations. **********Since then, the market, this past October's blip notwithstanding, has recovered. The hoopla over the decade's many insider trading scandals has died down. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., of course, has collapsed, but its long identification with well-publicized gambles in the ''junk bond'' market make it a special situation. And, even though some other beleaguered firms are still laying off people, the investment banks and brokerage houses have, for the most part, returned to a semblance of stability. They have even been recruiting actively on campus again. **********Yet academics and recruiters alike report that students, much like small investors, have shown a real reluctance to return to the markets. **********Indeed, the current crop of M.B.A. candidates, recognizing the insecurity involved in many high-profile financial jobs, is far less swayed by the promise of immediate six-figure incomes that lured many of their predecessors to Wall Street. Industrial corporations, meanwhile, have jumped into the breach with more aggressive recruiting programs, aimed at persuading M.B.A. candidates that there is as much glamour - and, for those who make it to the top, almost as much money -in managing a best-selling brand or opening a Hong Kong office as there is in doing mergers. **********Increasingly, the students are listening to the corporations' pitch. **********The implications for industry, and for the schools, can be huge. For more than a decade, business schools have found themselves competing for an ever-dwindling number of professors, as more and more of the best students were lured away from pursuing doctorates by high-paying job offers from Wall Street firms. Manufacturing companies all but stopped trying to recruit M.B.A.'s into line management jobs, and increasingly turned to in-house training programs and continuing education courses to develop manufacturing managers or internal finance specialists. Even management consulting firms, which once were the M.B.A. employers of choice, were having a hard time recruiting. **********Now the pendulum is swinging back - if not all the way to corporate America's side, then at least to a middle ground. Kellogg, Columbia, Cornell, Wharton, a whole host of business schools report that interest in industrial or academic careers is again at an all-time high. Courses in manufacturing, production and particularly international affairs have replaced investment banking as first-choice signups, they report. **********''The hard-core investment banking students, the ones who have it in their blood, have not changed their minds,'' said Lee Junkans, director of placement at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business. ''But the casual shoppers, the ones still looking for a career, for the most part are ignoring Wall Street, and listening to what the corporations have to say.'' **********Many educators guess that the shift in interest is permanent. ''Wall Street has finally lost its luster, and today's students want to know more about how you really operate a company, not just how you make deals,'' said John O. Whitney, who teaches management of organizations at the Columbia Business School. **********For the most part, the students know exactly what they are running from. On most campuses, the average age of an M.B.A. candidate is at least 26, which means that most have returned for their degree after several years of work experience. Many students spent those years on Wall Street - just in time to experience the depressed morale caused by the scandals, and the panic and subsequent doldrums caused by the crash. **********Then too, once-revered figures like Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky have been mired in scandal, tarnishing the Wall Street prestige. ''Now that some of the big names have been tarnished, being hired by Wall Street doesn't feel so much like earning a merit badge anymore,'' said Mr. Wilson, the Kellogg associate dean. **********And many of today's students do not relish the idea of putting in the 100-hour weeks that many investment bankers and brokers have endured to command their vaunted salaries. The aversion to the Wall Street grind is increasingly widespread, said Laurie Foltman, director of career services at Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management. ''Students in general are now more concerned with life style, with balancing work and family,'' she said. **********Professors also say that today's M.B.A. students seem less selfish in their career aspirations. ''There is a lot more interest in corporate America now, as well as in not-for-profit and government, because students are looking more at what they can offer back, not just how much money they can make,'' said Thomas R. Dyckman, a Cornell accounting professor. **********Other industries, meanwhile, are offering more challenges. Companies of all kinds have been slashing management layers for a decade - for middle managers, a disastrous trend for middle managers, but for young M.B.A.'s, a quicker chance at a job with meaningful responsibilities and less competition for the top spots. **********Simultaneously, companies have been expanding their international operations at a rapid rate, opening branch offices, subsidiaries and manufacturing facilities around the globe. This has put young managers trained in business practices of different cultures on the fast track -a fact that has not gone unnoticed by ambitious business students. **********''Until recently, all we could do is talk about the glamour of an international job,'' said Gerald J. Mussari, a sector personnel manager at Procter & Gamble who has helped the company recruit international students at Cornell for several years. ''Now we can bring back the Cornellians we recruited three, four years ago and let them tell first-hand about the challenges and the glamour and the excitement. We have the credibility of a track record.'' **********WHAT STUDENTS ARE SAYING **********Among the 67,000 students who garner degrees from the nation's business schools each year - a total that has remained fairly constant in recent years - a shift in sentiment away from Wall Street and toward corporate America is evident. **********''Investment banking isn't a high-profile choice among any of my friends,'' said Samuel O. Sheagren, 25, a second-year management student at Kellogg. ''For one thing, Wall Street still seems too unstable. And for another, many of us want to analyze businesses and then do something about their problems, not just concentrate on making markets.'' **********Jane Gerb, a 26-year-old operations major at the Columbia Business School, is similarly impervious to Wall Street's allure. She expects to work for the General Motors Corporation when she graduates in June. ''Finance is still where the big money is and there are still students going into it because of that,'' she said. ''But increasingly, students and companies are recognizing that there are other lucrative and satisfying careers that M.B.A.'s can pursue.'' **********Often experienced in the workplace, M.B.A. candidates bring special insights to career choices. ''I've worked on trading floors, and yes it can be exciting when things are fast, but it is boring and depressing when things are slow,'' said Cynthia Merrick, a 26-year-old student at Fuqua who worked with Merrill Lynch for four years before going for her M.B.A. ''For me, now, brand management sounds a lot more exciting.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/28/business/new-england-bank-has-loss.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 244, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New England Bank Has Loss", "print_headline": "New England Bank Has Loss", "body_text": " **********The Bank of New England Corporation yesterday announced a loss of $46.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of $42.3 million, or 60 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year ago. **********The company, which lost $1.1 billion in 1989, continues to be troubled by bad real estate loans in a weakening New England economy. **********Earnings were hurt by the need to add $151 million to its reserves for loan losses in the first quarter, up from a $108 million increase a year ago. **********Earnings were also hurt by the need to pay higher interest rates on deposits to attract funds in the midst of its financial trouble. **********Losses were partly offset by gains of $173 million from the sale of various assets, including its credit card business. **********Following guidelines set by **********Federal regulators, Bank of New Engalnd is in the midst of a reorganization and trying to raise more capital.

The Military Option **********\"I have today directed the Secretary of Defense to increase the size of U.S. forces committed to Desert Shield to insure that the coalition has an adequate offensive military option, should that be necessary to achieve our common goals,\" Mr. Bush said at a White House news conference.

It is also the first time that Mr. Bush has explicitly threatened to to take offensive action against Iraq. **********The decision appears to have the dual purpose of escalating the pressure on Mr. Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait and increasing military forces in the region to a level at which an attack against Iraqi troops would be more feasible.  1,200 More M-1 Tanks **********The Army divisions being sent will add more than 1,200 modern M-1 tanks to about 800 American tanks already deployed in Saudi Arabia. The new tank deployments would give the United States an advantage in the number of top-of-the-line battle tanks, although Iraq, which has thousands of old tanks, would still have an overall advantage in tanks. **********The three aircraft carriers that are being sent will bring the total number of carriers in the region to six. The Navy has a total of 14 aircraft carriers. **********Mr. Bush has also ordered that an additional battleship, the Missouri, join the Wisconsin in the Persian Gulf. With their 16-inch guns and land-attack cruise missiles, the battleships will figure significantly in the impressive American firepower in the region. **********\"There will probably be additional Air Force units also,\" said Mr. Cheney, adding that the precise units to be sent have not been determined. The United States has already stationed about 500 Air Force and Marine bombers, antitank aircraft and fighters in Saudi Arabia and other gulf nations, including a squadron of F-117 Stealth fighters, several dozen F-111F bombers in Saudi Arabia and about 20 B-52 bombers on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia. Rivaling Cold War Numbers **********With the dispatch of the additional divisions, the United States will have about as many troops in the Persian Gulf as it maintained in Europe for about 40 years to oppose the Soviet military. Even with the warming in American and Soviet relations the United States kept some 305,000 Army and Air Force troops in Europe. **********General Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the news conference that two and a third of the Army's four and a third divisions in Western Europe were being sent to Saudi Arabia. **********The decision to send large reinforcements to the region suggests that the Bush Administration wants to leave a credible threat that it will force a resolution of the crisis, either by coercing President Hussein to withdraw his troops from Kuwait or by launching an attack with its allies to do so. **********President Bush asserted that the United States is receiving strong support from Western European, Arab and other members of the anti-Iraqi coaltion. Iraq has sought to divide the coalition, by releasing French and German hostages, for example, and some specialists question how long the alliance can hold. Waiting for Cool Weather **********Some military specialists say that if President Bush wants to use military force it would be preferable to begin in the cooler winter months, before the Muslim holy visits to Mecca in the spring. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney declined to say what role weather or political considerations played in the decision to send large reinforcements now instead of waiting to see if the economic sanctions work.  No Upper Limit Yet **********Mr. Cheney declined to rule out sending still more troops, saying that no upper limit had been set on American deployment in the gulf. He said Congressional leaders had been notified of the additional reinforcements today before the announcement. Congress has insisted that it be consulted before force is used in the gulf, but the Administration did not seek to explain the scope of its planned reinforcement before lawmakers adjourned late last month. **********While military officials say that a buildup would be needed to win a decisive victory and to limit American casualties in the event of war, some specialists said the new deployment would increase the risk of war. **********\"It is too big a force to sit on,\" said Thomas McNaugher, a military specialist at the Brookings Institution, suggesting that the United States would be unlikely to tie down such a force for a lengthy period. **********The Administration's decision to continue the American buildup follows Iraq's move to expand its force in southern Iraq and Kuwait to some 430,000 and build elaborate fortications along the coast of Kuwait and the Saudi border. **********In addition to more than 230,000 American forces deployed in the region, allies of the United States have stationed well over 100,000 troops in the area, and more forces, including an Egyptian armored division and a Syrian armored division are being sent. **********The deployment of the three and a third Army divisions -- two and a third divisions from Germany and one from Fort Riley, Kansas -- is a major addition to United States armored capabilities in Saudi Arabia. Army figures show that the new units collectively have about 1,240 M-1 tanks, 750 of them new M1-A1 tanks, which have better guns and protection against chemical and biological attack. **********The American expeditionary force currently has about 800 tanks. This includes about 700 Army M-1 tanks, some 150 of which are M1-A1 models, and 120 Marine M-60 tanks. **********Mr. Cheney said the decision to add more forces was based in part on the assessment by the commander of American forces in the gulf region, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, of what would be needed to launch an offensive against Iraqi troops. **********\"The additional military capability that's now being added clearly will give us the ability to conduct offensive military operations, should that be required in the months ahead,\" Mr. Cheney said. He said it would be early next year before all of the forces activated today were sent to the Persian Gulf and were combat-ready. **********The Pentagon is considering a plan to rotate fresh troops into the gulf region every six to eight months, but Mr. Cheney said a final decision had not yet been made on the policy. The 82d Airborne, which was deployed early in the conflict to get troops on the ground in a hurry, is expected to return to the United States so that the Army will have a quick reaction force for other possible crises and so the unit can continue its training. No announcement was made about the future of the 82d Airborne today. **********In addition to adding more active-duty forces, Mr. Cheney also called up the first Army combat reserve units, about 15,000 men. The Marine Corps has mobilized about 700 reservists this week for combat roles. Three Army National Guard brigades from Georgia, Mississippi and Louisiana were called up and will be sent to train for several weeks at the Army Training Center in Fort Irwin, Calif. **********Once the units have completed their training, Mr. Cheney said, the Pentagon will decide if they are ready enough to be sent to join front-line troops in Saudi Arabia."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/17/business/investment-banks-ties-to-pretoria-draw-fire.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1483, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Investment Banks' Ties To Pretoria Draw Fire", "print_headline": "Investment Banks' Ties To Pretoria Draw Fire", "body_text": " **********Some of America's biggest investment banks, vying for lucrative contracts to handle New York City's bond issues, now find themselves embroiled in disputes about ties to South Africa. The bankers' predicament is the result of a curious blend of Wall Street rivalries and racial politics that is increasingly a feature of public finance in American cities. **********The main target of anti-apartheid advocates - and a quiet campaign by its competitors on Wall Street - is the First Boston Corporation. First Boston has received particular scrutiny partly because one of its executives, Ronald Gault, is a friend and tennis partner of Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York. Mr. Gault, who is a director in the bank's public finance division, the unit seeking New York City's bond business, also served as co-chairman of a search committee for members of the Mayor's administration. **********The Mayor's office and the office of the New York City Comptroller will soon choose the three Wall Street firms that will manage the underwriting of city bonds over the next few years, a business that will generate a total of about $180 million in fees. **********Rival firms, concerned that Mr. Gault's friendship with the Mayor will give First Boston an advantage in winning one of the lead manager positions for the city's bond business, have emphasized First Boston's purported links to South Africa to anti-apartheid groups, investment bankers said. **********First Boston's major shareholder is CS Holding, a Swiss holding company that owns Credit Suisse, a Zurich-based bank with operations in South Africa. Other American investment banks also have large foreign investors, like Japanese banks and insurance companies that have operations or holdings in South Africa. **********Somewhat Tenuous Links **********In all cases, the links to South Africa are somewhat tenuous. The American investment banks do not have offices or direct investments in South Africa, the usual target of anti-apartheid protests. The advocates seem to have concentrated on First Boston because, with most American and British banks having pulled out of South Africa, Credit Suisse's presence there looms larger. **********The focus in New York on investment bankers' links to South Africa follows similar debates during the last year in Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif. As in New York, First Boston was the main target. Last year, Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles sent a letter to the City Council urging rejection of First Boston as underwriter for a $350 million financing. The firm eventually withdrew from the competition before the City Council ruled. **********In Oakland, First Boston's Credit Suisse connection was reviewed by the City Council, after Mayor Lionel Wilson publicly raised the question, but the firm was found to be in compliance with the city's regulations that prohibit hiring companies that have operations or business links to South Africa. **********In New York, local anti-apartheid groups held a news conference last week to criticize First Boston publicly and pressure the city government to bar the firm from being part of the underwriting group that will raise about $20 billion in short- and long-term financing by selling bonds for New York over the next several years. **********An Increasingly Political Business **********The business of public finance in America is highly political and has become increasingly so in recent years. The banking firms competing for the underwriting business of major cities often make political contributions, and they often hire former city officials or people close to city politics to help bring in business. **********During the 1980's, the rise of minority politicians and women on local and state levels added another highly politicized dimension to the business. Many cities and towns have since adopted ordinances requiring the inclusion of minority groups at every level of municipal business. Thus, the bankers that compete for public financing deals have come under substantial scrutiny from local governments all across the country. **********For black mayors - and the investment bankers pursuing the financing business of their cities - the matter of ties to South Africa by companies that deal with those cities has become a sensitive issue. **********Policy of Mayor Dinkins **********Mayor Dinkins's office has consistently said that firms selected as members of the city's underwriting group would be chosen based on their professional qualifications. The competing firms have been asked to provide information about any business connections to South Africa, direct or indirect, as a matter of routine. And a spokesman for the Mayor's office said that Mr. Gault's longtime friendship with the Mayor would make no difference in how the city selects its underwriters. **********For his part, Mr. Gault said that he hoped his friendship with the Mayor as well as First Boston's role as financial adviser to New York from 1982 to 1989 would have some influence on the city's selection of lead underwriters, but mainly in the sense of underscoring First Boston's qualifications and demonstrated expertise. **********''Dave and I have been friends for about 20 years,'' Mr. Gault said. ''I supported him spiritually and I supported him financially in two failed races. Will it make a competitive difference? I sure hope so.'' **********Anti-Apartheid Advocates' Stance **********Anti-apartheid advocates are vigorously pushing the city to exclude First Boston because it is 44.5 percent owned by CS Holding. And they have clearly tried to embarrass Mayor Dinkins on the issue. **********''There is an obvious contradiction between posturing to be anti-apartheid and then allowing a bank 44 percent owned by Credit Suisse's parent, a major supporter of apartheid, to make millions of dollars if it gets this contract,'' said the Rev. Lawrence Lucas, the pastor of the Resurrection Roman Catholic Church in Harlem, in a reference to the Mayor. **********Local anti-apartheid groups contend that although they are working against First Boston now, they will soon start to protest against some of the other investment firms. **********''Our interest is to expose all of them,'' said Elombe Brath, head of the Patrice Lumumba Coalition, one of the advocate groups. **********Position of First Boston **********First Boston finds itself in the uncomfortable position of having to defend itself for something it has little control over. **********''The issue has been framed so that First Boston seems to be a firm that sympathizes with apartheid,'' said Carl M. Eifler, a managing director and the head of First Boston's public finance department. **********''We have no ties with South Africa itself, and we have no ties coming from South Africa, but we are being held to a different standard than everyone else because of political pressures and base competitive reasons,'' Mr. Eifler. **********Nearly all major investment banks have been criticized for some kind of connection to business in South Africa. **********Variety of South African Links **********Depending on the criteria used, few investment banks can claim to have no links whatsoever. For example, Goldman, Sachs & Company is partly owned by Sumitomo Bank Capital Markets, a unit of Sumitomo Bank Ltd., which has business ties to South Africa. Goldman also has a small, indirect interest in the Bucyrus-Erie Company, a firm that does business in South Africa. **********Kidder, Peabody & Company is a subsidiary of the General Electric Company, which has ties to South Africa. Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s parent, the American Express Company allows its credit card business to operate in South Africa, and Shearson is partly owned by the Nippon Life Insurance Company, a large Japanese insurer with significant business interest there. Many other large investment banks also have ties to to South Africa or do business with companies that have ties there. **********In 1985 the New York City Council adopted an anti-apartheid law that restricts companies that do business with the city from having any business connections with South Africa. City officials said that the Dinkins administration is working to tighten the city's anti-apartheid law and that a bill to accomplish that end is under consideration. **********Firms' Exemption May End **********Financial firms have been exempt from the city's anti-apartheid regulations since the late 1970's, when the city was near bankruptcy and badly needed the bankers' support, but city officials said that might change. **********New York City's Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, said that at least 52 firms had applied to be part of the city's underwriting syndicate and that about 30 were still in the running. **********''We have a considered and deliberative process that we intend to follow through,'' Ms. Holtzman said. She refused to say whether possible South African business connections would be taken into consideration, but a spokesman in her office confirmed that they would."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/25/business/briefs-374490.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 159, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Acustar Inc., Troy, Mich., the parts unit of Chrysler Corp., said it would invest $31.9 million in its McGraw Glass and Detroit Axle operations. *********** Compaq Computer Corp., Houston, has announced a 2-for-1 stock split for shareholders of record on June 29, bringing the number of shares issued to about 78.1 million.

Digital's earnings plunged nearly 83 percent, while Apple's were down just under 39 percent. **********Digital's results were at the high end of Wall Street expectations. Some analysts had predicted it would break even or have a loss. Apple's decline was anticipated as the company slowed production of older models to prepare for the introduction of new lower-priced Macintoshes on Monday. **********Following are details of the companies' results: **********Digital **********For its first quarter, Digital posted net income of $26.2 million, or 21 cents a share, compared with $150.8 million, or $1.20 a share, a year earlier. Revenues for the quarter ended Sept. 30 were flat, slipping a little more than 1 percent, to $3.09 billion, compared with $3.13 billion for the 1989 period. **********The company's stock rose $4.25 yesterday, to $51, on the New York Stock Exchange, after opening trading was delayed because of an order imbalance. **********Digital said that the results were ''not satisfactory'' and that the company would continue to cut expenses. For the fiscal year ended June 30, Digital took $550 million in charges to pay for voluntary severance packages. Last year, the company reduced its work force by 1,800. It said yesterday that it was still seeking to reduce its work force of 123,500 by as many as 6,000 employees before next July. **********John F. Smith, senior vice president of operations for Digital, which is based in Maynard, Mass., said the company was also consolidating operations, cutting discretionary spending and increasing automation. **********''They would like to become less capital-intensive,'' said Jay P. Stevens, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds. **********Digital's growth has slowed in recent years as the company has shifted to high-volume, lower-priced work stations from higher-margin minicomputers. **********Mr. Stevens said Digital should take more aggressive steps to reduce its work force. ''They tend to move slowly on staff reductions,'' he said. **********Digital had long resisted layoffs, but Mark Steinkrauss, a Digital spokesman, said, ''We can't rule out any line of thinking'' if too few employees accept voluntary severance. **********There were several bright spots in Digital's first-quarter results, including the company's worldwide services business, which grew 8 percent. Digital also shipped more than 75 of its new VAX 9000 mainframes. **********Digital's sales for the rest of the year are expected to get a lift from several new products scheduled to come out next week, including a midrange computer, the VAX 6500. **********The company also said that during the first quarter, it had repurchased 3.7 million of its shares for $241 million, completing a 5-million-share buyback its board authorized in April. **********Apple **********For its fourth quarter, Apple reported earnings of $98.5 million, or 81 cents a share, down from $161.1 million, or $1.24 a share, in the period a year ago. Revenues fell a little more than 2 percent, to $1.35 billion, from $1.38 billion in the fourth quarter of the 1989 fiscal year. Fourth-quarter 1989 earnings included 37 cents a share from the sale of common stock in Adobe Systems Inc. **********Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., announced its results after the stock market's close. Apple shares gained $2 yesterday, to $28.50, in over-the-counter trading. **********Apple predicted that it would return to strong revenue and earnings growth in the 1991 fiscal year. There are, however, some lingering doubts about how the new products will affect Apple's profit margins. **********For the fiscal year, Apple earned $474.9 million, or $3.77 a share, up 4.6 percent from $454 million, or $3.53 a share, in the 1989 fiscal year. Revenues rose more than 5 percent, to $5.56 billion, from $5.28 billion the previous year. **********''While we experienced significant revenue and unit growth in our Apple Macintosh computer modular products during fiscal 1990, sales of some of our more established product declined,'' John Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. However, ''gross margins improved dramatically from the prior year due to lower cost components and the favorable effect of a shift in our product mix to higher-margined products.'' **********While the three new Macintosh models all have lower profit margins than Apple products historically have had, the company expects to make up some of the difference through increased sales, continued strong sales of its more expensive, modular models, and continuing efforts to reduce operating expenses. Mr. Sculley, nevertheless, said he expects that ''gross margins will fall somewhat from the unsustainably high level of 53 percent of sales acheived in fiscal 1990.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/15/business/finance-briefs-574490.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 334, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** Barclays Bank P.L.C. of London plans to begin issuing commercial paper in the United States on June 1 through a newly formed subsidiary, Barclays U.S. Funding Corp., incorporated in Delaware. *********** McDonald's Corp., Oak Brook, Ill., has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a shelf offering of up to $300 million of unsecured debt securities. *********** Province of Newfoundland has filed for a shelf offering of $450 million in debentures through Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. *********** Storage Technology Corp., Louisville, Colo., has filed for $125 million in 25-year convertible subordinated debentures through Salomon Brothers Inc. **********Common Stock *********** AI Corp., Waltham, Mass. has filed for 2.25 million common shares through Alex.

But according to Leading National Advertisers, a research company specializing in advertising spending, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's ad budget soared 40.2 percent in the first six months of this year, to $148.1 million. That was up from $105.6 million in the period last year. **********The MCI Communications Corporation, the second-largest long-distance carrier after A.T.& T., raised its advertising budget in the same period by 23.4 percent, to $25.4 million. No. 3, the U S Sprint Communications Company, increased its spending by 46.6 percent, to $27.5 million, according to Leading National Advertisers. **********'Smacking Each Other' **********''Almost any day of the week, you can pick up your newspaper and look at the back pages and see one of us smacking the other,'' said Joseph P. Nacchio, A.T.& T.'s vice president of marketing for business communication services. **********In another indication of how the marketing war has become more heated since the middle of the year, U S Sprint has transferred hundreds of employees into sales and marketing positions where they deal personally with business and residential customers, said Ronald T. LeMay, the company's president. But partly to allow it to do so, Sprint laid off nearly 1,000 of its 20,000 employees in the last three months. And A.T.& T. is adding 2,000 people just to its sales and marketing staff for long-distance business communications. **********The similarity of the many advertisements, with little-known actors and actresses promising better long-distance phone service and lower prices, prompted U S Sprint to start a new advertising campaign yesterday featuring a celebrity, the actress Candice Bergen. MCI began a new campaign in the last week that includes parodies of A.T.& T.'s ads. **********A.T.& T. touched off the current war of negative advertising several months ago with a series of commercials in which actors portrayed average consumers expressing exasperation at repeated sales calls from rival long-distance carriers. The people in the ads were invariably disillusioned with what was depicted as the scant savings and poorer service quality of the non-A.T.& T. carriers. **********One ad shows a young woman laden with shopping bags who races to answer the phone only to find that the call is a marketing pitch. ''I think it's him, but it's them,'' she says in disappointment and disgust. **********The A.T.& T. campaign seeks to make the company's customers more resistant to telemarketing by rivals by suggesting that the competitors be asked to ''put it in writing'' when they promise better quality and lower rates. **********Spoofing the Leader **********U S Sprint, facing a stagnating market share, has spoofed A.T.& T.'s advertising binge with an ad showing a nightmarish factory of the future with no people and lots of large machinery stamping out television sets displaying its larger rival's ads. And MCI has begun its own newspaper and television campaign stressing quality service and lower prices with lines like ''Has A.T.& T. been under a rock? Do they think they have a monopoly on operators, too?'' **********The marketing war reflects the fact that, much like sellers of toothpaste, A.T.& T., MCI and U S Sprint all now offer similar prices and products, having made most of the cost savings and network improvements that can be done readily, said Jack Grubman, a telephone industry analyst at Paine Webber. **********''This industry has evolved into another consumer nondurable industry, which is: you win market share points on marketing and advertising and not on pricing,'' he said. ''This is largely a commodity product and it really takes a lot of marketing and advertising to convince people otherwise.'' **********A.T.& T. has about two-thirds of the market, MCI 16 percent and U S Sprint about 10 percent. The rest is divided among several hundred small companies. The winners from this fall's marketing struggle will not be clear for several months. **********Little Effect on Profits **********The extra marketing spending is likely to cut profits, but not by much in an industry with $52 billion in annual sales, financial analysts say. Long-distance carriers are waging their marketing war because they are not satisfied with their market share, and the resulting campaigns are cheaper than cutting prices, Mr. Grubman said. **********The question is, can operating costs decrease fast enough to compensate for the extra marketing expenses, he added, estimating that the current marketing struggle could cost MCI about $25 million this year in foregone profits. **********The bitterness of the struggle for the long-distance market is clear from three details: Most of the advertising is aimed at taking customers from other long-distance carriers, instead of increasing overall demand; competition is driving up the cost of acquiring each new customer, and the nation's three leading long-distance carriers all say they are devoting a slightly larger percentage of their total revenues to sales and marketing this year, which has partly displaced spending on network improvements like new switching equipment and high-capacity fiber-optic lines. **********''It's going to, in effect, take money out of the pockets of the telephone industry and put it in the pockets of the advertising industry,'' although not to an extent that is likely to hurt the quality of service, said John S. Bain, a telephone industry analyst at Raymond James & Associates Inc., a brokerage in St. Petersburg, Fla. **********Greater Number of Services **********Increased advertising partly reflects the need to explain a greater variety of services, such as discounts for large volumes of calls to a given country or region overseas. Executives at all three long-distance carriers say that although total marketing spending for the year has increased faster than their revenues, the deluge of advertisements will not last. ''If it's there all the time, it tends to get stale,'' said Merrill R. Tutton, A.T.& T.'s vice president for consumer services. **********''Now it's the fall, so it's about time from a seasonal point of view to go back on the air again,'' said Kevin W. Sharer, the executive vice president for sales and marketing at MCI. **********The increased sales efforts are a rational response by telephone companies to a marketplace that rewards such spending, said Mr. Nacchio of A.T.& T. ''We must all be assessing that the incremental revenues are greater than the incremental costs,'' he added. **********The combative stance of the long-distance companies contrasts to most advertising by local phone companies, which enjoy monopolies. Their advertisements are aimed at persuading people to make more calls, a strategy that A.T.& T. also followed when it dominated the long-distance market. The Illinois Bell Telephone Company and the New York Telephone Company, for example, use the slogan of ''We're all connected'' set to feel-good music to try to stimulate demand for their services. **********The Buildup of 1989 **********MCI and A.T.& T. began to build up their sales and marketing staffs in the summer of 1989. **********U S Sprint did not immediately follow, and paid a price: On July 12, it announced a $42 million loss for the second quarter and blamed a lack of new residential and small-business customers. The stock of United Telecommunications Inc., which owns 80 percent of U S Sprint, quickly dropped by a third. **********Advertising campaigns by long-distance carriers are also particularly visible this autumn because residential consumers and small businesses represent the most hotly disputed corner of the market. But long-distance marketing moves in cycles. Large business customers, who are seldom the targets of television advertisements, may become the focus of attention again. **********''My competitors have, in my opinion, slid over'' to advertising for residential customers, said Mr. Nacchio, who oversees A.T.& T.'s large business accounts.

But the locals seem to recognize them instantly. A white-haired woman with a cane berated some noisy German youngsters in a subway car the other day, then turned to no one in particular and declared: ''I can't stand these people from East Germany! They should stay home. I never did like them.'' **********On the same line the next morning, an elderly German woman turned with a look of disdain away from empty seats adjacent to several dark-skinned passengers and sat down next to a white passenger. ''I despise these foreigners,'' she said. **********''But I am a foreigner, too,'' the seatmate said. **********''Yes,'' she said. ''But you are not dark skinned.'' **********That sentiment in a country where the population density is already one of the highest in Europe can be encountered in more intense forms in towns where asylum-seekers have been crowded into camps. **********One of those is in Lebach, a town of 7,200 in the Saar where there has been a reception center since 1958 for asylum-seekers and Germans from outside the country being resettled here. All went well with the foreigners until now. **********Curbs on Asylum Sought **********For weeks, the Lebach camp, with a capacity of 1,300, has been home to nearly twice that number, the majority of them Gypsies from Romania, and tensions with the townspeople have sharpened. **********After complaining of rampant shoplifting by the refugees, shopkeepers and bankers started closing their doors. Barbed wire was put around the town swimming pool to prevent camp people from bathing there. The police chief complained that Gypsies had entered his house and stolen property. **********Richard Dewes, Secretary for Social Affairs in the Saar state government, said he had encountred ''naked hatred'' when he tried to discuss the problems created by the asylum-seekers with Lebach residents last week. **********The situation in Lebach has prompted the Saar governor, Oskar Lafontaine, who is also the Social Democratic candidate for Chancellor of West Germany, to join politicians from other parties in proposing restrictive changes in the Federal Republic's laws on asylum. #41% Rise in Applications In principle, any foreigner may seek political asylum in West Germany, although currently about 97 percent of the applicants are considered to lack clear evidence of eligibility. But the law permits them to stay until their applications have been processed by administrative courts and other legal authorities, which can be a matter of months or even years. **********In July the number of applicants for asylum was 18,855, an increase of 41 percent over the number in June. **********Waves of asylum-seekers seem to be coming from ever new directions. In July it was the 3,200 Albanians who stormed into the West German Embassy in Tirana, subsequently obtaining free passage out of their Communist-ruled country. In August it seems to be people from Lebanon, Turkey and Bulgaria. **********The asylum issue is a difficult one, as Mr. Lafontaine learned when he proposed a ban on asylum seekers from European Community countries as the beginning of a restrictive list. He met a storm of criticism from his own party and from the Free Democratic Party. **********The issue conceivably could attract attention in the national election campaign that is just getting under way. But at the moment, Bonn politicians are so preoccupied with the unification of East and West Germany that the question has not attracted great controversy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/04/world/hong-kong-honors-beijing-s-victims.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Basler", "pub_date": "1990-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 993, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HONG KONG HONORS BEIJING'S VICTIMS", "print_headline": "HONG KONG HONORS BEIJING'S VICTIMS", "body_text": " **********More than 100,000 people, most of them dressed in the mourning colors of white and black, took part today in a march to honor pro-democracy demonstrators who were killed in the army crackdown in Beijing last June 4. **********The march, under gray, rainy skies, drew the largest turnout here since the huge demonstrations in support of democracy in China last summer. The police estimated the crowd at 100,000, while organizers claimed 250,000. **********The size of the crowd, which stretched for more than two miles past the skyscrapers of Hong Kong's central business district, surprised even its organizers, whose original estimate of a turnout of 30,000 people was widely thought to be optimistic. Hong Kong, a British colony, reverts to Chinese control in 1997. **********''The vast numbers show that in spite of fears here - and many people do fear that the Chinese photograph these demonstrations and will later seek to punish those who took part - despite those fears, almost a quarter of a million people came out,'' said Martin Lee, a liberal lawyer and a leader of today's march. **********Intimidation Said to Fail **********Mr. Lee said the huge crowd ''proves that the Chinese policy of trying to intimidate Hong Kong over the past year has failed.'' He added, ''They need to recognize that fact and try to win us over, not frighten us.'' **********The crowds today, generally sad and solemn, followed a hearse, and where the Chinese traditionally place a picture of the dead, it carried pictures of the violence in Tiananmen Square last June. **********A Chinese father marching behind the hearse and carrying his young son on his shoulders said: ''I want him to remember this. I want him to understand we must never forget.'' **********Thousands of small white penants proclaimed, ''People Will Not Forget.'' The marchers, who sang ''China Shall Be Free'' to the American protest tune ''We Shall Overcome,'' also chanted for the downfall of Prime Minister Li Peng, and demanded the release of democracy advocates still in prison in China. **********The river of demonstrators was led by Mr. Lee and Szeto Wah, and a number of Hong Kong's most popular entertainers. The march was organized by the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China, a group Beijing has labeled subversive. **********The march ended at the New China News Agency, China's de facto embassy here, and then dispersed quietly. The press agency's headquarters has traditionally been the focus of protests against China, and all day, passers-by had stopped to pay tribute to those who died in Beijing last June. **********Makeshift Altar Set Up **********Some bowed reverently before a makeshift altar that had been set up by student protesters outside the big marble and tile New China News Agency headquarters. Others lighted joss sticks, and still others brought small offerings of apples, oranges and biscuits they placed before the alter. The headquarters was heavily guarded by the police, its front door locked and barred. **********The crowds today were no match for the hundreds of thousands - some said up to a million - who took to the streets here last summer in support of the democracy movement in China. But today's turnout was nevertheless impressive for a colony that has grown increasingly reticent and fearful of China. **********One sign of the change of heart from summer to summer is the large Goddess of Democracy statue, put up by Beijing demonstrators, and copied here by local artists. The replica was displayed last summer in parks here, but was absent from today's tribute. **********The Goddess, stored for months by its creators, was finally buried in a garbage landfill after the Hong Kong Government refused to give it a permanent public home. Today, there was a smaller copy strapped to a bus, and there were a number of cardboard cutouts of the Goddess. **********Since last June, the Hong Kong government and political leaders here have taken pains to avoid angering or even displeasing the Chinese authorities, whose attitude toward the colony has been seen by many as intrusive and threatening. **********The military crackdown last year shook Hong Kong's very foundations, destroying in days the colony's essential confidence in itself, in its future under China. A local newspaper recently quoted expert psychologists as saying the level of stress in Hong Kong ranks behind only Beirut and Belfast. #1,000 Leave Each Week While China has promised to leave Hong Kong's social and economic systems largely intact and to maintain a policy of ''one country, two systems'' after 1997, few have faith in those pledges anymore. **********More than 1,000 people - educated, talented entrepreneurs and professionals - are leaving Hong Kong each week, creating serious shortages in key occupations. **********Economic performance has been lackluster, and more local companies here have moved their bases to Bermuda, and are looking for investments outside the colony. **********A Hong Kong Chinese banker said recently that political reforms here were no longer the answer. ''The only hope for us,'' he said, ''is a change of power in Beijing.'' **********Rallies in the U.S. **********By The Associated Press **********Demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the suppression of the democracy movement in China were held yesterday in New York, Washington, Chicago, Boston and Buffalo, among other cities. **********The rally in New York City drew about 1,500 people across the street from the Chinese Consulate in Manhattan. People inside the consulate's building at 45th Street and 12th Avenue were seen videotaping the rally from windows, and an older Chinese man yelled up several times in Chinese, ''Come Down!

Hills, Chile is believed to be the first Latin American country to recognize the patent rights of laboratories that develop drugs. **********The law provides 15 years of patent protection for drugs, counting from the date of the beginning of the development of the drug. The law is not retroactive. **********Trade Sanctions **********American drug companies and the United States Government have sought protection in Latin American countries for years, and the issue led to trade sanctions against Brazil four years ago.

No decision is expected before the spring. **********Berliners appeared in need of reassurance this week. First, the present Bonn Legislature named Frankfurt, not Berlin, as the permanent seat of the Central Bank on Tuesday. **********Earlier, Bonn bureaucrats had leaked a report complaining about the way Berlin had handled Unification Day ceremonies on Oct. 3, calling them chaotic. And Bonn's arbiters of finance let it be known that they favored the immediate abolition of state subsidies that now pay about half of Berlin's annual budget of more than $17 billion. Arguments on Two Levels **********Heinrich Albertz, a former Mayor, appeared to stroke Berliners' sensibilities when he warned today that \"Berlin has to be the true capital of a united Germany.\" If Berlin had only the title of capital, and the ministries and their bureaucrats stayed in the distant Rhineland, the 75-year-old politician said in a speech, then a united Germany was \"in danger of listing westward.\" **********The arguments over Berlin are made at two levels. **********On the one hand, there is the cost of shifting ministries, financing accommodation for officials and their staffs, and reorganization. **********East Berlin's former Mayor, Tino Schwierzina, now the Deputy Mayor of all the city, warned recently of crushing unemployment in Berlin if the federal ministries stayed in Bonn, given the loss of roughly 180,000 jobs in the now dissolved bureaucracy of the former East German Communist Government. Berlin's jobless rate, he said, could rise as high as 25 percent. **********Berlin's government spokesman, Werner Kolhoff, argues that without Berlin as a locomotive the economic prospects of the five new states carved out of the region that used to be East Germany are bleak. 'On the Razor's Edge' **********\"What other city can be the motor for the region?\" he asked recently in the city's bright and trim town hall. \"Our theory is that the integration of the new states has to happen through Berlin, or it will happen very fitfully, or not at all.\" **********\"Berlin is on the razor's edge,\" Mr. Kolhoff said. \"It can be a great metropolis, or it can be a poverty zone. Both are possible.\" **********But the other argument is over the symbolism and the political effects of the move. For most Germans, Berlin stands for recovery and reconstruction and the defiance of the Soviet attempt to starve the city out of its freedom with the 1948 blockade. Berlin also recalls the flight to freedom of millions of East Germans that provoked construction of the Berlin wall. **********But from a historical perspective, it also stands for Prussian militarism and failed empires, and the failed democracy of the Weimar period with the hyperinflation, disorder and decadence out of which Nazism arose. **********\"Many Germans never liked Berlin,\" said Joachim Trenkner, a television producer who has seen Berlin through thick and thin. \"They regard it a little the way the rest of America sees New York. Basically an evil place, even if lively and interesting. They go there to amuse themselves, but they don't really like it or trust it.\" The Political Element **********Partly, this is political, he admits. Berlin is run by a coalition of Social Democrats and a leftist grouping called the Alternative List that is often at loggerheads with the conservative Bonn Government. When Chancellor Helmut Kohl rushed to Berlin last November at the opening of the wall, the excited crowds booed him. **********There is a strong anarchic scene, and the city is perceived by many in the west as overrun by foreigners. Polish moonlighters and Soviet Jewish immigrants abound, and a large Turkish population remains from the effort to hire workers from Turkey to offset a labor drain caused when working-class families fled the city's isolation after the wall went up. Now the crumbling Kreuzberg district is sometimes called Little Istanbul, Turkish newspapers are edited here and there are two Turkish television stations. **********Boosters of Berlin like Mr. Kolhoff like to point to surveys like one taken recently in what used to be East Germany showing that 87 percent of the population there favor Berlin as capital. But there are dissenters. **********\"I feel I am an East European,\" said Stefan Ret, a writer in what used to be East Berlin. **********Berlin is 50 miles from Poland, nearly as east as Prague, and the cobbled streets and crumbling buildings of the Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood where Mr. Ret is opening a publishing business remind one more of Warsaw or Bucharest than Paris or London. **********\"The question of the capital is more urgent for West Berlin than for us,\" said Mr. Ret, who was born 34 years ago near Leipzig and wants to print young German and East European authors. \"People there are afraid they will go under with the east.

The discount rate is the interest the Fed charges on loans to banks and other financial institutions. **********The minutes show that the committee members were concerned about \"the growing signs of a softening economy, the related vulnerability of many business and financial firms to added financial strains and the increased reluctance of institutional lenders to accommodate less-than-prime business borrowers.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/08/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-reporter-s-notebook-for-speed-ball-bush-on-to-helsinki.html": {"writer_name": "Maureen Dowd", "pub_date": "1990-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: Reporter's Notebook;   For Speed Ball Bush, On to Helsinki", "print_headline": "CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: Reporter's Notebook;   For Speed Ball Bush, On to Helsinki", "body_text": " **********All over the world last Saturday, phones began ringing. Christer Haglund, the press attache of the Finnish Consulate in New York, got a call from the Foreign Ministry at his summer home in the archipelago 35 miles east of Helsinki, putting him in charge of the 2,000 journalists descending on the capital. **********Sig Rogich, the President's summit planner, was spending Labor Day weekend hiking in the Virginia mountains when he got word that his presence was required in Finland. **********Wendy Walker, a producer at Cable News Network, was whacking the ball on the fifth hole of a golf course in Kalamazoo, Mich., when her bosses tracked her down with orders to catch the next plane to Helsinki. **********Only six days later in Finlandia Hall, where the Helsinki Philharmonic can usually be found rehearsing, the American networks have produced an instant electronic village, with four metal anchor booths rising from the lawn like miniature rock-concert stages. **********The Finns, who pride themselves on an industrious temperament and state-of-the-art technology, have outdone themselves. **********In Finlandia Hall, there are ''Helsinki, 9/9/90'' briefcases, umbrellas, T-shirts and hologram stickers, press packets in eight languages and brochures listing other events in the city: a production at the National Theatre of ''En Ole Herra Rappaport'' (''I'm Not Rappaport''), the Finnish Grand Prix in Body Building at the Ice Rink, a fish festival at the Baltic herring market, and ''Lapland Ahoy,'' a tourist and trade event aboard the Arctic icebreaker Sampo. **********One downtown shop sought to capture the zeitgeist of the East-West summit with a window display featuring a pouty cutout of Marilyn Monroe wearing an ''All We Need is Glasnost'' T-shirt with a hammer-and-sickle design. **********A Race With Television **********At CNN headquarters, Ms. Walker was overseeing the installation of 41 telephones, 40 television monitors, 15 trash cans, 10 clocks, 8 computers, 8 typewriters, 6 microwave dishes, 2 satellites, 2 fax machines, 1 photocopying machine and 1 refrigerator. **********At the request of the White House, she also had to have the Government guest house where Mr. Bush is staying wired so he can receive CNN. **********Next door at CBS, Susan Zirinsky, an inspiration for the producer in the movie ''Broadcast News,'' was ordering up shots of local statues and ''nice angles'' of the Presidential Palace, where the two leaders will meet Sunday for five hours, and have lunch with their wives and the President of Finland, Mauno Koivisto. **********Ms. Zirinsky was simultaneously arranging for Dan Rather's hotel room and scheduling coverage of a Sunday event with Barbara Bush and Raisa Gorbachev, a tour of the University of Helsinki Library's rare map and book collection. **********Ms. Zirinsky said President Carter was also fast, recalling that he rushed off one morning from his house in Plains, Ga., so fast he left behind in his driveway the military attache with the bag of codes that can blow up the world. But she said Mr. Bush is the champion speed demon. **********''The President loves the game of 'Bet you can't keep up with us,'' ' she said. ''And, since television is crisis-oriented, we love the game of 'Oh, yes, we can.' '' **********Of Saunas and Summits **********Unofficially, it is being called ''the reindeer summit'' or ''the sauna summit.'' **********Finnish officials proudly point out that Mr. Bush, on a trip here as Vice President, enjoyed a traditional Finnish sauna bath. It may have been hard to avoid. According to ''A Businessman's Guide to the Finnish Sauna,'' the country has 60,000 lakes and 1,200,000 saunas, one sauna for every four Finns. **********But while the Finns may be trumpeting the Helsinki summit meeting, Bush officials here insist it is not a summit, but a meeting. **********That semantic downshift is consistent with the Administration's earlier reluctance to call the hostages in Iraq ''hostages'' or the blockade of the Persian Gulf a ''blockade.'' **********The use of the word ''meeting'' and the choice of less-than-exotic Helsinki are also consistent with Mr. Bush's desire to demystify contacts with the Soviet leader. The President wants his relations with Mr. Gorbachev, by phone and in person, to seem more routine and less dramatic. **********In order to avoid the use of the dread ''s'' word, White House officials arranged with Soviet officials for the background sign for the joint news conference to read: ''Bush -Gorbachev. Helsinki, Finland. September, 1990.'' **********Unlike Hollywood agents, who fight to the death over which star gets top billing, the American and Soviet advance teams did not wrangle about which President would be listed first. **********The summit planners for East and West, who also planned the sessions at Malta and Camp David, have become so friendly that they now call each other by their first names and exchange gifts. The Soviets offer caviar, and the Americans give Presidential cufflinks. **********Asked why Mr. Bush gets top billing, Mr. Rogich replied with the grace of a seasoned diplomat, ''Probably just alphabetical.'' **********Spotlight on the Gray **********Tourism in Iceland and Malta may never recover from the summit pictures beamed around the world, showing those countries looking wet and gray and windy. **********But the countries that play host for Soviet-American summit meetings always begin their endeavors with great optimism that they will be able to show off their charms and correct all misperceptions abroad. **********Even though it is raining and gray and windy here today, the Finns are buoyant about their turn in the spotlight. **********Ralf Friberg, the director general of the culture department of the Foreign Ministry, said the summit meeting might help debunk Finland's international reputation as a laggard ''in terms of bold diplomatic initiatives and strong phrases.'' **********''They characterize Finland as a waiter at the table of international diplomacy, or at most, a maitre d','' Mr. Friberg wrote in a statement on the summit titled, ''Why Helsinki?'' **********But he predicted that the meeting would be such a success that Finland will be able to sit down at the diplomatic dinner table. ''All 500,000 residents of Helsinki are eager to do their part,'' he said, ''be it only to applaud at black motorcades rushing by or to watch the performance on television.'' **********He also noted that security - always the top concern of host countries - would not be a problem. ''How safe is Helsinki as an international meeting place?'' Mr. Friberg asked. ''A Finnish policeman would answer this question with two words: safe enough.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/17/business/the-media-business-advertising-how-ayer-views-talks-with-dentsu.html": {"writer_name": "Kim Foltz", "pub_date": "1990-09-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 752, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;   How Ayer Views Talks With Dentsu", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;   How Ayer Views Talks With Dentsu", "body_text": " **********JERRY J. SIANO, the chairman and chief executive of Ayer, wants to set the record straight. **********Contrary to recent reports in the trade press and some newspapers, Ayer is not on the verge of signing a deal to sell a minority stake to Dentsu, the Japanese agency giant, he said. **********''We've had a relationship with Dentsu for seven years, working together for clients like Toshiba, and recently we've had talks with Dentsu about forming a bigger relationship,'' Mr. Siano said in an interview on Friday. ''But nothing explicit has been agreed on, and no specific deal has been forged.'' **********Mr. Siano said he had had informal discussions with a number of agencies, including some from France that he would not name, that are attracted by Ayer's roster of blue-chip clients. These include A.T.& T., J. C. Penney, Procter & Gamble and General Motors. **********It is likely that Ayer will strike a deal at some point to sell a minority interest to a foreign agency, he said, because he wants to establish a solid presence in East Asia. To that end, Dentsu would be a likely choice, but Ayer could easily strike a deal with some other foreign agency. Ayer also needs an infusion of capital to continue its aggressive expansion in Europe and the United States. **********''If we want to grow further we have to look outside the agency for the money to invest,'' Mr. Siano said. Expansion in Europe is especially important, he said, because it now accounts for nearly 40 percent of the agency's business. **********Mr. Siano said Ayer needed to invest substantially in building up its European network if it wants to compete with well-established agencies like Young & Rubicam and J. Walter Thompson. ''It took us a long time to go international,'' he said. ''Now we have to play catch up.'' **********While the agency is profitable, Mr. Siano said, revenues have been shrinking, in part because of the decline in the industry in the United States and the loss of two big clients, Burger King last year and Continental Airlines earlier this year. **********One option for raising money that Mr. Siano said he would not pursue is going public. ''There is no reason for us to go public,'' he said. ''I don't want to spend my time thinking about the agency's bottom line, instead of our clients' business.'' **********Mr. Siano said going public would destroy the company culture of the private agency, which was founded 121 years ago. Many large publicly held agencies have been forced to make drastic cuts in their work forces to improve profits; Ayer, which is known for its paternalistic attitude toward employees, is reluctant to consider such layoffs. **********Mr. Siano has made significant changes at the agency. Since he took over the helm in January from Ayer's former chairman, Louis T. Hagopian, Mr. Siano has substantially changed the agency's management, appointing younger people to key positions. ''I want a more aggressive attitude,'' he said. **********In the past, Ayer has been viewed as an old boys' club that was slow to change. **********The agency has also begun to promote itself more heavily. ''We had been in the closet,'' Mr. Siano said. ''Now I want the agency to be more open.'' To that end, he has brought in consultants to teach Ayer executives how to communicate effectively with the press and clients. **********Of course, Ayer's staff can always learn to be innovative by example. In the lobby at the entrance to the agency's executive offices there are two huge artworks by Mr. Siano. **********''I think it helps to motivate people if there is a creative person at the head of the agency,'' said Mr. Siano, who was an art student in college. ''I know what it takes to nurture creative people. I set the tone by telling people you have to believe in advertising in order to create it well.'' **********And, in case any executives at Ayer forget that message, there is a piece of video art just down the hall from Mr. Siano's office that acts as a constant reminder. Four television sets continually play a fast-paced montage of scenes from programs and commercials over which is superimposed this message: ''We create your needs; we create your desires.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/25/business/finance-briefs-439590.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt  * Coastal Corp., Houston, a refiner and marketer of oil and gas, said it planned to redeem about $120 million in 8.48 percent subordinated notes, due in 1991, from the $259 million that are outstanding. * Halliburton Co., Dallas, an oil well service company, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for up to $500 million in debt securities.

Below are the bemedalled khakis of army officers. Here and there amid the civilian business suits are the white blousons of the Interior Ministry and the blue epaulets that distinguish troops of the K.G.B., the internal security agency. **********The symbiosis of security forces and the Communist Party, so conspicuous at this party gathering, has become the target of mounting pressure both inside and outside the party, as Communists cope with the new world of political pluralism. **********In recent weeks, a wide range of elected officials, Communist insurgents, independent worker committees and rival political groups have demanded that the party give up its influential network of party cells in the army, the police and the courts. **********The campaign has encountered fierce resistance from top military leaders, who contend that the removal of party cells could lead to a dangerous collapse of discipline. **********But ''departization,'' as the movement is called, has won considerable support in the law enforcement agencies, where many judges and police officials say the taint of party influence undermines their credibility. **********And there are signs that in the army and the K.G.B., as well, a younger generation of officers consider the party cells an impediment to professionalism. **********''Knowing the mood of the majority of the officer corps, I can say that they are for expelling all party organizations from the army,'' Col. Vladimir S. Smirnov, deputy commander of an air force unit in Akhtubinsk, wrote in a letter this week to Moscow News. **********'Vacancies in Kindergartens' **********''There are no organs in the armies of democratic countries that implant the ideology of a single party,'' the colonel wrote, ''that rule the army on behalf of the party, that distribute housing, goods, vacancies in kindergartens and so on.'' **********At the party congress, where nearly 300 officers of the military, K.G.B. and police are among the 4,700 delegates, the calls to get rid of party organizations have been firmly rejected by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, and the K.G.B. chairman, Vladimir A. Kryuchkov. **********Georgi K. Shakhnazarov, an adviser to Mr. Gorbachev, said in an interview that depoliticization was inevitable sooner or later, but that for the moment the party structures were a guarantee of stability. **********''If they cease to exist, it will mean that another support is knocked out from under Gorbachev, which is quite risky,'' he said. **********Loyalty to the State **********The issue is an important one for liberals, because they foresee a prolonged power struggle between elected government bodies and the party, and they want to make sure the military and law-enforcement agencies have clear loyalties to the government. **********Forty-seven liberal politicians and scholars asserted in a letter Wednesday to the daily newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda: ''The fact that the army has been used more than once for purposes for which it was not intended raises a serious question: which side will it take in the event of new collisions in our society?'' **********The Parliament of the Russian republic, headed by Boris N. Yeltsin, has already voted to outlaw party organizations in the military, law enforcement agencies and industry as part of a new constitution to be enacted later this year. Coal miners have added such a move to their list of demands. **********The party's influence in government agencies varies widely, and has declined as Mr. Gorbachev has tried to shift power from the old party patronage network to newly elected government councils. But the party still maintains political watchdog committees throughout the society, and their work is regarded with special suspicion when it comes to security agencies. **********Voting Irregularities Charged **********Since the outset last year of competitive elections, challengers in several cities have charged voting irregularities in precincts dominated by the military. **********The K.G.B.'s links to the party have come under strong attack recently following charges by Oleg D. Kalugin, a recently retired K.G.B. counterintelligence officer, that the agency is essentially a tool of Communist political control. **********''While the Interior Ministry is more or less accountable to the Council of Ministers, the K.G.B. has never been and is not accountable to anyone except the Politburo,'' said Mr. Kalugin, who was stripped of his rank of Major General for saying similar things in the Soviet press. He advocates making the K.G.B. exclusively answerable to the state, but adds, ''The K.G.B. is so much interwoven with party apparatus it is very hard to change.'' **********Anatoly A. Sobchak, the chairman of the predominantly non-Communist city council in Leningrad, said the K.G.B. chief in that city continues to send intelligence reports to the head of the Leningrad Communist Party organization, but not to him. **********Party Role in Justice System **********The party's role in law enforcement became a national scandal last year when two maverick federal prosecutors charged that the party had squelched their investigation of corruption reaching into the Politburo itself. A parliamentary inquiry found that much of the prosecutors' evidence was inconclusive, but it also confirmed that the party had meddled. **********In the courts, judges say political influence is minimal, especially now that such overtly political crimes as ''anti-Soviet propaganda'' have been expunged from the legal code. **********But judges still sometimes get calls from party headquarters urging that particular cases be handled with particular care. And the party's influence can still make or break a judge's or prosecutor's career, especially in the provincial cities where democracy has not yet penetrated. **********''We all agree that depoliticization is necessary,'' said Vladimir I. Kononyenko, the chief judge of the Peoples Court in the October District of Moscow. ''Because judges, in their role as arbitrators, have to take into account the interests of all sections of society, and they must be fully trusted.'' **********Overseeing the Police **********At the Interior Ministry, which oversees the police nationwide, sentiment for depoliticization is also said to run high. **********Grigory Y. Omelchenko, a police major and a delegate to the party congress, said Interior Minister Vadim V. Bakatin met with the ministry's party delegates last month and strongly endorsed the abolition of party committees. **********Police officers say the political committees often become way stations for aging party functionaries, who are assigned to the Interior Ministry a few years before retirement so they can retire with an Interior Ministry pension. **********''The operational workers, investigators, commanding officers and so on, they are all for elimination of these organs,'' said Mr. Omelchenko, who teaches at a police academy in Kiev. ''We must work only strictly under the law, and not in accordance with any political trends or movements or parties.'' **********There is little of that talk from the army generals and colonels who congregate in corridors between sessions of the party congress. More than a million Communists serve in the armed forces, and party members form virtually the entire officer corps. **********Morale Function in Military **********The top military brass argue that the political officers and party organizations in every military unit serve the function of morale officers, keeping spirits and standards high and combatting ethnic conflict. **********''Now, when our political system is unstable, there must be certain guarantors of stability,'' said Lieut. Gen. Yuri I. Pankratov, chief of political administration in the Carpathian Military District, with headquarters in Lvov. ''And the armed forces is a guarantor, not from the viewpoint of opression of any internal resistance, but it gives the capability of defence from an outside threat if necessary.'' **********Mr. Shakhnazarov, the Gorbachev adviser, said: **********''I would say our political officers in the army play the same role as chaplains in the armies of other countries. Their role is moral, patriotic education in the spirit of dedication to the country and the party. If all these functions are taken away from the army it will be very dangerous. **********''In due course, in a law-governed state, we must have guarantees that all law enforcement bodies must stand apart from any political partiality and work for the benefit of the entire society. **********''The question is, whether it should be done now. The danger is that if it is done now, as some demand, if political bodies start being disbanded in the army, this may lead to very dangerous results.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/30/business/world-markets-coping-with-the-threat-of-peace.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1990-12-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 719, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World Markets; Coping With the Threat of Peace", "print_headline": "World Markets; Coping With the Threat of Peace", "body_text": " **********With the Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait and the possibility of a war afterward staring them in the face, you might expect portfolio managers and market analysts to be beside themselves with anxiety.

And when they look at the larger global picture, they see other factors clouding the outlook for the coming year far more than the situation in the Persian Gulf. **********These managers point to the decline in world economic growth, with the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia in recessions, the problems with banking systems in America and Japan and the high level of interest rates in Europe and Japan. **********\"To an extent, it is still the same question,\" Martin Paling, international strategist for James Capel Inc. in London said about the uncertainty of war. \"The deadline does not necessarily say that you will have a war after the Jan. 15, even if the United Nations requirements are not met. We have no idea what is going to happen.\" **********\"I do not treat lightly the possibility of hostilities,\" added Lawrence W. Harris 3d, a director of Lombard Odier International in London. \"But this is the most prepared for war portfolio managers have been in my lifetime.\" **********That does not mean that a war would not send stocks down sharply in markets around the world. This would be the likely immediate reaction, especially because some markets have rallied a bit since the lows reached in the fall. But these managers and analysts believe that a war could be quick and that markets would rebound. **********In fact, one portfolio manager stands ready with cash to leap in and buy when stocks drop if there is fighting. Another is already putting some cash back into stocks in case there is a negotiated settlement. **********Mr. Harris knows a long conflict is possible, but he is counting on a negotiated settlement or quick war that would do no long-term damage to oil production. **********\"I am convinced there is so much oil out there that it is hard for me to believe that the price of oil would go up very much,\" he said. Earlier this year, the uncertainity for stock markets caused him to keep 30 percent of the Worldwide Value Fund in cash. He has cut that to 18 percent so he can buy back some stocks, on the theory that there will be a settlement or quick war followed by an equities rally. **********Mr. Paling of James Capel agreed. \"We feel that the impact of a war on the medium-term economic performance would be limited,\" he said. Asked about the threat of a war, he answered, \"The real question is what is happening if peace breaks out.\" **********Sander Cseh, who runs Cseh International in Philadelphia, has about 10 percent of his small fund in cash. He expects the drop in stock prices to be so shortlived if war breaks out that he is ready to snap up stocks should it happen. **********Such strategies reflect the view that a war will not mean a long-term jump in oil prices, an analysis based on the recent sharp increase in oil production in Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries. **********But beyond that, analysts and portfolio managers fall back on fundamentals -- the outlook for the world economy and interest rates in general. And although they are generally positive that global stock markets will rise moderately in 1991, after the sharp declines of 1990, there are seeds of doubt. \"The main thing that worries me is the possibility that the deterioration in the economy is worse than I thought,\" said Mr. Harris. **********Madhav Dhar, a global strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company in New York who is much more bearish, believes that stock markets are too anxious for a rally, which he said means they are ignoring the shakey economic fundamentals. **********Finally, there is the problem of the Soviet Union, the wild card in everyone's analysis. It is a country whose problems could send stock markets around the world reeling if something went seriously awry. \"With Russia about to implode, that just adds to the risk premium,\" said Mr. Dhar."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/02/business/theater-the-board-is-talking-center-stage.html": {"writer_name": "Suzanna Andrews", "pub_date": "1990-12-02", "snippet": "AT 8:15 ON A SEPTEMBER MORNING, the executive committee of the Manhattan Theater Club has gathered for a breakfast meeting in the downstairs lobby of New York's City Center -- and Lynne Meadow, the M.T.C.'s artistic director, is late.

Michael H. Coles, the president of the board of directors, briskly calls the session to order. The former chairman of Goldman Sachs International doesn't like to be kept waiting. The co-chairmen of the M.T.C. board, Paul B. Kopperl and Edwin C. Cohen, offer a few remarks. Cohen is in midsentence when he realizes that he's lost his audience. Fifteen heads have turned toward a rustling noise at the top of the nearby staircase. **********There stands Lynne Meadow -- tall with raven-black hair, her deep tan set off by strawberry-pink lipstick. Framed by gleaming brass banisters, grinning and waving in an impromptu imitation of Miss America, she starts her descent to the laughter and applause of the executive committee. **********Finally reaching the conference table, Meadow begins her presentation with theater gossip: the guest list at the recent birthday bash for a prominent British director, tidbits from a weekend spent at the home of a famous playwright. Then she gets down to business. \"There is a play that I have in mind,\" she says, \"but we'll have to discuss it financially.\" Pause. \"It has 16 characters.\" Necks stiffen around the table. \"And a swimming pool.\" Pause. \"On the stage.\" She smiles hopefully. \"That people **********swim **********in.\" **********Silence. Coles scowls. Kopperl looks nonplused. Cohen fiddles with a carton of fruit juice. John W. Spurdle Jr., the treasurer, utters a loud, disbelieving guffaw. Yet Lynne Meadow will probably get her expensive play, 16 characters, swimming pool and all. Somehow, the members of the board will find the money. **********During the years they have worked together, the directors of the board of the Manhattan Theater Club and Meadow have forged a remarkably close working relationship. At heart, it rests on the shared conviction that their nonprofit theater represents something special in the cultural life of New York and the nation, an institution that nurtures the serious, sometimes demanding works that so seldom make it to Broadway these days. **********\"The M.T.C. is known for doing a lot of new plays,\" says Benjamin Mordecai, the managing director of the Yale Repertory Theater. \"When you do that, you have a lot of 'critical' failures. It takes great courage. The top critics come. If the play gets blasted, it's done across America.\" **********For all its achievements, the theater club is not immune to the ailments afflicting the theater in general. Federal grants are static, and state and corporate support is waning. Like many urban producers, the M.T.C. faces an aging audience base. Last year it had a $250,000 deficit. Yet the theater club has devised a daring long-range solution that calls for an array of new programs and a major increase in its budget. At a moment when the local and national economies are stagnant, the M.T.C. is about to undertake its largest-ever capital funds drive. **********For many upwardly striving business people, membership on the board of directors of an arts institution is perceived as a way to join the company of the rich and famous. Not at the Manhattan Theater Club. The 31-member board has some high-net-worth individuals, but it includes neither Fortune 500 C.E.O.'s nor headline-grabbing socialites. For example, Coles, 58, is a limited partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company; Kopperl, 57, heads his own corporate financial advisory boutique of Delano & Kopperl; Cohen, 48, is managing general partner of General Atlantic Partners, a small private-investment firm; Spurdle, 53, is a retired managing director of J. P. Morgan & Company. **********What the theater club offers its board is a chance to help launch the careers of such actors as Holly Hunter and Amanda Plummer and to provide a stage for the work of such playwrights as Alan Ayckbourn, Beth Henley and Terrence McNally. To a degree that is unusual on most nonprofit boards, the top directors of the M.T.C. board treat that responsibility as a full-time job. **********It was the board that prodded Lynne Meadow and Barry Grove, the managing director, to confront the theater's long-term economic problems. The M.T.C.'s traditional artistic risk-taking, the board decided, would now have to be matched by a significant business risk. But the decision was not made quickly or easily. In his soft-spoken way, Kopperl reflects the board's deep concern. \"I **********believe **********in what we're doing,\" he says. \"I don't think we're being irresponsible. I don't see it as growth just to be big. I see it as a case of survival.\" **********EACH SEASON, THE M.T.C. presents nine plays at its two theaters in City Center, five of them finished works on Stage I; the others, on Stage II, sometimes works in progress being rewritten even as they are shown. The theater also sponsors 12 readings a year at the center by novelists and poets. **********But the soul of the Manhattan Theater Club can be found some two miles south of City Center's midtown neighborhood in a rundown area of the Chelsea district. Up a narrow, dark flight of stairs in what was once a longshoremen's hiring hall are the administrative offices and rehearsal rooms. **********The linoleum-tiled hallway is crowded with actors. Some are headed for rehearsals, others mumble their lines as they wait to audition. From behind a closed door comes the clicketyclack of tap dancers; in the ladies' room a singer practices her scales. **********In cluttered offices, desks are piled high with scripts. The walls are papered with photos of theater greats -- actors such as Glenn Close, Tim Curry, Colleen Dewhurst and Sam Waterston who have graced the M.T.C. stages. In part, the lure has been the theater's reputation for producing challenging, quality plays -- \"Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act,\" Athol Fugard's 1977 anti-apartheid work, for example, or the 1986 revival of \"Loot,\" Joe Orton's farce that lacerates the church, the police and the medical and legal professions. **********The other attraction has been 44-year-old Lynne Meadow. She has been selecting the theater's plays for 18 of the M.T.C.'s 20 years, and she is well known in theatrical circles for her willingness to take chances and her perfectionism. In one case, unhappy with the director's work, she stepped in and restructured a play the night before it was to open. **********Her opposite number, Barry Grove, 39, has run the business side since 1975. An incisive, logical man who favors conservative attire, he stands in marked contrast to the flamboyant Meadow, but they have maintained what is probably the theater world's longest-running amicable partnership. \"Barry anticipates,\" says Meadow, grinning at Grove as she sums up their relationship. \"I worry.\" **********The M.T.C. started in 1970 as a neighborhood group that offered after-dinner play readings in the Upper East Side living rooms of its members. By 1971 it had grown large enough to have its own space, a complex of rooms at the National Bohemian Hall where the company began to win local and then national recognition. In 1985, after much dispute with the hall's owners, in and out of the courts, the M.T.C. completed the relocation of its theater operations to City Center and its headquarters to Chelsea. **********That same year, the board asked Lynne Meadow to map out her vision of the theater's artistic future -- \"as if,\" Grove says, \"the restraints of money were taken away.\" The board found her ambitions financially sobering: the M.T.C. had been sliding in and out of operating deficit from one year to the next. Clearly, it was time for the board of directors to think hard about reorganizing the theater. **********LYNNE MEADOW, A DRINK IN hand, looks on approvingly as her board members chat with a handful of actors and directors. On this September evening, the board is gathered for its first social event of the season in a Fifth Avenue art gallery owned by a fellow member, Edward R. Roberts, a limited partner at Goldman, Sachs. \"They love this sort of thing,\" Meadow says. **********Board members attend readings and rehearsals; they dine with playwrights and actors. \"There is an obligation,\" says Jim G. Kilpatric, a senior vice president at A.T.&T.;, \"to keep yourself conversant with the theater and to have ideas.\" Meadow recalls talking to Kilpatric about a play in rehearsal. There were rough spots in the early version of the script, says Meadow, \"and Jim had the most insightful, intelligent and **********radical **********idea of how to make it better.\" **********Says Meadow, laughing, \"Some of the people on the board who you think would have the most conservative tastes in theater are the funkiest.\" Ed Cohen scouts out new writers, and recommends scripts to Meadow that are often very daring; Meadow produced one that was, she says, \"a very difficult play\" -- in other words, a box-office flop. Paul Kopperl has been known to attend some shows as many as eight times. **********During one board meeting, Meadow was discussing the rehearsal of a well-known playwright's work when Michael Coles interrupted. \"He said it very innocently, but he asked how many rewrites the playwright had done,\" she says. \"What he wanted to know was whether I was being as tough on an established writer as I would be on a new one.\" **********The commitment of the board's leaders to the M.T.C.'s mission was dramatically tested last season when some corporate donors, uncomfortable with the content of a proposed theater club show, refused to back it. The play, \"The Art of Success,\" by Nick Dear, dealt in graphic detail and language with the debauched life and controversial art of the 18th-century artist, William Hogarth. Coles, Roberts and Cohen took out their checkbooks and underwrote a large part of the production. \"The Art of Success\" opened last spring to critical acclaim. **********THE THEATER CLUB'S move to City Center in 1985 had catapulted the M.T.C. onto a bigger stage. As the business people on the board thought about reorganizing the theater, they turned for help in a familiar direction. In 1987, the management consulting firm of McKinsey & Company began to study the theater on a pro bono basis. **********According to a McKinsey partner, \"We told them you can't just admire your pretty baby anymore; it's now a growing child.\" Among the consultants' recommendations: cutbacks in staff, increased computerization, the appointment of marketing specialists to the board and the expansion of the board to include some heavyweight corporate executives with good contacts. **********The recommendations were approved by the board in June 1988, with one notable exception. Most of the directors were deeply concerned that the addition of prominent executives could alter the chemistry, destroying the teamwork developed over the years. Although the proposal to expand the board was defeated, the issue would later come back to haunt them. **********The consultants also urged that the M.T.C. develop a long-term strategic plan. The board soon called in Lynne Meadow for another look into the future. This time, though, it was not to be just a wish list but a detailed report on where the theater should go and how to get there. **********The draft that emerged painted a dreary picture. Promising playwrights were being lost to television and movies, and so were budding actors. The number of Broadway producers willing to invest in risky plays was shrinking rapidly, leaving more and more of the burden for producing serious shows on the backs of nonprofit theaters in general and M.T.C. in particular. **********There was more. About 60 percent of the $5 million operating budget was covered by ticket sales, mainly among the 13,000 people who buy season subscriptions. Now that market was saturated: the M.T.C. had reached \"maximum subscription potential.\" Meanwhile, government support for the arts was at a low ebb and corporations were hunkering down for a recession. If these trends continued, the theater could face an earnings gap of $2 million by 1994. **********The assumption was that the M.T.C.'s major donors would hold fast -- institutions such as the Shubert Foundation and the Eleanor Naylor Dana Charitable Trust, corporations such as Philip Morris and A.T.&T.; But these patrons were not likely to make up the looming shortfall; new sources of income would have to be found or the scope and mission of the theater would have to be curtailed. It was a familiar dilemma for a business under pressure: cut costs or boost revenues. **********Meadow and Grove had no doubt about which of the two routes to follow, but their ideas for boosting revenues carried big price tags. For example, they asked for a $405,000 \"artistic safety net\" to cover the losses on risky plays. To strengthen the M.T.C.'s \"product,\" they also sought money to beef up the script department and additional funds to option important new works and commission plays. To create the M.T.C.'s future audience, they proposed an education program that would bring high school students into the theater. To nurture new acting talent, they proposed setting up internships and master classes at the theater. **********One $600,000 item in the plan called for a fund to finance the transfer of successful M.T.C. plays to other theaters in New York and around the country. Because of its tight production schedule, the theater cannot extend the run of a hit play by more than a week. If a play is picked up by another producer, the M.T.C. may receive a royalty ranging from 0.5 percent to 5 percent of the weekly gross. But if the M.T.C. finances the move, the theater club winds up with the lion's share of the profits -- or losses.WHEN THE BOARD began to review the draft of the Meadow-Grove long-range proposal in the spring of 1989, the leadership was enthusiastic about many of the ideas. Several board members, for example, welcomed the idea of a safety net for risky plays. \"I am not a proponent of comfortable theater,\" says Roberts. The option of cutting costs to solve the theater's fiscal problems was not seriously entertained; the board members felt they had cut as much as they could after the McKinsey report. **********As the directors tested the numbers against economic projections and devised a time frame for raising funds, they looked for ways to give Meadow what she asked for. \"We didn't sit around and say, 'You guys are out of your minds' -- the way you would in a business budget meeting,\" recalls Spurdle. \"Bond traders are replaceable. The Lynne Meadows are not.\" **********Herbert Weissenstein, a consultant to nonprofit groups who has helped design the M.T.C.'s fund-raising campaign, talks about the \"magical balance\" on arts boards between the business members' impulse to apply tough financial standards and their recognition that too much intrusiveness will backfire. \"You have very little grasp over the product,\" he says. \"The art belongs to the artist. It would be like telling an orchestra that was losing money: cut your string section in half, get rid of three flutes and two oboes -- and just play louder.\" **********Throughout April and May of this year, Kopperl, Coles, Grove, Meadow and Weissenstein met with small groups of board members over breakfast at the Princeton Club to discuss the draft of the long-range plan, and its financial consequences. Finally, on a June morning, the full board met in a conference room at Chase Manhattan Bank's Park Avenue offices to vote on the package. What the members of the board had before them was a proposal for a four-year campaign to raise a total of $9.8 million -- $3.4 million of that would represent the initiatives of the long-range plan, while the rest would fund programs already in existence. **********Before the vote, Coles warned his colleagues that approval would require that each of them donate a substantial, additional sum of money. The vote in favor was unanimous. **********Board member Gary Knisely, 48, who is managing director of Johnson Smith & Knisely, an executive search firm, recalls: \"When I came home that night and told my wife, she said: ' **********What **********did you **********do **********?!' \" **********THE MEMBERS OF THE Manhattan Theater Club board are expected to give, or to get from other sources, a minimum donation of $15,000 a year. What Knisely and his colleagues had \"done\" was to commit themselves to at least another $2,500 a year over the next four years. **********But that extra $2,500 a year would be the bare minimum. \"If everybody gave that, we'd be in trouble,\" says Coles. At the June meeting, he announced that the leadership of the board had pledged \"northward\" of $500,000 to the campaign. The five leaders were Coles, Cohen, Kopperl, Roberts and Bonnie Sacerdote (an arts consultant and chairman of the membership committee whose husband, Peter, is a partner at Goldman, Sachs). **********During the following months, those five, long the club's biggest individual donors, solicited pledges from the other members of the board, armed with an estimate of how much money each member could afford to give. Their manner was delicate, but also direct. \"I asked for a number,\" says Coles. \"I said I may have asked for too much. But I may also have asked for too little, in which case, I hope you'll remedy that.\" They hope to raise $250,000 from their peers. **********In addition, the M.T.C. has applied for a three-to-one challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. Under the grant, the N.E.A. would give the theater $750,000 over the next four years, on the condition that the M.T.C. attracted new or increased contributions of $2.25 million. As of the first week of November, the N.E.A. had not announced a decision. **********\"Raising the rest of the money is going to be tough,\" says Roberts. \"It's bad times.\" The M.T.C. has some novel ideas, including asking individual donors to commission plays. Subscribers now donate a total of about $200,000 a year, but the M.T.C. wants more; Coles, for example, is hoping to organize post-performance cocktail parties to knit subscribers into fund-raising teams. **********The capital campaign, scheduled to go public next month, has also reignited an earlier debate: Does the new M.T.C. require a more powerful and socially prominent set of directors -- people such as James D. Wolfensohn and Sanford I. Weill, the two well-connected investment bankers who helped put Carnegie Hall's 1985 campaign over the top? Or would such heavyweight donors overwhelm the board and interfere in artistic decisions? **********\"I think we'd love to be seen as a high-profile prestige board to be on,\" Michael Coles says, \"but it might mean a fundamental change in who we are.\" Coles would never think of changing the theater's artistic director, for example; the board's association with her, he says, \"has the mark of a very personal relationship as opposed to an institutional one.\" Gary Knisely, on the other hand, says: \"At some point we will have to be able to be in a position to tell Lynne to leave. Not because she isn't doing a great job, but because that is what the board of a major institution should be **********able **********to do.\" **********Earlier this year the board asked Knisely's firm to conduct a pro bono search for new board candidates. By fall, he had several candidates on his string, including the vice chairman of a New York bank and a senior partner at a Wall Street law firm. **********For some board members, such developments can be disconcerting. \"We've all taken a big gulp,\" says one of them, who suspects that some of the things she loves most about the theater and its board may soon pass. Knisely talks openly about the possibility that a prominent new board member might take over Kopperl's role as the more active of the two co-chairmen. **********Generally speaking, Lynne Meadow contemplates the prospect of change philosophically, recalling the ups and downs of the Manhattan Theater Club's progress from living room readings to star billing as one of the most important companies in the nation. \"Every year we've lost something,\" she says, and then adds, with a smile: \"Take the day I stopped pouring drinks at the bar to help pay the rent.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/12/business/the-media-business-advertising-eric-mower-to-buy-firm.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1990-04-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 144, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Eric Mower To Buy Firm", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;   Eric Mower To Buy Firm", "body_text": " **********Eric Mower & Associates, a marketing communications agency based in Syracuse, has reached an agreement to acquire Levy, King & White, an advertising and public relations firm based in Buffalo. **********The Buffalo agency will now be called LKW/Eric Mower & Associates.

Extra revenue from price increases is used to offset the costs of cash rebates and discount financing. **********''The pricing strategies of the Big Three are largely fictitious,'' said Ronald A. Glantz, an analyst with Dean Witter Securities in San Francisco. ''They raise the price on a vehicle by $50 or $60 one week, and increase the incentive by $100 the next.'' An Inescapable Cycle?  In fact, for the Big Three, the cycle appears to have become inescapable. Consumers now seem to require rebates before they will buy. **********On Monday, the General Motors Corporation raised prices between $66 and $165, and increased the destination charge by $10. The Chrysler Corporation's price increases, which also took effect on Monday, range from $60 to $160. Both companies followed the Ford Motor Company's move on June 18 to raise prices between $58 and $134. **********The increases on most cars and trucks sold by Ford, G.M. and Chrysler may eke out a little more revenue from a weak market. Raising prices now may also blunt the effect of higher prices when new cars are introduced in the fall, analysts say. **********Imports Take Same Course **********Although higher prices on imported cars probably will not show up until fall, several Japanese and European auto makers have begun offering rebates of their own and have followed - in some cases, even exceeded -the Big Three's price increases. **********The cycle of higher prices to offset rebates does not necessarily harm the competitive position of the auto companies, industry experts and economists say, since competitors are doing the same thing. But car dealers say many customers are baffled by the array of rebates and financing incentives. **********''Rebates have muddied the waters and made determining the true price of a car incredibly complex,'' said Lance Ealey, an automotive specialist with McKinsey & Company, a consulting firm. **********Customers Seem Hooked **********Chrysler was the first to offer rebates on cars, in the early 70's. The plan was viewed by analysts and competitors as a shrewd marketing move, and other companies soon followed suit. But by the mid-80's, analysts say, customers were hooked and the car companies saw their sales fall off sharply whenever rebates ended. **********''The consumer very quickly learns to look for rebates, and it doesn't take long to see demand dry up between one rebate period and the next,'' said James R. Taylor, a professor of marketing at the University of Michigan Business School. **********Car companies, fearful of losing customers to rivals, are unlikely to break the rebate habit soon. **********''Even if auto sales boom next year, we'll still have incentives,'' Mr. Glantz said. ''There are three dozen auto manufacturers out there, and unless they all go cold turkey I don't see how they can give up incentives.'' **********The manufacturers do have ways to raise revenues without adding significantly to a vehicle's base price. One pricing game Detroit plays involves making popular options standard equipment, which lifts the manufacturer's revenues on a vehicle. Customers are compelled to buy the special packages, while the manufacturers use the base price - minus the equipment - to promote their new models as only slightly more expensive than last year's versions. **********As a result of this trend, pursued throughout the 1980's, the least expensive cars now carry significantly more equipment than they used to, and they cost more. **********Japanese Prices Up, Too **********While the American car companies have historically moved first to raise prices, the Japanese have generally followed suit in the last few years, keeping their car prices within one or two percentage points of competing American models. The Toyota Motor Corporation, the Honda Motor Company and the Nissan Motor Company typically limit themselves to lifting prices once a year, usually in the fall when most new models are introduced. Sometimes they delay price increases until the end of the year, seeking the promotional advantage that comes from comparatively low sticker prices in the first months that new models are on sale. **********In the past, the Japanese had shown a willingness to limit increases, with the objective of grabbing a larger share of the market. The most notable instance was the mid-1980's, when the value of the Japanese yen rose against the dollar, making goods produced in Japan more expensive in the United States. **********Opportunity to Gain Share **********While the Japanese did raise prices, they resisted pressure to keep up with the strengthening yen, even though their profits suffered. **********Some analysts contend that domestic auto makers, by failing to cut their prices then, passed up an opportunity to improve their competitive position. **********''The mid-1980's was a unique period in time when the domestic auto makers could have seized a gigantic comparative advantage,'' said Maryann N. Keller, an analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney in New York. ''The opportunity was there to open up a price differential so big that the issue of higher Japanese quality could have been obliterated by the vastly lower price of most American cars.'' **********Oldsmobile Rebates **********LANSING, Mich., July 3 (Reuters) - The General Motors Corporation said today that its Oldsmobile division would offer a $1,500 rebate to buyers of 1991 Oldsmobile 88 models in certain areas of the United States. The areas include New York, New England, Washington, Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Louis, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The program runs from Wednesday until Aug. 2.

Few realize that in some cases it is advisable to file separately, either to avoid liability or to allow one partner to claim deductions they cannot claim together. **********Similarly, many single people simply check ''single,'' unaware either that they may qualify for the more beneficial ''head-of-household'' status or under tax law may not be single. **********''Once two people have signed a return, the law says they are jointly and severally liable,'' Richard J. Stricof, a partner with BDO Seidman in New York, pointed out. That means that if the Internal Revenue Service discovers that one spouse had substantial unreported income, it can hold both responsible for the taxes, interest and penalties. **********Often, if that happens, the ''innocent spouse'' defense is used. The other spouse denies knowledge of the undeclared income. But it is far from clear that that defense will succeed, Mr. Stricof said. **********He pointed to conflicting court decisions in such cases. The tax court denied relief to a man who failed to prove that he did not know of his wife's omissions of funds she had embezzled. He had accompanied her to a lawyer's office after a police investigation had begun, the court noted. Nor was innocent-spouse relief granted to a wife who had often spoken with her husband about his gambling activities. She hired an accountant and supplied him with the financial data to prepare the return and took care of the family's bank deposits, the court noted. **********But relief was granted to the wife of a man who had established a successful medical practice and concealed his illegal activities and omitted the income. The court said ''she completely trusted her husband owing to religious principles.'' **********Mr. Stricof advised anyone who had reason to believe that a spouse was concealing income -whether cash payments from legitimate business activities or money from gambling or illegal activities - to file separately to avoid future liability, even though such a filing will generally result in higher taxes. **********Also, when a marriage is in trouble and the partners are arguing over money, it may well be advisable to file separately, he said. Later, if they are divorced and the I.R.S. discovers a problem, it could hold a spouse liable who no longer has access to the relevant records. **********Happily married couples whose finances are aboveboard may also have reason to file separately. Sidney Kess, a New York lawyer and certified public accountant, pointed out that sometimes one spouse qualifies for deductions based only on his or her income, but that the couple would not qualify if they filed jointly. **********That is because the Tax Reform Act of 1986 allows deductions for unreimbursed medical expenses only to the extent that they exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income, miscellaneous itemized deductions only above 2 percent and casualty losses above 10 percent. **********Whether it is advantageous to file separately will depend on a number of factors, including the size of the deductions and the amount of income and consequent bracket. To make sure, the return should be calculated both ways. **********Mr. Kess cautioned that taxpayers eligible for credits for earned income, child or dependent care or retirement must file jointly to claim them. Another consideration is that half of any Social Security benefits may be taxable for married people filing separately. For married couples filing jointly, half the benefits become subject to taxation only after income exceeds a base amount of $32,000. **********''A lot of people assume that if you are separated, you are single,'' Mr. Kess said, but for tax purposes a court decree for separate maintenance must have been in effect at the end of the year. There is an exception for legally abandoned spouses, he added. **********Separated or unmarried people may qualify for ''head-of-household'' status, which has more favorable tax treatment than ''single'' status, if an unmarried child, grandchild, foster child or other dependent relative lived with them more than half the year or if they provided more than half the cost of maintaining a household for such a person. **********A single person whose dependent parent is in a nursing home may also qualify for head-of-household status, Mr. Kess added, as may a married person whose spouse is a nonresident alien. He cited as an example a Pakistani taxi driver whose family still lives in Pakistan. **********There is one other category: surviving spouse. Those whose spouses died during the tax year may file a joint return if they have not remarried, and generally a surviving spouse with dependent children is entitled to file a joint return for two years after the year in which the spouse died."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/18/business/company-news-usinor-sacilor-plans-purchase-of-edgcomb.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-07-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 274, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Usinor-Sacilor Plans Purchase of Edgcomb", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Usinor-Sacilor Plans Purchase of Edgcomb", "body_text": " **********France's biggest steel company, the state-owned Usinor-Sacilor S.A., said today that it planned to acquire the Edgcomb Corporation, a privately held United States steelmaker.

'It's So Cold' at Night **********At night, the biting desert air permeates the house, making the cement and tile floor so cold that after a few minutes the soles of one's feet feel like ice. The dampness is abated only by a tiny electric heater placed amid four paper-thin mattresses that the family members share to sleep. There are no blankets to cover them at night, and not a chair to sit on during the day. A blue plastic bag of onions and three round loaves of bread was the family's dinner that night. **********\"It's so cold,\" Mr. Seif said. \"The entire family is sick. We went to Kuwait to find a better life; we had a good life there. But now people are being killed there. There's no bread. Everyone is scared. There is no life.\" **********His brother had to quit the university because the family no longer had money for tuition, and Mr. Seif has not been able to find work. **********The plight of the highly educated professionals who have returned from Kuwait with their household possessions but not their savings -- which became almost worthless when Iraq converted Kuwaiti dinars into much less valued Iraqi dinars -- is a hot topic of conversation in many homes in this very social capital.

His entire family and his four brothers are now living in their father's house in Amman. Mr. Khatib took with him his household furniture, his wife's couture dresses -- stuffed into plastic garbage bags -- and the key to his $5 million factory and warehouse, which was looted by the Iraqis. **********\"They took the fax machines, typewriters, all the computers and even the chairs,\" Mr. Khatib said. \"I later saw the Iraqis sitting on my chairs at their checkpoints.\" **********As luck would have it, he had recently given his daugher $100,000 to buy an apartment in Boston, where she was studying. \"Now she's sending money home to us,\" he said. **********Other Palestinians, who spoke on condition that they not be identified, told of human rights abuses they witnessed under Iraqi occupation. **********A professor at the University of Kuwait, which is now defunct, said he rapidly lost his sympathy for the Iraqis when he was stopped along with a dozen other cars at an Iraqi checkpoint in Kuwait City. **********\"They pulled a young Kuwaiti out of his car and made the rest of us get out,\" the professor said. \"Then they shouted at us, 'Does anyone know this dog?' \" The professor said the Iraqis shot the young man in the head and left his body lying in the road for several hours as a warning. Collaboration Is Denied **********All of those interviewed denied that Palestinians were collaborating with Iraq in its occupation. The P.L.O. faction headed by Mohammed Abbas, also known as Abul Abbas, who masterminded the hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro in 1985, sent Palestinians to help the Iraqis soon after the invasion, but even they have left, the Palestinians asserted. **********\"Kuwaitis who have remained in Kuwait no longer believe that the Palestinians are collaborating with the Iraqis,\" said Khalid al-Rashed, a Kuwaiti journalist with the newspaper Al Khaleej, now published in the United Arab Emirates. \"They know that both Kuwaitis and Palestinians are now being killed there.\" **********Despite their tales of atrocities, of growing hunger and theft in Kuwait and of lost fortunes, most of the Palestinians interviewed said they would not criticize President Hussein publicly, nor did they want to see Iraq's military power destroyed. \"The Americans must leave the gulf, and Israel must leave our land,\" one professor said. **********They insisted that the P.L.O. was still the \"sole and legitimate voice\" of the Palestinian people.

They are expected to discuss at least two issues - the congress's refusal to renounce the use of force against the Government and the continuation of international economic sanctions against South Africa, backed by the congress as a means to press the Government to end apartheid. **********Britain has condemned the use of violence and been criticized by Mr. Mandela for easing some sanctions, including a ban on new investment in South Africa, in the belief that President F.

With the official residence vacant, the road outside the sprawling row of British-built bungalows was opened to traffic on Friday for the first time in six years. **********Measures to protect top Indian officials, especially Mr. Gandhi, were kept secret in the years after Sikh guards assassinated Mr. Gandhi's mother and predecessor in office, Indira Gandhi, in October 1984. The assassination, which occurred at her official residence, was apparently intended to avenge an Indian Army raid on the Golden Temple, the holy Sikh shrine, at Amritsar earlier that year to crush a Sikh revolt. **********But after the defeat of Mr. Gandhi in last November's elections, the cost and number of security personnel and bulletproof cars given to him and his family are being reported extensively and discussed in television and radio reports, newspaper articles, letters and editorials. **********Other politicians, also on a purported ''hit list'' of extremists, have complained that security measures for them have been reduced by the new Government. For its part, the Government says it is giving them adequate protection. **********The open talk of the details of Mr. Gandhi's security has angered officials in his Congress Party. ''This is the first time that a leader's life is being measured in rupees,'' said M. J. Akbar, a spokesman for the party, who is a member of Parliament. ''He is just extremely vulnerable.'' 7.5 Million Rupees a Year In a letter to a Congress Party leader Friday, Mr. Singh estimated the cost of Mr. Gandhi's security at 7.5 million rupees a year, or about $450,000. The letter, which was published in newspapers here and shown on the state-controlled television, said 150 guards, most from the New Delhi police, would be assigned to protect the former Prime Minister. He would have the use of four bulletproof cars. **********Mr. Akbar, who was editor of the influential Telegraph of Calcutta before being elected to Parliament, critiziced the new security measures. **********''In the United States, a former President continues to get the protection of the Secret Service, not of the local sheriff,'' he said. ''This is not to question the competence of the sheriff but it's not really his job and the Delhi police are simply not equal to the job.'' **********Mr. Singh was quoted by a spokesman today as saying that he was increasing the spending for security for Mr. Gandhi to about $600,000 and that crack members of the Special Protection Group, set up for the Prime Minister's own security, would be deployed for the opposition leader when he is in the capital. But state governments will be responsible for his security during travels across India. **********Security officials also are reportedly reviewing protection for Mr. Singh, who favors an open form of Government and less personal security. **********''It is not a question of an open Government,'' Mr. Akbar said. ''The reason why Rajiv Gandhi needs the security is because he is the target, not V. P. Singh.'' He pointed to a statement by a Sikh leader who demanded the withdrawal of security for Mr. Gandhi, saying he had ''committed genocide on the Sikhs.'' **********A shake-up in the security and intelligence services followed Mrs. Gandhi's death and a new residence, considered easier to protect, was selected for Mr. Gandhi. His mother's death also prompted savage anti-Sikh rioting in New Delhi and elsewhere in northern India, in which more than 3,000 Sikhs were killed. Sikh militants blame Mr. Gandhi for not curbing the violence in time after he succeeded his mother."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/12/business/the-media-business-advertising-chrysler-eases-attack-on-japanese.html": {"writer_name": "Kim Foltz", "pub_date": "1990-09-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 717, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Chrysler Eases Attack On Japanese", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;   Chrysler Eases Attack On Japanese", "body_text": " **********''Everything from Japan is perfect,'' he said.

One spot begins by praising Honda: ''A good car the Honda Accord; no doubt about it,'' the announcer says as a beautiful shot of the car is shown. **********But the commercial quickly turns into the expected pitch for Chrysler as a Plymouth Acclaim pulls in front of the Honda. ''Compared to the Plymouth Acclaim, it has less interior room, a smaller engine, no air bag and costs $1,300 more,'' the announcer says. ''Now, we're not saying the Accord is second rate, merely second best.'' **********Some auto industry analysts were not surprised that Chrysler changed its anti-Japanese stance. After all, it has not significantly helped Chrysler's sales, which have been in a slump. ''The Japan-bashing obviously was not working well,'' said Tom Healy, an analyst with J. D. Power & Associates, an automobile marketing company. ''A 'Made in Japan' label is not necessarily a turnoff to many car buyers.'' **********Chrysler was also criticized for attacking Japanese car makers because it imports vehicles made by Mitsubishi in Japan and sells cars made in a joint venture with Mitsubishi in Illinois. **********For its part, Chrysler, which spends about $700 million a year on advertising, said it had decided to modify its approach in part because research found that American consumers do not like to see other cultures criticized. **********The company also decided to concentrate on ads that compared some Chrysler cars with Honda models, which it has done previously, because it found the tactic effective. Even though Chrysler's overall sales have been falling, Mr. Damoose said sales of Plymouth Acclaim have improved significantly since last spring, when ads comparing it with the Accord began to run. **********The commercials are also more humorous than those in the past. ''It takes the edge off the criticism of Japanese cars,'' said David Bell, the president of Bozell, the agency that created both campaigns. **********The agency also decided to give the ads a ''hip'' look to try to change some consumers' perception that Chrysler has not been moving with the times. **********''We've found that a lot of people still associate Plymouth with an old-fashioned attitude,'' said Bert Gardner, an executive creative director at Bozell. ''We wanted to create a more contemporary image.'' **********To direct the commercials, Bozell hired Lol Creme, a former rock musician who now produces music videos. The sets on which the cars are photographed look like Broadway stage sets - they feature abstract representations of skyscrapers, mountain peaks and trees. The music sounds like a synthesized blend of Big Band tunes set to a rap music beat. **********One spot features a group of dancers in clothes reminiscent of the 1960's, moving to a groovy beat as they cross the set to a 20-year-old Honda. The announcer tells viewers that Americans were once attracted to Honda because it was a well-made, less-expensive alternative to American cars. **********The music and the clothes change to a 1990's version as the same group boogies back to a pack of new Chryslers and the announcer says that car buyers are now looking for well-made American alternatives to Honda. **********Mr. Iacocca appears in only one commercial, for Chrysler's mini-van. Acting like a tour guide at a Chrysler factory, he explains how the mini-van has been redesigned. **********In another spot about the design evolution of the mini-van, the agency used innovative computer-generated graphics that show the dashboard being reconfigured, the engine growing larger and the chassis changing shape. **********It was an expensive and time-consuming commercial to create, but agency executives said it was necessary. ''The most convincing way to illustrate to consumers that the mini-van had drastically changed,'' Mr. Gardner said, ''was to show them the metamorphosis happening before their eyes.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/17/business/alcoa-s-net-is-down-by-43.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-07-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 296, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Alcoa's Net Is Down by 43%", "print_headline": "Alcoa's Net Is Down by 43%", "body_text": " **********The Aluminum Company of America, citing a softening in aluminum prices and lower income from the company's affiliate in Brazil, yesterday reported a 43 percent drop in second-quarter earnings. **********The Pittsburgh-based company, the world's largest producer of aluminum, said that its earnings fell to $161.9 million, or $1.86 a share, compared with $285.2 million, or $3.21 a share, in the second quarter of 1989.

Indeed, company officials believe that Pilsner Urquell, perhaps more so than any other operation in Czechoslovakia, can be turned into an export powerhouse - and a large producer of hard currency. **********A Much-Imitated Pioneer **********The ambitious goal is mainly an effort to exploit the Pilsner Urquell brand, renowned among the beer-quaffing cognoscenti. Pilsner Urquell, which is German for ''Original Pilsner,'' was a 19th-century pioneer, creating a new beer category that was then widely imitated. Today, the ''pilsner'' name is attached to beers throughout the world, meaning a pale gold-colored beer with a strong hops taste. **********The end of Communism has produced a whirl of talk at Pilsner Urquell about the need to do business differently: establishing its own marketing arm, finding a foreign partner, modernizing its equipment, increasing exports and setting up an employee ownership plan. **********''We realize that we're sitting on a gold mine - the old Government failed to appreciate that,'' said Jaroslav Pesler, production manager at the brewery, a 130-acre jumble of dark, sprawling structures. ''The Government looked at us as an interesting oddity that happened to produce hard currency.'' **********Effect on Workers **********Although the brewery has an extraordinary reputation and product, it is typical of many Eastern European enterprises in the excitement and anxiety its employees are experiencing as the region divorces itself from Communism. **********For the workers, there is reluctant recognition that the advent of capitalism will probably mean tougher management, less slacking off and perhaps some layoffs, especially among the 400 administrative workers who spend much of their time doing paperwork for Prague's central planners. At the same time, despite all the talk nowadays about learning how to survive in the more competitive capitalist era, brewery workers seem supremely confident that their famed beer will withstand the heat. **********''There is more pride here than at other Czechoslovak companies,'' said Josef Krysl, a talkative 35-year-old who manages the dank, dimly lit beer cellars, where the beer ages slowly in large oak barrels. ''There are not many Czechoslovak products that command such respect and can be sold so easily on Western markets.'' **********Bid to Recapture Past Glory **********Managers are confident that by making the brewery into a market-oriented enterprise, Pilsner Urquell can recapture its past glory. The beer's popularity spread throughout Europe soon after the brewery opened in 1842, when Pilsen's small breweries pooled their resources to form one giant brewery. It married some then-new technology with traditional ingredients and patience to produce its distinctive brew. **********While other 19th-century beers were often murky, Pilsen's bottom-fermented beer grew famous for its golden clarity and assertive, somewhat bitter taste. Soon dozens of imitators sprang up throughout the world, and thus the family of pilsner beers was born. **********For a century after the Pilsen brewery was founded, Pilsner Urquell was hailed as one of the world's great beers. Its popularity stumbled after World War II, however, partly because of heavy bombing damage during the war and partly because of the Communists' half-hearted efforts to export it. **********Hopes to Raise Exports **********Soon after last December's peaceful revolution pushed out the Communist Government and created the prospect of economic changes, the brewery's managers set up their own exporting arm to put an end to the indifferent marketing. For decades, the brewery had to rely on Koospol, the state food- and beverage-export monopoly. **********A third of the brewery's annual production of 40 million gallons is exported. Brewery managers say that with some sophisticated marketing they can almost double exports so they represent 60 percent of production. **********American beer drinkers consumed about 470,000 gallons of Pilsner Urquell last year, not enough to make the beer one of the 50 best-selling imported beers in the United States. **********When a journalist visited one recent week, the brewery's general manager, Vaclav Spalek, was traveling in West Germany to meet with officials from a half-dozen beer companies that have offered to buy a stake in Pilsner Urquell or to enter into a marketing and distribution agreement with it. One German brewery has offered $70 million to buy a controlling stake in Pilsner Urquell, while several British and Australian companies have also made offers to acquire a stake. **********For the most part, brewery managers and employees want to remain independent, saying it would be better for a foreign partner to buy just a small stake. **********''We wouldn't like a foreign partner to obtain a majority,'' Mr. Pesler, the production manager, said. ''We'd like it to buy maybe a 25 percent stake.'' **********There is widespread agreement that an injection of foreign capital could be used to help finance a more modern, less labor-intensive pumping system to transfer the beer between mash vats, barrels and bottling plant. **********''We are profitable enough to pay for it out of our own earnings, but we can do it much faster with foreign help,'' Mr. Pesler said. **********Many employees are frustrated that the slow pace of legislating economic reforms on foreign investment and in other areas is keeping the company from selecting a partner and making other key decisions. ''We're eagerly waiting for the new laws to see what all the changes mean for us,'' said Jaroslav Hodan, the brewery's chief microbiologist. **********At the moment, the brewery's management is talking far more about finding a foreign company to cooperate with than about privatizating the company. There is some discussion about changing Pilsner Urquell's legal structure into that of a shareholding company, which would remain majority state-owned, at least for now. Many managers say the employees should be allowed to buy 10 or 20 percent of the shares to create more incentives for the workers. **********The end of Communism is likely to have a less welcome effect on the workers. ''One thing is for sure, they'll want us to work harder,'' said Jirina Slepichova, a 19-year-old brewery biochemist. **********Conditions Under Communism **********Karel Jilek, the 59-year-old brewmaster, recalls that the brewery's work ethic was far stricter in 1946, when he joined and the brewery was still privately owned. **********''The brewery workers haven't had to work so hard under Communism,'' said the round-faced, white-haired brewmaster. **********Vaclav Havel, the playwright who is now President, depicted conditions in a Czechoslovak brewery in his satirical autobiographical comedy ''Audience.'' The brewery Mr. Havel had worked for was not Pilsner Urquell, however, but another in Bohemia, said an official at the Czechoslovak Embassy in Washington. **********Mr. Pesler, the production manager, said that after management dismissed two workers for stealing from the brewery, the Civic Forum union threatened to go out on strike. Civic Forum was the umbrella group of pro-democracy forces, led by Mr. Havel, that toppled the Communist regime last December. **********Mr. Pesler, who was recently promoted to production manager thanks to the support of Civic Forum, persuaded the union not to strike, arguing that the workers must recognize that the rules have changed in post-Communist Czecholslovakia and that workers will be disciplined for stealing, slacking off and other infractions. **********''They don't realize sufficiently that they will have to work more and work more efficiently,'' he said. ''The pressure will have to come from management, and we have to accept that we will not be so popular.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/30/business/company-news-bankruptcy-for-aancor.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 177, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bankruptcy For Aancor", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Bankruptcy For Aancor", "body_text": " **********Aancor Holdings Inc., including the National Gypsum Company, a wholly owned subsidiary, has sought protection from creditors, officials said today. **********The privately held Aancor filed the voluntary petitions in United States Bankruptcy Court on Friday. **********National Gypsum was taken private in April 1986 in a $1.64 billion leveraged buyout led by management.

The rest of its sales come from technologically advanced ceramics, plastics and chemical-process products. **********BTR, Britain's ninth-largest company based on market capitalization, is one of this nation's most acquisitive. It comprises more than 100 companies, making valves and meters, automotive and aerospace components, construction materials and packaging. **********The acquisition of Norton would be BTR's biggest. The British company has more than 60 businesses in the United States. Last year these concerns generated a pretax profit of more than $250 million on sales of $3 billion. BTR has bought 12 American companies in the last 15 years at a total cost of about $1.2 billion. The other operations either came with foreign acquisitions or were started by BTR. **********The company's $438 million purchase last year of a valve and meter business from the Rockwell International Corporation was BTR's biggest in the United States. **********BTR, originally the British subsidiary of the B. F. Goodrich Company, is very different from another big British acquirer, Hanson P.L.C. **********Hanson has made a name for itself by buying companies that have diversified, then selling everything but the profitable core operations to get back most of what it paid. **********Pursues Global Expansion **********BTR usually keeps what it buys. It has a long history of acquiring industrial companies that make high-quality products for niche markets, investing heavily in them to lower their costs and helping them expand throughout the world. It is also known for getting the highest-possible prices for its products. **********''BTR has been an extremely good performer over the years,'' said Andrew C. Mitchell, an analyst at the Smith New Court Agency, a London brokerage. ''They have taken businesses that on the surface wouldn't be very exciting and produced very good results with them.'' **********BTR's worldwide operations had a pretax profit of nearly $1.74 billion on sales of $11.31 billion in 1989. The company's pretax profit grew more than fifteenfold in the last decade, while sales increased nearly as much. **********Confident on Financing **********BTR stressed that the bid for Norton would not be a leveraged buyout, whereby BTR would load Norton up with debt to finance the acquisition. BTR said it was confident of getting bank financing to buy Norton stock. Dillon, Read is the investment bank advising BTR. **********At a news conference, John C. Cahill, BTR's chief executive, noted that Norton had ''a mixed profit performance'' in the 1980's, when its earnings grew very little. **********Last year, Norton earned $105.1 million ($85.8 million before a tax-loss carry-forward) on sales of $1.53 billion. Norton had an operating margin of 9.6 percent, while BTR's was 17.6 percent. **********''If you combined the technology excellence of Norton with the operating excellence of BTR, you'd improve the key ratios significantly,'' Mr. Cahill said. ''BTR can provide the global scope, the financial resources and the management tools to allow Norton managers greater success in the 90's.'' **********Some Say Price Is High **********Mr. Mitchell and some other analysts said BTR was offering a relatively high price for Norton and would have to work hard to make the acquisition pay off. ''This will be one of their tougher challenges,'' Mr. Mitchell said. **********At least one analyst, James Wei of Merrill Lynch, said he thought that another company could bid for Norton and push the price above $80 a share. BTR officials said they had already paid $15 million, or about $50 a share, for a 1.6 percent stake in Norton. Analysts also said that unless Norton capitulated, BTR faced several obstacles: two anti-takeover laws in Massachusetts and a Norton plan that gives shareholders the right to buy shares at a bargain price if a hostile bid is made. **********BTR intends to has filed challenges to the laws and the plan in a Federal court in Boston, said Robert Delamter, a lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell, the New York law firm representing BTR. **********Acting on the suit, Judge Joseph Tauro issued a 10-day restraining order barring the state or Norton from invoking the law or carrying out any other legal action to fight the tender offer until he hears further arguments on March 26. In addition, Mr. Wei noted that Norton, like others in its industry, was hit hard in the 1980's when many industrial customers substituted plastic parts, which did not require grinding, for metal parts, which did. **********Stock Buyback Under Way **********John M. Nelson, Norton's chairman and chief executive, seems to have been aware that his company was vulnerable to a takeover bid. Norton is in the process of selling its drilling-bits business for $550 million in cash and securities and said it would use the proceeds to buy back up to 15 percent, or 3.1 million, of its shares. It has already bought a million. **********BTR's shares closed today on the London Stock Exchange at $:4.37, or $7.10, up 20 pence, or 32.5 cents. **********The main architect of BTR's expansion strategy has been Sir Owen Green, BTR's chairman, who was chief executive until three and a half years ago. Before succeeding Sir Owen as chief executive, Mr. Cahill, who is 60 years old, ran the United States operations for seven years. He continues to live in America, and has homes in Providence,R.I., and in Longboat Key, Fla. **********How does he run a London-based company from America? ''I live in an airplane,'' he said. He quickly added it was not a BTR-owned craft. ''We have no corporate jets, no hunting lodges and only 49 people in our corporate headquarters'' in London, he said. ''We're not an extravagant company.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/31/business/eastern-s-woes-tied-to-pressure.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1990-07-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1504, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Eastern's Woes Tied To Pressure", "print_headline": "Eastern's Woes Tied To Pressure", "body_text": " **********Many Eastern Airlines maintenance supervisors, including those indicted last week on charges of falsifying records, were trapped between the airline's aggressive management and its militant unionized workers, interviews with people at many levels of the airline show. **********On one side, management created enormous pressure to avoid delays caused by maintenance and keep the planes flying even as it laid off workers and cut back on the ready availability of parts, according to an Eastern executive, leaders of the airline's unions, and pilots and mechanics interviewed over the weekend and yesterday. **********On the other side, some unionized mechanics and pilots insisted on following rules to the letter to disrupt the airline's flight schedule as part of a bitter battle with management. **********Incentive Program Instituted **********The airline instituted an incentive program in which managers and supervisors got extra pay for keeping cancellations and late flights at a minimum. Those supervisors with poor records of keeping flights on time were often transferred, demoted or dismissed. The supervisors thus often had to choose between keeping their jobs and falsifying records, these people said. **********''With management at the top directing and pushing and the employees resisting, the line supervisors were caught directly in the middle,'' said John Bavis, a former leader of the pilots' union. ''If the performance of the airline was off, who did management go to? The line supervisors.'' **********Karen Ceramsak, a spokesman for Eastern, said that the incentive program was intended to reward people for performing work properly and keeping on top of maintenance, not just to keep planes flying on time. There was increased pressure on the supervisors to manage, she said, ''simply because they were managing under a difficult environment. The pressure was never to disregard legitimate safety conerns.'' **********Ms. Ceramsak said that all parts of an airline, including catering and luggate-loading, contributed to on-time performance, but ''that on-time performance does not come at the expense of safety.'' **********A former Eastern foreman pleaded guilty yesterday to charges of ignoring repairs and falsifying records. He told the court that the fraud was orchestrated by his superiors. **********Eastern and nine of its maintenance supervisors and executives were indicted last week on charges that important maintenance work was routinely ignored at some airports where the carrier operates and records were then falsified to make it appear as if the work had been done. The indictment covered the period from July 1985 to October 1989. Eastern has said that it has since taken action to insure that its operations are safe. **********The Eastern employees described a situation in which top Eastern executives thought that mechanics and pilots were using complaints about maintenance and malfunctions as another way of waging their war with management. Thus the executives put enormous pressure on supervisors to keep planes flying despite complaints, and instituted the incentive program. **********Complicating the jobs of the supervisors was the fact that pilots and mechanics sometimes did use the rules to fight back. In 1987 the pilots' union even began to refuse to fly planes on which a large number of maintenance items had accumulated. **********A series of layoffs and cost-saving drives during the period covered by the indictment often left supervisors with fewer workers to handle the same number of flights. **********Report Expected **********The practice of falsifying records was apparently allowed to continue in some areas because the Federal Aviation Administration took inadequate action. A Federal prosecutor in New York is expected to issue a report criticizing certain F.A.A. officials for not acting on complaints by Eastern mechanics and pilots that repairs were being forgone and maintenance records falsified. The report will say that these officials did not act because they attributed the problems to the labor dispute at the airline and did not want to get involved, according to several people with knowledge of the report. **********The unusual report stems from the grand jury investigation that produced last week's indictment. It has been prepared by the staff of Andrew J. Maloney, the United States. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, in Brooklyn. **********Mr. Maloney and his staff would not comment. But the existence of the report was confirmed by a member of Mr. Maloney's team and a top official of the F.A.A., according to Mike O'Connell, the president of Local 1894 of the International Association of Machinists. Mr. O'Connell had presented some of the evidence that led to the grand jury investigation. **********Fred Farrar, a spokesman for the F.A.A., said the agency did not know of the report and would not have a response ''until we find out what the man said.'' He was referring to Mr. Maloney. $12 Million in Fines The F.A.A. has repeatedly investigated Eastern for maintenance, safety and recordkeeping violations over the last three years and has imposed fines totaling more than $12 million. Mr. Maloney commended the efforts of some of the staff of the F.A.A.'s Eastern regional office at Kennedy in his investigation. **********Most of those interviewed agreed that the practices mentioned in the indictment spread across many parts of Eastern's system. **********The indictment involved Eastern's operations at Kennedy International Airport, La Guardia Airport and Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta. **********The supervisors and executives are charged with what is called ''pencil whipping'' in the industry. The indictment says they signed their own names on records for work that was not accomplished, forged the names of other employees and used fictitious names. **********Conflict With Unions **********The period in which the practices went on coincided with a period of escalating conflict between Eastern's management and its three unions -the pilots, machinists and flight attendants. It covers the last year when Frank Borman, the former astronaut, was chairman and the three years when Frank Lorenzo controlled Eastern as chairman of the Texas Air Corporation, now called Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. The airline, which filed for protection of the bankruptcy court in March 1989, was placed under the control of a court-appointed trustee, Martin Shugrue, in April. **********After a period of good relations and some profitable quarters in 1985, Eastern by early 1986 had begun to lose money and was coming under pressure from its banks, which held about $2.5 billion in debt, to win union concessions and become profitable. **********While Mr. Borman was able to secure deep cuts from the flight attendants and pilots, he failed with the machinists. The company was sold to Mr. Lorenzo's company in 1986. **********Lorenzo Team Brought In **********By October 1986 Mr. Lorenzo had taken over as chairman and brought in his own management team, including Phil Bakes, the former head of Continental Airlines, as president. **********One former Eastern pilot who monitored what happened in maintenance but did not want to be identified said that Eastern executives installed a carrot-and-stick approach. For example, a manager of maintenance at Kennedy who met the company's goals for getting airplanes out on time would get extra money. **********If the supervisors and managers failed, the pilot said, they would face enormous pressure from above, including the threat of a transfer. **********An inspection of Eastern records in Miami by a team of F.A.A. investigators that found that Eastern managers ''were allowing aircraft to be moved without adequate corrective action'' concluded that the incentive program was partly to blame. **********Guilty Plea Entered **********By The Associated Press **********A former Eastern Airlines foreman pleaded guilty yesterday to charges that he ignored vital maintenance and safety repairs and then falsified records to make it appear the work had been done. **********Elia Dragone, 29 years old, of Jersey City, was the first employee of the troubled airline to plead guilty in a broad scheme that allegedly allowed unsafe airliners to fly. **********Mr. Dragone, who worked at Kennedy Airport, told a Federal District Court judge in Brooklyn that the fraud was orchestrated by his superiors at the airline. **********Named in 20 Counts **********Mr. Dragone, named in 20 counts of the indictment, pleaded guilty before Judge I. Leo Glasser to two counts -conspiracy and obstructing a Federal Aviation Administration investigation into the airline. He faces five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each count at sentencing Oct. 17. He was allowed to remain free on his own recognizance. **********In exchange for cooperating in the investigation, the Government will dismiss the other charges against Mr. Dragone and recommend leniency in sentencing, Charles W. Gerber, an Assistant United States Attorney, said. **********According to a four-page plea agreement signed on June 18, Mr. Dragone will testify at trials against Eastern and its employees. He will also cooperate in investigations of the airline by the F.A.A. and other Government agencies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/14/business/company-news-asarco-fights-sale-of-freeport-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Asarco Fights Sale Of Freeport Unit", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Asarco Fights Sale Of Freeport Unit", "body_text": " **********Asarco Inc. challenged the proposed sale of the Freeport-McMoran Inc.'s gold mining subsidiary to South African-controlled Minorco S.A.

Uses Light Touch In Campaign", "body_text": " **********FACED with increasing competition, the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York has begun its first television campaign in three years, an effort aimed at dispelling what it says are some common misconceptions about health maintenance organizations. **********''A lot of people think we don't offer health care that is as up-to-date and convenient as service offered by other organizations,'' said Victoria Wicks, the senior vice president for marketing at H.I.P., a nonprofit organization that provides health care through its medical centers and hospitals for a set fee. ''We want to dispel those misconceptions and give people a new image of the organization.'' **********Ms. Wicks said consumer research had found that many people thought H.I.P.'s centers were like state-run clinics, which many associated with poor medical care. Other complaints have focused on the costs of the program and an inability to choose doctors. **********One commercial uses a stylistic trick to make a point about how much money the organization has invested in improving operations. A spokeswoman is shown on half of the television screen, while the other half pictures nothing but static, as if the videotape had been cut in half. **********As she alternately disappears into the static and reappears on the good half of the commercial, the spokeswoman tells viewers that ''H.I.P. has spent so much money, $170 million buying medical equipment and beautifying our offices, we only had enough money left for half a commercial.'' **********H.I.P. hopes the campaign will attract new members and keep current members from switching to other plans. Autumn is a critical period for health-care concerns because during this period many companies offer employees the opportunity to choose a new provider. **********The job of getting and keeping members has gotten harder. For one thing, far more competition exists; the number of health maintenance organizations has risen substantially since H.I.P. went into business more than 40 years ago. More than 600 such plans are competing in the $28 billion-a-year prepaid health-care industry. **********In the last 15 years, membership in these organizations has grown rapidly. About 30 million Americans are now enrolled in these plans. But primarily because of the rising costs of the plans, enrollment has slowed significantly in the last two years. **********For the most part, the campaign created by TBWA Advertising in New York relies on humor to demonstrate to consumers that they may have the wrong impression of what H.I.P. has to offer. **********Research found that most consumers were concerned about the kind of doctors who would treat them. ''The biggest problem most people had was the fear that they would get a lousy doctor,'' said Murray Gaylord, an executive vice president at TBWA. **********One commercial, called ''Night Golf,'' shows a frustrated-looking man teeing off at night with only the headlights from his cart to light the golf course. The announcer explains, ''Doctors at H.I.P. are so dedicated to the practice of medicine, their work comes before play - but at least they can have the golf course to themselves.'' **********Another addresses the concern among consumers that they would not be allowed to choose their doctor. The spot features a man adamantly shaking his head as the announcer says, ''If your doctor at H.I.P. isn't one you like, you can choose another, or another, or another until you find a doctor you do like, for whatever reason.'' The commercial ends with the man shaking the hand of a physician who looks just like him. **********The organization took the uncharacteristicly humorous approach because the advertising for competing health-care and insurance companies usually relies on a straightforward rundown of program benefits. ''Most advertising in this category gives consumers the serious treatment,'' Ms. Wicks said. ''We're hoping this will set us apart from the competition.'' **********Ms. Wicks said she did not worry that the commercials would give viewers the false impression that H.I.P. was a frivolous organization. ''Even though we're using a lighter tone,'' she said, ''we do not treat medical care lightly.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/11/world/standoff-in-the-gulf-in-desert-gi-s-find-a-welcome-oasis-the-px.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1990-12-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1295, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Desert, G.I.'s Find a Welcome Oasis: The PX", "print_headline": "STANDOFF IN THE GULF; In Desert, G.I.'s Find a Welcome Oasis: The PX", "body_text": " **********It was as if Pfc. Jason Mink had never seen a fruit cocktail before. **********\"You think about fruit a lot,\" said Private Mink, who carried a red plastic shopping basket overflowing with more than 30 cans of fruit salad. After four months in the Arabian desert, he had clearly been left without much taste -- make that any taste -- for freeze-dried Army rations. \"You dream about fruit.\" **********Private Mink, a lanky 20-year-old from Palatine, Ill., waited patiently in the checkout line Sunday morning, relishing his first visit to what, for the hundreds of thousands of American soldiers in Saudi Arabia, is the next best thing to a ticket home: the post office and PX, or post exchange.  'Really Gets Boring Here' **********\"It just breaks the monotony,\" says Specialist 4 Ron Power, a 22-year-old soldier from Chandler, Ariz., who said he tries to get to the PX as often as he can to stock up on shaving supplies and Tiparillos. \"It gets really boring here, just waiting for something to happen.\" **********The Defense Department has established several of American post exchanges across Saudi Arabia, each one part supermarket, part restaurant, part entertainment center, part town square. A small canteen that sells hamburgers and french fries is run from a trailer nearby. **********For American soldiers and airmen who are deployed here, a visit to the PX is just about the only chance they have to pretend they are someplace other than in the middle Saudi Arabia, waiting for a military clash with Iraq. **********Many travel hundreds of miles by bus to this PX in eastern Saudi Arabia. The exact location cannot be identified under military reporting rules. 'Break From the Routine' **********\"So many of these men and women are restricted to their camps and aren't allowed to go into town,\" said Dan Bouchard, a PX manager, who arrived here recently from San Antonio. \"We're their break from the routine. We're the place they come to get their beanie-weenies and a can of Coke.\" **********Private Mink, who said he has been in the army for \"two years, one month, 15 days and a couple of hours,\" made it clear that his visit to the PX was among the most pleasant occasions of his stay in Saudi Arabia. **********\"I'm part of an engineering unit and we're building roads and helicopter pads way out there in the desert,\" said Private Mink, his face a reddish brown from days under the searing sun. \"You need this sort of break.\" **********Inside the PX, the look is distinctly that of a K-mart or a Kroger, and these shoppers clearly appreciate the comforting familiarity of American brand names, everything from Oreos to Cheez Ums, from Milky Ways to M & M's, from Gatorade to Pepsi, from Johnson & Johnson baby powder to Noxzema skin cream.  Previous Use Unclear **********Military officials say they are not quite sure what the building was used for before it was turned into a PX last summer -- perhaps a small warehouse or a factory. The building appears to be reasonably new and is perhaps a quarter of the size of a traditional American supermarket. **********\"I'll have to tell my dad about this,\" said a young airman, pointing to a shelf jammed with hundreds of blue cans of Spam. \"He used to eat this stuff in Korea. I guess it's my turn now.\" **********The store is decorated for the holidays, with green-and-red foil garlands drawn across the ceiling and a nearly life-size stuffed Santa Claus placed near the entrance. **********A display of Christmas cards includes a specially designed card featuring a drawing of an Army M-1 tank parked on the Saudi desert under a palm tree decorated with Christmas ornaments.  Christmas Cards for Home **********Senior Airman Michelle Argabrite, a 21-year-old from Long Beach, Calif., was picking out a Christmas card for her 11-year-old sister from a more traditional selection of cards an aisle away. \"For Christmas presents I've already gotten everybody Desert Shield T-shirts,\" she said, referring to the Pentagon's code name for the Saudi operation. \"My parents are into that stuff.\" **********The PX selection of T-shirts, the preferred souvenirs for the soldiers, is vast. One shirt features an American flag and the words, \"These Colors Don't Run.\" Another describes the deployment of hundreds of thousands of American soldiers and sailors to Saudi Arabia as the \"U.S. Armed Forces Summer Tour.\" **********Soldiers here say often that, until and unless there is a fight with Iraq, their chief adversary is unrelenting boredom. **********The PX reports that among its fastest-selling items are tape players and radios. \"Anything electronic that can keep people entertained,\" Mr. Bouchard said. \"We just keep jamming these radios and boom boxes onto the shelves as fast as we can.\"  Romance by Cassette **********One customer, Specialist 4 Montegus Price, a 21-year-old soldier from Roanoke, Va., said he fills long hours of idle time by making romantic tape recordings for Cheryl, his girlfriend back home. **********\"Today I'm going to buy maybe three 90-minute tapes for her,\" he said, reaching for a handful of blank cassettes. \"I talk to her on the tapes and play some songs dedicated to her -- you know, soft music, love songs.\" **********Around the corner from the PX, in an adjoining warehouse, is one of the 12 regional military post offices set up by the Defense Department to handle the deluge of mail to American soldiers stationed here. **********At this post office alone, \"we're handling about 100,000 pounds of mail a day,\" said Larry Bullock, who in civilian life directs a vocational training center in Montgomery, Ala., but who, because of his enlistment in the National Guard, now finds himself as a sort of military postmaster for a large stretch of Saudi desert. **********\"Short of bullets flying, mail is the most important thing going on here,\" Mr. Bullock said.  Complaints About the Mail **********Unhappily for Mr. Bullock, his job may be one of the most thankless ones in the military. Soldiers complain incessantly that letters are lost or misplaced. **********\"It's tough,\" Mr. Bullock said of the complaints. \"They're all talking about the one piece of mail they're missing and I'm trying to talk about the hundreds of thousands of pieces of mail I have to deal with.\" A letter or parcel mailed in the United States will take an average of about two weeks to reach a soldier in the field, he said. **********Military postal workers also complain about their problems. For several weeks last summer, for example, soldiers tried to mail Saudi sand home as a souvenir. **********\"They just put it in an envelope, and the envelope would somehow open up and the sand was getting all over the place,\" said Sgt. Marvin Thomas, a 23-year-old National Guardsman from Selma, Ala. \"It was a mess.\" **********Pvt. Christa Barclay, a 22-year-old Army supply specialist, said as she stood in line to mail a package that she had heard rumors that part of the reason for the mail delays was the flood of letters sent from the United States marked \"Any Soldier.\"  Letters From Schoolchildren **********Many schools in the United States have encouraged students to write to \"Any Soldier,\" and the Pentagon also initially encouraged the letters. **********\"It's a nice idea, and we've got some people in our unit who don't have much family and don't get much mail,\" she said. **********But Private Barclay wondered whether a nice idea was getting out of hand. \"I answered one of the 'Any Soldier' letters from a school kid in Indiana, and the next thing I knew I heard back from kids in four different classes in the same school,\" she said. \"You write one letter and next thing you know you've got nine pounds of mail.\" **********\"You feel obligated to write back to all the kids who write you,\" she said. \"But it's impossible.

And they say Iraqi soldiers' morale is open to question. **********The most recent Pentagon estimates of casualties in a full-scale conflict with Iraq over several weeks indicate that American forces could suffer several thousand dead and many times more wounded, according to Bush Administration officials. **********These sobering figures come from Pentagon and intelligence-agency reviews of Iraq's military potential and its ability to respond to an attack. **********Iraqi forces are preparing the ground in Kuwait and southern Iraq to lure United States and allied attackers into killing zones of concentrated firepower. They are erecting multiple defensive barriers to make it difficult to sweep around their forward positions and attack their elite units. They are protecting their air forces from pre-emptive strikes by hiding planes in fortified bunkers, and they have shown the ability to augment Soviet-style armored attacks with unconventional tactics and weapons.  Iraq's Military: How Strong? **********As the brinkmanship between President Saddam Hussein and the American-led international coalition demanding his unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait becomes more tense, American analysts say the key to the Iraqi leader's strategy and perhaps his political survival rests with the million-member military establishment he has ruled with uneven success since coming to power in 1969. **********\"As a general statement, they are some of the Arab Middle East's best-educated troops,\" said Lieut. Col. Douglas V. Johnson 2d, co-author of a recently published study of the Iraqi Army for the Strategic Studies Institute of the Army War College. \"They are doctrinally inclined to fighting a set-piece battle, seeking to lure enemies into prearranged killing zones.\" **********Iraq now has the sixth-largest military force in the world, and with this week's call up of reserves, the total of men under arms could reach as high as 1.5 million, nearly 10 percent of the country's population of 16 million. **********The Iraqi military goes to the battlefield as a Soviet-equipped ground army whose fighting ability may be retarded by declining morale among the front-line infantry troops along the border with Saudi Arabia, half of whom are poorly paid reservists who can expect to bear the initial brunt of United States and allied firepower. **********Of the 430,000 troops Mr. Hussein has now fielded, about 230,000, organized in nine divisions of mixed Army and Republican Guard forces, are elite forces whose training, readiness and motivation approximates those of first-line American combat troops, according to Defense Department officials. **********Pentagon officials said the addition of 250,000 more Iraqi troops to Mr. Hussein's combat ranks in the war zone might only add to his burden of feeding and provisioning them as a result of the United Nations trade embargo.  New Chief of Staff Draws the Plan **********A major element of Mr. Saddam's plan fell into place this month when he installed a new armed forces chief of staff, Gen. Hussein Rashid al-Wendawi, who has been credited with dramatically reversing Iraq's fortunes during the eight-year war with Iran by combing flexible defenses with innovative offensive attacks. **********Under his leadership, Defense Department officials say, well-fortified Iraqi forces today are preparing to lure American and allied attackers into killing zones in Kuwait and southern Iraq where Baghdad's firepower is concentrated. **********Mr. Hussein's relationship with his officer corps has at times been stormy and marked by mutual distrust, frequent purges and centralized control. But the failure of Iraq's war strategy against Iran five years ago convinced the Iraqi leader to cede greater authority to his field commanders, whose initiative today may reflect a willingness to accept Mr. Hussein's interpretation of the Persian Gulf conflict as a struggle between Arab nationalism and foreign imperialism. **********Iraq's battle plan, like so many in the past, may not survive contact with the enemy. **********United States and allied forces will seek to exploit Iraqi weaknesses, American officials say, by relying heavily on United States air power, night combat ability, electronic warfare and superior battlefield intelligence to surprise, stun and then encircle Iraq's Army while avoiding its heavily defended sectors as much as possible to minimize casualties.  Tactics and Arms Are Unconventional **********In recent years, Iraqi commanders have improved their Soviet-style armored attacks with more unconventional tactics. Increasingly, they have also used unconventional weapons, like chemical warheads, fuel-air explosives and medium-range ballistic missiles to terrorize their enemies. Fuel-air explosives spread a highly concussive cloud of vapor. **********Mr. Hussein has also devoted billion of dollars to a domestic arms industry. **********\"The Iraqis are formidable in defense, but we must also remember that their experience is against masses of fanatical light infantry which had limited artillery or armor support and almost no air support,\" the authors of the Army War College study said in an unclassified summary, referring to the war against Iran. **********With an air force of about 600 modern aircraft, Iraq is the largest Arab air power, but it committed its aircraft sparingly and often ineffectively in combat during much of the war. Iraqi pilots were notorious for dropping their bombs blindly from 20,000 feet over Iranian cities to avoid air defenses. **********Still, Iraq's air commanders, equipped with some of the latest Soviet- and French-made fighters, scored some spectacular successes. On one mission in 1988, an Iraqi formation flew the length of the gulf to execute a surprise low-level bombing raid that resulted in the largest one-day toll of Iranian shipping of the war. **********The widely held view that the Iraqi Air Force will be taken off the board in the opening hours of any conflict has been questioned by senior United States Government analysts, who see Mr. Hussein as marshaling his air forces in protected bunkers and sending them aloft only to take advantage on any opportunity to surprise or pre-empt United States forces. **********\"I don't think they will lose all of their airplanes right away,\" a Government analyst said. \"They will hide in their armored shelters and we will have to keep hitting the air bases all the time.\" What Will Victory By the Allies Cost? **********Still, American military officials appear confident that they can defeat the Iraqi military. The question is at what cost. **********\"Very few people are predicting that they are capable of defeating the United States,\" said a United States Government specialist on Iraq who has been advising Defense Secretary Dick Cheney since the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. \"The key question is how much are they going to hurt you, and there are a lot of us who believe they could hurt us quite a lot.\" **********American military and intelligence analysts say Iraq is preparing for a war in which it will try to force United States and allied ground troops to fight their way through multiple defensive barriers before reaching 9 to 10 divisions of combined army and Republican Guard troops. **********These mobile forces represent the core of Iraqi military power, experts say, and Mr. Hussein will probably seek to protect them from an opening round of bombardment while drawing American ground forces deep into Kuwait and southern Iraq for what could develop as a final climactic battle. **********Iraq's military commanders understand from Western press reports that an attack will most likely be preceded by a huge bombing campaign followed by major allied ground forces attacks and amphibious landings by United States marines. American air superiority will be an key factor. Iraqis Emphasizing Defensive Barriers **********In response, the Iraqis are placing strong emphasis on static defense barriers to protect their infantry and armored divisions from air strikes. They have established forward depots well stocked with ammunition to sustain them for weeks of fighting. **********Iraq's combat engineering battalions, working with priority support from the high command, are more than eight weeks into one of the most extensive military excavation projects undertaken in desert warfare. They have erected berms, tank and artillery emplacements and dug anti-tank ditches along nearly 200 miles of border between Kuwait, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. **********The defensive line, which includes mine fields and fiery napalm traps, now extends westward beyond the Hafr el Batin area in Saudi Arabia, which is the kingdom's main military base and staging area. The extension of this modern-day Maginot Line, much like the one France built to prevent a direct German attack in World War II, will make it more difficult for United States and allied forces to sweep around Iraq's forward positions, because of the desert's expanses and poor terrain. **********Iraq's front-line forces are backed up by a formidable rear guard of mobile tank divisions. **********\"The Republican Guards are very clearly the key to the battle,\" said the specialist advising Mr. Cheney. \"You have to go to them, but first you have to break through the defenses, then you have to fight your way through the intermediate reserve before you even are ready to take them on.\" **********\"By then you are a long way from your supply bases,\" he said. \"They are clearly preparing for that kind of battle.\" **********\"Will this be enough to win? No, but they don't think that either. But they sure as hell can make us pay, and they hope they can outlast us. And after they tear us up, after we have 200,000 prisoners of war, how much will we be willing to continue?\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/27/business/ames-stores-files-for-bankruptcy.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1990-04-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 938, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ames Stores Files for Bankruptcy", "print_headline": "Ames Stores Files for Bankruptcy", "body_text": " **********Unable to recover from the setbacks it suffered after taking over the Zayre discount department stores in 1988, Ames Department Stores Inc. said yesterday that it had filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. **********Ames, the nation's fourth-largest discounter after the K Mart Corporation, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Stores Inc., said a sharp drop in sales in recent weeks had left it short of cash. Retail analysts said most of the drop had occurred at the nearly 400 Zayre stores. **********Ames, with 680 stores, all east of the Mississippi, was already experiencing an inventory shortage because many suppliers had balked at making new deliveries until they were paid for earlier ones. The company said that when it could not reach a new lending agreement with its banks, it decided that the most sensible next step was to seek creditor protection while it sought to reorganize itself. **********Late Wednesday Filing **********The actual bankruptcy filing took place late Wednesday in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, but it was not until yesterday morning that Ames, based in Rocky Hill, Conn., outside Hartford, disclosed that it had sought protection. **********''The Chapter 11 petition will give our suppliers the assurance they need to resume the steady flow of merchandise into our stores,'' said Peter B. Hollis, Ames's chief executive. **********Trading was halted on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday in Ames's stock, which rose 12.5 cents, to $1.50, on Wednesday. Last year, Ames traded at a high of $20 a share. **********Ames also said yesterday that Chemical Bank in New York had agreed to provide $250 million in interim financing. While the retailer did not say so explicitly, the indications were that Ames would use the money to get new merchandise and to meet expenses like payroll, rent and utilities. **********By meeting those daily obligations, the analysts said, Ames could continue operating all its stores while it began the arduous process of working with creditors to restructure its finances. **********''It will be business as usual,'' said a banker who has done business with Ames. ''They will pay their employees and open the registers.'' **********The Zayre troubles were also a big reason for Ames's announcement several weeks ago that it expected to report a loss of $228 million for the fiscal year that ended on Jan. 27. **********As retail experts told it yesterday, that announcement touched off a chain of events. First, Ames's lenders declared the retailer in default on certain debt covenants. Next, so-called retail factoring companies, which guarantee a merchant's payments, stopped extending credit to Ames. Finally, many suppliers stopped making shipments, fearful that they might not be paid. **********In fact, the bankruptcy will leave several well-known suppliers with unpaid bills. Among them are American Yard Products Inc., the big lawn-mower company, which is owed $7.6 million; the Thermos Company, owed $5.2 million; the Sara Lee Corporation, due $3.9 million; Rubbermaid Inc., owed $4.5 million, and the Gitano Group Inc., the sportswear maker, due $5.3 million. **********Gitano, based in New York, said it would reduce its first-quarter earnings by about 10 cents a share in anticipation that it would not be paid for the Ames shipments. **********But retailing experts said big changes loomed for Ames, which with $4 billion in sales was once regarded as one of the best-run retailers in America. **********Kurt Barnard, an industry consultant who also publishes a retailing newsletter from New York, predicted yesterday that Ames would seek to undo its October 1988 acquisition of Zayre. He said Ames might sell off hundreds of the Zayre stores and refocus on the Ames discount stores, which had been performing well. **********Mr. Barnard said that possible buyers for the Zayre stores included Target, a division of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, and Wal-Mart. **********''A Target might pick up a store here or a store there,'' he said. ''But a discount-department operation will not reach out and buy the whole cluster. It's too risky.'' **********Quick Sales Seen **********Howard Davidowitz, the chairman of Davidowitz & Associates, another New York-based retailing consultant, said Ames would move even more quickly than Mr. Barnard suggested. **********He said the company might close 200 to 300 stores with going-out-of-business sales. That would allow Ames, he said, ''to get out of bad stores and to have less funding requirements because they won't have to finance the inventory in these bad stores.'' **********Ames's troubles seem easily traced to its $778 million purchase of Zayre, its largest acquisition. Although the takeover appeared to be a good fit, because Zayre had a good name and excellent locations that had little overlap with Ames, the retail experts said Ames managed to make a weak chain even weaker by committing several strategic blunders. **********For example, Ames sharply reduced the number of weekly Zayre mail circulars to which shoppers were accustomed. Ames changed the name of the Zayre stores to Ames, even though Ames is not well known outside its New England base. Ames also redirected Zayre's merchandise toward basic apparel rather than the inexpensive but fashionable clothing that had always been a draw for Zayre customers. **********The results were disastrous. Under Ames, sales at individual Zayre stores fell by 15 percent last fall from a year ago."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/23/business/mutual-funds-cleaning-up-on-the-ground-floor.html": {"writer_name": "Carole Gould", "pub_date": "1990-09-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1041, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mutual Funds;   Cleaning Up on the Ground Floor", "print_headline": "Mutual Funds;   Cleaning Up on the Ground Floor", "body_text": " **********If Donna Dempsey Calder were to crack open a Chinese fortune cookie, the message would probably read, ''Get in on the ground floor.'' That's how she managed her career, and how, as manager of the $55 million Oppenheimer Discovery Fund, she picks her stocks. **********Ms. Calder, a rising star among fund managers, has built a spectacular record since 1986, when she took over the Discovery Fund, an aggressive growth fund investing mainly in small-company stocks. She beat Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by 2 to 8 percentage points from 1987 to 1989, no mean feat in a time when the volatile small-company sector mostly lagged the market. **********Things have soured a bit in 1990 - so far this year, the fund is down 13.8 percent while other small-company growth funds have declined 11.3 percent. But given the sector she manages, some slippage was inevitable. It has not tarnished her solid reputation. **********''It's too early to say that she's another Peter Lynch, but she's definitely on the short list,'' said Don Phillips, vice president of Morningstar Inc., Chicago-based mutual fund consultants, referring to the legendary, recently retired, Fidelity money manager. **********Although she usually keeps just 5 percent of her holdings in cash, her bearishness has pushed that up to 32 percent, making cash the largest single holding in her portfolio. She has not bought any stocks since June - she believes the market has not yet bottomed out - and has whittled down her holdings to two main groups: energy (20 percent) and biotechnology (14 percent.) Another big part of her portfolio - 25 percent - is in special situation stocks, which she thinks will shine because of unique circumstances. Her other holdings are a mix of stocks. **********From her paper-strewn office in the World Trade Center, the 39-year-old Ms. Calder also manages Oppenheimer's $300 million Time Fund, which invests mainly in large-capitalization growth stocks. In both, she looks for companies that are ''relatively undiscovered by Wall Street, that have a new product or niche, or a special franchise that lets them grow at double-digit rates.'' She often shops at initial public offerings. **********''I watch speculative demand surge and then wane; when it gets excessive, I try to get out of the way before the crash,'' she said. She likes to buy stocks with a price-earnings multiple equal to or less than three-quarters of a company's growth rate. **********The sector she finds most exciting is biotechnology. She said that investments made by the industry in the 1980's are now bearing fruit, and the economic downturn has not yet affected stock prices. She particularly likes Home Nutritional Services, a Parsippany, N.J.-based health-care company, which she expects will grow 30 percent annually over the next two to three years. She also likes the Chiron Corporation, of Emerysville, Calif., which develops diagnostic tests and vaccines. **********Her other big emphasis - energy - hurt the fund in early 1990, but it should help now. Favorites include McDermott International, in New Orleans, and Snyder Oil, in Fort Worth. **********In her ''special situation'' category, she likes the Adolph Coors Company. It had trouble bringing its beer to the Northeast last year, but has succeeded with its new, nationally marketed Keystone beer, Ms. Calder said. She predicts its stock price will rise to $30 in the next year from the low $20's now. **********Ms. Calder's road to Wall Street was anything but direct. She alternated college semesters with forays through Europe and the American West, graduating at the age of 24, with a degree in education, from the University of Vermont. Although she received job offers from several New York City private schools, the low salaries turned her toward Wall Street and she become a secretary to a money manager at Mitchell Hutchins, later acquired by Paine Webber. **********Her on-the-job training there led her to apply for a money manager's job at E.F. Hutton. Told she didn't have enough experience, she challenged Hutton to try her out - and it did. A year later, she moved to Oppenheimer and worked her way up from research assistant to portfolio manager. **********She consults with three outside technical analysts weekly, studies stock charts and analyzes trends. When the story is sweet but the charts are sour, she holds back. And she's not afraid to bail out. But she has had bad calls, such as Tandem Computer this year. ''I got blasted,'' she said. She held a big chunk of Tandem stock but did not foresee sharp earnings shortfalls. **********What will she do when the market turns? She plans to stick a strategy that has held her in good stead over the years: ''I try to identify groups or sectors that will do well over the next 18 months to two years, and then pick the best four or five companies in the group.'' **********AVOIDING THE 12b-1 PENALTY **********Tired of paying 12b-1 fees? Shop around. **********According to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., 41.1 percent of the money in mutual funds this summer was subject to 12b-1 fees. Those fees are skimmed off fund assets each year to pay for marketing expenses. **********Some fund categories are more likely than others to levy 12b-1 fees, so pick carefully. The taxable bond group, for example, has more assets subject to 12b-1 fees than other fund groups. That's because starting a fund - and building a 12b-1 fee into it - is easier than asking shareholders to approve new fees. And many of the new funds on the market are taxable bond funds, which are being sold by big brokerages, said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper. Big brokerages often rely on 12b-1 fees to pay brokers to push funds. **********Least likely to charge 12b-1 fees are tax-free bond funds. For years, they have been sold by independent mutual fund companies rather than by large brokerage firms."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/05/business/keating-creditors-in-accord.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 253, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Keating Creditors in Accord", "print_headline": "Keating Creditors in Accord", "body_text": " **********The Government announced today that it had reached an agreement with the major creditors of Charles H.

Consider the case of American Spirit Corporation of Beverly Hills, Calif. **********American Spirit is a tiny over-the-counter company that is affiliated with the American Spirit Foundation, a nonprofit organization whose stated goals include the commemoration of America's political heritage. **********The corporation's principal tangible assets are two original bronze monuments, weighing a total of nearly 30 tons, that commemorate the bicentennials of the United States Constitution and the American Presidency. It also owns the copyrighted etchings used to produce exact bronze replicas of the Constitution itself, suitable for mounting in schools and libraries. American Spirit, in short, is a company whose products conjure up phrases like ''We, the people'' and ''E pluribus unum.'' **********A more apt phrase for investors might be ''caveat emptor.'' According to audit reports on file at the Securities and Exchange Commission, this company - whose shares are quoted by brokers at $3.75 if you want to buy them and $3 if you try to sell - is so short of capital that its survival is in doubt. And its chief assets, those two bronze monuments, have been pledged as collateral for loans due at the end of this month. **********As S.E.C. documents go, the filings by American Spirit are in a class by themselves. The catalog of exhibits include cameo appearances by President Bush, who signed a letter last November endorsing the display of the bronze documents in schools; former President Reagan, who dedicated one of the company-owned monuments at a ceremony in 1987; and former Chief Justice Warren Burger, the chairman of the Commission on the Bicentennial of the Constitution, which has extended its official recognition to certain projects of the affiliated American Spirit Foundation. **********Among the leading players is Brett-Livingstone Strong, the Australian artist who created the plaques and statuary. (Mr. Strong is perhaps better known for his portrait of the performer Michael Jackson and his bust of John Wayne, chisled into a Malibu Beach boulder.) The company's chairman and largest shareholder is Jeffory Fairbrother, an Australian businessman. Over the last year, Mr. Fairbrother has been involved in a series of deals that left his new company with these new art works and him with four million restricted shares of the company's stock, for which he paid $800, or one-fiftieth of a cent per share. **********The corporate assets have already had a slice of stardom. A four-page bronze replicaof the Constitution rode on floats in the Rose Bowl Parade, the Liberty Day celebration in Philadelphia, and the P. T. Barnum Festival parade, reported Peter F. Paul, the president of the American Spirit Foundation. And the Constitution memorial was the centerpiece at the inaugural ball for Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia in January. **********The nonprofit foundation, Mr. Paul said, was formed in May 1989. Its relationship with the publicly traded corporation is a little vague: The company's S.E.C. filing shows that it pays for Mr. Paul's salary and the foundation's office space, while Mr. Paul described the company simply as ''one of our sponsors'' and ''the exclusive supplier'' of the bronze plaques that figure in one of the foundation's projects. **********On Friday, Mr. Fairbrother said the company's report to the S.E.C. was ''not exactly accurate. We make a nominal and regular contribution to the foundation,'' he said, ''but we don't pay directly any salaries. They are independent. There will be an amendment to that effect, in due course.'' **********The plaque project calls for the foundation to enlist donors whose tax-deductible contributions - $6,000 per Constitution - will be used to place these bronze replicas in schools and other public locations. Then the foundation will buy the plaques from the corporation for $4,000 per set, or about $2,300 more than the plaques cost the company to produce. Proceeds from plaque sales are envisioned as the company's chief source of revenue. **********Aside from plaque sales, the company's only other source of income is the sale of stock through the exercise of warrants, which Mr. Fairbrother said has produced ''at least $300,000'' in fresh cash from investors since the date of the S.E.C. report last March. Although plaque sales have been skimpy so far, great things are promised by Mr. Fairbrother in recent company news releases. **********Meanwhile, the company's assets, while carried on the books as of March 16 at $8 million, are obviously not very liquid. (It is true that other epic works by Mr. Strong have found buyers - his portrait of Michael Jackson was sold recently to a Japanese tycoon for $2.1 million. But Mr. Paul said the foundation has ''equitable'' rights that prevent the company from selling the bronzes to the highest bidder. The plan, he said, is for the foundation to find donors to buy the bronzes and donate them to the American people.) The company's obligations, however, appear pressing. It owes $850,000 to the National Australia Bank, secured by the Presidency monument, and an additional $110,000 to a Los Angeles lawyer named Jerome Wank, a company shareholder. That note is secured by the Monument to the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution. Both loans are due on July 31, and, as of the company's March report to the S.E.C., the company did not have the money to repay those loans. **********Mr. Fairbrother insists that the monuments are not at risk, however. Mr. Wank agreed on Thursday to extend his note, the chairman said, and the company is now negotiating with the bank. Besides, he said, ''These are magnificent works of art and there is no way that the bank or Mr. Wank would set about trying to collect on them.'' **********Accepting collateral that one would never dream of seizing to satisfy a unpaid debt would seem to defeat the purpose of having collateral at all. But Mr. Fairbrother is confident that these credit problems will soon be history. ''This is a wonderful project,'' he said. ''We've got great prospects.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/05/business/the-media-business-sound-becomes-the-new-frontier-for-tv-ads.html": {"writer_name": "Kim Foltz", "pub_date": "1990-02-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1024, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Sound Becomes the New Frontier for TV Ads", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;   Sound Becomes the New Frontier for TV Ads", "body_text": " **********A new Coca-Cola commercial probably has some television viewers thinking they are hearing things. At one point during the spot, chirping birds seemingly can be heard flying overhead while the wind whistles through the living room. **********The illusion in the Coke spot is created by a new three-dimensional stereophonic technology called Q-Sound, which makes recorded sounds seem to be coming from different parts of a room. Coke is the first to use it and is one of a growing number of advertisers relying on sound to make their commercials stand out. **********''Sound is the new creative frontier,'' said Paul Cappelli, a group creative director for McCann-Erickson Worldwide, which created the Coke spot. ''The visual part of commercials has reached its creative limits.'' **********Creative Innovations **********New sound technology is now being used to make creative innovations in commercials much the same way that advertising agencies made use of new videotaping and editing techniques developed for music videos in the early 1980's. **********Increasingly, commercials are using special effects created by computerized sound synthesizers, electronic musical scores and other sound enhancers. Some commercials have even made the sound the star -with not a single word from an announcer. **********''As consumers become increasingly sophisticated, it becomes harder to keep them entertained,'' said Gordon Bowen, a creative director at Ogilvy & Mather. ''Sound is the newest way to get them to pay attention.'' **********As a result, business is booming for sound production houses. There are now 200 production companies, most of which are in New York. About 10 years ago there were only several dozen. A sound specialist's handiwork can cost as little as $1,500 for a simple treatment or more than $25,000 for elaborate effects. And for new techniques like Q-Sound, experts say the price will be even higher. Ahead of Its Time?  But Q-Sound may be ahead of its time. The impact of the new Coke commercial was limited because the effect of 3-D sound can only be heard by people with stereo televisions; only 19 percent of American households have such sets. **********Q-Sound, which was developed by Canadian-based Archer Communicaions Inc., is a computerized sound-mixing process in which the voices, instruments and other elements of a recording are separated and then programmed to be heard from various locations. **********For example, the roar of a jet can be made to sound as if it is coming from above the listener and the babble of a brook as if it is at his feet. **********Like regular stereo, 3-D sound has its limitations. To get the desired effect, the listener must be sitting directly in front of the speakers. Nonetheless, Mr. Cappelli said, the agency intends to use Q-Sound in more commercials. **********Virtually Limitless Uses **********In contrast, the use of synthesized sound is virtually limitless. By using a computerized synthesizer, a sound engineer can recreate thousands of sounds, from the blare of a trumpet to the crash of two cars colliding. **********Synthesized sound has become commonplace in commercials during the last few years. ''You don't have to send out for the real sounds of the instruments or the voices you need,'' said John Silverman, president of J.S.M. Music, a production company. ''The computer has a library of thousands of sounds.'' **********The process is also less expensive than hiring musicians, and a musical score can be quickly changed. ''I was recently in the middle of finishing a sound track when the agency called and changed everything,'' said Don Piestrup, who heads Piece of Cake, a music production company. ''Within 20 minutes, I'd completely changed the sound track.'' **********Synthesizers have enabled advertising agencies to create commercials with startling effects. A spot for Goodyear Auto Services, for example, featured a series of quick shots of people having car trouble, accompanied by a raucous chorus of anvils, bells, drums and even the pneumatic wrench used by auto mechanics. **********The intensity of the sounds was multiplied by the synthesizer so that even though it was not any louder than the usual commercial, it would startle an unsuspecting audience. **********In another spot, for Levi Strauss, synthesized human voices were used like a musical score. Michael Montes, a sound engineer at J.S.M. Music, used a computer to slow the voices down, speed them up and stretch words out to impossible lengths as they sang the praises of jeans. **********Sound as the Focal Point **********In some recent commercials, the sound has been the focal point. A recent spot for Volvo, for example, zeroed in on the eerie synthesized version of the sound the car made as it sped along the highway. **********''You can only catch people's attention by creating something their ears aren't accustomed to,'' said Jeanne Neary, a partner at Look & Company, a sound production house. **********For all its flexiblity, the sound of computer-generated musical instruments can not match the quality of the real thing. So some sound specialists are adding real instruments to synthesized scores. **********''The actual sound of a violin or a saxophone is the only way to get the right emotional impact from music,'' said Scott Elias, the founder of Elias Associates, a production company. **********A Silent Commercial **********Someone, of course, always goes against the trend. For example, Bartle, Bogle, Hegarty, a London advertising agency, decided that less sound equals more impact. It recently created a commercial for a Sony compact disk player in which the only sound is the ring of a doorbell. **********In it, a man on a bare white set performs a pantomime. Soon after his imaginary girlfiend arrives at his apartment, they begin to dance and then romance. The imaginary girlfriend finally pulls the man off into the bedroom. **********''It's meant to be odd - to make people stop, look and try to listen,'' said Oliver Lewis-Barclay, an account executive at the agency."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/13/business/banks-given-order-by-us.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-02-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 212, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Banks Given Order by U.S.", "print_headline": "Banks Given Order by U.S.", "body_text": " **********A top Federal regulator ordered commercial bank officers today to correct promptly ''a significant number of fundamental deficiencies'' in their real estate lending operations. **********The Comptroller of the Currency, Robert L.

Now, like many other Armenians and Armenian-Americans here, he was showing his helplessness and frustration after scores of his countrymen were reported killed last week in a dispute with Soviet Azerbaijanis. **********''I am always calling but always it is busy, busy,'' he said. ''I am ready to help any way I can and if necessary of course I'll go.'' **********Word of Pogroms **********Mr. Nagapityan was discussing the news from home with other Armenians gathered around the counter at Taslakian's pastry shop, one of a cluster of Armenian shops and offices here. **********Hollywood and nearby Glendale have become the fastest-growing Armenian communities in the country, fed by immigration from the Soviet Union. Altogether, more than 200,000 Armenians are believed to live in the Los Angeles area, the greatest concentration outside Soviet Armenia. **********Other major centers are Fresno, in central California, and Watertown, Mass., as well as dozens of other communities scattered across the country. **********In all of them, said Garen Yegparian, a leader of the Armenian National Committee, a sense of desperation and helplessness has grown since the Soviet Government reported last week that anti-Armenian pogroms in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, and clashes elsewhere in Azerbaijan had claimed scores of lives. **********A People in Danger **********The subsequent Soviet crackdown to restore order, in which scores of Azerbaijanis have been killed, has not eased the Armenians' fear that their people and nation are in danger. **********''I'm telling you, it's perceived as a matter of national collective survival,'' Mr. Yegparian said. ''We are facing the most important moment since 1915.'' **********It is a sentiment echoed by many Armenians here, including a leading historian, Richard G. Hovannisian, professor of Near Eastern and Armenian history at the University of California, Los Angeles. **********For the past two years ethnic violence has troubled Azerbaijan, which borders the republic of Armenia. Thousands of Armenians have recently been evacuated from Azerbaijan, fueling a sense here that Armenians are being progressively driven from their homes. Medicine or Guns?

It's awful.'' **********Both he and Mr. Yegparian said there was talk among young men of going to join the fight but little sign here that such talk might be turning serious. **********First the Quake, Now This **********They said, however, that an Armenian organization in France had sent word that a group of men were leaving this week to join the fight. **********Armenians are already involved in relief efforts as a result of the 1988 earthquake, which left as many as a half million people homeless.

Grushevoy rang doorbells, begging surprised, suspicious people at their partly open doorways to ask him questions about the truth. **********''I've come to tell the truth, comrades,'' he said, frantically trying to protect his reputation from the handbills' allegations of Nazism, and to shield his insurgent's campaign from defeat at the hands of the local Communist Party. **********For all the Soviet political dissidents' pain and struggle, this Election Day was encouraging for them in making clear the party's deepening desperation in its attempt to stay alive and dominant. **********Fears of Trickery **********In the Byelorussian republic, run by perhaps the most resistant and formidable party machine, voters could witness fledgling, stunted democracy forcing a perversely encouraging phenomenon into Soviet politics: the opposition was putting poll watchers on guard in large numbers against widely held fears of vote corruption by the government itself. **********''We expect the party is resorting to widespread fraud,'' said Zyanon Paznyak, a leader of the insurgent Popular Front of Byelorussia, who likened the party to a cornered animal thrashing dangerously. **********''These fights can only make us stronger,'' he said, accusing the provincial police and others of trying to interfere with the poll watchers. But he said they were determined to witness any shaved totals, invented voters, even ballots cast from the graveyard - the nefarious stuff of established democracies that heretofore had been unnecessary in the 98-percent landslides of the party's old monopoly victories. **********'The Power of Words' **********''We are just learning what democracy is,'' said Mikhail Tkachev, a candidate and deputy chairman of the Popular Front. ''We are fighting for it against a bare-faced 'partocracy,' and believe me, it is not easy. But we are doing it without bloodshed. We believe in the power of words.'' **********As voters went to the ballot box across the Slavic heart of the nation in the Ukraine and Russian republics as well as here, no Communist Party was putting up a more head-on fight, declining to pander to or flirt with the opposition as in other regions. In the last two months the bosses of the Byelorussian machine used every rule and more in the party-scripted official election law to try to keep serious challengers from the voting lists. **********For weeks, patronage loyalists in government jobs repeatedly ruled opposition candidates in violation for the size of their crowds, the form of their nominations, the provenance of their pamphlets. Dozens of volunteers distributing opposition platforms were arrested. **********Moves and Countermoves **********But the opposition was only more emboldened. The Popular Front, denied republic registration to print its own pamphlets, trucked in anti-party tracts printed in the more sympathetic Baltic republics. Imaginative young nationalists wheeled a funeral urn right up to the government center as a convenience into which loyalists were invited to face the future and ''throw away your party cards.'' **********The party finally reacted to such stings by having its stalwarts in the republic parliament pass an outright ban, two days after the ballots were set, on voters' selecting any candidates of the most challenging insurgent groups running under the banners of the Popular Front, the Society for the Byelorussian Language and the Ecological Union. **********At this, the public rebelled and demonstrated peacefully a week ago, even spontaneously seizing broadcast time on the party-controlled television station to accuse the party of gross abuse of the democratic process. The party finally retracted the ban after the opposition prepared to complain directly to the United Nations. **********'The Big Cheeses Must Hide' **********''Now the big cheeses must hide in the farthest boondocks,'' exulted Valery Saveklov, a worker at the Popular Front, referring to the fact that the republic's embattled party chief, Yefrem Sokolov, and others have shied from a city candidacy to run for the parliament in an obscure, supposedly safer rural district. The government gave two new tractors to the local farm collective, but the insurgents were saying the bribery was no match for their corps of poll watchers dispatched to the village for the occasion. **********Ivan I. Lipsky came into the front's headquarters Friday night with a black eye, a swollen nose and a big smile, certain that the thugs who had set upon him as he campaigned were emissaries from a desperate party apparat. **********''The party has ignored all the laws about fairness and packed the press with lies,'' he said, describing the insurgents' handicaps. ''All the party people in my neighborhood were given a day off to deliver pamphlets while the rest of us had to work. You cannot have true pluralism until we have a fair election law.'' **********A Legacy From Chernobyl **********The party has denied the charges of pervasive fraud and claimed its practices were fair and according to law -a law dictated by the party through the Communist-dominated republic parliament, the 360-member chamber the insurgents are challenging in today's vote. **********''Only people with strong nerves, the fighters, made it this far,'' said Pyotr v. Sadovsky, a candidate, Popular Front leader and author of some of the most articulate demands aroused by the Byelorussian public's escalating fears about the Chernobyl nuclear plant explosion four years ago. **********Most of the radiation clouds drifted onto Byelorussian farm communities, and the villages are still being haphazardly evacuated, residents complain, by an all too secretive Government. **********''A year from now we will have caught up with the democratic progress of the Baltics,'' Mr. Paznyak contended, noting that the popular front was less than a year old and was proscribed by the government, yet was giving the party a fight in which, by some estimates, insurgent candidates might take half the seats in the parliament. **********An Insurgent Agenda **********Mr. Paznyak looked ahead to an insurgent parliamentary agenda that will include the thorough disestablishment of the party from government, a move to a market economy rather than the dictated plan of the national government, and the first steps toward an economic confederation of like-minded reform governments that insurgents say will sooner or later come to power in the Soviet Baltics and the Ukraine. **********Such plans seemed well beyond the tenement horizon as Mr. Grushevoy anxiously rang voters' doorbells to respond to the handbill that smeared him as a Nazi sympathizer. Listeners at the doorways soon were agreeing that he was the victim of another ham-handed Communist tactic. **********''Seventy years of Communism and we're still standing on our knees,'' one pensioner boomed out as other apartment dwellers watched more silently, unused to such uninhibited cries of foul on a Communist election day."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/04/business/reuters-seeks-stock-buyback.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 220, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reuters Seeks Stock Buyback", "print_headline": "Reuters Seeks Stock Buyback", "body_text": " **********Reuters Holdings P.L.C., the British information services company, said on Monday that it would seek shareholder approval to buy back up to 10 percent of its stock and increase its borrowing power. **********Reuters said shareholders will vote on the proposals at a special meeting to be held immediately after the annual shareholders meeting April 26. **********The company said the approval to buy up to 10 percent of its stock will expire at the 1991 annual shareholders meeting.

The opening this month of the Congress's regional branch here attracted up to 50,000 people. **********The roadside tables in the membership drive are usually set up on weekends and at the end of the month, when those with jobs have just been paid. Recruiters have also gone door to door. **********But many people say they cannot afford the Congress's modest annual membership fee of 12 rand, or about $4.75. Port Elizabeth and the surrounding area suffer from an unemployment rate believed to exceed 50 percent, partly because Ford and General Motors shut down their automobile assembly plants in response to overseas pressure to disinvest.  Congress's Competitors **********The African National Congress also found itself competing around Port Elizabeth with the more militant Pan-Africanist Congress and with the Labor Party, whose leader, the Rev. Allan Hendrickse, lives in nearby Uitenhage. **********\"People are resenting the Labour Party,\" said Mr. Xhego. He discounted the Labour Party's appeal because of its participation in the segregated Parliament. The Pan-Africanist Congress, formed in 1959 by breakaway A.N.C. members, claims to have more support than the African National Congress. Bloody fighting between adherents of the rival organizations broke out around Uitenhage last February. **********The African National Congress has encountered the biggest resistance in rural areas of the Eastern Cape, not just from white farmers but also from intimidated black farm workers. **********\"It's very difficult to reach the farms because the farm worker will tell you that if the master knows he is in the movement, he will lose everything -- his house, his school, everything,\" Mr. Xhego said. **********\"We need to convince those farmworkers it is not criminal to join the A.N.C.,\" he said. \"In fact, it is their right.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/08/world/china-sees-taiwan-instability.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-03-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 399, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China Sees Taiwan Instability", "print_headline": "China Sees Taiwan Instability", "body_text": " **********China expressed deep concern tonight over political battles in Taiwan that are taking place in advance of the presidential election there later this month, and strongly condemned the governing Nationalist Party for ''creating political and social instability.'' **********The Chinese statement, attributed to ''an authoritative source in Beijing'' and distributed by the official New China News Agency, seemed to display indignance and bewilderment about the furor in Taiwan in recent days. **********Taiwan's National Assembly is scheduled to choose a president on March 21, and until recently it was all but a foregone conclusion that the incumbent, Lee Teng-hui, would be re-elected. But politics in Taiwan have been thrown into an uproar by the unexpected candidacy of a rival ticket backed by some elderly officials who are suspicious of Mr. Lee's program of rapid change and of his identity as a native Taiwanese with few links to the Chinese mainland. **********While President Lee has 80 percent approval ratings in public opinion polls, it is the 752-seat National Assembly that will choose the president and vice president.

On the other side is an unlikely combination of consumer groups, big businesses and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. **********The Bell companies say that Japan, France and even Singapore may have telephone systems as good as or better than those in the United States by the mid-1990's unless state and Federal regulators give them more incentive to invest in new fiber-optic cable and digital switches that transmit voice, computer data and images faster and more cheaply than existing copper cables and analog switches. **********They want state public service commissions to let them include in their rate bases the cost of early replacement of older equipment. And they want Congress to reverse a court-ordered bar on their entry into telephone equipment manufacturing, as well as into information services like electronic shopping and cable television programming, which will insure adequate demand for the new technologies installed. **********Big Public Relations Campaign **********''If you like being No. 2, you'll love America's telecommunications policy,'' reads one of the large advertisements placed by the Bell companies in newspapers and magazines. The ads are part of a $21 million public relations campaign on the subject. **********Consumer groups dispute these assertions, and estimate that accelerated investment could add as much as $11 to monthly telephone bills within a dozen years. A.T.&T. is vigorously opposing any relaxation of rules that now bar the Bell companies from manufacturing telephone-system equipment, one of its biggest businesses. **********And 14 large corporate users of telephone services, including the International Business Machines Corporation, have accused the Bell companies of exaggerating the threat to competitiveness. **********Federal regulators and members of Congress have expressed concern over whether investment in the telephone system is adequate to prevent an erosion of the competitiveness of American goods. Advocates of more investment in fiber optics and digital switches say these are essential to bringing high-quality facsimile machines, faster computer communications and video telephone service into American businesses and homes. **********For example, the Sharp Corporation may sell its recently announced color facsimile machines only in Japan, partly out of concern that too few American businesses will have the especially advanced type of high-speed digital telephone lines to handle efficiently the high volume of data needed, said Joseph F. Cosgrove, Sharp's national facsimile marketing director. **********F.C.C. Conference **********Alfred C. Sikes, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, convened a conference Wednesday and yesterday to review the technological development of the nation's telephone system. It was attended by the heads of most of the nation's state regulatory agencies. No broad policy initiative was announced or agreed upon. **********The Senate Subcommittee on Communications held hearings Wednesday on the health of the nation's telephone system, as it began consideration of a bill to allow the Bell companies to develop and manufacture telephone equipment. The House Subcommittee on Telecommunications is reviewing slightly broader legislation. **********Spending Elsewhere Cited **********To bolster their case, the Bell companies point to heavy spending by other nations on their telephone systems. **********But some industry and Government experts say that extra spending in the United States would be expensive and unnecessary because local telephone companies are already making digitally switched, fiber-optic telephone lines available as fast as their customers demand it. **********Some Government officials also suggest that advocates of regulatory change may be exaggerating the immediate threat to American competitiveness to stampede the Government into action. ''Those who believe the policies are bad might have a reason to manufacture a crisis,'' Mr. Sikes said in an interview. **********The United States still has the world's best telephone service, Mr. Sikes said, adding that any erosion of its lead was not significant so far. But he added that there were grounds for concern that the nation was developing two forms of telephone service, as large corporations install the latest technology while smaller businesses and individuals continue to rely on a public access network that receives limited investment. **********Rise in Investment Urged **********Mr. Sikes said that since the beginning of the year he had called in the chief executives of each of the seven ''Baby Bells'' to encourage more research and investment. Annual investment in local telephone exchanges stagnated in the 1980's at about $20 billion, according to the United States Telephone Association, an industry group in Washington. But over the same period, local telephone companies' revenues rose 55.9 percent, to $91.7 billion last year. **********Even among some Baby Bell executives, some question exists over the extent to which loosened regulation would stimulate investment in the public access network. Richard K. Snelling, the executive vice president responsible for the network of Southern Bell, which provides nearly a tenth of the nation's local phone service, said that regulatory changes would be unlikely to prompt substantial changes in his company's plans to install fiber-optic cables and other high-technology equipment. **********He said Southern Bell would install fiber-optic cable regardless of regulatory changes because it was now as cheap as copper cable and getting cheaper.

A Congressional critic of United States policy in El Salvador and officials of the Bush Administration said today that American pressure was partly responsible for that announcement. **********Administration officials said they kept pressure on El Salvador to investigate the killings in part to forestall efforts by Democrats in Congress, who want to halt American aid to the Salvadoran military, which has long been tied to human rights abuses. **********Obstacles to Prosecution **********The White House officials also said they genuinely wanted those responsible brought to justice, but diplomats and lawyers in San Salvador said today that there would be many obstacles to a successful prosecution. [Page A10.]  A housekeeper and her daughter were also killed in the attack, which came six days before Congress adjourned. Legislators expressed deep outrage at the time, and there were unsuccessful attempts in the Senate and the House to restrict aid. **********Many legislators expressed concern that the killings were ''most likely carried out with American-supplied weapons,'' in the words of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York. **********Representative Joe Moakley, Democrat of Massachusetts, who leads a committee investigating the killings, said in an interview today that he was ''very happy about the announcement'' by Mr. Cristiani because it suggested that the Salvadoran Government was making a diligent investigation. The Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, appointed the committee. **********Mr. Cristiani ''knows that Congress is serious about reviewing American aid if these killings are not solved, with the right people indicted and sentenced,'' Mr. Moakley said. ''Many people will make up their minds on further aid to El Salvador based on the way this case is handled.'' **********Mr. Moakley, who is chairman of the House Rules Committee, has been a critic of American policy in El Salvador for a decade. He said that Mr. Cristiani was ''cooperating fully'' with Congressional efforts to monitor the investigation. **********''The Speaker's involvement put additional pressure on El Salvador,'' Mr. Moakley said.  Closer Review Called Necessary With most members of Congress out of town, it is difficult to determine whether Mr. Cristiani's announcement will stave off new Congressional restrictions on American aid. While pleased with the investigation so far, members of Congress said they needed to review the inquiry more closely before deciding whether to restrict aid. **********The Bush Administration said today that Mr. Cristiani showed ''great courage'' in declaring that military men were responsible for killing the priests. Mr. Cristiani is the leader of a rightist alliance that has been accused of backing paramilitary death squads. **********Administration officials said the vigor of the official Salvadoran investigation showed that there was no reason for the United States to reduce or restrict aid to El Salvador, as some Democratic members of Congress have demanded. **********Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said the Administration hoped that the future of American aid ''would not be linked'' to the investigation. **********''While identifying these alleged individuals is a decisive and necessary first step, the Salvadoran Government must now take actions to prosecute'' those responsible for the crime, Miss Tutwiler said. ''I have no reason to believe'' that El Salvador will not fully investigate the ''horrendous murder'' of the priests, she said. **********'Salutary,' Rights Group Says **********Americas Watch, a human rights group, said, ''The Cristiani Government's admission of military involvement is an important and salutary development.'' But noting that there have been no indictments or arrests, the group said the Bush Administration must ''maintain sufficient pressure to see that all those responsible are tried and punished.'' **********Miss Tutwiler said she did not know the rank of the Salvadoran soldiers suspected in the killings. **********Mr. Moakley said his independent inquiry strongly suggested that ''the responsibility goes extremely high'' in the Salvadoran armed forces. **********The Federal Bureau of Investigation is providing laboratory services to the Salvadoran Government to help with the inquiry. F.B.I. officials declined today to give details of the bureau's help. Mr. Cristiani asked for such help in a letter sent to President Bush on Nov. 19. **********El Salvador received $298 million in economic aid and $80 million in military assistance from the United States last year. In the last eight years, Washington has provided more than $3.2 billion of aid to El Salvador, about $1 billion in military equipment. The Government has been fighting a civil war against leftist rebels for more than a decade, and the priests' killings came during a rebel offensive in the capital. A strict curfew was in place at the time, during which only the military was allowed to move freely. #47 Are Confined to Base Just after the killings, the Bush Administration adamantly opposed Congressional efforts to curtail aid to El Salvador, even though it now appears that such efforts were partly responsible for the Salvadoran Government's professed commitment to investigate. **********Members of the elite Atlacatl battalion are among those suspected of being involved in the killings. Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in El Salvador, said on Sunday that 47 members of the battalion were being confined to their base even though they had not been arrested or formally charged. **********Many members of the battalion have been trained by the United States. But an American official said, ''Just about every battalion in El Salvador has received U.S. training of one type or another.'' **********Anne Manuel, the research director of Americas Watch, said the Atlacatl battalion was implicated in the 1981 massacre of more than 700 peasants in the Salvadoran province of Morazan. It has also been accused in the killings of at least 68 people in Cabanas province in 1984 and the massacre of at least 50 in Chalatenango province in 1984. **********Its record cast doubt on ''the theory promoted by successive U.S. administrations that U.S. training brings about improved human rights behavior,'' she said. **********Without naming those responsible for killing the priests in November, Miss Tutwiler said, ''We are pleased that the Salvadorans have made this important breakthrough in identifying alleged perpetrators of the despicable slayings of the Jesuit fathers.'' **********Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said the White House had no independent information about who carried out the slayings. **********''Cristiani has shown great courage,'' he said. ''We asked that the investigation be thorough and the prosecution move ahead, and it looks like that's the course he is on. He deserves a lot of credit.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/31/business/company-briefs-821590.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 287, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Amersham International P.L.C., a British health-care and medical research group, said it would pay no more than $45.85 million for Media-Physics Inc., the radio-pharmaceuticals subsidiary of Hoffman-La Roche Inc., instead of the previously agreed $61 million. *********** Anheuser-Busch Inc., St. Louis, said it would discontinue its LA beer brand. *********** Bridge Oil Ltd., Sydney, Australia, said it would buy oil and gas reserves in Texas from USX Corp.'s TXO Production unit for $159 million. *********** Kollmorgen Corp., Simsbury, Conn., a maker of electrical machinery, said a Connecticut Superior Court judge had denied a petition by Venitron Corp., a maker of direct current motors, to restrict Kollmorgen's recent sale of a series of preferred stock to investors led by Tinicum Inc. *********** Martech USA Inc., Anchorage, a provider of environmental services, signed a contract with Hungary's Ministry of Environmental Protection to remove hazardous waste from 60 abandoned military bases in Hungary.

Shinn. **********The appointment of Mr. Donaldson, whose selection had been expected on Wall Street, comes as the exchange is being challenged on many fronts as the central arena for trading shares in American companies. Although it has lost volume to regional exchanges, to overseas markets and to new products traded on the nation's futures exhanges, it remains the world's largest exchange. **********Series of Challenges **********In a news conference, Mr. Donaldson said his biggest challenges will be meeting international competition and ''restoring public confidence'' to an exchange where trading is perceived to have become increasingly volatile since the October 1987 crash. **********''We are in an extremely competitive marketplace,'' Mr. Donaldson said. ''That competition never rests, and opportunities for improvement are never exhausted.'' He added that as capitalism spreads, the exchange must ''explore the boundaries'' of competition and must keep abreast of technological innovations to make trading more efficient. **********The selection of Mr. Donaldson, who is 59 years old, brings to the exchange a man with broad experience. After graduating from Harvard Business School, he and two classmates founded Donaldson, Lufkin in 1959.

''They may have to be more competitive.'' **********Arthur Levitt, former chairman of the American Stock Exchange, said he suspected that the selection of Mr. Donaldson means that ''having a voice in Washington and in the financial community is the exchange's most important priority right now.'' **********Mr. Levitt added that one ''serious problem'' facing Mr. Donaldson will be dealing with the ''pressures being brought to bear on the specialist system,'' which is the heart of the exchange's trading process. The specialists, who trade securities on the exchange floor, are often strained for capital at times of heavy volume. Their jobs are being threatened by computerized trading systems used in the over-the-counter and other markets. **********Issue of Program Trading **********In other issues, Mr. Donaldson declined to take a position on program trading, which some blame for increased market volatility, saying that he needed to research the subject. Still, he said market volatility was ''of great concern'' to him. **********Mr. Donaldson also is credited with participating in a transformation of the capital structure of the financial-services industry. In 1969, Donaldson, Lufkin was the first firm to go public, a trend that others followed to help bring fresh pools of money to support Wall Street firms. **********Mr. Grasso, 44, has had a two-decade career within the exchange, and recently has been instrumental in introducing more automation to the exchange floor.

The desire to leave has spread through all layers of Soviet society, as more and more people seek ways to escape a country that they believe can no longer protect them from food shortages, anti-Semitism and other problems. **********''Many people want to leave this country now because of the economic situation, the difficulties of life,'' said Galina I. Bashayeva, 20, a student at the Foreign Languages Institute in Moscow. **********They Want Love (but in the U.S.) **********Miss Bashayeva and other clients of the venture, called American-Russian Matchmaking, do say they are looking for love. **********''Like every Jew in the Soviet Union, I want to emigrate,'' said Svetlana L. Gartman, 23, who said she was rejected for postgraduate study at a Moscow institute last year because she is Jewish. **********Miss Gartman described her anxieties about rising anti-Semitism during a break in a video session in a shady park by Moscow's famed, and faded, Bolshoi Theater. **********Clients of American-Russian Matchmaking took turns strolling past the park's fountain and purple pansy beds, while Jacob Cantor recorded their moves with his video camera. **********Mr. Cantor was born in the Soviet Union but left with his family 17 years ago when he was 2. His father, Gene, is the American partner in the matchmaking firm. **********More Women Clients Than Men **********Gene Cantor said he hopes to start making matches for Miss Gartman and perhaps 700 other Soviet citizens when he returns to Los Angeles this week, laden with photographs, videotapes and biographies of his new clients - three-quarters of whom are women. **********Mr. Cantor plans to open a matchmaking bureau in California to advertise his Soviet clients and set up initial mail contacts with interested single Americans. **********American-Russian Matchmaking will also arrange tours for any Americans who want to meet their Soviet pen pals. These tours, complete with ''candlelight and chandelier dinners'' in the Soviet Union, would be the source of any profits the service might make. **********Escape From Ethnic Violence **********The firm's marketing plan reflects some hard-nosed business sense. Besides Moscow and Leningrad, the country's two biggest cities, American-Russian Matchmaking's partners in the Soviet Union have placed advertisements in hot spots like Armenia, where tens of thousands of refugees from ethnic violence are looking for a new life. **********Ads were also placed in Lithuania, where many Russian residents began searching for a way to get out after the Parliament declared independence on March 11. **********Gene Cantor said he does not expect many people to emigrate through his matchmaking service. Americans may be drawn to the service by curiosity, but the huge geographic and cultural gaps are likely to limit the number who actually propose marriage. **********Among those most likely to wed one of his Soviet clients, Mr. Kantor said, would be Jewish emigres to the United States. **********''They feel a lot of cultural deficiencies in America,'' he said. ''They are kind of nostalgic. It would be nice to meet a girl from the old country.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/15/business/mutual-funds-variations-on-the-index-game.html": {"writer_name": "Carole Gould", "pub_date": "1990-07-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1043, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mutual Funds;   Variations on the Index Game", "print_headline": "Mutual Funds;   Variations on the Index Game", "body_text": " **********With all the brouhaha about index funds these days, something important is slipping by. Tracking Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is not the only way to go - or perhaps the best. **********There are two other smart ways that investors can index their portfolios: they can bet on small-company or international stocks. Although the choice of index funds specializing in these areas is rather limited - there are only about a handful on the market - there are at least four new ones in the works, according to Wayne S. Huff, an associate with Charles E. Simon & Company, a Washington-based research firm. **********One reason they look so good is that the S.&P. 500 is likely to give up its position as the best-performing index in the next five years, analysts say. Joe Mansueto, president of Morningstar Inc., a Chicago-based mutual fund consulting firm, predicted that the Wilshire 4500 or the Russell 2000 will take the top spot. Investors who agree can get into funds that mimic those indexes. **********The plain-vanilla S.&P. 500 index funds already have lost much of their luster. The stocks in the S.&P. 500 had a spectacular run-up during the 1980's, but times have changed. Pension money is moving into small-company stocks because they are relatively inexpensive, and the ''junk bond'' market that financed corporate buyouts - and helped send big-company stock prices heavenward - has collapsed. **********Small-company stocks turned in a dazzling performance for the first half of the year. These long-neglected cousins of the S.&P. 500 are coming into their own after lagging the market for seven years, market observers say, and index fund investors can tag along for the ride. **********There are three small-stock index funds to watch. Vanguard's $184 million Extended Market Portfolio, which tracks the Wilshire 4500 Index, includes more small-company stocks than the funds that track the S.&P. 500. Financial stocks, mainly small- and medium-sized banks, make up 22 percent of its portfolio, versus only 9 percent for the S.&P. 500; 7 percent is invested in energy stocks, versus 13 percent for the S.&P. 500. **********Unlike most Vanguard funds, this one carries a one-time, 1 percent upfront charge to defray higher transaction costs stemming from trading requirements in the over-the-counter market, said Brian S. Mattes, a spokesman. **********As for performance, the past 12 months have been a period with market averages all over the lot. The fund rose 4.4 percent for the year ended June 30, according to Morningstar. Meanwhile, two traditional measures of small-company performance moved in opposite directions. The Nasdaq index rose 6.2 percent for the year ended June 30; the Value Line index dropped 5.4 percent. **********Vanguard's $47 million Small Capitalization Fund tracks the Russell 2000, which includes more small-company stocks than the Wilshire 4500. The average market capitalization of the Russell stocks is $170 million, versus $1 billion for the Wilshire 4500, and the fund's portfolio focuses more heavily on the technology and consumer discretionary sectors. So the fund, with a 1 percent one-time upfront charge, is a more pure small-company play - and thus more volatile. It was up 1 percent for the year ended June 30. **********The most expensive of these three funds is Colonial's Small Stock Index Fund, which tracks the smallest 20 percent of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and has a 4.75 percent upfront charge. It rose just three-tenths of a percent for the year ended June 30.  One reason expenses are so critical with index funds is that they create tracking errors that can cause a fund to underperform the index it is supposed to duplicate. With the Vanguard funds, for example, expense ratios - the gauge of those expenses - are razor thin, which lets those funds track the indexes very closely. **********On the international side, there are several index funds worth considering. Colonial's International Equity Index Fund, which has a hefty 4.75 percent upfront sales charge, weights its portfolio by the gross national product of each country in the Morgan Stanley Capital International E.A.F.E. index. As a result, the Japanese portion of Colonial's portfolio is lower and the European portion is higher. The fund rose 15.8 percent for the year ended June 30, versus a 19.2 percent rise in all international stock funds. **********Vanguard's International Equity Index Fund, which began investing just last month, has garnered $70 million in assets in ''one of the most successful new fund launches that we've ever had,'' Mr. Mattes said. It has two portfolios that investors can buy separately. **********Its $53 million European Portfolio tracks the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe Index, made up of about 600 companies in 13 countries; about two-thirds of the portfolio is invested in Britain, West Germany and France. The Pacific Portfolio mimics the Morgan Stanley Capital International Pacific Index, with tracks stocks mainly from Japan (91 percent of its weighting) and Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore. **********THE 12B-1 DISADVANTAGE **********The 12b-1 fees levied by mutual funds usually lower net returns to investors, according to a new study conducted for the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********Proponents of the fees - named for S.E.C. Rule 12b-1, which allows funds to use shareholder money for marketing expenses - claim 12b-1 plans improve fund performance. They say higher marketing spending brings in shareholders, and as funds grow, costs drop because expenses are spread over a bigger base. **********Not so, says Charles Trzcinka, an associate professor of finance at the State University of New York at Buffalo, and Robert Zweig, a financial analyst with the S.E.C.'s division of investment management, who studied 612 stock and bond funds. They found that the larger the 12b-1 fee, the larger the fund's total expenses - and, in general, the lower the net returns. The advice from Mr. Trzcinka: ''Investors should put no more money into 12b-1 funds unless they are sure that the service they get from their broker is worth the fee.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/18/business/world-markets-volatility-in-south-africa-s-markets.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1990-02-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 779, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World Markets;   Volatility in South Africa's Markets", "print_headline": "World Markets;   Volatility in South Africa's Markets", "body_text": " **********Humphrey Borkum, a director of South Africa's largest brokerage house, wasn't surprised by what Nelson Mandela said when he was released last week from prison after more than 27 years. But other players in the South African stock market apparently were. **********After Mr. Mandela restated his support for the African National Congress's long-held policy of nationalization of some key industries, like gold mines, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Overall Index plummeted 7.5 percent in just three days. It recovered a bit at the end of the week, but still finished 6 percent down. ''I didn't expect him to come out after 27 years and say, 'I changed my mind,' '' said Mr. Borkum of Davis Borkum Hare. ''Everyone here thinks he is doing no more than staking out his position from where he will negotiate.'' **********But that didn't deter the selling, which was accelerated by a concomitant sharp decline in the financial rand, the special investment currency foreigners must use to buy South African stocks. Kloof Gold, a gold-mining company, fell from 42.75 rand on Feb. 9 to 37.75 at its low on Wednesday; and the drop of the financial rand increased the loss when translated into other currencies. **********The fall was just as scary for Americans who invest dollars in gold funds concentrated in South African shares. International Investors Inc. is the largest gold fund and has 56 percent of its investment in South Africa. It fell from $18.18 on Feb. 9 to $15.75 Wednesday, a 13.4 percent decline, compared with a 11.6 percent decline in the South African gold index. A sister fund, Gold Resources, which does not invest in South Africa, was down only several pennies, to $5.42 on Wednesday. **********Mr. Borkum and Niall Brown of Simpson McKie, another big South African brokerage firm, attributed the sell-off to speculative foreign investors who had already pushed the the market up 3.2 percent after South Africa's President, F. W. de Klerk, promised two weeks ago that Mr. Mandela's release was imminent. ''It is a case where people are behaving more on sentiment than fact,'' Mr. Brown said about both the run-up and the fall. **********David Poole, chief economist at International Investors Inc., said a correction was due anyway because of the large rise in gold-share prices. The fund has risen 73.6 percent since last May; the South African gold index has risen 44.7 percent. **********Most Americans who invest in South Africa do so through funds, like International Investors, that buy gold stocks in South Africa, the United States, Canada and Australia. But opposition to apartheid has deterred many investors. According to Davis Borkum Hare, Americans held only 3.9 percent of the South African gold shares that are traded in American Depository Receipts in the United States at the end of last year, down from 13.8 percent at the end of 1987. **********Last week's decline in the South African market means investors will have more volatility to contend with. It is likely that every hiccup in talks between the A.N.C. and Pretoria could move the market quickly in one direction or another. And as in the case of the plunge last week, these moves may not seem logical. **********There is, of course, a risk that talks won't get off the ground. But Mr. Mandela's release and Mr. de Klerk's willingness to negotiate are real reason for optimism. And they give investors, for the first time in years, several positive factors with which to balance South Africa's risks. **********One is that South African gold stocks are already some of the most attractive in the world and would be more so with a new government. In the last year, they are up 72 percent in dollar terms compared with 27 percent for gold shares in the United States. **********And investors can look forward to the lifting of sanctions, which is now a real possibility and would bring in floods of new money. **********But after all this, there is still one other variable to contend with: the price of gold, which colors the atmosphere on the exchange. Warren Myers, vice president of Merril Lynch Capital Markets in New York, predicts a continued rise, which should push up the price of gold shares. But Mr. Brown thinks gold will not rise much this year, ''so gold shares are not too exciting.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/09/business/high-tech-credit-fraud.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 233, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "High-Tech Credit Fraud", "print_headline": "High-Tech Credit Fraud", "body_text": " **********The Toronto police said last Friday that they had cracked an international high-technology credit card fraud ring that uses electronically doctored credit cards. **********The Hong Kong-based scheme involves copying electronic information from a genuine card and attaching it to a stolen one. **********The seized cards were stolen and doctored in Hong Kong and the four men caught using them were Chinese nationals who had immigrated to Canada, said Roy Teeft, detective inspector of the Toronto Police Department's intelligence services.

''We Sani people cook our meat with pig bones in it. But the Han people don't.'' **********Mr. Bi is one of 80 million members of ethnic minorities whom the Communist leadership is trying to assimilate peacefully into Han Chinese life. China's minorities represent only 8 percent of the country's population, but there are 55 different groups, and 24 of them live here in the country's southwest. **********Distinctions Are Blurring **********Many of the minority groups live in mixed-tribe communities that are often hotbeds of dispute. But at least in this province of Yunnan, the younger generations are beginning to marry across ethnic lines and blurring the distinctions between peoples. The Communist leadership hopes this trend will diminish the chances of conflict. **********In any event, chances of an uprising seem slim. In Yunnan, for example, the minority groups make up one-third of the whole, but any effort to organize would be difficult because they are fragmented and scattered throughout the province's sprawling red-clay hills and rice-paddied valleys. Rifts often occur between neighboring tribes over land and resources, rather than between a minority and the Han Chinese. **********''The minorities here have always lived under some form of Chinese rule, be it the Communists or the emperors,'' a Muslim student said. ''In Yunnan, they are not united. They don't have the sense of having their own nation as do the Tibetans or even the Mongolians.'' **********But the recent upheavals in the Soviet Union's minority regions have raised concerns about prospects for stability here. Prime Minister Li Peng recently called for greater emphasis on minority relations, and the Government is planning to increase tax benefits to certain minority areas. **********Some Extra Benefits **********A Government official said that Yunnan spends the equivalent of $43 million on supplements to minorities, although there are many other benefits that are not captured in that amount. For instance, the minority people here are not subject to China's one-child policy, but are permitted to have two children, and in some cases more. **********Minority students applying for college may be admitted with lower exam grades than Han Chinese, and minority families get a certain priority in allocation of housing. Two of the poorest minority areas are also exempt from taxes, and the Government says it is doing its best to encourage a business mentality among some traditionally oriented societies. **********''The Government gives investment money and sends intellectuals and technicians to help the minorities develop their local economies,'' said Shen Qirong, an official at the provincial Minority Nationalities Affairs office. ''We also have minority swat teams who go to the minority areas to settle any conflicts.'' **********Still, officials acknowledge that in Yunnan there is still a gap in average incomes: Han Chinese earn the equivalent of $85 per year, while minority people earn $64. **********Religious Differences **********The tensions here are not as sharp as in the neighboring province of Tibet, where violent clashes have led to the declaration of martial law in Lhasa, the capital. In Yunnan, religious differences are a source of minority friction, and relations between the Han Chinese and Muslim groups are still somewhat strained. **********The 400,00 Muslims in Yunnan, members of the Hui minority, still recall the conflict in 1974, near the end of the Cultural Revolution, when the army invaded an area in Yunnan's southwest, called Shadian, to crush a rebellion by Muslims. Communist officials had been forcing the Muslims, who do not eat pork, to raise pigs, and the defiant Muslims armed themselves with knives and guns, both Muslim and Chinese officials say . The clash apparently left several hundred dead. **********In recent months, some Muslim nations were reported to have offered money to pay for students to study in their countries, but the Chinese Government has refused to allow the money to be disbursed directly to Muslim groups in Yunnan. The offer has renewed the discomfort on both sides. **********''Everything seems fine on the outside, but underneath there is still tension,'' a Chinese worker said. **********More Privileges Promised **********Officials say the Communist Party has helped raise the standard of living for many of these societies and weaned them from their traditional way of life. **********Ma Yisheng, a senior research official at the small museum at the Yunnan Institute of Nationalities, said some societies used slaves until a few decades ago. He said that the Yi minority, the largest in Yunnan and an umbrella race for Sani people like Mr. Bi, would punish its slaves by binding their feet to a horse who would gallop around, dragging the face and body on the ground. **********''In the future, there will be more privileges,'' Mr. Ma said.

Thus did Victor Carauscu, a 28-year-old research engineer, describe the small and grinding deprivations that led him, on the night of Dec. 22, 1989, to take up arms against tyranny in the revolution that toppled Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena. **********His story, recounted to a reporter today, might be repeated by men and women across the land. But for the residents of this snowbound Transylvanian city cradled by pines and mountains, it was not the first time they had taken to the streets. **********'He Never Returned' **********In November 1987, workers from what used to be called the Red Flag Truck Factory went on strike to demand bread and money. Baton-wielding police officers charged and scattered the strikers when they tried to storm the Communist Party headquarters. One day later, the strike leaders, identified from security police videotapes of the protest, were rounded up. Some vanished.  Mr. Carauscu, who joined the 1987 demonstration, said about 60 people were formally tried on charges of terrorism and hooliganism and sentenced to two-year jail terms. **********Hundreds more, he said, were evicted from their homes, sent to other towns and made to work there. Still more, according to several residents here, who asked not to be identified, met a harsher fate. **********''They brought the son's clothing home in a cardboard box,'' a hotel employee said, describing what he said was an incident he had witnessed. ''The clothing was covered in dried blood. They did not explain to the parents what had happened to the son. But he never returned.'' **********Concessions, Then Punishment **********For a brief moment, the authorities offered concessions. Wages were increased. Food supplies began to arrive. Then, according to Mr. Carauscu and others, the food supplies ran out. ''We had less than before,'' he said. ''The whole city was being punished for the strike.'' **********That deepened the discontent that Rumanians used to discuss only among their closest friends, never knowing when they might be denounced by informers for doing so. **********''We thought that some of the leaders in Bucharest might do something,'' said Mr. Carauscu, who works at the factory's research department and of late has become a leader in the revolutionary committee here. ''But nobody did anything. We hoped the army might do something. But they didn't. We even hoped that Gorbachev might help us. But he didn't. The only way that remained was to fight and we fought.'' **********''The situation could not survive forever,'' he said, even if other Eastern European countries had not first thrown off Communist rule. He continued, ''In other countries it was changed peacefully. But that was not possible here.'' **********'Then We Knew he Was Weak' **********Yet, in conversations with him and with students who took part in the demonstrations that overthrew the Communist Party in this city, 100 miles north of Bucharest, one thing seemed clear: Without the clues provided by the capital's television and radio stations, the lesser revolutions around the country would not have charted their courses so easily. **********The first and overriding sign, said Julia Gavril, a 26-year-old drama student, was a broadcast of a speech in central Bucharest by Mr. Ceausescu on Dec. 21, during which the crowd booed him down and the television station, then in the hands of his regime, froze the transmission. **********''Then we knew he was weak and scared,'' she said. ''The whole country saw him frightened. This was a very important moment.'' **********The display of vulnerability spurred between 3,000 and 4,000 people to demonstrate outside the local party headquarters here, she said. Workers from Brasov's factories, including the Red Flag Truck Factory, came to protest. **********Protest at Central Square **********Already, she said, people had been angered by the accounts from foreign radio stations of the bloody suppression of protest in the western town of Timisoara. But the army and the police, not yet ready to switch allegiance, guarded the Communist Party headquarters, fired into the air and turned water cannon on the demonstrators. **********The next day, according to several accounts, thousands of people converged on the central square outside the Communist Party headquarters. They listened for news relayed by others watching the television, now in the hands of those who had forced the Ceausescus to flee Bucharest. **********About noon, the television broadcast the news of Mr. Ceausescu's helicopter flight from the Central Committee Headquarters in Bucharest. About 2 P.M., the army units guarding the local party headquarters in Brasov withdrew and the demonstrators poured into the local party building. **********Army Hands Out Guns to Rebels **********''People embraced, soldiers and workers,'' said Miss Gavril. ''Old men cried. I even saw an army officer with tears on his face.'' But the ordeal was not over. **********From Bucharest, on the television, came images of Mr. Ceausescu's Securitate, the secret police, counterattacking, opening fire on the crowds celebrating the new and still undefined order. **********''We thought the same thing could happen to us,'' said Mr. Carauscu. ''So we asked the army to come back and defend us.'' He said he had joined the core of those who made decisions without time for reaching a consensus, and was one of those at the local party offices when the army handed out the guns to the revolutionaries to fire on the Securitate units around them. **********About 2 A.M. on Saturday Dec. 23, the fighting in Brasov started, with pro-Ceausescu forces firing on the crowds and the army firing back. **********Counterattack by Securitate **********It took two days of swirling, ill-defined conflicts, scares and alarms for the fighting to die down. There were panics and rumors and confusions. **********Two of the supposed revolutionaries to whom the army had given guns in the party headquarters turned out to be Securitate infiltrators, who then turned their guns on the revolutionaries and were shot down. **********There was a counterattack on the security police headquarters against army units holding it. By the end, 64 people had been killed, Mr. Carauscu said. The national death toll is estimated by Western diplomats at 7,000. **********The fighting subsided when the television broadcast news of the execution of Mr. Ceausescu and his wife on Dec. 25, Mr. Carauscu said. **********''This was very good,'' he said, offering a view that has become controversial and has divided Rumanians. ''If he had remained alive and his forces had continued to fight for him, then all the country would have been transformed into a bloodbath. But this execution saved thousands of lives.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/17/business/citicorp-to-cut-215-jobs-at-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Citicorp to Cut 215 Jobs at Unit", "print_headline": "Citicorp to Cut 215 Jobs at Unit", "body_text": " **********Citicorp said today that it would cut 215 jobs in a reorganization of its money-losing Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers equities unit. **********Citicorp said up to 140 employees would be laid off while another 75 are being transferred within the organization, which will be integrated more closely with Citicorp's pan-European capital markets group. **********Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers will be left with a total of 110 employees, it said.

After talks in Moscow on Sunday morning, Mr. Gorbachev plans to fly with his guest to Stavropol, the city in the northern Caucasus where the Soviet President spent his childhood and began his Communist Party career. **********A visit to Mr. Gorbachev's native village, Privolnoye, is possible before the two leaders part at Mineralniye Vody, a northern Caucasus spa resort, on Monday afternoon, German officials said. **********While West German officials view the personally escorted sightseeing on Mr. Gorbachev's home turf as a significant personal gesture, there was a distinct shift in tone today in the way the officials discussed concrete prospects for the visit. **********Earlier, the public line was that Mr. Kohl, who had been pushing his allies at the recent summits of NATO, the European Community and the Group of Seven industrial democracies for a multinational economic aid package for the Soviet Union, would not go to Moscow with empty hands. Today, officials said he would not be offering any more money this weekend. **********Guaranteeing Bank Loans **********The officials said Mr. Kohl would point out that he had gotten his partners to agree to consider the possibility of effective assistance programs while Moscow worked out its plans for change. West Germany had shown its good faith, they said, by agreeing to guarantee $2.9 billion in bank loans and to pay the Soviet Union $781 million this year to cover the cost of stationing its 360,000 troops in East Germany. **********Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher will also be in the delegation, and the Economics Minister, Helmut Haussmann, has drafted a comprehensive plan for expanding German trade, increasing oil and gas imports from the Soviet Union and broadening technical assistance for Soviet economic changes. Mr. Kohl will carry the plan in his briefcase in Moscow. ''There will be no further financial offers,'' an official said. **********The officials said that Mr. Kohl would also point out the political gestures that West Germany and its allies had made to allay Soviet fears about unification. Mr. Kohl plans to be the first NATO government head to explain to Mr. Gorbachev the implications of the London summit's decisions to transform NATO from a military to a political organization, invite the Soviet Union and other members of the Warsaw Pact to sign nonaggression pacts and to ask Mr. Gorbachev to address them at NATO headquarters in Brussels. **********A Meeting in Paris **********Will all this, and whatever Mr. Kohl whispers in private in Mr. Gorbachev's ear, be enough to get the Soviet Union to agree to the idea of a united Germany within NATO? One European diplomat said on the eve of the talks, ''If the Russians are capable at all of rational decision-making at the moment, they probably will fall into line,'' but he did not expect this to happen quite yet. **********Mr. Genscher and his Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, will meet in Paris again next Tuesday, with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Foreign Ministers of Britain, France and East Germany, for the next round of six-power talks on unification. **********In the Paris talks, Poland is expected to push for a commitment by the World War II Allies not to give up their residual occupation rights after unification until a united German government negotiates and ratifies a treaty guaranteeing the integrity of the postwar Polish-German border, along the Oder and Neisse Rivers several hundred miles to the west of the prewar line. **********West Germany, whose Parliament agreed with the East German Parliament to attain such a treaty, will argue in Paris that the promise is sufficient and that Germany should regain full sovereignty and unification after the all-German elections tentatively set for Dec. 2, officials here say. The United States will also reject the Polish demand, according to an American diplomat here. **********Mr. Kohl will discuss concrete measures to improve the lot of the estimated two million ethnic Germans in the Soviet Union, officials said, in hopes of reducing the flow of refugees coming to West Germany. Noting that 66,000 have arrived in this country so far this year, one official said, ''We want to put measures in place that will prevent a massive exodus.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/18/world/thailand-tells-un-to-stop-aiding-burmese.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 375, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Thailand Tells U.N. to Stop Aiding Burmese", "print_headline": "Thailand Tells U.N. to Stop Aiding Burmese", "body_text": " **********The Interior Ministry has threatened to expel United Nations or other refugee officials who assist Burmese dissidents living in Thailand, newspapers reported today. **********Thailand has close ties with the military Government in Myanmar, formerly Burma, which brutally crushed a student-led movement for democracy two years ago.

The provision would expand the regulatory authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission, letting it review proposed takeovers of railroads by investors who are not already in the rail business. The commission already reviews acquisitions between railroad companies. **********Amtrak's nationwide passenger service will continue to operate under separate legislation even if the veto is sustained, lawmakers said.

Fields, another leading advocate of assisting high technology, was removed from his position as director of the Defense Advanced Projects Agency. **********Mr. Sekora's resignation was independent of Dr. Fields's transfer, but the two men shared professional frustrations. **********Dr. Fields's removal last month has heightened an already-bitter controversy over what the Federal Government's role should be in support of critical high-technology industries. Advocates of a national industrial policy have argued that the Government should step up its efforts to bring the United States back as a major player in the consumer electronics industry and in defending industries like semiconductors and computers that are threatened by foreign competitors. **********But Administration officials have argued against any coordinated attempt to spend heavily on particular technologies, saying it is impossible to pick ''winning'' technologies. **********Others have suggested that the recent cutbacks are more likely to be related to across-the-board reductions at the Pentagon than to ideological issues. ''A lot of this may have little to do with ideological issues,'' said Gary R. Saxonhouse, professor of economics at the University of Michigan. ''They are cutting everywhere in the Defense Department. They have to make hard choices.'' **********Reasons for Resignation **********Mr. Sekora said he resigned because he thought he would be more effective doing similar research working with private corporations outside the Federal Government. He said that his resources had recently been cut at the Pentagon and that Defense Department executives had been stalling on legislation that would have combined his agency with a second group, the Defense Industrial Network, to create a stronger organization to collect information for industrial planning. **********''All the initiatives that were started under Reagan are taking hits from the Bush Administration,'' Mr. Sekora said. Project Socrates was created in 1988 and it was intended to build an accurate data base of many of the world's most advanced technologies to help planners assess the status of American high-technology efforts compared with those of foreign competitors. **********Mr. Sekora said he had set up a private company, Technology Strategic Planning Inc., and planned to work with corporations to provide assessments of foreign technology. **********In setting up Socrates, Mr. Sekora had been successful at gathering experts who could be called on to gauge competitive foreign technologies. **********'A Network of People' **********''What he's put together is a network of people in all of the major labs that we have both corporate and government,'' said Dr. Roy L. Beasley, a Defense Department consultant who is a specialist in military manufacturing technologies. ''They were all willing to work together to determine the status of the United States technology in any area.'' **********Mr. Sekora said information-gathering operations like Socrates were essential because the United States is no longer the unilateral leader in all advanced technologies. **********''Technology is becoming uniformly distributed around the world,'' he said. ''The way Socrates addressed technology was to say that every technology in the world is simulatneously a threat and a resource. The most advanced technology is now found in third-world countries or even small countries in the East bloc.'' **********The Socrates program in the Defense Intelligence Agency focused on tracking advances in microelectronics, exotic structural materials, superconductors, high-performance computers, high-definition television and a number of classifed technologies, he said. **********Project's History **********Project Socrates was part of a strategy advanced by Robert B.

About 550 others journeyed on a separate ship to Marseilles. **********They are a ragtag bunch, unwashed, unshaven and ill-clothed after up to two weeks of shelter in Western embassies in Tirana, the Albanian capital. Some hobbled off the ships, and a few had to be carried off because of injuries suffered when they clambered over walls and smashed through gates in trucks to get onto embassy grounds. **********Newborn Among the Refugees **********One of the first to be brought off the ships was a baby born five days ago in the West German Embassy compound. Fourteen others spent their first day in the West in a Brindisi hospital, with an assortment of stomach and kidney problems and broken bones. **********But they had spanking new red passports in their pockets and promises of safe passage from Italy, West Germany, France and Greece. That, along with pluck, was all they needed to form the largest exodus from the last Stalinist stronghold in Eastern Europe. **********''Ciao Italia,'' they shouted, cheering and waving from the top deck as they glided into Brindisi aboard the Espresso Grecia, a cruise ship normally used to ferry backpacking European youths to island vacations in Greece. Today, the Espresso Grecia carried the blue flag of the United Nations, which supervised the evacuation by bus from Tirana and then the ship-boarding in the Albanian port of Durres. **********A 5-Hour Voyage **********On arrival in Brindisi, the refugees sipped milk and mineral water and ate cakes provided by the Italian Red Cross. Most tore eagerly at packages of clothing and shoes handed them to supplement the meager bundles they had carried, if they managed to bring even that much. **********There were unconfirmed reports that scuffles had broken out in Durres when other Albanians tried to force their way onto the ships. But Claudio Luksich, chief engineer of the Espresso Grecia, said ''everything was calm.'' To avoid provoking the Albanian authorities, he said, the refugees had heeded requests to remain quiet as they embarked on the five-hour, 85-mile voyage. **********Overwhelmingly, the new arrivals were in their 20's and 30's. Mr. Luksich said older people who appear to have been dispatched by the Albanian Government went to Durres to beckon the young people to stay. **********Among those who ignored the plea was Eno Vaso, a 27-year-old college graduate, who stood barefoot, having lost his shoes during his escape into the West German Embassy. **********''I want to change my life,'' Mr. Vaso said in Italian, which he said he learned in part from watching Italian television. ''I want to lead a better life. I don't want Communism.'' **********Australia a Destination **********Like many of the refugees, he said he hoped ultimately to reach Australia, where an uncle lives. Others gave the United States and Canada as their havens of preference. A few, among them Rodolf Hadhami, insisted that they would return home ''when Albania is free,'' which Mr. Hadhami predicted would be within two years. **********Several said that through Italian and Yugoslav television they were well aware of the changes that had swept other corners of Eastern Europe, and they also knew of the similar flight to freedom by foreign embassies that East Germans had made a year ago. **********For now, the Albanians will stay in the countries whose embassies had given them shelter, and for most that means West Germany. **********About 3,050 of them boarded three long special trains that came from Germany to carry them north. It was not clear where they would wind up, but a West German diplomat, Friedrich W. Catoir, said they would be housed for a while in six reception centers. **********An Abandoned Army Depot **********Brindisi's prefect, Giuseppe Mazzitello, said 29 people who had fled into the Greek Embassy were to be flown to Greece, while 841 more refugees would stay in Italy while they figure out to do next. Italy has an ethnic Albanian population of about 150,000, concentrated in the hardscrabble South, and some of those communities have offered to shelter their compatriots. **********The Italian group was taken to an abandoned army depot outside Brindisi, where they will stay in old buildings equipped in the last few days with cots, kitchens and portable toilets. On Thursday soldiers hacked away at weeds and tore down rolls of barbed wire, which were seen as an unseemly early sight for people seeking freedom. **********In the long term, the Albanians' future is less clear, for it is uncertain if they will be deemed political refugees or simply emigrants in search of better living conditions. The decision could have a significant effect on whether they will be allowed to resettle in their chosen countries. **********'Came Here to Find Work' **********''Life in Albania is very difficult,'' said Ganti Borova, a 23-year-old architecture student. ''We came here to find work.'' **********That point was echoed by many of the new arrivals. **********But others asserted that they and their families had spent years opposing the Communist Government and that their flight was purely political.

German unification fits neatly into that vision. **********Chief executives at several of Europe's largest corporations said, in a series of interviews, that the unification of West Germany and East Germany would be the crucial first step toward a merging of Western and Eastern Europe that could result in a family of nations larger and more dynamic than today's Western Europe. **********''The European challenge is to restore the Europe of 1914, when Europe was the biggest economic power in the world and had the best-educated population, one that is twice the population of the United States and four times the population of Japan,'' said Hans-Jorg Rudloff, chairman of Credit Suisse-First Boston, a leading investment bank in London. **********But German unification may hurt some countries and companies, the European executives warn. As investment money flows into East Germany, it might be harder for struggling African and Latin American nations to attract funds for development. **********Similarly, the stream of West German capital that has poured into factories in southern Europe may largely be rechanneled toward the East, halting the investment benefits enjoyed recently by Spain and Portugal, for example. **********Still, the executives view German unification as a welcome prospect in general. After complaining for years about slow European growth, a malady they called Eurosclerosis, executives say a greater Europe will provide vast opportunities for growth. It will also give European companies a stronger foundation for competing against American and Japanese corporate giants. **********West Germany is expected to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild East Germany and bring its living standards up to the much-envied levels of the Federal Republic. That will require stepped-up production by West Germany's potent industrial machine; ''the locomotive of Europe'' will have to pull all of the continent to faster growth. **********Some Western European business leaders worry that unification will make West German companies even more formidable competitors. Titans like Siemens, Daimler-Benz and Deutsche Bank will expand their reach, and British, French and Italian executives say their companies will have to work hard to stay in fighting trim. **********These business executives assert that German unification should in no way slow the European Community's plans to drop all internal trade barriers by late 1992, creating a single central bank and currency for the 12 nations. **********Instead, they say, European unification should be accelerated so that a united Germany is created under a large, watertight European roof. **********Rather than gloating at the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe, some of the eight modern knights of capitalism interviewed say it is a time of unusual responsibility for the West. **********''We have to pay the bill,'' said Carlo de Benedetti, chairman of Olivetti, the Italian company that makes office automation equipment and personal computers.

A Bigger Market Open to Everyone LARS RAMQVIST Recently chosen chief executive of Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications company. **********German unification is bound to be the first step toward building a great, united Europe, East and West. This united Europe will be 700 million people, according to the old definition of Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals. **********In the beginning, it will be tough to do business in East Germany, but long-term it will be a bigger market that will open up to everyone. What's important in all this is that it is the first step in a bigger Europe, and that will be positive for Swedish industry. Running 'Like Mad' To Stay Competitive SIR DENYS HENDERSON Chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, Britain's largest chemical company. **********There is a pent-up demand to improve standards of living, not just in East Germany but in the East bloc as a whole. There is a somewhat naive view that it is going to create a massive new market overnight in the East bloc. My view is that it's great, but you are not going to switch overnight from a totalitarian economy to a market economy. **********In the short term, it might make it slightly easier to compete against German industry. The Germans are committed to achieving unification and there will be a cost to that absorption. If their capital priorities are directed toward the East bloc, it might mean some distractions about what they hope for in other parts of the world: Asia and the United States. **********In the long term, it will make German competition tougher because the German market will be an even bigger market. In a decade when demography is going to be a problem in terms of getting new skilled workers into the economy, it will give the Germans access to a very skilled work force. After the absorption period has gone through, that will put German industry in a very strong position. We will have to run like mad to improve our productivity, our technological base and international presence to compete satisfactorily. **********The negative part is that it is just possible that West Germany's absorption of East Germany's ostmark may produce higher inflation in West Germany, which will undoubtedly produce higher interest rates. This will be matched in other parts of the world, and that means the United States and Japan. That could produce a slowdown in growth. Solving the Problems Left by Communism CARLO DE BENEDETTI Chairman of Olivetti, the Italian office machine and computer company. **********The real unification in terms of willingness and spirit is a fait accompli. The consequence of this is that we are at a turning point for Europe. **********I think we should negotiate politically with Germany that it is in the best interests of all of the community's partners to speed up the process of European integration before a negative climate appears in other European countries that Germany is too powerful, too arrogant. **********We couldn't be more happy seeing the total and irreversible collapse of Communism, ideologically and practically. Communism has failed because it hasn't been able to solve the real problems of those countries in terms of democracy, economic freedom, social structure, consumer satisfaction. **********The real news is that we have to be the ones who will be in charge of solving those problems. The challenge for the Western world, for the capitalistic world and specifically for Western Europe, will be to help solve those problems. Renewing a Nation In Need of Repair PERCY BARNEVIK Chairman of Asea Brown Boveri, a Swiss-Swedish company that is Europe's largest electrical engineering group. **********During a short-term transition period, German unification could create some problems, such as higher inflation and, consequently, higher interest rates. **********Medium-term, the reconstruction of East Germany represents enormous business opportunities. We estimate that 600 billion Deutsche marks will be needed for housing, 40 billion for new power plants, 8 billion for new telephone lines and 100 billion to 150 billion marks to renew the transportation system. This means larger markets for both West Germany and the European Community. **********Industry and governments have to act quickly to support East Germany to build an adequate industrial infrastructure. Only this will keep the East Germans there. A mass migration could thus be avoided. **********Environmental issues are a top priority. East Germany urgently needs new equipment to reduce toxic emissions. Its power plants are 35 percent less efficient than those in the West. **********At first, West German companies will be more absorbed with East Germany and thus have to slightly reduce capacity available for other markets. At the same time, suppliers from other Eastern European nations will have a harder time supplying East Germany as their trade system changes to hard currency dealings. Product quality will play an increased role. **********In the second phase, the position of West German industry will be improved because of the larger market and better production-sharing possibilities with East Germany. This will create tougher competition for non-German companies. **********There is a real risk that West German interests are, for the moment, somewhat diverted toward East Germany. As a result, some people in Brussels are afraid of a slowdown in the integration process. This need not be the case if the other European Community members insist strongly enough. West Germany has the capacity to go both ways at the same time. Balancing Emotions Against the Realities MICHEL FRANCOIS-PONCET Chairman of Compagnie Financiere de Paribas, a French banking group. **********German unification is a complex and a not-so-complex situation. East Germany is about 10 percent of West Germany in terms of gross national product, but it's at least 25 percent in terms of population. It is one-fifth in terms of productivity ratios. Therefore, you have a set of problems balancing the political emotions and the consequences on East Germany of issues like unemployment. **********German unity will mean a different economic balance in Europe. It will become a country of 80 million people, and the game will not be exactly the same. **********For some French companies, there is already a certain feeling of inferiority. It varies from one company to the next. Unification will create a larger market for industrial companies in Germany; it gives them a more powerful base. French companies will have to maintain their cool and not hesitate to take chances. More Consumption And a New Impetus JEAN-LOUIS BEFFA Chairman of Saint-Gobain, the Paris-based glass and packaging company. **********German unification is a very positive development. It expands the market. It's going to be a new impetus for economic demand. **********When the Common Market was formed, everyone worried about what would happen to French industry as opposed to German industry, but basically it was a positive factor. It will be the same now. It will be good for the good companies, whether German of French. The dynamic companies in France are already reacting and signing agreements. **********If all goes quickly and in the right direction, the so-called German question will be solved and we will be in a position to integrate Europe and more quickly. I am in favor of not slowing down European integration and support pushing for German reunification within the European Community. **********When a country like East Germany starts growing, its people will improve their housing, buy cars, buy packaging, and all that is going to help us. Showing Willingness To Transfer Wealth HANS-JORG RUDLOFF Chairman of Credit Suisse-First Boston, a London-based investment bank. **********If what the Germans have is economic and monetary union, then it will be nothing else than a huge investment program. A lot of money will have to be invested in industrial stock, streets and railways. **********Germany being a first-class borrower, if it starts borrowing heavily, whether for companies or government, it will clearly divert investment money from other areas. What we will see is a competition for capital all around the world. All this will happen when monetary policy all over the world is very tight and when there is a huge debt burden out of the 1980's to pay off or refinance. It will create a big competition for savings. **********I'm not talking about East Germany alone, but the entire East, and that includes the Soviet Union. If you divert huge streams of capital to these areas, wherever these funds are diverted from will have to tighten their belts. **********Will unification be inflationary? My answer is no. The Germans have a superb tradition of handling inflation. They are always willing to make the sacrifice to avoid inflation. **********Will it be impetus for growth? Yes. But will that additional growth be negated by less growth in other areas of the world? That could very well be. **********No one should have the illusion that it is good enough to applaud the liberation of 120 million people from 40 years of dictatorship, praising our own system and how we proved beyond any doubt that the capitalistic liberal system is superior in economic terms to the 80-year-old Marxist system. To applaud that is not good enough. Now we have to help these people who aspire to the same living standards that we have. We have to show that we're willing to transfer some of that wealth. New 'Marshall Plans' To Prime the Pumps CORNELIS VAN DER KLUGT Chairman of Philips N.V., the international electronics group based in the Netherlands. **********German unification is inevitable. It will strengthen Germany, and therefore it will also strengthen the European Community. Everyone is hell-bent to make sure that it doesn't slow down European integration. We should never slow down European integration - it's already 30 years late. But it might slow down if everyone places their priorities elsewhere. **********There is no longer an Eastern bloc. Some countries will move fast, like Hungary. Others will move almost as fast, like Czechoslovakia, and then there is the next layer: Poland, the Soviet Union, Romania, and Bulgaria, countries that will come later. In countries where there is so little and such low purchasing power, the interest for business will be the initial infrastructural projects, which will be done with money from our side. **********These improvements will bring these countries to a higher productivity, which will give them possibilities to export to Western Europe and to increase their material well-being. This is a long-term process, with the initial business based on a Marshall Plan-type of approach."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/19/world/soviets-said-to-withdraw-fighters-and-bombers-from-vietnam-base.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "1990-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 912, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviets Said to Withdraw Fighters and Bombers From Vietnam Base", "print_headline": "Soviets Said to Withdraw Fighters and Bombers From Vietnam Base", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union has withdrawn all of its MIG-23 fighter planes and about half of its TU-16 bombers from its base at Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam, Pentagon officials said today, in a move the officials said would reduce Soviet military abilities in Southeast Asia. **********But Pentagon officials added that there were no indications that the Soviet Union planned to shut down the base, which is used to refuel Soviet ships on their way to the Indian Ocean. **********Cam Ranh Bay, which was built by the United States in the Vietnam War, is the largest Soviet naval base outside of the Soviet Union. For years, the Pentagon has described the base as a threat to the United States and Southeast Asian nations. **********Cam Ranh Bay ''extends the Soviet wartime reach over East Asia's sea lines of communication in the South China Sea and poses a challenge as well to the U.S. military presence in the Philippines,'' the Pentagon said in its 1988 Soviet military power report. **********Squadron of Fighters **********The 1988 report said that the Soviet Union maintained a squadron of 14 MIG-23 fighters at the base to defend the installation from attack and to escort other planes. It added that Moscow had 16 Badger bombers, 10 of which were capable of carrying anti-ship cruise missiles. **********While the Pentagon said in its 1988 report that Soviet planes and ships at Cam Ranh Bay could be destroyed in a global war with ''relative ease,'' it said that such an action would divert American forces from other missions. **********But today a Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Vadim Perfilyev, said that the Soviet Union had withdrawn MIG-23 fighters and TU-16 bombers from the base. Mr. Perfilyev said 6 to 10 Soviet aircraft remained, but he gave no details. The withdrawal of the planes was disclosed this week in a report by The International Herald Tribune. **********Pentagon officials familar with intelligence reports offered their elaborations today on the withdrawal of the aircraft. **********They said the only squadron of Soviet MIG-23 fighters at Cam Ranh Bay, about 12 planes, had been taken apart and shipped back to the Soviet Union. **********Described as 'Junkers' **********About half of the Soviet Union's force of TU-16 bombers had flown back to the Soviet Union, Pentagon officials added. The remaining half a dozen or so bombers were described as ''junkers'' by one Pentagon official. ''They are the sort of planes that nobody ever expects will fly again,'' the official said. **********While the withdrawal significantly reduces the Soviet Union's capability to attack ships in the area, the Russians still have TU-95 Bear long-range reconnaissance planes at Cam Ranh Bay. A Pentagon official said that about four of these planes were based there. **********The number of Soviet ships stationed at the base has declined since 1988, when the Pentagon said the Soviet naval presence at Cam Ranh Bay included about 25 ships, including 2 to 4 submarines. **********Pentagon officials said today that Moscow now had fewer than 20 ships at Cam Ranh Bay, including one submarine. The ships there are small fighting and support ships. **********Soviet Cut in Spending **********Pentagon officials said that the declining Soviet military presence at Cam Ranh Bay is part of the larger Soviet effort to cut military spending. **********Some Western and Asian diplomats in Southeast Asia have suggested that the move is also designed to improve relations with China and to increase pressure on the United States to reduce its military presence in Asia and the western Pacific, in particular at its bases in the Philippines. **********But Pentagon officials asserted that there were no indications that Moscow intended to abandon the Cam Ranh Bay base. **********''The ships have not left,'' said one Pentagon official, who did not wish to be identified. ''The people have not left. Strategically, it is still pretty important to their deployments in the Indian Ocean. There is no sign that they intend to leave.'' The official said that while the withdrawal of the Soviet planes was welcome, the United States would not have had much difficulty ''neutralizing'' the aircraft in a war. **********'Purely Defensive Structure' **********Mr. Perfilyev, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said the withdrawal of the planes was part of a move to a ''purely defensive structure in the Asia-Pacific region'' and was being carried out in consultation with the Vietnamese. **********He added that ''the Soviet side hopes that these actions will help to defuse military-political tension'' in the region. **********In 1988, the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, offered to abandon Cam Ranh Bay if the United States did the same with its six military bases in the Philippines. American officials dismissed the offer, saying that the United States needed to maintain naval bases in the Pacific to support its worldwide operations. **********The State Department said it welcomed reports that Soviet planes had been withdrawn from Cam Ranh Bay. ''We anticipate that less Soviet military involvement in southeast Asia would contribute to regional stability and to efforts to achieve a comprehensive political settlement in the Cambodia conflict,'' a State Department spokesman said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/05/business/media-business-advertising-macy-s-ad-assails-financial-rumors.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1990-12-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 800, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Macy's Ad Assails Financial Rumors", "print_headline": "MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Macy's Ad Assails Financial Rumors", "body_text": " **********Frustrated by the continuing speculation about the financial stability of R.H. Macy & Company, Edward S. Finkelstein, its chairman and chief executive, took a full-page advertisement in a leading retailing trade paper yesterday to respond to \"unfounded rumors and misinformation, which serve no one.\" **********In the advertisement, which appeared in Women's Wear Daily at a reported price of about $15,000, Mr. Finkelstein leveled an attack on what close associates say is a pet peeve -- the growing conviction among suppliers and creditors that Macy's future is staked to sales performance this Christmas. **********\"No 'miracles on 34th Street' are required this Christmas,\" he stated in the advertisement, a reference to the holiday movie that is centered on Macy's flagship store on 34th Street in Manhattan. \"The season will not make or break Macy's. We expect it to be slow and we are prepared for it.\" **********The ad, which some in the industry say only lends credence to the rumors, was in the form of a letter from Macy's and signed by Mr. Finkelstein. It begins, \"Dear Friends: It has become fashionable of late for uninformed outsiders to speculate about Macy's status and future.\" **********The letter was also distributed to Macy's employees earlier this week, a company spokesman said. **********Mr. Finkelstein declared in the ad, \"We have $650 million less in inventory this Christmas season than last, so there is no need to resort to last year's level of markdowns, regardless of what others may do.\" **********He added: \"Our gross margins this Christmas quarter will be superior to last year's. We are focusing on profitability, not volume, and are committed to preserving traditional gross margins.\" **********Mr. Finkelstein is said by people close to Macy's to have been especially irritated by recent news reports about the sharp increase in its losses, which rose to $66 million in the first fiscal quarter, ended Oct. 31, and by other articles suggesting that Macy's may face what Federated Stores confronted last January: a bankruptcy filing. **********Last Thursday the Standard & Poor's Corporation said it was reviewing for a possible downgrading the speculative-grade rating for Macy's subordinated debt. The rating agency said the action reflected Macy's continuing weak retail sales in the context of the company's highly leveraged capital structure. Macy's is about $5 billion in debt from a 1986 leveraged buyout led by Mr. Finkelstein and a 1988 acquisition of the Bullock's and I. Magnin retail chains in California. **********In the advertisement, Mr. Finkelstein tried to address the ramifications of some of these issues. \"Macy's has ample liquidity to meet all of its obligations under any economic scenario we can foresee,\" he said. \"In fact, even after making our $68 million debt principal payment later this month, we will be cash positive and have $475 million of excess bank borrowing capacity.\" **********The advertisement drew mixed reactions. **********\"It's certainly a gamble that by running the ad he is reinforcing the rumors,\" said Bud Konheim, president of Nicole Miller Inc., a dress and sportswear maker. \"It's obvious that Mr. Finkelstein is frustrated because no one is telling the story the way he wants it to be told. He probably feels embattled on several fronts. He used to make himself available to the media, but now he has other people doing it for him. But, in my opinion, he is doing well coping with all his problems.\" **********Others doubted that the advertisement made a convincing case. \"It's a bold move for Macy's to make considering that neither they nor anyone else knows that the retail business will be better in 1991 than it was in 1990,\" said David Rachman, professor of marketing at Baruch College in New York. \"Ed Finkelstein must also be feeling pressure from suppliers. But if I were doing this, I would have my favorite banker also writing a statement in the ad or appearing with me on the six o'clock news.\" **********He said the advertisement might have been a ploy to buy time. \"I suspect that he may be in the midst of making a major or otherwise important deal and ran the ad to buck up the morale of factors and creditors until the deal takes place,\" Professor Rachman said. **********In the ad, Mr. Finkelstein also stated: \"Any comparison between Macy's and the situation in which Campeau Corporation (now Federated) found itself last winter is simply wrong. Campeau didn't have ample cash to meet its obligations -- we do; Campeau had huge, ballooning debt and interest payments to meet in a very short time frame -- we don't; and Campeau wasn't run by merchants who have seen hard times before and know how to plan for them -- we are.\" **********Federated Stores, which owns Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus, declined to comment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/09/business/business-people-top-officer-retiring-from-amstar-sugar.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1990-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 441, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Top Officer Retiring From Amstar Sugar", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   Top Officer Retiring From Amstar Sugar", "body_text": " **********The Amstar Sugar Corporation, makers of the Domino brand, said yesterday that William C.

Mr. Shanley, 65 years old, will become president of Tate & Lyle Inc., a United States subsidiary of Tate & Lyle. He described the post as a part-time one in which he will deal with legislative and Wall Street issues. **********''Neil asked me to take the job since I've been in the business for 40 years,'' Mr. Shanley said, referring to Neil M.

Pickering, the United States representative here, started whispering into a portable phone during the Security Council debate on Panama last month, he reinforced the split image that many people have of him after his first year on the job. **********As usual, he strode quickly into the Council session, his great height and gold glasses giving him an earnest air. And the cordless telephone he carries almost everywhere is his personal contribution to the job of representing the United States at the United Nations. **********At one level it seems to symbolize the professionalism that he is credited with bringing to the post. But by suggesting that Mr. Pickering is kept on a short leash by his superiors, the phone is a reminder that he is a rarity, an American permanent representative to the United Nations who does not have a seat in the Cabinet, and only the second career diplomat to hold the job. The first was Charles W. Yost, who served under President Nixon. **********Bush's Old Stamping Ground **********Just why President Bush downgraded a post that he once held is unclear. Some say Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d insisted on it after hearing of the difficulties that former Secretaries had with past representatives. Others say Mr. Bush wanted to prevent Ronald Reagan from lobbying for the job for his daughter Maureen, who took part in the General Assembly session in 1988 as a member of the American delegation, and who was reportedly interested in the post. **********Nevertheless, President Bush's choice of Mr. Pickering is seen as encouraging at the United Nations. **********By giving the post to a respected Foreign Service professional, President Bush seemed to end the ideological confrontation of the Reagan years and to accept that the United Nations could play a useful role in global problems now that cold war tension is fading. **********Mr. Pickering is praised for his mastery of the issues, his energy and his openness. ''When you deal with him even as a small country you find he has done his homework,'' said Dr. Chan Heng Chee, Singapore's representative. Yves Fortier, the representative from Canada, said, ''He often doesn't need to open his briefing book.'' **********'Pinching and Pushing' **********''Pickering is on top of the United Nations agenda,'' said Prof. Lincoln P. Bloomfield of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''He understands the tricky problems it can help with.'' Professor Bloomfield, Director of Global Issues on President Carter's National Security Council, added, ''but he must keep pinching and pushing Washington to keep the faith.'' **********Such praise implies unhappiness with Mr. Pickering's predecessor, Vernon A. Walters, now the United States Ambassador in Bonn. Mr. Walters spoke a half-dozen languages, but was not thought to be a master of detail and traveled often on Presidential missions. ''Either he wasn't there or you saw your precious half-hour wasted on jokes and anecdotes,'' a United Nations representative recalled. **********But while many welcome Mr. Pickering's technocratic approach, some regret the loss of that prestigious Cabinet seat and wonder whether he can do enough ''pinching and pushing'' in Washington without it. **********'Pickering Is Terrific' **********Edward Luck, president of the United Nations Association of the United States, shares that view. ''We think Pickering is terrific,'' he said. ''But we still want the Cabinet seat restored because it gives him more authority within the State Department.'' **********In particular, Mr. Luck thinks that a Cabinet seat strengthens the representative's hand in dealings with the Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, the State Department official directly in charge of United Nations matters, and the official to whom Mr. Pickering reports. **********''Traditionally the Republicans have used this job to pay off the extreme right, which doesn't like the United Nations,'' Mr. Luck said. ''That's why Pickering needs extra authority.'' **********John R. Bolton, the current Assistant Secretary, is a conservative who once worked for Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina. Mr. Bolton praises many aspects of the United Nations, and last year the Bush Administration asked Congress to send the organization its full funding and to start paying off Washington's huge backlog of dues to the United Nations. Congress refused to do so. **********No Suite or Limousine **********While Mr. Pickering is praised by colleagues at the United Nations, they also note that he has suffered embarrassments in recent months at the hands of Washington's power brokers. **********The State Department acknowledged his reduced status by removing the impressive sixth-floor office suite that his predecessors were given in Washington, as well as the personal limousine. **********Mr. Pickering shrugs off the loss, although those close to him say he fought to retain the Washington office and car. **********Sitting recently in the United States Mission on First Avenue, in a sunny room across from the United Nations, Mr. Pickering played down the loss of the Cabinet seat. ''The President told me he thinks I can do what he wants done here,'' he said. ''So I have his confidence. And when U.N. matters are discussed he invites me to the Cabinet, so what do I lose?'' **********A Staff Shortfall **********Mr. Pickering failed to win Congressional backing for the higher pay and perks that he says the Mission needs to attract quality officials to New York. Washington's United Nations office is about 25 percent understaffed. **********On two occasions, Mr. Pickering's advice has been rejected by the Administration. Although he predicted that the Palestine Liberation Organization could be stopped from winning recognition as a state, as it was seeking at last year's General Assembly session, the State Department weighed in with a threat to bankrupt the organization if the P.L.O. was admitted as a nation. The Arabs nations decided eventually not to press the issue. **********Soon after, Vice President Dan Quayle demanded the repeal of a General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism, although Mr. Pickering, like other Western diplomats, judged this effort difficult without a Middle East breakthrough. **********Both episodes angered America's allies because they showed the United States in an arrogant light, trying to impose conditions even while owing the organization a half-billion dollars in dues. But many experts say a Cabinet seat and a big office in Washington would not have made much difference. **********Bush Under Nixon **********After all, George Bush was cast in the role of straw man by President Nixon, who left him struggling to keep China out of the United Nations in the early 1970's while Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger was secretly negotiating its admission in Beijing. **********And Daniel Patrick Moynihan, now the Democratic Senator from New York, had no illusions about his importance as a Cabinet officer when he served here under President Ford. **********He began ''A Dangerous Place,'' a book about his spell as United States permanent representative, by recalling the fate of many of his predecessors. He wrote: ''I had seen Stevenson humiliated. Goldberg betrayed. Ball diminished. Wiggins patronized. Yost ignored. Bush traduced. Scali savaged.'' **********''A man of Tom Pickering's experience knows his way around Washington and can get his views across effectively,'' a senior American diplomat said. ''But he is still basically an ambassador who most of the time carries out orders made by others.'' **********A Visible Post **********A direct, open man, Mr. Pickering always seemed assured of success. Born in 1931, he was educated at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Me., before attending the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and winning a Fulbright Scholarship to study in Australia. After State Department posts in intelligence and arms, he served as Deputy Chief of Mission in Tanzania and as special assistant to William P. Rogers and Mr. Kissinger when they were Secretary of State. **********He was Ambassador to Jordan, Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environment and Scientific Affairs, and Ambassador to Nigeria, El Salvador and Israel before taking the United Nations post. **********Despite its curtailed privileges, the United Nations job remains a singularly prestigious and visible post, one that involves dealing with 158 foreign governments at once. The job brings a rambling apartment at the top of the Waldorf Towers where Mr. Pickering lives with his wife, Alice, and their two children. The apartment costs the Government about $250,000 a year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/24/business/milken-plea-is-said-to-be-set-for-today.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1990-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 592, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Milken Plea Is Said to Be Set for Today", "print_headline": "Milken Plea Is Said to Be Set for Today", "body_text": " **********Michael R.

Dozen Youths Are Blamed **********Mr. Bontchev estimated that there are only about a dozen young Bulgarians who have written the viruses that have caused all the trouble. **********\"Computer hackers here write viruses to show who is who in computer science in Bulgaria, to find a place in the sun,\" said Slav Ivanov, editor of a Bulgarian computer magazine. **********One virus designer acknowledged that revenge was also a factor. **********\"I designed my first computer virus for revenge against people at work,\" said Lubomir Mateev, who helped write a nondestructive virus known as Murphy. \"Our first virus made all the computers at work send out a noise when they were switched on.\" **********Mr. Mateev, who is 23 years old, said he collaborated with Dark Avenger's designer last spring on a new virus that is harder to diagnose and cure because it is self-mutating. **********Attempts over several months to get in touch with Dark Avenger's creator proved fruitless. **********For now, Bulgaria's computer virus designers can act with legal immunity. \"We have no law on computer crime,\" said Mr. Ivanov, whose magazine offers free programs that cure Bulgarian viruses. \"The police are only superficially interested in this matter.\"  Government Not Suspected **********Bulgaria's secret-police computers have also been infected, said a well-placed Bulgarian computer expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity and refused to elaborate. **********Dark Avenger has also spread to the Soviet Union, Britain, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary, Mr. Bontchev said, adding, \"I've even had one report that it has popped up in Mongolia.\" **********Mr. Bontchev said he was almost certain Bulgaria's Government was not involved with Dark Avenger. \"A computer virus cannot be used as a weapon because it cannot be aimed accurately and can return like a boomerang,\" he said. \"It can be used only to cause random damage, like a terrorist bomb.\" **********Unlike less infectious viruses, Dark Avenger attacks computer data and programs when they are copied, printed or acted on in other ways by a computer's operating system, Mr. Bontchev said. The virus destroys information every 16th time an infected program is run. **********A virus can spread from one computer to another either on floppy disks or through computer modems or computer networks, he said. Many viruses are spread at computer fairs and through computer bulletin-board systems using telephones. **********\"Things may get much worse before they improve,\" Mr. Bontchev said. \"The first law of computer viruses is that if a virus can be made, it will be. The second law is that if a computer virus cannot be made, it will be anyway.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/23/business/new-chairman-at-circle-k.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 197, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Chairman At Circle K", "print_headline": "New Chairman At Circle K", "body_text": " **********The Circle K Corporation has appointed as its new chairman a Cincinnati lawyer who is a partner with the law firm representing the company's largest shareholder. **********Circle K, the nation's second-largest convenience-store chain after the 7-Eleven stores, named Bart A.

''I had not even touched a computer before I came here, because I never learned how to type,'' confessed a man recently hired as a senior marketing executive by a large computer company. He has now learned to type - and to use a computer. **********It is not just executives who shy away from keyboards. Factory workers, sales representatives, police officers, construction supervisors and millions of other nonoffice employees who might benefit from computer automation are left out because they cannot, or will not, use a keyboard. And even the willing find it hard to use a computer if they have to work standing up. **********Recognizing this, computer companies including the International Business Machines Corporation, Apple Computer Inc. and the smallest Silicon Valley newcomers are racing to develop notepad computers - lightweight machines that can be operated with pen-like styluses, using a flat screen as the writing surface. **********As the user writes on the screen - or, at least for now, carefully prints block letters or numbers - the computer converts them eletronically. Some software will also allow the user to employ the stylus for operations that do not involve handwriting. In much the way one works with a mouse, the user might drag symbols around on the screen, indicate choices from a menu, or put a check mark in a box on a form. Census takers, inventory clerks and workers at fast-food restaurants, among others, might well find the machine appealing. **********Apple's former head of product development, Jean-Louis Gassee, said earlier this year that stylus technology would eventually replace the Macintosh's famous mouse, which is more of a pointing device than a writing tool. **********Although the technology is still relatively crude, and for the time being useful only in narrow applications, electronic notepads have created a great deal of excitement in the industry. Grid Systems Inc., a division of the Tandy Corporation, has brought a notepad computer to market. And earlier this month, I.B.M. announced that it had entered into a joint venture with the fledgling Go Corporation of Foster City, Calif., to develop pen-based computers. **********''We see stylus-based systems as one of the most important applications to come along since the original PC in the 1970's,'' said Timothy P. Bajarin, executive vice president of Creative Strategies Research International, a consulting and market research company in Santa Clara, Calif. ''For the first time, it makes me believe that the PC can be used in a broad-based, Everyman-type situation. You've got so many people who don't use desktop computers or keyboards, and yet everyone uses a pen and writes.'' **********Other analysts, including a number of people who are in the business of developing stylus-based computers, say a little caution is appropriate. Vern Raburn, an industry veteran who is chairman of a notepad software development company called the Slate Corporation, in Scottsdale, Ariz., recently told PC Week magazine: **********''I don't want to see what happened to artificial intelligence and multimedia happen here. The biggest concern we have is overexpectation - that people are going to look at these machines and say, 'Wow! Magic Paper!' Will this be the machine that unlocks the world of computers for the great unwashed? No, nothing is.'' **********One problem is that handwriting recognition technology is still in its infancy. The Gridpad computer, which sells for $2,370, can recognize only carefully printed numbers and block-letter capitals, for example. Given the complexity of the algorithms needed to accomplish even that task, the prospect of developing a computer that can read most people's handwriting is daunting. **********I.B.M. researchers at Yorktown Heights, N.Y., last month announced that they had developed a system that could recognize many handwritten characters, including those that touched or overlapped. The I.B.M. system, called the Paperlike Interface, is said to ''read'' the handwriting immediately, with a high degree of accuracy, and convert it to computer text. **********The company's partnership with Go, which is developing both the hardware and the operating system for a stylus-based notepad, creates a formidable alliance. **********Other major companies, including the Japanese electronics giants Sony and Canon, are also pursuing the market. Sony, for example, recently introduced a palm-sized device called the PTC-500 which recognizes the Kanji characters used in Japan. There are no plans to introduce the machine in the United States, a Sony official said. **********Of course, drawing is not the primary issue with notepads; writing is. However, some people contend that even writing may be too hard for some users, or not sufficient for some tasks. They point to speech recognition technology as the eventual ways to open the doors to such people. But on a technical level, that is even more difficult than handwriting recognition. **********Other companies are exploring other input technologies, including but not restricted to styluses. The details of such research are closely guarded. The Momenta Corporation of Mountain View, Calif., for example, describes its as-yet-unannounced notepad machine only as radical and ''non-keyboard.'' **********Of the notepad computers already on the market, the best known is the Gridpad, from Grid Systems. The Gridpad proved to be a handy tool for such applications as filling out a traffic accident report or writing a sales ticket. It is not intended to be a general-purpose computer, although it is MS-DOS compatible and can be connected to a desktop PC in a variety of ways. **********The Gridpad is a 4.5-pound, 9-inch by 12-inch computer that looks, in the words of a Grid official, like a black ''Etch-a-Sketch'' toy. The machine has straps on the back that can hold it on the user's forearm. They are handy, because the computer can get awfully heavy at the end of a long shift. The straps also make it easier to hold the computer and write on it at the same time. **********The machine is not flawless. In tests it flubbed some characters and the screen image was quite dim. But this technology will surely improve. The larger test is whether software will be developed that will make the machine popular. **********Users will want highly specialized applications, and even entering a business form into the Gridpad requires an advanced programmer. Right now, there seems to be no way to use handwriting to enter data into Lotus 1-2-3, dBASE or other standard business applications. **********Other companies developing notepad products include Data Entry Systems Inc. of Huntsville, Ala., which sells a $1,595 machine, and Superscript Inc., of Cambridge, Mass., which is developing software. **********Are pen-based computer pads likely to have a substantial impact on the broader base of desktop personal computers in the next few years? ''It's very questionable at this point,'' said Michael S. Swaveley, president of the North American operations of the Compaq Computer Corporation. ''The technology is moving forward but it is far from 100 percent perfect.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/31/world/baker-s-tone-on-jerusalem-settlement-softens.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 504, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Baker's Tone on Jerusalem Settlement Softens", "print_headline": "Baker's Tone on Jerusalem Settlement Softens", "body_text": " **********Secretary of State James A.

Kemmerer, Wyo., plans to become a virtual J. C. Penney theme park. Gary, Ind., is promoting casino gambling. And places that do not already have football field-sized aquariums are quickly drawing plans for them. **********Officials of these towns say they hope that a metamorphosis that involves revamping their downtowns and imposing new building codes will create places that people will drive out of their way to visit and to spend money. **********''It's happening overnight,'' said David Edgell, director of policy and planning for the United States Travel and Tourism Administration, an agency of the Commerce Department. ''What people are doing may seem unbelievable.'' But, he added, many communities had proved that tourism can rebuild economies that might have otherwise faded with the paint on the town hall. **********Already there is a Swedish theme town - albeit with palm trees - in California, and Bavarian-style towns are springing up across the West. Festivals that were once held annually for just the local community have expanded into gigantic productions that celebrate everything from squid to Shakespeare. **********Behind these changes is the recognition that tourism is the third-largest retail service industry in the United States, employing six million people. In 1989, travelers in the United States spent more than $330 billion on goods and services, according to a Commerce Department study. **********That study said spending by visitors was becoming an increasingly effective economic development tool for rural areas. Tourism can replace agriculture and industry as a community's livelihood, the study said. **********''One of the major changes in thinking is tourism,'' said Matt Kane, a policy analyst for the Northeast-Midwest Institute, a economic research group based in Washington. ''Before it was part of a diversified approach. Now everybody is putting their eggs in one basket.'' **********May Be a Fad **********But Mr. Kane, the author of ''Economic Development: What Works at the Local Level,'' warned that tourism might be a fad. ''In the 70's, you saw the building of industrial parks. In the 80's, it was the microchip industry. The major push now is tourism.'' **********Mr. Kane said tourism could be part of a good strategy, but it could be disastrous for towns to rely on tourism alone. ''Tourism is very seasonal and very cyclical,'' he said. ''When the economy flattens and people have less money to spend, just watch what happens to all the fancy hotels that have been built.'' **********Still, there are some long-term success stories. One is Leavenworth, a town in the mining and logging area of central Washington state, about 120 miles from Seattle. Leavenworth is often lauded as the oldest and most successful example of a dying town that was resuscitated by tourism. **********Leavenworth's downturn, which began in the early 1940's, followed the pattern of many other communities hit hard by a changing manufacturing base and the resulting unemployment. By the end of World War II, Leavenworth's timber and mining industries had pulled out, stores were boarded up and more than half its population had moved. The final blow came when the railroad stopped serving the town, which is in a valley of the Cascade Mountains. **********In the late 1960's, after two decades of economic decline, the town of 1,600 people emerged as a Bavarian village, even though it had no real ethnic German community. Today the town, framed by mountains and waterfalls that inspired the Bavarian theme, is a picture postcard of prosperity. **********The boarded-up storefronts have been replaced by antique shops and beer halls. Chalet-style motels cannot be built fast enough to keep up with demand. Retailers, many of whom dress in Lederhosen year round, say that 1989 was their best year. **********''It was pretty scary going in,'' said Laura Jobin, director of the Leavenworth Chamber of Commerce, who grew up in the town. ''People said the idea would never work, but we had hit rock bottom. What were our choices?'' **********Leavenworth transformed its face in less than five years, and by 1970, tourism was the town's major industry. Even though the nearest large city, Seattle, is two hours away, a million people a year visit the town. Leavenworth officials get 50 to 60 inquiries a year from as far away as Japan asking how they did it. **********Massachusetts Rain Forest **********On the East Coast, Chicopee, a Western Massachusetts industrial city of about 50,000 just north of Springfield, has seen scores of manufacturers pull out since the 1970's. Officials paid a design firm, Cambridge Seven Associates in Cambridge, Mass., $75,000 to come up with an idea to attract new business using an abandoned electrical plant where toxic wastes are stored. **********The first idea was to build an aquarium large enough to gain national recognition, but too many other places, including Baltimore and Mystic, Conn., already had them. So the design firm proposed turning the aging plant on the muddy Connecticut River into a $25 million Amazon rain forest. **********''It's a very ambitious concept,'' acknowledged Thomas Haberlin, Chicopee's community development director. But he said feasibility studies had shown that projected economic growth would justify the conversion. **********''With the state government turning from poor to terrible, we've had some doubts expressed,'' Mr. Haberlin said. ''But there really aren't any alternatives.'' **********Cambridge Seven is involved in other town projects. It designed a $30 million freshwater aquarium on the banks of the Tennessee River in Chattanooga, Tenn. That city, like many of the firm's other clients, is economically depressed and hopes tourism will help. ''It's like changing a city with one building,'' said Peter Chermayeff, the firm's founder and vice president. **********Homage to J. C. Penney **********Not all places have the aspiration or can raise the millions of dollars needed to bring large projects to life. But the economic development offices in towns even as small as a few thousand are scurrying for a niche that might tap new sources of revenue - sometimes with quirky ideas. **********Unemployment and an exodus of young people have plagued Kemmerer, Wyo., home of the nation's largest open coal pit. That moved Kemmerer to try to capitalize on its place as the home of the original J. C. Penney store. **********The southwestern Wyoming town, which is near the Utah border, already has a J. C. Penney museum and a J. C. Penney boardwalk. There are now plans to restore the original store and the boarded-up downtown area, all using the J. C. Penney theme. ''People get real excited about J. C. Penney here,'' said Steve Golnar, the city's administrator. He said the project had prompted interest from top Penney executives. **********Thomas Griffo, a J. C. Penney Company district manager whose territory includes Wyoming, emphasized that the company was not behind Kemmerer's plan. But he added that J. C. Penney ''may be spending some monies to bring in some of the old look'' of the original store. **********Indiana Casino Plan **********Not all of the places taking bold steps are rural. Gary, Ind., a city of about 130,000 in the Chicago metropolitan area, has lost a third of its population since the steel industry collapse. It is counting on the Indiana Legislature to approve the construction of five casino hotels along Lake Michigan. The city's Economic Development Office projects that the hotels will generate $800,000 million in gaming revenues annually and employ thousands. **********''Nobody else is going to employ 25,000 people off the bat,'' said Karen Williams, a city spokeswoman. ''Casinos have the most impact in the shortest amount of time. We simply can't wait 10 or 15 years.'' **********Though some projects may appear frivolous, some say it may be more foolish not to try. **********''Structurally, the economy has changed so much that the economic conditions that created these towns 100 and 200 years ago just aren't there any longer,'' said B. J. Reed, an associate professor of public administration at the University of Nebraska in Omaha, who advises community and business leaders in dying towns. **********''In the long run, it is desperate,'' Mr. Reed said. ''Unless these towns can find a viable economic base or just retain what they have, they simply have no justification to exist.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/06/business/company-news-lionel-is-urged-to-sell-big-stake.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 207, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Lionel Is Urged To Sell Big Stake", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Lionel Is Urged To Sell Big Stake", "body_text": " **********An investment group led by a Florida brokerage, which controls a 5 percent stake in the Lionel Corporation, has asked the New York toy retailer to set up a committee to consider the sale of a large stake in the company. **********The brokerage, Trendex Capital Management, said that after a New York investor, Robert I.

Gorbachev. **********The idea of endowing the President with new emergency powers was proposed last week by Mr. Gorbachev and endorsed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party amid claims that the current system was too slow in dealing with outbreaks of ethnic violence and economic crises. **********The official Soviet press agency Tass said tonight that the 41-member Presidium, or executive committee, of the legislature had met today with Mr. Gorbachev presiding and voted unanimously to press quickly for constitutional changes to create ''a democratic presidential power.'' **********A special session of the full 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies would also have the authority to abolish the Communist Party's constitutional monopoly on political power and open the way to a multiparty system, steps endorsed in the new Communist Party platform adopted last week. **********Sweeping Powers Suggested **********The party platform, which Tass published tonight for the first time, did not specify what new powers should be given to the President, but the wording suggested that it should be sweeping. **********The platform declared: ''A President is needed to maintain the country's stable development, to speed up perestroika, to guarantee its irreversibility, to insure the normal and effective functioning of all state and public institutions in the process of democratization, to insure law and citizens' security, to protect the Soviet Union's interests and to represent our state in the international arena.'' **********The idea of creating a stronger chief executive appears to have widespread support here, but critics say Mr. Gorbachev should not be given the new post without facing a direct, competitive nationwide election. **********While legislative leaders moved quickly to execute the party's proposals, there were signs that Mr. Gorbachev's blueprint for the country was arousing dissatisfaction among the military leadership. **********General Mikhail A. Moiseyev, the armed forces chief of staff, said in a weekend interview with the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda that the party platform ''contained too many generalities'' and ''belittled'' the army. **********Morale Problems in the Military **********General Moiseyev's unusually critical comments included charges that the party had ignored deep morale problems in the military brought on by draft evasion, desertion of ethnic minorities and the slashing of the professional officer corps because of troop withdrawals in Eastern Europe. **********The general disclosed that in last fall's call-up, 6,000 young men had resisted the draft, often with the cooperation of local Communist Party and Government agencies. The opposition was strongest in the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and other regions pressing for independence from Moscow. **********In the southern republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia, General Moiseyev added, 1,200 deserters had fled the army, many of them to join up with ethnic commando units. **********The party platform published tonight is a draft to be presented at a nationwide Communist Party congress in the summer. It is clearly a compromise document, bowing simultaneously to Mr. Gorbachev's program and to familiar basics of Communist doctrine, leaving individual Communists broad leeway for interpretation. **********Soviet legislators seeking the guidance of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the issue of whether to allow private property will not find those words in the text, but they will find this: ''The C.P.S.U. believes that the existence of labor-individual property, including ownership of the means of production, does not contradict the modern stage in the country's economic development.'' Which Means of Production?  Soviet economists sometimes use the phrase ''labor-individual'' property to mean the things workers use in their jobs. An orthodox economist would conclude that individual farmers could own their own tractors, but not entire farms. But ''ownership of the means of production'' might be interpreted to mean private farms and factories. **********The draft platform calls for elections to become ''an honest competition'' open to all ''public organizations and movements.'' **********''The development of society does not preclude the possibility of forming parties,'' the draft says. ''The procedure for their formation will be established by law and reflected in the constitution of the U.S.S.R. **********''The formation and activity of organizations and movements that expound violence and inter-ethnic strife and that pursue extremist, unconstitutional aims should be prohibited by law.'' **********The platform promises to submit an amendment to Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution, which establishes the party as ''the leading and guiding force'' in Soviet society. **********The party's ''role is to be a democratically recognized political leader acting through Communists and not seeking advantages nor establishing a privileged status for itself in the U.S.S.R. Constitution,'' the text says. **********The proposal to create a strong presidential government has arisen repeatedly in the soviet press, sponsored in some cases by writers with close ties to the party leadership. **********Although Mr. Gorbachev is already head of state, chairman of the legislature and leader of the Defense Council, advocates of a new system contend that he lacks the flexibility to take rapid executive action, like sending troops to trouble spots or imposing emergency economic measures. **********A Major Overhaul **********Creation of a presidential government would mean a major overhaul of the parliamentary system enacted less than a year ago. **********The current system includes the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies, which selects from its own ranks a 542-member standing Parliament, called the Supreme Soviet, and its executive committee, called the Presidium. The chairman of the Presidium is generally referred to as President, but in domestic affairs he is in theory required to consult with the rest of the Presidium. **********Yuri N. Afanasyev, a historian and leader of the parliamentary opposition, has strongly opposed the proposed revamping of the system. **********''We are witnessing the creation of authoritarian-totalitarian power headed by the initiator of perestroika,'' Mr. Afanasyev warned on Saturday. Other advocates of more far-reaching change said they supported the notion but felt that before getting new powers, Mr. Gorbachev should run in a nationwide election. **********Neither the party document nor the announcement today indicates how the President would be selected. Party leaders have indicated that they hope to have the Parliament appoint Mr. Gorbachev to the new post for the duration of his current term - until 1994 -and begin popular elections to the post after that. **********Tass said the parliamentary leaders had also sent the legislature draft laws creating procedures for a republic to secede from the union. **********Two Baltic republics, Lithuania and Estonia, have approved laws challenging their forced 1940 incorporation into the Soviet Union, setting the stage for a showdown this year over their quest for independence. **********The reports tonight provided no details of the proposed legislation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/03/business/debentures-priced-by-fannie-mae.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 147, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Debentures Priced By Fannie Mae", "print_headline": "Debentures Priced By Fannie Mae", "body_text": " **********The Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, yesterday priced a total of $1.3 billion in four-year and 10-year debentures through its regular selling group of securities dealers. **********Because of the Fourth of July holiday tomorrow, the Government agency moved up its debenture offering a day.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell by 6.30, or 1.7 percent, to 355.31. [Page D1.]  Growing Apprehension The profit disappointments came at a time of growing apprehension about the health of the financial system -many large bank stocks are trading at their lowest levels in two years - that had generally not hurt the stock market up to now. While share prices were not as expensive, measured against such indicators as earnings and interest rates, as they were in the summer of 1987, they were approaching that level, according to many analysts. **********''The market had reached overvalued levels, the economy is sluggish, and corporate profits, while they are not horrendous, are well below the levels of expectations that were built into prices,'' said Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief American strategist for Barclays de Zoete Wedd Research. **********The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates slightly two weeks ago, providing some help for share prices, but worries that interest rates would not fall further, and might rise, have grown. Those fears intensified yesterday after rates in Japan rose overnight, and share prices declined in Tokyo, with the Nikkei 225-stock index off 1.6 percent. But in early trading today the Nikkei's losses were trimmed. At the close of the morning session, the average was down by 67.66 points, to 31,827.13, a decline of about two-tenths of a percent. **********Rates Quickly Turn Down **********Interest rates were up in early New York trading yesterday, but quickly turned down after stock prices cracked, as traders seeking safety bought Treasury securities. **********The suddenness of the plunge stunned many traders, recalling the 190-point fall on Oct. 13, 1989. But while there were a pair of causes that touched off that slide - including the collapse of financing for a takeover of United Airlines and a Washington setback to efforts to lower capital gains taxes - there were no such ready explanations yesterday morning, although some pointed to the continued rise of oil prices and to the fact that McDonald's, a consumer growth stock and market leader up until now, reported poor earnings late Friday. The company fell $1.50 that day and another $3 today, closing at $33 a share. **********The plunge may have been accelerated by the fact many brokers had built up inventories of shares in recent weeks as the Dow neared 3,000, a point at which it was hoped that buyers would come flooding in. Last week, the average traded over that level on three days, but never closed there. In addition, there had been a widespread expectation on Friday that prices would rise in late trading as the scheduled expiration of a stock index futures contract in Chicago touched off a wave of buying. Instead, the buying from that was minor and was overwhelmed by late selling from other areas. **********Some analysts said the decline was exaggerated by changes in the securities industry in recent years. With commission rates on stock trades falling steadily, the big brokerage houses seem less willing to risk their own capital to buy stocks that institutions are selling. Without that buying support, the volatility of stock prices is increased. **********With buyers returning in the afternoon, the day ended as only the third worst decline of the Dow in 1990, and there were indications that some buyers were betting that the market would bounce back quickly. **********Robert Farrell, the chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that it appeared more retail customers at his firm were inclined ''to want to buy something'' rather than to ''panic and sell.'' **********Impact of 'Circuit Breakers' **********The ''circuit breakers'' in effect at futures exchanges - most importantly the one at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which trades contracts on the Standard & Poor's 500 index - seem to have had a dual impact. They may first have accelerated the drop, but then stabilized the market. **********The rule on the S.&P. provided that if the September futures contract fell 12 points - about 3.3 percent - there could be no trading below that level for 30 minutes. When prices began to near that amount just after 10:30 A.M., there appeared to be a ''magnet effect,'' in which they fell to the level. Prices in the stock market at first continued lower, but then rallied, helping the futures quotes recover. **********In the afternoon, when the market again sagged, S.&P. futures prices fell even lower. There was no circuit breaker then, and there would not have been one unless prices fell 20 points, but the market nonetheless rallied. **********Rules Proposed by Exchange **********The New York Stock Exchange has proposed rules to halt stock trading for 30 minutes if the Dow falls 100 points in a day, but they are awaiting approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission and by other exchanges, and were not in effect. **********The Big Board did, however, put into effect a ''side car'' rule in which some program trades related to index arbitrage were delayed for five minutes after the futures circuit breaker was set off. The immediate effect of that was to cause some program trades to be executed at a loss, some traders said. **********In recent weeks, as the Dow rose while many stocks were weakening, traders had increasingly focused on two groups: computer stocks, which were market stars early in the year, and companies that were thought to have consistent growth in profits, whatever happened to the economy. It was in that context that disappointments in such companies as McDonald's and Texas Instruments may have demoralized money managers, and made them hesitate to buy when prices tumbled yesterday. **********Volume yesterday, at 209 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, was heavier than usual, but by no means as heavy as in previous big drops. That fact served to reinforce the feelings of some traders that the markets have become more fragile, able to plunge with only limited selling pressure. **********Reports from some brokerage houses yesterday said there was only limited selling of stocks by institutions. But there seems to have been more selling of stock index futures in an effort to hedge portfolios against further losses. That selling was then translated back to the stock market through index arbitrage, in which traders sold stocks while buying the futures contracts. **********The Big Board asked that brokers refrain from some forms of index arbitrage after the large fall in the morning, but some of it continued, traders said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/15/business/piper-aircraft-s-rescuer-falters.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Weiner", "pub_date": "1990-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1405, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Piper Aircraft's Rescuer Falters", "print_headline": "Piper Aircraft's Rescuer Falters", "body_text": " **********For M. Stuart Millar, a man once heralded as the savior of the struggling small-airplane industry, the dream has run into the reality. **********A World War II fighter pilot with a passion for aviation and a solid track record in business, Mr. Millar set the industry on its ear in 1987 after acquiring the troubled Piper Aircraft Corporation, a company whose name has long been synonymous with small private planes. **********In a business where liability insurance is the safety net against the huge lawsuits resulting from crashes, Mr. Millar decided to forgo it. When rising prices were the norm, he slashed his own by 20 percent, offering a plane for as little as $45,000 when the cheapest model from other companies cost twice as much. And when it was still unclear whether demand for small planes would grow, he cranked up Piper's production line and introduced new designs. **********Mr. Millar has indeed raised Piper's sales and orders strikingly. But recently it has become evident that his daring plan has begun to unravel. Industry analysts said Piper's woes could be traced to underfinancing and an unrealistic business plan under which the company, hoping to build a loyal customer base, sold hundreds of discounted planes at a loss. **********A Two-Week Furlough **********To deal with what Piper executives described as a cash flow problem, the company last month furloughed nearly all of its 1,600 employees for two weeks. Rumors circulated that the Vero Beach, Fla., company, in debt to many vendors, was preparing to file for bankruptcy protection. **********Piper executives say their problems are only a temporary setback. They are quick to point to the company's large backlog of orders for Piper planes ranging from the $45,000 single-engine trainer to a twin-engine turboprop model that costs several million dollars. Meanwhile, Mr. Millar has been talking to domestic and foreign corporations in hopes of attracting investors. **********Mr. Millar's task will not be easy; he is trying to succeed at the low end of the market, where giant competitors like General Dynamics, which owns Cessna Aircraft, and Raytheon, which owns Beech, have failed. Both companies are no longer making planes that sell for less than $100,000, citing a decline in the number of private pilots to buy the planes and the cost of liability insurance to protect themselves against large lawsuits. They have moved toward selling larger jets - a business that Piper is not in. **********Last year, the general-aviation industry sold 1,143 planes, down from nearly 18,000 in 1978. General-aviation planes range from single-engine propeller planes like Piper's to $23 million business jets. **********The sales decline of the 1980's was evident at Piper. In 1987, when it was owned by Forstmann Little & Company, the New York buyout firm, Piper was building fewer than 300 airplanes a year - less than a tenth of its peak in the late 1970's. The company, which employed more than 8,000 people in the late 1970's, had only 750 on its payroll. **********The company's troubles attracted the attention of Mr. Millar, then a computer entrepreneur, who owned a Piper plane. ''I was shocked at what I saw,'' Mr. Millar, now 65 years old, said of a visit to the Piper factory. ''I hadn't realized that the industry for small aircraft had dropped so precipitously.'' **********In 1987 he bought the failing company from Forstmann Little for what aviation industry executives estimated was $6 million. Terms of the deal were never disclosed, but it was clear that the low price was partly due to the fact that the buyer was assuming potential liability for every plane made by Piper since 1937 -more than 100,000 airplanes. **********By daring to expand production to 14 models from just a few, and marketing more aggressively, Mr. Millar breathed new life into Piper. Airplane sales rose to $90.5 million last year from $50.7 million in 1988. The company's backlog grew to $175 million from about $8 million. At the same time, amounts paid out in lawsuits dropped by a third. The number of workers doubled. Morale rose for the first time in years. **********One of Mr. Millar's first moves as the company's new owner, president and chairman was to resurrect the Piper Cub, an airplane in which thousands of pilots have learned to fly since the 1940's. ''It was one of the great utility airplanes,'' Mr. Millar said. ''Alaska wouldn't be a state if it wasn't for the Piper Cub.'' **********Piper sold more than a hundred of the spartan Cubs to doctors, lawyers and airline pilots who were willing to pay $50,000 to taste a simpler era of flight. Although the Cub had new radios and instruments, it was basically the same plane that carried Mr. Millar aloft on his first flight in 1940. **********Sensing a growing market for the training planes used primarily by flying schools - to replace a fleet whose average age is more than 20 years - Mr. Millar stripped down a Piper model and created a no-frills training plane called the Cadet. Piper was determined to build a loyal customer base by luring people into aviation, and the company sold hundreds of the planes. Mr. Millar ''became an industry spokesman for the downtrodden masses who previously couldn't afford flying,'' an industry executive said. **********But, priced at $45,000, the plane was a money loser. Piper could cover only labor and material, not overhead or dealer discounts. **********''We're a victim of our own success,'' said C. Raymond Johnson, who was recently appointed president of the company. **********Credit Stretched **********But critics have argued that Piper is actually a victim of poor planning and inadequate financing. Airplane companies are more assemblers than manufacturers, relying on as many as 400 vendors to supply the parts, engines and radios that make a plane. In its headlong rush to regain its former glory, Piper had stretched its credit with those vendors to the limit. **********''He was depending on the munificence of his suppliers,'' said James Holahan, editor of Aviation International News, an industry publication. ''They finally lost patience.'' In deciding to forgo liability insurance, Mr. Millar chose to do battle in the courtroom. Employing a staff of what Mr. Johnson called the ''meanest bunch of junkyard-dog lawyers,'' the company refuses to settle a case out of court if it thinks its plane was not at fault. ''We refuse to pay extortion money,'' Mr. Millar said. **********For the most part, the strategy has paid off, Mr. Millar said. Awards against the company dropped to $8 million last year from about $30 million a year when Mr. Millar bought the company. **********Piper can take such a risky strategy because its corporate pockets are not nearly as deep as those of a company like Raytheon or General Dynamics. Still, losing one huge lawsuit could mean the end of Piper. **********The strategy has backfired on at least one occasion. In 1988, Piper was sued for an accident involving a twin-engine model called Aztec. Arthur Wolk, the plaintiff's attorney, offered to settle the case for $800,000. Piper declined. A jury awarded the plaintiff $4.7 million. **********Mr. Millar has taken other unconventional steps that have made him something of a folk figure in the industry. When one of his most popular models, a high-performance six-seat plane that sells for about $350,000, developed an engine problem, Mr. Millar promptly grounded the fleet and provided free first-class airline tickets to owners until the defect had been repaired. All told, 893 people took him up on the offer, which cost the company $2 million. **********Ultimately, Piper's biggest challenge may be a lack of customers. The number of pilots in the United States has dropped by about 15 percent in the last eight years. Industry analysts trace the decline to the rising cost of flying and the decline of the industry itself. **********Meanwhile, Mr. Millar said he hopes to arrange additional financing within 60 days, using the company's $50 million in real estate assets as leverage. But the search for backers has not been easy.

Although the campaign frequently was criticized as dull, preliminary figures showed that more than 80 percent of the 1.6 million registered voters cast ballots. **********Both major parties mobilized nationwide transportation networks to take their supporters to the polls. As caravans crisscrossed the country, voters hung out the vehicles' windows waving their parties' multicolored flags. **********Rival supporters blasted each other with horns, beeped in unison to the rhythm of their candidate's name. Hour after hour, wave by pounding wave, the strident battle swept across San Jose. **********The Government gave 10,000 children, some only 4 years old, their first taste of the political process by helping them to register and vote.

Then he used his country's oil wealth to expand the role of the state in the economy and tohelp finance and arm the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua.

In a recent survey of 120 of its M-1 subcontractors, General Dynamics found that 15 percent would have to close a plant if production of the tank program was ended. **********A Ripple Effect **********The M-1 program is just one example of how the coming Pentagon budget cuts would ripple through thousands of subcontractors in all 50 states. Such smaller companies heavily dependent on military contracts are particularly vulnerable to the upheaval and accelerated consolidation that awaits the military-supply industry as it enters the post-cold war era. **********Lakewood, for example, derives more than 50 percent of its $6.5 million in annual sales from subcontracting work for General Dynamics on the M-1 and employs half its 95 employees on the program. Its executives are already preparing for the changes ahead. **********''We're aggressively trying to diversify into commercial markets, and we think we'll be able to replace some of the M-1 work, but we'll be hurt,'' said Richard C. Peplin Jr., the company's owner. ''Some people will be laid off, and the company will go backward to some extent.'' **********While the ranks of subcontractors include large corporations like Texas Instruments Inc. and the General Electric Company, most lack the size, the name recognition and the political influence of prime contractors like General Dynamics. But the business of supplying nuts and bolts, wing sections, radar equipment, microchips and other components is an immense enterprise that cuts across regional economies and industry lines. **********On most arms programs, roughly half the budget ultimately flows to subcontractors. Last year, for example, when the Pentagon awarded $120 billion of prime contracts, more than $56 billion was farmed out to subcontractors, many of which rely on yet another tier of suppliers for the parts they need. 5 Percent Cuts Ahead Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is lobbying Congress to limit cuts in the Pentagon's $300 billion budget to about 2 percent a year through 1997. But Congress seems certain to insist upon deeper cuts, probably in the range of 5 percent a year after accounting for inflation. **********Cuts of that magnitude would reduce the size of the United States military force by as much as 25 percent. They would also mean canceling, delaying or scaling back most big weapons programs. In addition to the M-1 tank program, Mr. Cheney has already recommended cuts in other high-profile systems like the B-2 Stealth bomber being built by the Northrop Corporation and thousands of subcontractors. **********The weapons industry is not the only one in which subcontractors are put at risk when the business cycle turns down, as suppliers to the automobile industry have long known. But analysts and industry executives think the current political atmosphere will mean a permanent reduction in the size of the military contracting industry. **********A Decade of Pressure **********The last decade has left many military subcontractors battered by foreign competition and squeezed by new Government rules that lowered the allowable profit margin on contracts and raised the costs of dealing with the Pentagon bureaucracy, which stepped up its oversight and demanded more paperwork. A half-dozen Government and private studies now conclude that further weakening could imperil national security. **********''If present trends persist, the once-mighty arsenal of democracy could become little more than an electronic laboratory, perhaps even incapable of manufacturing the materiel required for deterrence or for protecting U.S. national interests around the globe,'' said a report issued last year by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan research group in Washington. **********A Faster Exodus **********The center estimated that the number of companies doing military contracting work decreased to fewer than 40,000 in 1987, from 138,000 in 1982. Government officials and private analysts say budget cuts will only speed that exodus. ''There is no question that we have already lost a significant number of subcontractors and suppliers,'' said Senator Jeff Bingaman, the New Mexico Democrat who is chairman of a subcommittee on the military contracting industry, ''and budget cuts are one additional element that will adversely affect them.'' **********Michael Quinn, the director of marketing and program operations at Cadillac Gauge Textron, a division of Textron Inc., said that if the M-1 program ended, the company would probably have to lay off at least half of its 65 skilled engineers and hundreds of production workers. **********''The state of the art would stop advancing and our ability to remain competitive internationally would erode,'' Mr. Quinn said. ''More important, when there's a new generation of technology, we'll be starting over with amateurs. If suddenly the Russians weren't withdrawing or some other threat appeared, it would be at least four years until we could support a tank production effort.'' **********The same types of issues are already facing other subcontractors across the country. Texas Instruments said earlier this month that it would eliminate 1,000 of the 22,000 jobs in its military systems division, reflecting declining demand for its military electronics products, which are used in scores of weapons systems. The P.V. Tool Company in Westbury, L.I., a precision-tool maker that gets 80 percent of its business from the nearby Grumman Corporation, has seen annual revenues fall by almost 40 percent as Grumman programs like the F-14 Navy fighter plane and the A-6 attack plane are scaled back or canceled. **********Paring Back Suppliers **********Even where programs have not been canceled, the prospect of budget cuts is squeezing subcontractors, as prime contractors pare back the number of suppliers they deal with, seeking to give their business to those who consistently deliver the best price and the best quality. **********''The aerospace industry is cutting back its supplier base, and it's doing it by selecting those suppliers that are improving their operations,'' said Ted Tiaga, the owner of Golden Eagle Manufacturing, a metal-working company in San Dimas, Calif., which makes parts for missiles and torpedoes. **********The prime contractors, seeking to keep their own plants and personnel busy, are also starting to do some work themselves that they formerly would have subcontracted. ''When the defense budget is growing, it's easier to farm the work out,'' said William B. Burnett, a vice president at the consulting firm Charles River Associates. ''When the budget is shrinking, the primes are more likely to keep the work in-house.'' **********Competition Intensifies **********The battle to get business from prime contractors has become increasingly intense. In some cases, suppliers are cutting their prices significantly, seeking to win enough business just to keep operating. **********Lamsco West Inc. in Santa Clarita, Calif., recently bid for some additional work making portions of the outer skin of the B-2 Stealth bomber, offering to do the work at its cost. The company lost out to another subcontractor that was willing to do the work for even less. **********''Some of these small shops almost have to take business at less than cost in order to at least meet their overhead expenses,'' said Gladden Baldwin, the general manager of Lamsco West. **********More Nonmilitary Work **********Many subcontractors are looking for more nonmilitary work. Golden Eagle Manufacturing, which relies on military business for 95 percent of its revenues, wants half its business to be commercial, Mr. Tiaga said. It has already had some success making parts for the water-purification industry and for medical instruments. **********But most commercial markets are already highly competitive, and many subcontractors admit they are likely to have only limited success with diversification. Moreover, for many companies, nonmilitary business is not a realistic option. **********''Everything we do is designed for the life-and-death defense situation,'' said Mr. Quinn of Cadillac Gauge. ''If we were to build a commercial product it would probably be overpriced by five or six times.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/12/world/evolution-in-europe-perez-de-cuellar-visits-albanians.html": {"writer_name": "David Binder", "pub_date": "1990-05-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 671, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Evolution in Europe;   PEREZ DE CUELLAR VISITS ALBANIANS", "print_headline": "Evolution in Europe;   PEREZ DE CUELLAR VISITS ALBANIANS", "body_text": " **********Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar of the United Nations flew here today for talks with Albania's Communist leaders. The Albanians see the visit as an opportunity to advance the opening of their isolated and restricted country. **********It was the first visit here by a Secretary General, who came at the invitation of President Ramiz Alia's Government. Thousands of Albanians lined the narrow road from the airport and thousands more stood along the streets of this capital of 300,000 people to glimpse the cavalcade of eight cars carrying the hosts and guests. **********The crowds were silent as the cars passed along streets normally crowded with pedestrians, horse carts and ancient trucks or buses. But they stared intensely at the passing parade. **********Touring Eastern Europe **********The widely publicized visit of Mr. Perez de Cuellar, who has been touring Eastern European countries in a United Nations jet, was celebrated in the Albanian press, as was the presence of a dozen journalists representing publications from the United States, Spain, Brazil, France, Portugal, China, Japan, West Germany and Italy. **********Mr. Alia is apparently using the presence of the United Nations chief and the non-Communist journalists in his effort to push back what is believed to be opposition to his ''democratization'' policy from powerful Stalinist elements in the sole political organization, the Party of Labor, as the Communists are called here. **********Mr. Alia has been in power since the death in 1985 of his predecessor, Enver Hoxha, but only recently has he moved to change the authoritarian policies of the man who ruled Albania for four decades. **********Albanian Government officials and journalists said as much, and Ismail Kadare, the country's leading novelist, remarked in a brief interview today that the Mr. Perez de Cuellar's visit could be viewed as ''part of the process of democratization in Albania.'' **********''There is joy among the people these days about these developments,'' he said. **********Fundamental Change Sensed **********There is a sense here that for the first time since World War II Albania is undergoing fundamental change from a rigid Communist police state to a more participatory society and the introduction of elements of democracy. **********The visit started with traditional airport protocol. The Secretary General shook hands with the ambassadors from Eastern and Western nations who reside here. **********The accents in the welcoming remarks of Foreign Minister Reis Malile reflected Albania's new attitude. **********Petraq Pojani, the Foreign Ministry's spokesman, said Mr. Malile spoke of Albania's desire to ''strengthen cooperation with the United Nations and to make every effort to contribute to the work of the U.N.,'' where Albania has long been a relatively inactive member. **********Mr. Malile emphasized that Albania was ''a small country.'' Its population is 3.3 million. But he said that henceforth Albania intended to take part more actively not only in the United Nations but also in the 6-nation Balkan cooperation talks that began two years ago in Belgrade and in the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. **********Issue of 6 in Italian Embassy **********For his part, Mr. Perez de Cuellar praised Albania's ''strong commitment to independence.'' **********While his talks dealt in the generalities of international affairs, there is expectation that the Secretary General may be confronted with a specific issue. **********Six Albanians have been taking refuge in the Italian Embassy here since December 1985 and have refused to leave even with a promise of Albanian exit visas. This has not changed, although Parliament this week passed a law permitting all Albanians to travel abroad. **********According to Albanian officials, Mr. Perez de Cuellar may be asked to provide a diplomatic means for the six Albanians to leave under United Nations auspices."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/01/world/cambodia-asserts-us-guerrilla-ties.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Pear", "pub_date": "1990-01-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 717, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CAMBODIA ASSERTS U.S. GUERRILLA TIES", "print_headline": "CAMBODIA ASSERTS U.S. GUERRILLA TIES", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Hun Sen expressed concern today that Khmer Rouge forces were coordinating military operations and strategy with non-Communist guerrilla armies supported by the United States, and he said the Khmer Rouge had obtained weapons from the non-Communist factions. **********In an interview, the Prime Minister said Khmer Rouge guerrillas had received American-made antitank weapons from the non-Communist forces despite Washington's assertion that such arms transfers had not occurred. **********The Cambodian Government is fighting a three-party coalition made up of the Communist Khmer Rouge and two non-Communist guerrilla groups led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Son Sann, a former Prime Minister. **********Displays M-16 Rifles **********Mr. Hun Sen displayed M-16 rifles and grenade launchers that he said had been seized from Khmer Rouge guerrillas during fighting in October. He said that the guerrillas had obtained the weapons from Prince Sihanouk's army. **********There was no way to verify the source of the weapons independently, and Mr. Hun Sen did not say how many weapons the Khmer Rouge had obtained from the Sihanouk army. **********Cambodian officials and foreign diplomats said the war was confined mainly to three provinces along the Thai border and appeared to be at an impasse. **********The 38-year-old Prime Minister said that Cambodia would hold national elections by early 1991 regardless of whether his Government reaches a negotiated political settlement with the guerrilla forces. **********The Prime Minister said he hoped to achieve a political settlement of the civil war so the United Nations could send experts to Cambodia to ''organize the elections.'' Opposition candidates, including Prince Sihanouk, could then take part in the voting, he said. **********International Observers Invited **********In the absence of a political solution, Mr. Hun Sen said, Cambodia plans to organize elections by itself and invite international observers to monitor the vote. His comments were the most explicit statement by any Cambodian official of the Government's intention to hold elections monitored by international observers. **********Gen. Peng Path, a Vice Minister of Defense, said in an interview that the tactics of the Khmer Rouge were more clever and sophisticated than those of the non-Communist factions. The Khmer Rouge forces, led by Pol Pot, save their ammunition and quietly send infiltrators deep into Cambodia while allowing the non-Communist forces to assault Cambodian Government positions near the border, he said. If the guerrilla coalition starts to prevail, the Khmer Rouge would be the first to arrive in Phnom Penh and would be in a better position to seize power, he said. **********Thus, he concluded: ''The most dangerous enemy is Pol Pot. The Khmer Rouge is more patient, more persistent, and can endure more'' than the non-Communist factions. **********Mr. Hun Sen said, ''U.S. arms that were provided to the other side could not fail to fall into the hands of the Khmer Rouge.'' **********Artillery Support Cited **********Khieu Kanharith, editor of the weekly newspaper Kampuchea, said the Khmer Rouge had provided artillery support to the guerrillas. **********Gen. Peng Path said that Phnom Penh had received most of its weapons from Moscow and that there had been no change in the level of arms shipments in the last six months. **********Mr. Hun Sen said the date for elections would be set by the National Assembly. Several Cambodian officials said they were considering dates in the first half of 1990. **********''If there is a political solution, we would organize elections within the framework of that solution,'' Mr. Hun Sen said. ''If there is no political solution, we would have to organize elections on a unilateral basis. One way or the other, elections will be held.'' **********The United States and most Western countries have refused to recognize the current Phnom Penh Government, saying it is illegitimate because it was installed by Vietnamese invaders in January 1979. **********The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975 to January 1979.

The surcharge will be quoted separately from the fare by travel agents and airline reservation agents. It will also be listed as a separate charge on the ticket. **********Other airlines are expected to match the increases, even if the higher fares cost them some passengers at a time of year when fares usually go down as traffic slows. But if even one big airline refuses, the increases would probably be withdrawn by the rest of the carriers. **********The increases come on top of a 4 percent rise in fares that some airlines began several weeks ago, also to cover fuel costs, which have risen to 90 cents a gallon and higher, from 60 cents only last month. Supplies of jet fuel have tightened as refiners have switched more production to heating oil during the unusually cold weather of recent months. **********Underestimated Fuel Cost **********Donald J. Carty, senior vice president of finance and planning at the AMR Corporation, parent of American Airlines, said the nation's largest carrier had expected that fuel would cost about 65 cents a gallon in January. **********''Somehow the airlines are going to have to get more for their product than they have been getting to ameliorate this fuel price increase,'' he said. **********Fuel is one of the largest costs for airlines, ranging from 30 percent of operating costs for carriers with older fleets to 20 percent for carriers with newer, more fuel-efficient fleets. **********The price in jet fuel is still rising even though prices for heating oil, which surged in December, have begun to fall. Heating oil, at $1.10 a gallon in the last week of December, has been selling for about 70 cents a gallon for January delivery in the New York area. **********Oil analysts said the increase in the production of heating oil to meet the high demand caused by cold weather in recent months is one cause for the low inventories of jet fuel. **********'The More Pressing Need' **********''Supplies are tight due to the fact that refineries maximized output of heating oil,'' said Robert Boslego, an oil consultant. ''That was the more pressing need. That's where they make their money.'' **********He said another reason for tighter supplies was that many refineries on the Gulf Coast had to cut production because the cold affected equipment. **********He said supplies of jet fuel were the lowest in some time, with the supply at 24 days now, compared with 28 days a year ago and 34 days in 1988. **********At the same time, demand for fuel among the airlines, many of which have expanded routes and taken delivery of new planes, has risen by 7.8 percent in the last three months, Mr. Boslego said. **********Mr. Carty said the airlines could do little about the price because most do not have the capacity to store fuel. **********Carriers like American, which has been buying more fuel-efficient airplanes, can better absorb a fuel price rise than carriers like Trans World Airlines and Pan American World Airways, which have older fleets.

This is particularly true in this case, because for now the Food and Drug Administration has approved the product for use only in ice cream-like desserts. **********Even so, Monsanto stock, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, rose by $4.375 a share today to close at $112.25, with some analysts predicting an immense demand for Simplesse products, given the growing national concern for healthy diets. In 1989, Nutrasweet had $869 million in sales for its artificial sweetener aspartame, accounting for just 10 percent of Monsanto's sales and 16.7 percent of the company's net operating profits, analysts at Salomon Brothers said. Monsanto, based in St. Louis, makes most of its money selling industrial and agricultural chemicals. $500 Million in Sales Possible While many analysts were reluctant to guess the potential market for fat substitutes, some said that within five years Simplesse could generate $300 million to $500 million in sales. **********David L. Morley, group vice president of the Simplesse group, declined to disclose any projections for the product. He also declined to disclose the advertising budget for Simplesse. **********Still, Simplesse is Nutrasweet's long-awaited second act. Until now, the company's sole product had been the highly successful aspartame, which has found wide acceptance in soft drinks and foods since it was introduced in 1981. There had been mounting pressure on Nutrasweet to develop another product because the exclusive patents it holds on aspartame will start to expire around the world in 1992. **********At a news conference in New York,the company said it would follow the same ''branded ingredient'' strategy that helped make Nutrasweet, itself a substitute ingredient, a household name. The company said the line of Simplesse frozen desserts, called Simple Pleasures, would be marketed through a newly formed subsidiary, the Simplesse Company, based in Skokie, Ill., a few miles from Nutrasweet's Deerfield headquarters. **********Little Immediate Impact **********Despite the jump in Monsanto's stock today, Leonard Bogner, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Research, said Simplesse would have little immediate impact on Nutrasweet. ''In terms of financial impact, near term, there's not going to be one,'' he said. Simplesse will lose money this year because of the cost of introducing the product, he said. **********Nutrasweet officials said Simplesse had a wide variety of potential applications. The low-calorie fat substitute, made from cooking and blending milk or egg-white protein, is intended to replace fat in salad dressings, mayonnaise, yogurt, butter, cheese and other dairy products. Simplesse is one of many fat substitutes being developed around the nation. But unlike a potential competitor, Procter & Gamble's Olestra, which is still awaiting approval, Simplesse breaks down when exposed to high temperatures and therefore cannot be used in cooking or baking."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/11/world/guatemala-ballot-marks-watershed.html": {"writer_name": "Lindsey Gruson", "pub_date": "1990-11-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 846, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GUATEMALA BALLOT MARKS WATERSHED", "print_headline": "GUATEMALA BALLOT MARKS WATERSHED", "body_text": " **********Barring a collapse brought about by the wave of political violence now afflicting Guatemala, the general elections on Sunday and the inauguration of a President in January should mark a democratic watershed: the first transfer of power from one elected civilian to another in the country's history. **********That would be a significant step for the United States-backed effort to end a tradition of military dictatorship and build a working democratic system. **********But Western diplomats say the political violence illustrates President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo's failure to gain control over the armed forces and end the institutionalized terrorism that limits political expression to the right and the extreme right. **********\"The only left here is in the mountains,\" said Juan Francisco Alfaro, secretary general of the Confederation of Guatemalan Union Groups, the largest labor organization in the country, in referring to a three-decade-old guerrilla movement.

Such programs would address the problems most often cited as the causes of the pervasive poverty and political repression that have led to two decades of war and bloodshed. **********The results have been growing apathy and hopelesses in the face of growing violence, a resurgent guerrilla movement and corruption by the ruling Christian Democrats.

But the army, which squashed two right-wing coup attempts against Mr. Cerezo, is expected to accept any of the three leading candidates. A Wealthy Front-Runner **********Polls show that the front-runner is Jorge Carpio Nicolle, a wealthy newspaper publisher and founder of the National Center Union. In an effort to broaden his appeal in the private sector, he enlisted as his running mate Manuel Ayau Cordon, a businessman who started as a presidential candidate of the far-right National Liberation Movement. **********Senior members of the National Center Union have acknowledged that it was unlikely that the ticket could win the absolute majority needed to avoid a runoff in January. That has made the campaign into a scramble for second place between Alvaro Arzu, the wealthy former mayor of the capital and the ex-president of the National Liberation Movement, and Jorge Antonio Serrano, an evangelist and the president of the council of state during the regime of the dictator Gen. Efrain Rios Montt.  The General's Reputation **********Mr. Serrano has benefited from the collapse of the general's own candidacy, which ended last month when the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional provision barring former dictators from power. In the most obvious sign of the country's disillusionment with democracy, the general was until then the front-runner, even though thousands of civilians were killed during his rule in the early 1980's. But his 16-month tenure is now remembered more for stability than for bloodshed. **********The national dissatisfaction seems to have buried the chances of Alfonso Cabrera Hidalgo, the candidate of the ruling Christian Democrats, who by law may not renominate the President. Mr. Cabrera's campaign has faltered since he was stricken with pancreatitis earlier this month. **********Mr. Cerezo spent his first two years as President pushing demilitarization and Guatemala seemed to be fertile soil for democracy.  But Guatemalan politicians say their President appeared to give up and became content to finish his term. He stopped going regularly to his office, and his aides were replaced by girlfriends who surrounded him in what has been described as \"a thicket of pretty legs.\" **********Violence began to mount. In the first nine months of this year, there were 276 political murders and 145 disappearances, according to the congressionally appointed Human Rights Ombudsman. **********Mr. Cerezo has described the human rights abuses as the final spasms of a dying era. But many Guatemalans blame the President, saying he allowed himself to become a captive of the army. They note the military staffs his country estate, providing even the servants. When aides went to see him there earlier this year, they said they were required to park their cars and ride the last two miles on Army buses. **********\"He became the caged pet of the army,\" Jorge Skinner Klee, a senior opposition Congressman, said. **********But some diplomats say Mr. Cerezo came to rely on the army because it is the only bureaucracy that works. He asked civilian aides two years ago to prepare his position papers for a summit meeting in Mexico. They never produced. Finally, he turned to the army.

He was arrested in his apartment on Wednesday on suspicion of murder, a spokesman for the city's justice department said. **********The spokesman said that Mr. Mansur, who is 32 years old, was identified after a former member of the now disbanded East German State Security Ministry's secret police confirmed evidence found in the ministry's files that the East German Communist authorities knew that Libyan terrorists and diplomats had planned the attack on La Belle discotheque.

Wilson 4th, the deputy chief of mission, said, \"I have not given up hope on the diplomatic process.\" **********Secret consultations continued today in the Iraqi capital involving senior Iraqi officials and 20 to 25 Iraqi Ambassadors who have been summoned from Western and other foreign capitals before the Jan. 15 deadline in the United Nations Security Council resolution demanding that Iraq withdraw its occupation army from Kuwait or face eviction by force. **********Foreign Ministry officials have declined to comment on the consultations and have told foreign journalists that they would not be available for the rest of the week. Western officials said they regarded the gathering as an extraordinary session that could signal a new diplomatic initiative by Iraq, probably after the New Year.  Some 'Room for Diplomacy' **********A United States official here said he could not confirm \"at this point\" an Israeli newspaper report that American and Iraqi officials had discussed or agreed on a date for Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to meet in Baghdad with President Saddam Hussein as part of an effort to avert war. **********The official, whose comments on diplomatic progress were generally positive yet also ambiguous, said, \"What you should take from this is that so long as there is some sort of diplomacy to be conducted we are going to conduct it.\" **********\"I think and I hope there is some more room for diplomacy,\" the official said. Later the official said, \"Obviously we're not sitting on our hands here.\" **********The United States and Iraq remain deadlocked over dates for an exchange of high-level visits proposed by President Bush in an attempt to avert war over Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.  Hints of Compromise Dates **********The United States has insisted that it will send Mr. Baker to Baghdad no later than Jan. 3, but Mr. Hussein said he was not available until Jan. 12, three days before the deadline. The White House has said that date is unacceptable because it is too close to the Jan. 15 deadline and thus the Iraqis would be able to say after such a meeting that they had not had enough time to consider any American offer or to pull out of Kuwait. **********Officials in Washington and Baghdad have hinted at compromise dates between Jan. 5-8 for the Baker meeting, but the United States official here discouraged any suggestion that the Bush Administration had relented on its position that the Baker meeting must occur no later than Jan. 3. **********The Israeli newspaper report said a date of Jan. 9 was agreed on as a date for Mr. Baker's visit. But a State Department spokesman in Washington denied the report. Western officials here said a meeting as late as Jan. 9 was plausible, because many Western governments estimate that Iraq could withdraw its forces in the five to six days remaining before the deadline after such a meeting took place. **********Western embassies here said they had noted the strong resurgence of rumors that Mr. Hussein's Arab Baath Socialist Party is making plans to set off national demonstrations about Jan. 10 that would create the impression that the Iraqi people would rather pull out of Kuwait than go to war. Avoiding Look of Stubbornness **********There have been similar suggestions that Mr. Hussein would submit the question of a pullout to his National Assembly, a consultative body that is controlled by Mr. Hussein's one-party apparatus. **********As with all rumors in the Iraqi capital, Western diplomats say it is difficult to determine whether the current rumor has official sanction or reflects popular sentiment. **********The resumption of diplomatic contacts between the United States Embassy and the Iraqi Foreign Ministry might have been compelled by leaders on both sides who wished to avoid any accusations of stubbornness in working out a compromise on the dates. **********As recently as Monday, the United States official had made a point of telling reporters here that there had been no diplomatic contacts between the United States Embassy and the Iraqi Government for a week.  'You Know Our Position' **********In the last meeting between Mr. Wilson and Nizar Hamdoon, an undersecretary of the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, Mr. Wilson read from an aide memoire that recounted the history of the dispute over the dates, but proposed no compromise, while Mr. Hamdoon listened and then said, \"You know our position,\" Western officials said. **********Today, a United States official said he meant to convey a new impression about the resumption of diplomatic contacts. To demonstrate that contacts had resumed, the official picked up the telephone and dialed the Foreign Ministry. It is believed from his comments on the telephone that he spoke to Mr. Hamdoon, who is a former Ambassador to Washington. **********Also today, Mr. Wilson made arrangements to send a bottle of California wine to Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, as a Christmas gift. Mr. Aziz is a Christian. **********On Christmas Day, Mr. Wilson received a cake in the shape of a Yule log from Mr. Hussein as well as a floral arrangement of purple and lavender zinnias.

Both life and art reveal the capriciousness that rules the advertising industry, where dreams of success can be snuffed out at random. **********But while the television program highlights the self-doubts of two ad men thrust from their entrepreneurial cocoon, reality underscores other traits of advertising people, especially the ones who revel in creativity: their toughness and resilience. **********''I don't want to do 'Mr. Whipple,' '' Mr. Seisser affirmed from his freelancer's desk at Backer Spielvogel Bates. **********Mr. Taub, from his freelance outpost at Ogilvy & Mather, was equally emphatic. ''I don't want to do 'Ring around the collar,' '' he said. **********Last year, after winning the Playboy magazine and Bridgestone tire accounts, the two men were filled with jaunty bravado. Keye/Donna/ Pearlstein's New York office, which was founded on May 16, 1988, was finally establishing itself as a creative force in the ingrown advertising industry. **********But disaster crept slowly upon them. Shortly after the office was formed, Consumer Reports magazine reported that the Samurai, a four-wheel-drive vehicle made by the American Suzuki Motor Corporation, had a tendency to flip over when rounding corners at high speeds. After trying public relations strategies and new advertising themes to limit the damage, Suzuki, the largest client of Keye's home office in Los Angeles, took a step common among threatened clients: It dismissed its ad agency. Pressed for cash, the agency closed its New York branch in March. **********''It's my theory,'' said Mr. Seisser, an art director, ''that somebody at K/ D/P did something in a previous life to deserve the rotten luck that came their way in '89.'' **********The men admitted to brief bouts with depression, but they did not engage in two pastimes that might have been expected when a business goes belly up: rancor and second-guessing. Instead, they concentrated on what they might do next. **********For Mr. Taub, who is 39 years old, the question was solved quickly. A call from Ogilvy came in even before the doors were locked on Keye's New York office. He began freelance copywriting there the day after his agency closed, becoming part of the team that drew the Eastern Airlines account to Ogilvy in May. He has also served part time at Backer Spielvogel Bates, working with the 32-year-old Mr. Seisser in a partnership that is now nine years old. **********Both men said they were freelancing by choice. ''It's like where you get divorced and want to date but don't want to get married right away,'' Mr. Taub said. **********Ah, but whom to marry, when the time arrives? Friends, like Neil Drossman of Campbell-Mithun-Esty, Mr. Taub's mentor, called with solace and advice. Jerry Della Femina, at whose agency Mr. Seisser and Mr. Taub met, entered into negotiations with them that led nowhere. **********The greatest profusion of inquiries came from people who wanted to start agencies and thought Mr. Taub and Mr. Seisser knew the secret. ''Starting an agency is kind of a tough thing to do, getting your ducks in a row,'' Mr. Seisser said. ''A lot of people calling us were looking for a short cut. They wanted to know how tied in we were into the existing business, to use it as a foothold for a new agency.'' **********The offers were all unappealing. ''When things are going good and you want to leave a place, you make it happen, but when someone's courting you and you're not sure where you are in your life, it's hard to say, 'This is what I want and need,' '' Mr. Taub mused. **********Both men said it was irrelevant whether they worked together again. ''Tod and I started out as business partners, but now we're friends who happened to work together,'' Mr. Taub said. And both said their goal was simply to do ''great work,'' which Mr. Seisser defined as advertising that sells products while allowing him to sleep at night. **********But asked to pinpoint the perfect situation, Mr. Seisser waxed a bit nostalgic. ''The ideal?'' he asked. ''If I could invent one?'' he asked again. ''Keye/Donna/Pearlstein,'' he concluded.

The total value of the deals in which a price was reported was $15.4 billion. The value of 55 percent of the deals was not reported. **********The number of deals was just below the record of 371 in the third quarter of last year but above the quarterly average of 317 for all of 1989. The total value was below the third quarter's $21.7 billion but above the other three quarters, Translink's said. **********American Acquisitions Slowed **********While European companies were very active, acquisitions by American concerns slowed significantly, Translink's reported. **********In the first quarter, American companies were involved in 37 deals, with a total reported value of $747.8 million. This compares with 53 deals, with a reported value of $4.2 billion, in the fourth quarter of 1989 and a total of 182 deals, with a reported value of $15.2 billion, in all of 1989. **********The continued high level of acquisitions seems to reflect that the barriers to acquisitions, within the 12-nation European Community and elsewhere, are coming down. The pressure to build ties is forcing an easing of obstacles to takeovers in countries like France and Sweden that have long been hostile to such purchases. **********The trend demonstrates that business and economic decisions have moved ahead of politicial or regulatory ones. That is comparable to what happened in the United States in the 1970's as financial markets left regulators breathlessly trying to catch up with their innovations. **********''Everyone is bringing down their defenses so that they can buy in the European Community,'' said Mark Dixon, the editor of Translink's European Deal Review. This easing, he said, should make more acquisitions possible and should make more logical business alliances easier. **********France and Sweden Rank High **********France, a member of the European Community, and Sweden, which is not, were No. 1 and No. 3, respectively, in net acquisitions last year. This means that French and Swedish companies bought much more abroad than foreign companies bought in France and Sweden. France's surplus was $6.1 billion and Sweden's was $1.3 billion. The No. 2 position was held by West Germany. **********But in the first quarter of the year, France and Sweden were the top targets for acquisitions. In part, this reflects the cross-ownership merger between Volvo A.B. of Sweden and Renault S.A. of France. **********French and Swedish companies were also the targets of other deals. France was No. 1 in the number of deals, with 53. Sweden, with 12, tied for ninth with Norway. But that is already more than a third of last year's total acquisitions by foreigners in Sweden. **********In another measure of the change in positions, the value of the companies that outsiders bought in France equaled 82 percent of acquisitions by French companies abroad, compared with 43 percent in all of 1989. In Sweden, the ratio rose to 72 percent in the first quarter, from 15 percent in 1989. **********Active Outside Home Nations **********Even with this new spurt of foreign acquisitions in France and Sweden, the two were also first in acquisitions abroad in the first quarter, again helped by the the Volvo-Renault deal. Along with Britain, France and Sweden are spending much more to acquire foreign companies than to buy at home. **********For Sweden, it seems the economic ties to the European Community will be well established before the politicial decision is made over whether to apply for membership in the community. But the mood in Sweden -and the economic moves already made - seem to narrow the question to when will Sweden apply, not whether it will do so. **********The slowing pace of acquisitions by American companies in the first quarter does reflect a change in attitude about the need to get a foothold in Europe, Mr. Dixon said, describing it as a natural slowing after the activity last year. And he notes that while the deals declined, dropping the United States to fifth in the first quarter from first in 1989, many companies making acquistions were medium sized. **********These acquisitions, Mr. Dixon contends, reflect a growing and broader commitment to a role in Europe that goes beyond what huge multinational companies like the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation have already done. **********McGraw-Hill Moves Quickly **********One American company that bought in Europe, and elsewhere, in the first quarter was McGraw-Hill Inc., whose Standard & Poor's Ratings Group bought financial ratings services in Britain, France, Sweden and Australia. **********Standard & Poor's wants a foothold in Europe and Australia to take advantage of the growing international market, its president, Leo O'Neill, said. Capital markets outside the United States are growing faster than in the country, and so is the ratings business, he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/23/business/du-pont-to-construct-plants-for-ozone-safe-refrigerant.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1990-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 776, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Du Pont to Construct Plants For Ozone-Safe Refrigerant", "print_headline": "Du Pont to Construct Plants For Ozone-Safe Refrigerant", "body_text": " **********Du Pont announced yesterday that it would design four plants to produce refrigeration chemicals that do not endanger the earth's ozone layer, but said it was continuing to delay a commitment to produce another family of compounds that would have a different use. **********The company said the decision to build the plants put it among the leaders in the production of environmentally friendly refrigerants. ''These commercial facilities would be among the first to produce world-scale quantities of non-ozone depleting alternatives,'' said Joseph P. Glas, director of the Freon Products division of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company. Freon is Du Pont's trade name for current refrigeration compounds. **********Both groups of chemicals are intended to replace the most widely used refrigerants, known as chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's. The chlorine in CFC's that escapes to the atmosphere has been identified by scientists as the principal agent responsible for the thinning of the ozone layer. **********Because the ozone shields the earth from harmful solar rays that can cause skin cancer and disrupt the food chain, most industrial nations have agreed to phase out the use of the CFC's by 2000. More than two billion pounds of the chemicals are used annually worldwide, a third of them in the United States. They are also used in insulation and as cleaning agents in electronics. **********The company said the new plants would produce four types of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFC's, for use in automotive air-conditioners, home refrigerators and commercial refrigeration equipment. The new compounds contain no chlorine and are therefore not expected to pose a threat to the ozone layer. **********When they become operational, between 1992 and 1995, the plants will have the capacity to produce 140 million pounds of refrigerants annually, which the company said ''could supply most worldwide refrigeration needs through the end of the century.'' **********The plants will be in Corpus Christi, Tex.; Louisville, Ky; Dordrecht, the Netherlands, and Chiba, Japan. **********Du Pont said it was holding back on plans to expand production of a third group of chemicals, known as hydrochlorofluorocarbons, pending passage of the revised Clean Air Act. HCFC's, as they are known, have been scheduled to replace CFC's in the roughly 75 percent of applications where HFC's are not suitable. **********Among the CFC applications where HFC's will not work are as refrigerants in large industrial chilling equipment and in the production of insulating foams, Du Pont officials said. **********HCFC's have much less ozone-depleting potential than CFC's, but they do contain chlorine. As a result, some environmental advocates have called for their use to be phased out soon after CFC's are eliminated in the next century. Big producers like Du Pont have said the HCFC ban should not take effect until 2030, to allow it and makers of equipment using the chemicals to recoup their investments in equipment to make and use the compounds. **********But an amendment to the Senate version of the Clean Air Act revision would ban their use by 2015. Mr. Glas said large chilling units that cool office buildings and hospitals have an economic life of up to 40 years. Anyone buying equipment designed for HCFC's could face a shortage of refrigerant long before the equipment was scheduled to be retired. **********Chemical industry executives have argued that the use of HCFC's is necessary for a quick phasing out of CFC's. And they have warned that if HCFC's are banned too soon, developing countries may continue to use the more dangerous CFC's, to the detriment of the ozone layer, until environmentally benign alternatives are found. **********Redesign Necessary **********Phasing out CFC's means redesigning all equipment that uses them as a refrigerant fluid. None of the proposed alternatives can be used in machines designed for CFC's. **********Mr. Glas said Du Pont, which is one of the world's largest producers of CFC's, is working with manufacturers to assure that substitute fluids deliver adequate performance. He said domestic automobiles with non-CFC air-conditioners would probably be available toward the end of next year. The substitute would be an HFC compound designated HFC-134a. **********Du Pont said that by the end of the year it will have invested $240 million in research and capital spending on CFC replacements. It said total expenditures by the end of the century could total more than $1 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/05/business/world-markets-the-unsettling-iraq-factor.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1990-08-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 782, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World Markets;   The Unsettling Iraq Factor", "print_headline": "World Markets;   The Unsettling Iraq Factor", "body_text": " **********SADDAM HUSSEIN, the President of Iraq, bet that Kuwait was vulnerable and it was. So were most of the world's markets, which tumbled dramatically after Iraq's invasion of the emirate last week as the outlook clouded for oil prices, inflation, economic growth and the balance of power in the Middle East. . **********The markets had been under stress before the invasion. Interest rates around the world are high. Many economies are slowing or are growing more slowly than anticipated. Earnings reports are coming in lower than expected - and the prospect is for less to come. **********The Amercan stock market was weakening and Japan's was already reeling. West Germany's market was worried by higher interest rates and, again, the cost of German unification. Italy has problems with its coalition government. Britain is near a recession. **********Hong Kong, which had been reaching new heights regularly, was stunned by the invasion, which sent the Hang Seng index tumbling by 111.69 points or 3.4 percent. Oil-rich Norway, whose all-share index had been propelled to new highs four days last week by rising oil prices and the expectation that they would rise further after the invasion, fell 1.6 percent Friday under the weight of inflationary fears. **********''We've been skittish on these markets anyway,'' said Madhav Dhar, global strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company in New York. ''This was not a healthy environment. We expected markets to roll off anyway. And this will aggravate that.'' **********Cliche though it is, the only certainity now is uncertainity and it alone is enough to roil stock markets. The unknown - what the Iraqi leader might do next - kept traders and analysts close to their computer screens Friday and responding - by buying dollars as a safe haven or dumping stocks because of inflationary and interest rate fears - to bulletins like ''State Department says Iraqi troops within six miles of Saudi border'' or ''Shevardnadze says U.S.S.R. 'has been assured' Iraq to pull out soon.'' **********But about as fast as the Iraqi forces moved into Kuwait City, economists and analysts around the world were examining the longer-term impact, pushing numbers through their black boxes and churning out estimates of the inflationary, interest rate and economic growth consequences both of the invasion and of higher oil prices. These scenarios, none of them very good, will be digested by investors this week and should add to the downward pressure on markets. **********Kieth Skeoch, chief economist at James Capel & Company in London, estimates that with a $25 per barrel price for oil, inflation in the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada could be five-tenths of 1 percentage point higher in the next year. And economic growth could be cut by as much as four-tenths of 1 percentage point from what it might have been. For the United States and Britain, whose economies could be near the brink of a recession already, this not comforting. **********Guy Rigdon, director of strategy at UBS Phillips & Drew in London, said he expected interest rates in Europe will be pushed up about half of a percentage point. And in Japan, he said, the oil price rise (he is also assuming $25 a barrel) will insure that the Bank of Japan will raise the official discount rate, now 5.25 percent, and keep interest rates higher longer. **********He estimates that, based on this rise in interest rates, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index, which fell 4.4 percent last week to close at 29,515.76, should drop below 28,000, the low it reached during the market collapse in the first quarter of the year. In Europe, he expects that markets could fall 10 percent to 20 percent from where they were. **********Last week, West Germany was down 4.1 percent; Britain, whose decline was somewhat offset by the positive effect of higher oil prices on its North Sea oil production, fell 2.0 percent; France, 4.9 percent, Spain, 5.5 percent, and Italy, 4.7 percent. **********Merrill Lynch, according to its chief international equity strategist, Thomas Robinson, has already changed its investment levels in several markets, cutting them in Japan and the United states and raising them in the few countries that will beneift from higher oil prices, like Norway, or are not as dependent on oil, like Switzerland."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/08/business/czechoslovakia-in-a-trade-pact.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 212, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Czechoslovakia In a Trade Pact", "print_headline": "Czechoslovakia In a Trade Pact", "body_text": " **********Czechoslovakia signed a trade and economic cooperation accord today with the European Community that its Prime Minister called an important step toward full membership by the year 2000. **********The agreement replaces a commercial accord signed in December 1988 and will give Czechoslovakia better access to markets in the 12-nation alliance, officials said. **********The Czechoslovak Prime **********Minister, Marian Calfa, said at a meeting of the community nations that the pact demonstrated his country's commitment to democracy and a market economy. **********Separately, the community endorsed extending a 24-nation Western aid plan for Poland and Hungary to five other countries: Bulgaria, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia. **********The community's two-way trade with Czechoslovakia now totals about $2.4 billion a year. **********The new 10-year accord covers trade in industrial and agricultural goods and will remove quantitative trade restrictions. **********The agreement is the fourth the community has signed with an East European country after Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union.

Eric Buckland, testified that the top Salvadoran military commander, Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, knew of the army's plans to kill the priests at least 10 days before the slayings last Nov. 16 and ordered Lieut. Col. Carlos Aviles to try to stop them. **********\"They want to handle it the old way by killing some of the priests,\" Major Buckland testified he was told by Colonel Aviles after a meeting with a leader of the plot, Col. Guillermo Benavides. \"Aviles told me that Benavides was old school and was still the 'hammer.' And Aviles added that there was some talk about death squads which were run out of the military school.\" Solid Link to Conspiracy **********Though it was retracted, Major Buckland's testimony is the most direct evidence to emerge so far linking the killings to a broader armed forces conspiracy. The affidavits cast doubts on continuing assertions by American and Salvadoran officials that the Jesuits were killed on orders from a single commander who cracked in battle. **********But Colonels Aviles and Ponce, the armed forces' chief of staff when the killings occurred, denied the allegations on Monday and dismissed Major Buckland as \"emotionally unstable.\" **********\"It's the biggest lie I've ever heard,\" said Colonel Ponce, now the Defense Minister. \"It's completely false.\" **********The officers said that a demonstrable error discredited the affidavits. The documents say that Colonels Aviles and Benavides met here \"approximately 10 days prior to the killings.\" But Colonel Aviles was in New Orleans at that time. In another affidavit, however, Major Buckland says the meeting \"probably occurred in late October.\" **********A week after testifying he had advance knowledge of the plot, Major Buckland recanted. \"The statements I made all seemed real to me at the time, and I was convinced I had not thought of them earlier because I had suppressed them,\" he said. \"Upon reflection of those statements, I know that they are not true.\" 'Indications of Deception' **********But polygraphers for the Federal Bureau of Investigation said that while one lie-detector test taken by Major Buckland was \"inconclusive,\" another found signs that his original assertion was true. When he denied having prior knowledge, \"there were indications of deception,\" the examiner, Special Agent Paul Cully, said. But there were also signs that he made up information. **********In his report, Mr. Cully said Major Buckland admitted he had advance knowledge of the plot. \"Major Buckland became aware of this information several weeks before the Jesuits were murdered,\" Mr. Cully wrote. \"He was also advised on the afternoon of Nov. 16 that the operation would take place.\" **********Major Buckland said he decided against advising his superiors before the killings because \"the U.S. would mishandle the situation,\" the agent added. American officials, who originally sought to blame leftist guerrillas for the killings, say the Major did not inform them about the army's involvement until six weeks after the murders. Impediment to Discussions **********Judicial authorities say the contradictions in the affidavits make them pratically useless in court. But Major Buckland's charges are likely to impede negotiations between the Government and the rebels and to strengthen Congressional resolve to slash American military aid, which pays for the entire Salvadoran military budget except salaries. **********\"If they're still killing priests after 10 years of involvement, you have to ask if the U.S. should still be here,\" an American diplomat said recently. **********The affidavits, whose sketchy details have been leaked in recent days, have already infuriated leading members of Congress. They charge that witholding the testimony demonstrates that the State Department has failed to cooperate with the investigation fully, but stopped short of accusing the Bush Administration of participating in an effort to obstruct justice. **********Administration officials said the affidavits were withheld because they are unreliable. They said that United States officials were at first convinced that it would be more fruitful to pursue other leads. Major Buckland's testimony, they added, seemed irrelevant once Colonel Benavides was charged. **********Salvadoran officials say they resent the failure to credit the army for cooperating. They say its help was critical to the arrest of Colonel Benavides, the highest-ranking officer charged with a human rights abuse, and a praiseworthy step toward ending the military's tradition of immunity in rights cases. 'I Did It' **********Major Buckland also testified that Colonel Aviles told him in mid-December that Colonel Benavides had admitted his role in the killings to the officer in charge of a special commission investigating them. **********\"I did it; what can you do to help me?\" Colonel Aviles quotes Colonel Benavides as saying, according to the affidavits. But Colonel Benavides was not arrested until almost a month later. **********Major Buckland said that a week later, he asked Colonel Aviles who else knew about the plot to kill the Jesuits. Colonel Aviles said he wasn't sure. **********\"Does Colonel Ponce know yet?\" Major Buckland said he pressed. **********\"I don't know,\" he said Colonel Aviles responded. \"I don't know who knows.

The system proposed by Zenith and A.T.& T. incorporates a new software algorithm to accomplish the necessary data compression and digital filtering technology to prevent high-powered conventional signals from interfering with the HDTV channel.  Lower Cost Expected **********The system that Zenith and A.T.& T. are announcing \"is better than most of the other proposals in terms of image quality,\" said James I. Magid, an analyst with Needham & Company in New York. In addition, \"although they don't tell you in the release that they will be cheaper, the cost should be about a tenth of the Japanese system,\" he said. HDTV sets went on sale in Japan earlier this month for $34,000 each. **********A number of technology analysts have suggested for some time that embracing an all-digital format would be one way for the United States to overcome the lead taken by Japan in the HDTV race. To date, the Japanese have not shown a digital system. One major advantage of a digital system is that there would be no loss in signal quality through the broadcast process. **********\"At the receiver end, so long as you had a certain level of signal, what you would see on the screen would be in effect a clone, a perfect replica of what came out of the studio,\" said Alex D. Felker, a technology and engineering consultant with the Washington-based firm of Wiley, Rein & Fielding. The disadvantage is that should the signal fall below a certain level, there would be no picture at all, not just a deterioration of the image as with conventional sets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/08/business/profits-at-anheuser-busch-rise-by-2.1-in-quarter.html": {"writer_name": "Anthony Ramirez", "pub_date": "1990-02-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 659, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Profits at Anheuser-Busch Rise by 2.1% in Quarter", "print_headline": "Profits at Anheuser-Busch Rise by 2.1% in Quarter", "body_text": " **********The Anheuser-Busch Companies, the country's largest brewer, said yesterday that fourth-quarter earnings rose 2.1 percent and that its profit for the year was up 7.2 percent. **********The quarter's results confirmed that Busch's more aggressive price-cutting policy, announced in October, hurt earnings. For the quarter ended Dec. 31, the company earned $128.1 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with $125.5 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. **********Sales in the fourth quarter grew 5.5 percent, to $2.31 billion, from $2.19 billion a year ago. **********For the full year, profit rose to $767.2 million, or $2.68 a share, from $715.9 million, or $2.45 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 6.3 percent, to $9.48 billion from $8.92 billion. **********Effect of Pricing Policy **********Last October, in announcing a 5 percent earnings gain for the third quarter over the similar period a year earlier, to $238.3 million, Busch said it would match any price cuts by rival brewers instead of trying to raise prices. The policy, it said, would hurt earnings in the fourth quarter and in 1990 but would help build Busch's already dominant market share. **********''They just wanted to scare the other guys,'' said William Leach, an analyst at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, referring to principal Busch rivals, the Miller Brewing Company and the Adolph Coors Company. **********Analysts said the net effect of Busch's policy for the industry was to restrain prices, rather than actually cut them. Earlier this month, Busch announced its regular annual price increase, about 3 percent, which is equal to its increases in 1989 and 1988. But Busch made it known, analysts said, that it would offer discounts of 1 percent to 2 percent. That would add less than a dime to the $3.30 wholesale price for a six-pack of beer. **********Market Share Edges Up **********Busch said yesterday that it had increased market share by one percentage point, to 42.1 percent, for the year. It reiterated its goal of reaching 50 percent within the next five years. **********In the fourth quarter, the number of barrels of Busch beer sold - which includes Budweiser and Michelob -rose 1.1 percent, to 18.3 million, from 18.1 million the year before. For the year, barrels sold rose 2.8 percent, to 80.7 million from 78.5 million. **********Mr. Leach, the analyst, said the fourth-quarter performance was in line with analysts' expectations. While Busch is a well-run company that diversified into other operations like amusement parks, he said, it is still dependent on one business and essentially one brand, Budweiser. ''Anheuser-Busch is the world's biggest one-product company,'' he said. **********In 1988, beer accounted for 77 percent of its sales and 92 percent of its pretax operating income. Busch does not break out results for particular brands. **********Per-Capita Consumption Off **********Industry sales have been flat since 1986; per-capita consumption is down in the United States over the last 10 years, mainly because of health concerns over alcohol and a trend toward lighter beverages, such as bottled water. Brewers sold about 182 million barrels last year, about the same as the year before. Americans drank about 23 gallons of beer in 1989, compared with 26 gallons a decade before. **********Despite being the largest company in the beer business, Busch does not enjoy the profit advantages of, say, tobacco companies. Unlike makers of cigarettes, which have also generated health concerns and are showing declining sales, brewers cannot as easily raise profit margins through manufacturing efficiencies or regular price increases. Brewers are already quite efficient and their customers often balk at raising prices. Nonetheless, Busch is spending more than $1 billion on plant modernization to become more efficient. **********Busch's share price rose $1 yesterday, to $37.625, on the New York Stock Exchange."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/21/world/israeli-court-delays-a-plan-for-voa-station-in-desert.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israeli Court Delays a Plan For V.O.A.

''But we have been calling on Moscow publicly and privately for avoiding escalatory measures in favor of dialogue.'' **********Mrs. Thatcher said that she and Mr. Bush had agreed in advance on what he would say about Mr. Gorbachev's threat. **********Reluctant at First **********At first, Mr. Bush was reluctant to characterize the ultimatum or say whether it violated Mr. Gorbachev's promises not to use force to keep Lithuania within the Soviet Union. But he later said: ''Am I concerned about the report? If it proves to be accurate, the answer is yes, because it goes against the policy of dialogue and a no-coercion dialogue that will result in peaceful evolution of democracy and self-determination. **********''So I'm concerned about the report. I'm concerned about the timing. But I just don't want to comment any further.'' **********Mrs. Thatcher bristled when asked about reports that Mr. Gorbachev had told a delegation of United States senators in Moscow this week that he did not want ''lectures'' from the West on how to handle Lithuania. **********''We're just not lecturing anyone, but we're entitled to express a view,'' she said. **********The Prime Minister added: ''We've frequently expressed it. This is not a problem that should be solved by force and which cannot be solved by force. It therefore must be solved by discussion. We had a duty to say what we think. We still think that way and we still think that is the only way to go.'' **********Mr. Bush has said the use of force in Lithuania would set back Soviet-American relations at a time when arms control and other issues appearing to be moving forward relatively smoothly.

In doing so, Compaq has come close to creating a single computer that can meet the needs of an executive both in the office and on the road. **********The Compaq LTE 386s/20 laptop weighs 7.5 pounds. At 11 inches wide, 8.5 inches deep and 2.2 inches tall, it is roughly the size of a middleweight telephone book. Compaq refers to its new machine as a notebook PC, but it's well beyond the five-pound limit that many people assign to that classification. **********Regardless of the nomenclature, the LTE 386s/20 is a champion in its weight class. It boasts an Intel 386SX microprocessor operating at 20 megahertz, two megabytes of system memory, a high-capacity diskette drive, a choice of 30- or 60-megabyte hard disk drive and VGA graphics. No other portable of comparable size can match its features. Epson America Inc. is the only other computer maker to have announced a 386SX-based notebook machine, and at 5.8 pounds it is closer to being a true notebook. But the Epson uses a slower, 16-megahertz chip, and it will not be available until the end of the year. Compaq officials say their machine is on its way to the stores. **********As with most Compaq computers, the LTE 386s/20 carries a premium price: $6,499 for the 30MB model, $6,999 for the 60MB model. An optional desktop ''docking'' station that surrounds the LTE and adds two expansion slots, two more drive bays and the ability to use standard keyboards and monitors, is $1,499. Compaq officials said the expansion base allows the LTE 386s/20 to be used as the executive's primary desktop machine. For life on the road, the LTE slips out of the docking station. **********Frank J. Michnoff, senior research analyst for Meta Group Inc., a market research company in Westport, Conn., said the pricing was ''somewhat in line'' with his expectations. ''Compaq doesn't want to cannibalize any other existing models,'' Mr. Michnoff said, referring to the larger and less expensive 386SX-based SLT computer. He said that if Compaq follows past custom, it can be expected to reduce the price of the new model after the competition arrives. That competition is already on the horizon. According to Compaq, notebook computers are expected to account for 50 percent of all portable sales by 1992. **********''By the end of the year, I think you'll see a whole roster of similar products, some in the six-pound range,'' said Bruce A. Stephen, director of PC hardware research for the International Data Corporation of Framingham, Mass. ''There will be lighter machines, and products that will cost less.'' **********In return for so much money, the user can expect premium laptop performance. The 386SX processor is not the only feature that sets the new LTE apart from other small laptops, including Compaq's earlier LTE and LTE/286 models. The LTE 386s/20 has a 9-inch, edge-lighted display that offers the full 640 by 480 dots of VGA resolution. In contrast, the other Compaq LTE machines have CGA screens with 640 by 200 resolution, which causes graphics to be flattened; a pie chart, for example, would show up on a CGA screen as an oval instead of as a circle. The new VGA screen can display a perfect pie in up to 16 shades of gray. **********Many small computers achieve their size by jettisoning either the diskette drive or a hard disk. Compaq has consistently vowed not to make that compromise. The standard 3.5-inch, 1.44-megabyte diskette drive serves mainly to move data and applications to and from the hard disk, which does most of the work, and it is much more convenient than using cables or modems. And while other notebook computers offer no more than 20 megabytes of hard disk storage, Compaq's goes well beyound that. The 30- and 60-megabyte choices are rugged, 2.5-inch hard drives made by Conner Peripherals Inc. of San Jose, Calif. **********Another reason Compaq was able to pack so much into such a small package, the company said, was its use of a technology called Regal Flex, which has also been used in cruise missiles and the Stealth fighter. Regal is an acronym for rigid epoxy glass acrylic laminate, which describes the machine's single circuit board. The flex part is just that: once the board is printed and packed with circuitry, it literally folds over on itself, much like a trifold wallet. Besides the savings in space, the design eliminates the need for many of the cables normally found in component electronics. **********Compaq is justifiably proud of its ability to produce the LTE 386s/20 in an 8.5- by 11-inch form. The technical breakthroughs required for such miniaturization are impressive. However, is there really a compelling reason for requiring computers to conform to standards set years ago for business stationery, briefcases or, in the case of the two-pound marvel built by the Poqet Computer Corporation of Sunnyvale, Calif., the inside breast pocket of a man's business suit? **********The drawback - albeit a small one in the case of the overall impressiveness of the LTE 386s/20 - is that Compaq's decision to limit the width of the computer to precisely 11 inches demands that the keyboard be miniaturized. It has all the standard keys, but they are scrunched together. And some keys are oddly placed. Function keys are half-size. Relaxing the standard by as little as half an inch would have allowed Compaq to use full-size, fully spaced keys. **********The optimal keyboard size is determined not by stationery or luggage but by ergonomics - specifically, the size and dexterity of the operator's fingers. We can condense keyboards, but we cannot shrink our fingers. (This writer has learned to type fairly well on the 8.5-inch Poqet keyboard, but the process invariably brings to mind the image of an elephant tap-dancing.) A standard legal pad measuring 8.5 by 14 inches is quite convenient and also fits neatly into a briefcase. As long as the overall heft of the unit could be kept low, a laptop computer that is 14 inches wide, coincidentally the same width as a standard desktop keyboard including a separate numeric or cursor keypad, would not seem to cause a great hardship. After all, if one is going to spend nearly $7,000 for a laptop computer, it seems silly to worry if it will fit in a $100 briefcase. **********Advanced Micro Devices Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., recently condensed a full AT-class motherboard to a single chip; Conner has built a 60MB hard drive the size of a pack of cigarettes; the power supply of the new Compaq machine is the size of a package of chewing gum. At this rate, it may soon be possible to design a ''smart'' standard keyboard that contains a computer and a disk drive, with a flip-up screen. We may be entering the age of the mouse-driven graphical user interface, but the keyboard is still important to many people."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/29/business/credit-markets-treasury-issues-continue-to-gain.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1990-06-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1007, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  TREASURY ISSUES CONTINUE TO GAIN", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS;   TREASURY ISSUES CONTINUE TO GAIN", "body_text": " **********The credit market rally continued yesterday, as prices of Treasury securities rose and interest rates dipped in moderately active trading.

A rough estimate of covering the cost of purchasing the grain, transporting it and then trucking it inside the country is $500 million, the official said. **********Western donors, unhappy with the Sudan over its sympathetic attitude to Iraq, its human rights violations and its bombing of civilian targets in the southern part of the country, have saidthey would provide food but only if they can be assured that it will get to the people in need. **********So far, the United States, traditionally the largest food donor to the Sudan, has said it will provide 100,000 tons for humanitarian relief on such conditions.

Ethiopia, which has a more and efficient professional transportation system than the Sudan, has requested more than 800,000 tons in international aid for next year. **********But United Nations officials are worried that with such critical shortages in the Sudan, the Sudanese will either hijack grain intended for Ethiopia or give priority to the grain intended for the Sudan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/14/business/integrated-resources-files-for-chapter-11-protection.html": {"writer_name": "Alison Cowan", "pub_date": "1990-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 743, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Integrated Resources Files for Chapter 11 Protection", "print_headline": "Integrated Resources Files for Chapter 11 Protection", "body_text": " **********After months of trying to reach an out-of-court understanding with its creditors, Integrated Resources Inc. sought voluntary protection yesterday under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. **********The New York-based company, once a high-flying real estate syndicator, has suffered financial setbacks since the Tax Reform Act of 1986 made it virtually impossible for the company to sell its most popular tax-shelter products. **********The company has since diversified into other areas of financial services like mutual funds and aircraft leasing, but at great cost to its profits. With the jittery market for high-risk debt securities and Integrated's mounting problems, the company was unable to extend its short-term borrowings that came due last June and ended up defaulting on $1.6 billion in debt. **********Yesterday, however, the company's top management said it was driven to make the filing because certain dissidents broke ranks with the company's other creditors. **********''We are disappointed by the fact that a few recalcitrant creditors could derail this process,'' said Stephen D. Weinroth, the company's chairman. He cited First Fidelity Bank N.A., New Jersey, in Newark in particular for forcing the company to make the filing in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. **********About three weeks ago, First Fidelity had gone to New York State Supreme Court to recover $11.6 million that it had lent to various partnerships that are guaranteed by Integrated. Last Thursday, Judge Beatrice Shainswit signed an order that would have allowed the bank to place liens on Integrated's assets. **********''This was incredibly foolish on their part,'' Mr. Weinroth said, adding that Integrated could not appeal the decision without paying the entire $11.6 million in advance. ''We told them if they did that, we'd have no choice but to file.'' **********'Independent Matters' **********But a First Fidelity spokesman, who asked not to be identified, disputed Mr. Weinroth's assertions. ''We feel that the bankruptcy filing by the company is not related in any way to the judgment which we received, and that these are entirely independent matters,'' he said. **********Integrated has relied heavily on Drexel Burnham Lambert for financing and advice, and Mr. Weinroth left the investment house to take the post at Integrated last August. But there is a limit to the help Drexel could offer now, given its own fragile financial condition. **********Indeed, analysts attributed the sharp drop in price on Integrated bonds yesterday not so much to the company's filing as to the separate announcements by Drexel in recent days indicating that it needs an infusion of capital to survive. **********''This paper has Drexel's imprint all over it, and people are afraid that there is not going to be liquidity in anything Drexel underwrote or is associated with,'' said Leigh Walzer, an analyst with R. D. Smith & Company, a research boutique that specializes in distressed securities. He noted that investors were particularly concerned that prices might deteriorate further as Drexel liquidates its own ''junk bond'' holdings to satisfy its debts. **********Securities Decline **********Prices of Integrated's securities could not fall much further. The company's stock, once trading as high as $40 a share, fell about 8 cents, to 17 cents yesterday. Integrated's senior bonds traded yesterday between 13 cents and 17 cents on the dollar, while the company's subordinated bonds traded between 1 and 2 cents on the dollar. **********A plan that Integrated presented to its creditors last month shows that the company believes its assets are worth slightly more than $700 million and put its debts at $1.6 billion. **********The company said its biggest creditors are Manufacturers Hanover, which it owes $55.8 million, and Chemical Bank, which it owes $51.6 million. The two banks' actual exposure is probably less, however, since the bulk is owed by Integrated's sponsored partnerships - none of which have filed for bankruptcy. **********Executive Life Insurance owns about $48.8 million of high-yield bonds and is the third-largest creditor, followed by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, which owns about $45 million of another high-yield bond issue, according to Integrated. **********Drexel, which has been helping Integrated to restructure and sell various asssets up until this week, is believed to be the fifth-largest creditor, with about $41.1 million in debts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/28/business/stocks-climb-sharply-as-dow-gains-29.28.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1990-03-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 765, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stocks Climb Sharply as Dow Gains 29.28", "print_headline": "Stocks Climb Sharply as Dow Gains 29.28", "body_text": " **********Stocks fought off a general malaise yesterday, advancing sharply on slow volume in a rise that analysts said was helped along by computerized program trading. **********The Dow Jones industrial average, off 10 points earlier in the day, recovered toward the end of the session, advancing 29.28 points, to 2,736.94. **********By the end of the day, 889 issues were up and 569 were down. **********Activity rose to 131.6 million shares, still the fifth-slowest day of the year.

Architectural Digest is the best magazine we advertise in.\" **********Nonetheless, the home furnishings market is down and many department stores are feeling the pinch. **********Cheryl Smith, media director at William B. Johns & Partners, a New York ad agency, described the home furnishing market as \"a little bit flat right now,\" but said advertisers with the most expensive goods were the least affected by the economic slump. **********\"If you continue advertising and stay visible, you can gain market share,\" she said. \"Recession or not, you have to remain visible.\" **********Recession or not, the magazines are now edited for readers who are scaling back. They are running more service pieces, more articles on how to refurbish existing interiors instead of redecorating from scratch, more features on less-expensive items. **********In the first nine months of the year, advertising pages fell 9 percent in House Beautiful and 8 percent in Metropolitan Home, while Architectural Digest posted a 4 percent increase and HG a stunning 10 percent gain. Elle Decor began publication in March so no comparative figures exist, but its publisher, Polly Perkins, said the nine 1990 issues had a total of 468 advertising pages, well above the projected 350 pages. **********The circulation leader is House Beautiful, with 932,377 subscribers last year, followed by Metropolitan Home at 701,015, Architectural Digest at 632,302 and HG at 619,920. Ms. Perkins said Elle Decor's circulation, as yet unaudited, was 200,000. **********All five magazines have a lustrous quality about them. With their depictions of perfectly appointed rooms, designer furniture, elegant gardens and oh-so-handsome couples presiding over impeccable preserves, the publications present a world that is more fantasy than reality.  Ultimate Voyeur Experience **********Architectural Digest, edited by Paige Rense, is considered to be the dominant magazine. Its critics call it pretentious, but with four-color issues of more than 300 pages each and more than 1,800 ad pages last year, it is the ultimate voyeur experience into the houses of the rich and famous. **********\"A couple of hundred years from now, if you want to get a sense of how affluent America lived in the latter half of the 20th century, you could do no better than a copy of A.D.,\" said Thomas P. Losee Jr., the publisher. **********Or any of its competitors, for that matter. Nine-year-old Metropolitan Home likes to distance itself from the others with its motto, \"Journalism, Not Voyeurism,\" although it, too, runs its share of glamorous homes. **********For instance, one article entitled \"Why You Can't Buy a Sofa in America\" examined why most good furniture is sold \"to the trade only\" and must be purchased through decorators. The piece also explained how to read the price code that hangs off sofas. As a result of this article, Metropolitan Home was barred from a major furniture show.  Bare-Knuckled Competition **********Although the magazines eye each other warily, there has not been the kind of bare-knuckled competition that occurred in the mid-1980's when Conde Nast brought in Anna Wintour, the British editor, to reposition House & Garden. The result confused readers, alienated advertisers and brought a flood of criticism. Under the editorship of Nancy Novogrod, HG has settled down and is back in favor with advertisers. **********House Beautiful, which manages to be both elite and mainstream, probably carries the most consumer articles. Tony Hoyt, its publisher, describes the magazine as \"very 203,\" the area code for Fairfield County, Conn., one of the wealthiest suburbs in the United States. **********The industry is watching Elle Decor, the latest entrant. Modeled after the hugely successful French magazine Elle Decoration and riding on the name recognition of its sister Elle, the magazine has succeeded in attracting coveted younger readers. **********Whatever their individual drawing cards, the magazines are hoping that the 1990's will be the decade of the home. \"There are going to be millions and millions of couch potatoes, and you're going to need lots of couches,\" says Theodore V. Kruckel, Elle Decor's marketing director."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/24/world/anger-in-congress-over-aquino-s-snub.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Rasky", "pub_date": "1990-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 802, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Anger in Congress Over Aquino's Snub", "print_headline": "Anger in Congress Over Aquino's Snub", "body_text": " **********President Corazon C. Aquino's refusal to meet with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney during his visit to the Philippines this week has stirred anger among Democrats and Republicans in Congress and accelerated proposals for moving American forces from that country to other locations in the Pacific region. **********At a White House meeting this week, Congressional leaders from both parties expressed their dismay to President Bush over the diplomatic snub, echoing in more subdued terms some of the angrier comments expressed by legislators in floor speeches and comments over the last several days. Members of the House were particularly sharp in their criticism of Mrs. Aquino, and some suggested that cutbacks in American aid to the Philippines might also come. **********Representative Toby Roth, a Wisconsin Republican who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, noted that the United States had given hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Philippines and that Mr. Bush had assisted Mrs. Aquino's Government in December by calling in American fighter planes to help put down a coup attempt. **********''I have a solution to the problem,'' he said. ''Let them keep their bases. We do not want them, we do not need them. They are only an albatross around the neck of the American people.'' **********Domestic Needs Cited **********Mr. Roth said there were plenty of domestic needs for which money now going abroad could be used. **********''We like the people of the Philippines, but it is incumbent upon us to send them a strong message,'' he said. ''America is a strong horse willing to pull a heavy load, but we are not a dairy cow to be milked.'' **********The Subic Bay Naval Station and Clark Air Base are the principal American military installations in Southeast Asia and among the largest outside the United States. There are about 18,000 American military personnel in the Philippines, and 20,000 dependents. The United States is one of the major employers in the country. **********In recent years, rising nationalism in the Philippines has made the bases a political target of rebels on the left and of more moderate opposition members who believe Mrs. Aquino is too close to the United States. **********The 1947 lease covering six American installations including Clark and Subic Bay is scheduled to expire in 1991 unless the two nations can negotiate a new agreement. **********Lawmakers in the United States are irritated at the direct linkage the Philippine Government appears to be making between the bases and increased economic aid. ''There has always been Congressional concern that we are paying rent through foreign aid even though those bases are supposed to serve mutual security interests,'' said a foreign policy aide to Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who heads the Senate Appropriations Subcommitee on Foreign Operations. **********Inaccurate News Reports Charged **********A week before Mr. Cheney's visit, Mrs. Aquino announced that she would not meet with the Defense Secretary, saying American news reports had inaccurately characterized her discussions with other American officials who had visited recently. **********Mrs. Aquino also complained that Washington had failed to live up to a 1988 aid agreement covering the last two years of the bases agreement because this year's allotment had been reduced by $96 million. Still, the Philippines ranks among the top five recipients of American aid. **********Mrs. Aquino's complaints about the cuts in aid were generally supported by politicians in the Philippines, and some lawmakers here said they understood Mrs. Aquino's political need to demonstrate her independence from Washington. But even those most sympathetic to her said she had gone to far in refusing to see Mr. Cheney. **********''I think that Mrs. Aquino's action was regrettable because the United States has been a great friend to the Philippines,'' said Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the House Appropriations subcommittee responsible for making foreign aid allocations. **********Mr. Obey said the Philippines received $289 million in assistance last year and $467 million this year. ''If that's a loser, I'd hate to see a winner,'' he said. ''I think it comes with ill grace to the Philippine Government to object to a 62 percent increase over last year.'' He said this was the largest increase for any country in the foreign aid bill. **********The Administration has already been reviewing alternatives to the Philippine bases. According to Congressional officials, Guam and Singapore have been examined as possible relocation sites for some installations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/14/world/pakistan-reports-clash-with-india-in-kashmir.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 418, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pakistan Reports Clash With India in Kashmir", "print_headline": "Pakistan Reports Clash With India in Kashmir", "body_text": " **********Indian soldiers tried to capture a mountain outpost, starting a firefight with Pakistani soldiers along the cease-fire line dividing the disputed region of Kashmir, Pakistan said today. **********India denied that a battle had taken place. **********The Pakistani Defense Ministry said the attack on a remote outpost in the Himalayas occurred Sunday, the day after talks on easing border tensions had adjourned.

The vehicle would have been sold in Europe and the United States. **********The two companies had considered assembling the vehicle in the United States and Europe and sharing the cost equally. Although no manufacturing site had been chosen in the United States, the partners announced in February, a year after the preliminary pact was signed, that they would build the vehicles at a vacant Renault plant in Valladolid, Spain, about 100 miles north of Madrid. **********Chrysler declined to elaborate on the reasons for the termination except to say that both sides believed it ''is no longer economically attractive.'' Chrysler said a distribution agreement under which Renault sells Jeep vehicles in Europe would not be affected. **********A spokeswoman for Renault confirmed that a study by the two companies had concluded that an alliance was ''not feasible.'' **********It was not clear whether Renault's increasing involvement with Volvo A.B., the Swedish auto maker, affected the decision to drop the mini-Jeep project. Since the agreement with Chrysler was made, Renault and Volvo have agreed to a large-scale joint venture to build trucks in Europe. **********Chrysler said it plans to continue with the project, code-named JJ for ''junior Jeep,'' and ''is reviewing various implementation alternatives,'' including a different partner. Chrysler has been negotiating with union and city officials in Toledo, Ohio, where it operates an assembly plant for full-size Jeeps, to build mini-Jeeps. **********Chrysler and Renault had originally talked of starting production of the mini-Jeeps in 1992. **********For Chrysler, pressing on alone with the project would be likely to raise the company's capital costs significantly at a time when the No. 3 auto maker's financial resources are already stretched. The company's sales have been soft and its market share in the United States has declined in the last year. **********The company has also been jolted by a series of executive changes. Two weeks ago, Gerald Greenwald, vice chairman and heir apparent to Lee A. Iacocca, the company chairman, announced his resignation. The departure of Mr. Greenwald, who left to run UAL Inc., the parent of United Airlines, followed the defection of a vice president in charge of international business and the resignation of Chrysler's treasurer. **********And on Monday, Bennett E. Bidwell, the chairman of Chrysler's automotive subsidiary, confirmed that he would retire at the end of the year for health reasons. **********After Mr. Greenwald's announcement, Mr. Iacocca told Chrysler's board that he would stay on as chairman indefinitely and would begin working on a succession plan. His current management contract expires at the end of 1991. **********Like its competitors, Chrysler has tried in the last two years to build a presence in Europe to balance its heavy reliance on the United States auto market. The Ford Motor Company and G.M. have recently had trouble making a profit in their United States operations, but have managed to balance those results with strong earnings in Europe. **********Chrysler sold off its European operations more than a decade ago to raise cash. But it has an agreement with Steyr-Daimler-Puch A.G. to build mini-vans in Graz, Austria, beginning in 1991. **********When Chrysler first announced the venture with Renault, Mr. Iacocca projected eventual sales of 100,000 mini-Jeeps a year in the United States and 50,000 in Europe. **********''It's a wild car,'' Mr. Iacocca had said when the joint venture was first announced. ''It's a youth-oriented vehicle that will have appeal in many countries. Russian kids will like this, too.'' **********At the time, Mr. Iacocca had said the vehicle would be assembled using an innovative manufacturing technique, but he had declined to elaborate. Today, a spokesman said Chrysler is aiming to have its suppliers assemble parts into large subassemblies, which Chrysler workers would put together to create a whole vehicle. This modular-assembly process would require far fewer workers, perhaps as few as 300, compared with a few thousand in a conventional assembly plant, a spokesman said. **********But so far, the sales of competitive vehicles suggest that the entire mini-Jeep market might not be as big as Chrysler had projected. ''Chrysler's goal of selling 100,000 was way too ambitious,'' said Christopher Cedergren of J. D. Power & Associates, a market research firm. ''The mini sport utility market is pretty dead right now. **********''Most of the vehicles - the Suzuki Samurai, Geo Tracker and Suzuki Sidekick - are not suitable as a primary means of transportation. Even young people are reluctant to buy them for their primary car, because they're not very comfortable for long periods of time.'' **********Two years ago, the Suzuki Samurai was branded as unsafe by Consumer Reports magazine, a contention that Suzuki denied, and sales of the Samurai fell sharply. Since then, Suzuki and G.M. have teamed to build similar vehicles, the Sidekick and Tracker, that the companies say are inherently more stable than the Samurai because of their dimensions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/10/world/panel-hears-how-federal-aid-profited-a-savings-institution.html": {"writer_name": "Jeff Gerth", "pub_date": "1990-07-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Panel Hears How Federal Aid Profited a Savings Institution", "print_headline": "Panel Hears How Federal Aid Profited a Savings Institution", "body_text": " **********A Senate subcommittee was told today that a Texas savings and loan association made up of 15 failed institutions earned huge profits as a result of Government subsidies, but made only four new loans in 1989. **********The panel is looking into how an Arizona insurance executive with legal and regulatory problems was able to acquire the savings and loan from the Government with borrowed money. **********According to testimony by regulators and documents made public today by the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Antitrust, Monopolies and Business Rights, irregularities continued after James M. Fail took control of the revamped institutions. **********Loans to a Lobbyist **********New questions were raised about loans of more than $500,000 last year from Mr. Fail's companies to Robert J. Thompson, a former Congressional liaison aide to George Bush when he was Vice President. **********The Bluebonnet Savings Bank, made up of the 15 savings and loan associations that Mr. Fail took over in 1988, made one of the loans to Mr. Thompson last year. **********Mr. Thompson, now a Washington lobbyist, helped Mr. Fail, who has had legal and regulatory problems, quickly win approval for the takeover of the 15 institutions and for $1.85 billion in Federal aid from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. **********In addition, insurance regulators from Arizona and Illinois told the subcommittee about violations or possible violations by insurance companies used to finance Bluebonnet's acquisition. **********The circumstances of Mr. Fell's acquisition of the insolvent institutions, as detailed in Government documents, were reported Sunday by The New York Times. The hearing today produced new information about how Mr. Fail was hastily selected as the winning bidder, often with missing or inaccurate information, according to testimony by two low-level regulators and supporting documents. **********Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, and the panel's chairman, said the hearing was part of an inquiry into whether the 1988 bailout of the industry was ''simply an exercise in throwing good money after bad'' that involved ''deals set up by the well connected and the high rollers.'' **********Mr. Metzenbaum wants to undo or renegotiate some of the 1988 deals. The competitiveness and cost of these sales are currently being reviewed by the Resolution Trust Corporation under the legislation authorizing the rescue of the savings and loan industry. **********Mr. Fail was invited to the hearing but did not appear. Instead he submitted a statement that referred in general to his record in managing newly acquired insurance companies that had experienced past difficulties. **********''My ability to handle these difficult problems has benefited the public, the policy holders and the employees of the company,'' it said. **********Stanley M. Brand, a Washington lawyer representing Bluebonnet, also issued a statement questioning the subcommittee's tactics and jurisdiction, and suggested the inquiry was politically driven. **********Argument Over the Blame **********The subcommittee inquiry is likely to heighten the argument between the Bush Administration and Democrats in Congress over who is to blame for the savings debacle, one of the nation's costliest. **********Many invited witnesses did not appear today, including Mr. Thompson, the former Bush aide, and former top officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board who were in office at the time of the Bluebonnet acquisition and other deals that critics contend were rushed through in the last days of the Reagan Administration. **********Mr. Thompson also declined to be interviewed or to respond to questions about the loans submitted in writing last month. **********Senator Metzenbaum said the subcommittee might vote to issue subpoenas to resolve many of the unanswered questions. **********New information made available by the subcommittee today showed that Federal regulators concluded that Bluebonnet's profitability last year - it was the most profitable large savings and loan association in the nation - was ''solely due to the extensive assistance provided by (the) Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.'' **********Other information introduced at the hearing showed that one of the new loans made by the Dallas-based institution was a $356,000 mortgage for Mr. Thompson's Washington home. The loan represents more than 25 percent of the new mortgage loans made last year. Information was not disclosed on the other three loans. **********Insurance Problems **********The Phoenix-based Farm and Home Life Insurance Company, one of Mr. Fail's life insurance companies, is the owner of a $150,000 loan to Mr. Thompson. Susan Gallinger, Arizona's director of insurance, told the panel that her department had questions about the transaction, which was made last year. **********Last week, her department suspended Farm and Home's authority to operate. In a regulatory order, the department found, among other things, that an investment reported by Farm and Home in Bluebonnet did not comply with state code. **********State and Federal regulators involved in overseeing Mr. Fail's financing of his Bluebonnet acquisition told the committee that they had been unaware of key details at the time. **********Zack Stamp, the director of insurance for Illinois, said his agency had begun investigating a $25 million loan to Mr. Fail from a Chicago company, the Bankers Life Insurance Company, used to help buy Bluebonnet. **********Rob Roe, a former bank board official, who now works for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, also testified that he was unaware of key details about Mr. Fail's financing, including the sources and timing of Mr. Fail's $70 million capital contribution, $10 million of which was late. **********Mr. Roe, who was designated by his superiors to negotiate the Fail deal in late 1988, told the panel that he believed Mr. Fail was the low-cost bidder to the Government. But documents released by the subcommittee showed that another bidder had sought $97 million less from the Government, and that Mr. Roe was present when the board was told that Mr. Fail's group was the ''second lowest bidder.'' **********Wayne G. Frena, the analyst at the Federal Home Loan Bank in Dallas who reviewed Mr. Fail's background, testified that that he had not been given adequate time and information to do the review. He and other members of the Dallas bank raised objections to Mr. Fail's acquisition because of Mr. Fail's past legal problems, but were overruled after a phone call from Washington. **********Mr. Brand, the attorney for Mr. Fail and Bluebonnet, said that his clients' actions ''were entirely proper and in full compliance'' with Federal law and that Mr. Fail had ''engineered a remarkable turnaround'' in Bluebonnet."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/04/world/in-thatched-roofs-of-argentine-poor-an-insect-that-saps-health-of-millions.html": {"writer_name": "Shirley Christian", "pub_date": "1990-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1169, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Thatched Roofs of Argentine Poor, an Insect That Saps Health of Millions", "print_headline": "In Thatched Roofs of Argentine Poor, an Insect That Saps Health of Millions", "body_text": " **********Ruben Juarez, a Government sanitary agent, stopped at the thatched-roof home of Luisa Chavez, opened two simple cardboard devices hanging on the bedroom walls and found what he feared. **********Out of the accordion-pleated ''sensor'' tumbled a live vinchuca, the blood-sucking insect that carries a disease that often brings early death to the rural poor of Latin America. **********It is known as Chagas's disease, named for the Brazilian doctor who identified it in 1909. The victims, most of whom are initially infected as children, usually recover from the first stage of Chagas's after infection, perhaps suffering a period of fever and a swollen eye. But starting 15 or 20 years later, as many as a third of them will suffer heart disease or digestive complications that can result in sudden death or a long, slow decline. **********The vinchuca, which ranges from the size of a fly to several times larger and carries a deadly parasite called the Trypanosoma cruzi, is drawn to the heavy grass and twigs that many poor farmers in the hottest parts of Latin America use to make roofs over houses known as ranchos. Sometimes the walls are made of adobe, and the vinchuca may hide in the cracks, and sometimes the sides of these houses are open to the air. **********Parasite Drops Onto Skin **********The vinchuca usually drops onto sleeping children at night. It passes along the parasite not through its bite, but when it defecates almost simultaneously and deposits the parasite on the skin surface. If the victim scratches the area of the bite later, the infection enters through the slightly opened skin. The infection can also enter directly into the eye if the bite occurs on the lid, a common occurence. **********Mr. Juarez, riding a bicycle along the dusty, rutted roads here in the western part of the province of Santiago del Estero, visits each home in his territory at least once every three months. When he finds signs of vinchucas he sprays and fumigates with insecticide, the most effective way known to prevent the disease. **********International health officials estimate that 20 million people, living in every mainland country south of the Rio Grande, are infected with some form of Chagas's, but it is in the impoverished north of Argentina and across the border in Bolivia that the infection is believed to be most widespread and to occur in its most serious form. **********Dr. Elsa Segura, who directs the Chagas's institute of the Argentine Health Ministry, said in an interview in Buenos Aires that blood transfusions were the second leading way of transmitting the disease but that only a fraction of the infections in Argentina occur that way because all blood donations in the country are tested for Chagas's. **********Some Congenital Cases **********In some cases, infected mothers pass the disease to their babies at birth. Chagas's experts say that in the north of Argentina, congenital infections occur in about 3.5 percent of all births by infected mothers, and that the figure is as high as 10 percent in some areas of Bolivia. **********''Here in the province of Santiago del Estero, we have the sad privilege of being the most infected area in the nation and one of the worst in Latin America,'' said Dr. Oscar S. Ledesma, who directs the Chagas Diagnostic and Treatment Center at Independencia Hospital in the provincial capital. **********In a 16-bed corner ward of the rundown hospital, children suffering from acute Chagas's infection in its initial form come to be treated with a drug called Benznidazol, which is often successful in killing the parasite. Most carry the telltale sign of one eye nearly swollen shut and have come here by battered bus from as far away as 100 miles after local nurses suspected they might have Chagas's. **********Just a few days before Dr. Ledesma led a visitor into the ward, one of the patients, a 6-month-old girl, died of heart disease after being diagnosed with Chagas's. Hers was one of the rare cases of death occuring during the initial stage of the disease instead of years later. **********Severity of Symptoms Varies **********Dr. Humberto S. Lugones, a pioneer in the treatment of Chagas's in the province who is 75 years old and now semi-retired, estimated that 25 percent of the 650,000 people in Santiago del Estero were infected with Chagas's. Although that is down a few percentage points from earlier years, he and Dr. Ledesma said there had been a rise in acute cases in the last three years. **********Nationwide, about 2 million Argentines in a population of 33 million are infected, and 400,000 to 500,000 of them are believed to suffer some form of heart disease as a result. The only area of Argentina completely free of vinchucas is south of the 42d parallel in cold Patagonia. **********Most people are unaware at the time they become infected because early acute symptoms show up in fewer than 5 percent of the cases. Others may suffer only a slight fever that passes in a few days, or they may have no symptoms at all. **********If the infection is noted at the time and treated with Benznidazol, experts say there is often no long-term effect. But since most infections go untreated, about a third of the infected people in Argentina begin to show signs of heart disease starting 12 to 15 years after infection. In Argentina, cardiologists say, many in that group will die between the age of 30 and 50 as a result of what is called Chagasic myocarditis.

Chagas's experts say they have no figures on the actual death rate from heart disease among Chagas's victims. **********Although researchers are working on a vaccine to prevent Chagas's infection, its use on humans is thought to be years away. **********''This is the disease of the poor, of underdevelopment,'' Dr. Lugones said. ''It affects the areas with the lowest socio-cultural level, where people have little education, don't practice hygiene and have precarious housing. **********''The quickest way to reduce Chagas's in Santiago del Estero would be to replace all the ranchos with decent housing,'' he said, ''but there are 50,000 ranchos in the province and there is no money to replace them.'' **********Doctors dealing with the disease say that because Chagas's affects mainly the poor, it is a low priority in the Argentine national health budget and for international organizations that finance medical research."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/04/business/us-to-sell-bills-today.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. to Sell Bills Today", "print_headline": "U.S. to Sell Bills Today", "body_text": " **********No corporate issues are scheduled this week, according to McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei Inc., a financial research and rating service. **********The following new fixed-income issues are scheduled: **********TAX-EXEMPT **********TENTATIVE OFFERINGS THIS WEEK **********California Housing Finance Agency, $185 million in home mortgage revenue bonds.

While other fashions have come and gone, the lowly T-shirt keeps selling. But even this garment's sales may be vulnerable to a recession. Indeed, a surge in domestic capacity and the flow of imports have made T-shirt marketing a sweaty contact sport. Analysts are expecting cutbacks in domestic T-shirt output to continue in 1991. **********\"The T-shirt market this year is soft due to too much capacity and the erosion in general economic conditions,\" said Robert Blanchard, president of the National Knitwear Manufacturers Association, of Morristown, N.J. \"Retailers knew that they can always get the supply they need and are controlling their inventories.\" **********Because T-shirts are relatively cheap and readily available in a wide range of styles and designs, they appeal to many different people. For example, wearing a T-shirt is a way to assert one's identity or or back up a boast, whether it be about surviving the New York Marathon, visiting Dolly Parton's Dollywood in Tennessee or proclaiming an allegiance to Calvin Klein. \"Over the last five years, demand for T-shirts has been very strong,\" said Deborah Bronston, apparel analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., in New York City. **********Meeting the demand can yield stunning profit margins. Start with a simple white cotton or cotton-polyester shirt, dye it in the factory or run it through a screen or thermal printing machine. With little added expense, a basic $3-wholesale shirt can emerge as a garment that sells for several times more. **********This year, about a billion T-shirts have been made for the United States market, or four for every back. Domestic mills produced about 609 million outerwear-style T- shirts and produced another 300 million meant to be worn as underwear. About 108 million shirts have been imported. **********T-shirts are the only clothing sold not just in stores, but also on the street, in gasoline stations, bowling alleys, movie theaters and zoos. A single shirt can fetch as little as $5 or as much as $150 when sold in boutiques. Even better, in Manhattan's Times Square, three shirts can sell for as low as $10. **********Large makers like Fruit of the Loom Inc. and the Hanes division of Sara Lee Corporation, together account for more than 50 percent of the domestic outerwear T-shirt market, with Fruit of the Loom having a somewhat higher share than Hanes. But retailers buy only about 15 percent of their shirts directly from the manufacturers. The rest filter through wholesalers who either print T-shirts themselves or sell to independent, entrepreneurial style printers. **********Some executives and analysts forecast continuing strong sales. Millions of young and older Americans constantly add to their T-shirt wardrobes -- attesting to the enduring American passion for the casual. \"T-shirts and jeans naturally go together, since each seems to be just right for the other,\" observed Richard Ruster, the president of the Tee Corporation of America, a producer and importer in New York City. \"They're the leisure wear for the 1990's.\" **********Few fashions are so adaptable. What began as outerwear for the fitness craze has become an all-purpose garment for the home and many work places. Indeed, the greatest growth in T-shirt sales has been in outerwear. Jack Hershlag, executive director of the National Association of Men's Sportswear Buyers, speaks of \"the two worlds of T-shirts.\" **********One, he said, is the world of fashion T-shirts, proprietary creations marketed by companies or designers, usually as part of coordinated wardrobes. The other includes the blank shirts that are printed with cartoon characters, team names, product logos, special events, political slogans and jokes. \"Bart Simpson is probably outselling any other cartoon character,\" Mr. Hershlag said. \"It's a case of the product creating its own market, and the more bright ideas there are, the bigger the market will be.\" **********Some analysts say that fashion and novelty will continue to fill T-shirts and T-shirt demand. \"Even though some see an oversupply, I see a continuing, solid trend because of the tie-ins with popular movies or television shows,\" said Arthur Britten, a New York retailing and apparel consultant. \"The 'Dick Tracy' and now 'The Simpsons' shirts have had sales in the millions.\" **********As demand grew in the late 1980's, factories expanded more than 10 percent a year but still ran at capacity. Domestic outerwear production boomed from 382 million shirts in 1986 to 648 million in 1989. Output fell closer to 600 million this year as the manufacturers, fearing oversupply, cut back. **********Importers have had to retreat as well. The biggest source of imported T-shirts is Pakistan, followed by China, Hong Kong and the Philippines. While the foreign flow increased from 14.9 percent of the outerwear market in 1986 to 18.2 percent in 1989, it has slowed this year, dropping an estimated 6 to 8 percent through June, Mr. Blanchard said. **********Domestic T-shirt makers have depended on automation to fend off the imports that have inundated many other types of apparel companies. T-shirts are made from knit jersey, either an all-cotton or polyester blend, by high-speed knitting machines that, in a plant with 500 employees, turn out 17 million shirts a year. But lower fiber costs help keep the price of imported shirts a dollar or two below the cost of domestic products. **********Some American companies are trying to compete by shifting their production overseas. Mr. Ruster said that imports are more likely to thrive in 1991 than domestic production. His three-year-old T-shirt company produces all its garments from abroad. Foreign makers often pay more for import rights -- which, under national quotas, can be bought and traded -- than for actual shirt production. In Mr. Ruster's view, \"That shows the demand still exists for the import.\" **********For manufacturers like Mr. Ruster, T-shirts will never go out of style. \"It's still a very hot business,\" he said. \"The T-shirt business is at its peak and everyone still wants to be in it.\"  DESIGNER T-SHIRTS' TRUE WORTH **********Nobody would price a Claude Monet painting by totaling the value of its canvas, pigment, frame and labor, as well as the retail markup. Likewise, the Monets of the fashion world insist that standard accounting fails to capture their creations' true worth. Far from treating T-shirts as designer doodlings, clever retailers promote them as essential elements in wardrobes. **********Earlier this year, at the Claude Montana boutique in Beverly Hills, Calif., $150 bought a white T-shirt with a big M on the front. However, the French designer will no longer produce these shirts, because, as the boutique manager said, \"We do not renew last season's styles.\" **********Those in the business stress that the finished masterpiece justifies a shirt's high price. \"The designer who decides to do a T-shirt will design it totally, from the fabric, construction, shape and trim,\" said Jack Hershlag, of the National Association of Men's Sportswear Buyers. \"Basic T-shirts are mass-produced and chopped out in standard shapes. But the designer might want his creation longer, shorter, fuller or deeper, or with a higher neck.\" **********Not that this effort is always evident. \"You are paying for the designer's name, which is usually on it, and for the pleasure of the reaction you get,\" Mr. Hershlag said. \"It's a matter of fashion appeal and probably snob appeal. Is it better made? Yes, but probably not much more than the best-made, moderate-priced T-shirt.\" **********Mr. Hershlag said that consumers will never tire of letting designers advertise on their chests. \"Not one bit,\" he said. \"People want that name on their jeans or their T-shirts. Manufacturers are falling all over themselves to get the permission of designers to use their names on the products they make.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/29/world/500000-bicycles-for-cubans.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-09-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 150, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "500,000 Bicycles for Cubans", "print_headline": "500,000 Bicycles for Cubans", "body_text": " **********Cuba will build 500,000 bicycles to help curb effects of a fuel shortage caused by a cutback in oil imports from the Soviet Union, the official Cuban press agency Prensa Latina said today.

The move is expected to be approved by the GATT Council at a regular monthly meeting scheduled for Wednesday. **********An Administration official said today that President Bush wanted a favorable decision before his meeting in two weeks with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as ''a tangible sign of American interest in bringing the Soviet Union into the world economy.'' **********U.S. Opposition Ends **********When Mr. Bush last met the Soviet leader at Malta last year, he pledged to remove American obstacles to Soviet participation in GATT. But the plan at that time was not to allow Moscow in until early next year. **********During most of the last decade, the United States had flatly rejected the idea of granting the Soviets observer status at GATT, considering it politically undesirable and economically impractical. Europeans, on the other hand, felt there would be little harm in letting the Soviets in. **********Earlier this year, the Administration decided to speed up the process started at Malta. **********Torie Clarke, an aide to the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, said, ''This decision stands today.'' **********No Guarantees **********''The United States has let it be known that if agreeable to all other GATT members, we would have no problem with observer status, but we have made it clear that this does not guarantee full membership,'' Ms. Clarke said. **********Observer status, said David Woods, head of information at the GATT headquarters, means the Soviets would be able to attend the monthly meetings of the GATT Council and participate in standing committees, like the Committee on Trade and Development, which works with the third world. **********In addition, the Soviet observers could speak at meetings, if invited, usually after the full members. They would receive all documentation. **********But the Soviets would not be able to vote. Neither would they be permitted to observe nor attend meetings related to the Uruguay Round, the GATT-sponsored effort to get rid of barriers to trade in services and farm products and providing better protection for patents, copyrights and other intellectual property. The Uruguay Round, which began at a negotiating session in Punta del Este, Uruguay, four years ago, is due to be concluded at the end of this year. **********While observer status does not guarantee full membership, it does provide experience in the workings of the trading system. To make the transition to full membership, an applicant nation must enact policies to open its economy to competition and foreign goods. There is a no set list of measures that must be adopted for membership, such as moving to a convertible currency, but the overall drift of the nation's policies must be seen as a clear move toward more liberal trading practices. Full membership in GATT usually insures lower import duties on the products of a member country. **********The move from observer status to membership can take several years. For example, China has been an observer for the last three years. It was moving to satisfy the membership requirements until it crushed student demonstrations last June. The membership talks have been suspended since. **********Some Dispute in Congress **********The decision to back an early approval of observer status for the Soviets could be contentious, because it comes as the Soviets are cracking down economically on Lithuania. **********President Bush announced on April 24 that for the time being he would not order American sanctions against Moscow, but the conflict over Baltic independence is having a significant impact on Washington. **********A resolution calling on the President not to support observership so long as the economic blockade of Lithuania remains has been introduced in the Senate. **********Japan has also used the issue of GATT observer status for the Soviets as a vehicle for underlining its differences with Moscow. Signaling its displeasure over continued Soviet occupation of four Japanese islands off Hokkaido seized in 1945, the Japanese Government asked for a delay last month when the GATT Council first took up the Soviet issue. **********Japan has set the unconditional return of the islands as a condition for concluding a peace treaty and establishing full-fledged economic ties with Moscow. **********But Japanese officials, who want to see the Soviet Union move toward a market-oriented economy, say they do not plan to use the island issue to keep the Soviets out of the GATT. **********''We are coordinating our position with the U.S. and the European Community,'' said Shataro Yachi, political counselor at the Japanese Embassy here. He said the GATT and island issues ''are not directly linked.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev is expected to visit Japan next year, and many Japanese expect that he will try to resolve the territorial problem in return for Japanese economic assistance. **********GATT is important for both the Soviet Union and China as they seek to normalize commercial relations with the rest of the world. Membership protects a nation's trade interests from the discrimination against nonmembers. **********For example, had the Soviet Union been a full member of the GATT, it would have been much more difficult for the United States to deny so-called most favored nation status to Soviet imports, a situation that imposes 10 times higher duties on imports from the Soviet Union than other countries. **********Under a Soviet-American agreement that both sides hope to have ready by the time Mr. Gorbachev meets with Mr. Bush, the Soviets could be accorded lower tariffs. **********GATT membership is also important as a sign of legitimacy and acceptance by the world community. **********Mr. Woods, the GATT official, said membership would involve significant commitments to economic change. ''It cements the reform process that governments wish to pursue,'' he added. **********Mexico and Morocco, two of the newest members, for example, have undertaken significant trade liberalization as a result of their accession. **********The Soviets have been interested in other international economic organizations besides the GATT. **********A $12 billion European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which is expected to open later this year, includes the Soviet Union as well as the United States. **********Moscow has long expressed interest in two important postwar institutions, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The Soviet Union participated actively in the 1944 conference at Bretton Woods, N.H., where these organizations were born. Yet the Soviet Union decided not to join, foreshadowing the cold war. **********The Soviets have not applied for membership in either of the Bretton Woods twins, and it is considered unlikely that Moscow would join, at least until the mid-1990's."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/17/business/trade-gap-reaches-5-year-low.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-02-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 910, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Trade Gap Reaches 5-Year Low", "print_headline": "Trade Gap Reaches 5-Year Low", "body_text": " **********The nation's trade deficit narrowed sharply in December to $7.2 billion, the smallest gap in five years, the Commerce Department reported today. **********The latest figures brought the full-year deficit to $108.6 billion, a reduction of $9.9 billion from the 1988 total. This improvement, however, was far less than the $33.6 billion reduction achieved in the preceding year. **********And while the December performance was considerably better than expected, most private analysts said that the deficit would likely widen again in coming months unless the economy sinks unexpectedly into recession. **********Trend for '90 **********''I think the trend is for little, if any, improvement'' for 1990, said Gary E. Schlossberg, an economist and trade specialist at Wells Fargo Bank. **********Just over three-quarters of the December narrowing was the result of lower imports, a phenomenon that is mostly welcomed but that also implies a weakening domestic economy. This was quite consistent with the department's report last month that gross national product in the fourth quarter grew by a skimpy five-tenths of 1 percent. **********The remainder of the December improvement reflected higher exports, but these were largely the result of a rebound in aircraft sales after the 48-day strike at the Boeing Company was settled Nov. 21. **********Export Momentum Slows **********''Export momentum continues to decline'' after helping to pace economic expansion for much of the past three years, said Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, . **********Currency traders focused on the sluggishness suggested by the decline in imports and the dollar fell against most major currencies. [Page 44.]  The report had little impact on the credit or stock markets. [Page 38.]  A number of analysts, however, took some heart from the December trade figures. The $3.1 billion drop from November's $10.3 billion deficit was significant, said Jerry J. Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, precisely because - not in spite of - the drop in imports. **********''For the first time there are clear indications that in the face of slowing domestic demand, imports of manufactured goods are declining,'' he said. ''The drop in imports of capital equipment at a time when exports of capital goods and machine tools are rising was particularly noteworthy.'' **********Mr. Jasinowski said he disagreed with those who are predicting little further improvement in trade this year. In addition to the gains made by American producers competing with imports, he cited a ''massive boom'' in European demand for American goods and a declining dollar that he expected would bring sustained increases in exports. **********Michael R. Darby, Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, called the report ''quite encouraging'' while cautioning that trade figures are subject to especially large short-run gyrations that make it hard to spot emerging trends. **********Deficit With Japan **********The latest figures show, for example, a second straight sizable decline, to $3.5 billion, in the American deficit with Japan, but analysts remained wary of concluding that this represents fundamental improvement. They noted that the declines of 12 percent in December and 18 percent in November were preceded by a 19 percent jump in October. Imports of Japanese cars rose in December to $1.9 billion, from $1.6 billion in November, the report showed. **********For the year, the United States deficit with Japan totaled $49 billion, down 11.6 percent from the 1988 total of $55.4 billion. **********The trade balance with Western Europe swung in December to a $550 million surplus, from a $750 million deficit, with $100 million of the improvement accounted for by a smaller trading imbalance with West Germany. **********There was some further shrinkage in the American deficit with the newly industrialized countries of the Far East - Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore. The combined deficit was $1.4 billion in December, down from $2.1 billion in November and $2.8 billion in October. Lower imports accounted for somewhat more than half the December improvement. **********Bill for Oil **********The nation's bill for imported oil eased $300 million, to $4.1 billion, in December, as a 27-million-barrel reduction in volume more than offset a 64-cent price increase. This occurred despite record December cold, suggesting that refiners drew down inventories during the month. Analysts expect a huge January increase in the oil bill, which during December represented 56.9 percent of the total trade deficit. **********For the year, oil imports surged 27.2 percent, to $48.94 billion - the highest amount since 1984, when the bill for oil was $52.4 billion. **********December's exports rose 2.4 percent, to $31.1 billion, while imports fell 5.9 percent, to $38.3 billion, the report showed. The $7.2 billion deficit was the lowest since the $6.8 billion posted in December 1984. **********November's deficit, initially reported at $10.5 billion, was revised to $10.3 billion but remained the worst deficit of 1989. **********Capital goods accounted for the biggest changes on both sides of the equation for December - a $1 billion increase in exports, three-quarters of it aircraft, and a $1.1 billion decline in imports. **********Without seasonal adjustment, the deficit dropped even more - to $6.4 billion from $10.6 billion, the report also showed.

Baker 3d told Soviet leaders in Moscow last week that the Administration is now ready to entertain new Soviet ideas on what sort of subsequent reductions in long-range nuclear arms should be carried out after the current Strategic Arms Reduction Talks are concluded. **********Thinking of 'Next Phase' **********''Up to now we have not been willing to discuss the Soviet ideas on Start-2 on the ground that we still have work to do on Start-1,'' said a senior Administration official. ''Now we are saying you can raise your ideas if you want to. We are getting to the point where we need to think a little bit about the next phase.'' **********The question of whether to seek further reductions in long-range nuclear weapons after an agreement is reached has been a contentious one for the Bush Administration. Some Administration officials, like the White House national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, have argued that reductions in nuclear weapons should not be pursued for their own sake, and the Administration has yet to formulate a basic position of what additional cuts in long-range nuclear arms, if any, might be sought. **********The treaty currently under negotiation would cut the number of nuclear weapons carried by long-range missiles and bombers by about 30 percent. A second treaty, if it were negotiated, would make deeper cuts, although officials said it was too early to determine what the extent of its reductions might be. **********Seed for a Second Treaty **********Administration officials said Mr. Baker's invitation to the Russians to present their ideas did not commit Washington to presenting its own proposals for a new treaty. Nonetheless, some officials said Mr. Baker's move was potentially significant because it would force the Bush Administration to define its thinking on future arms cuts and could initiate a process that would lead to talks on a second treaty. **********''The major impact is likely to be on the process back home,'' one Administration arms control specialist said. ''Bureaucratically, it will stimulate us to think about what happens after Start, if only to have something to say to the Soviets.'' **********Another official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the likely effect of the Administration's decision would be to encourage the initiation of talks on a second arms treaty. **********''The willingness to hear the Soviet ideas on Start-2 does not mean that there might not be a pause after Start,'' the official said. ''But the general direction is not in favor of a pause.'' **********Still, the course of strategic arms control policy in the Bush Administration is far from clear. Mr. Scowcroft said after the Malta summit meeting in December that the two sides should pause after the first treaty is completed before deciding whether to begin talks on a second. **********Some officials who remain wary of promising deeper strategic arms cuts say the Administration's new willingness to listen to Soviet ideas does not necessarily commit the United States to negotiating a second treaty. Given the differences among American arms control specialists, the presentation of new Soviet ideas could prompt heated debate within the Bush Administration. **********Administration officials said the Soviet proposals would be presented in Geneva to Richard R. Burt, the chief American strategic arms negotiator, by Yuri Nazarkin, the top Soviet negotiator on long-range nuclear weapons. **********Several Reasons Cited **********Administration officials cited several reasons to receive Soviet ideas. By taking up such proposals, the Bush Administration may be able to influence Moscow's new five-year program to develop strategic weapons and further reduce the Soviet nuclear threat to the United States, said one senior official. **********Another official said talks on a second treaty could be a useful ''dumping ground for hard issues that could slow down Start-1.'' **********Mr. Scowcroft, for example, has reportedly expressed interest in far-reaching strategic arms measures, like a ban on all multiple-warhead land-based missiles. But some officials say the introduction into the current talks of major new proposals like that would prevent President Bush from meeting his timetable of completing a strategic arms treaty this year. **********Such innovative proposals might have a place in negotiations for a second treaty, officials say. If such talks were opened, the United States might want to negotiate an entire new treaty or simply prepare amendments to the first document, officials said. **********No Harm in Listening **********Beyond that, some Administration officials say there is no harm in listening to new Soviet ideas now that an initial treaty appears to be within reach. **********An official, who noted that there are differences within the Administration over whether to proceed with a second treaty, said: ''Discussing Start-2 is something the Soviets clearly want to do. We will let them present their ideas and try to clarify what they mean. That does not commit us to a full-fledged discussion.'' **********The Administration's new willingness to hear Soviet ideas follows reports of important headway being made in the Moscow talks on conventional arms and strategic weapons issues. **********But despite that progress, officials expressed disappointment with the Soviet reaction to new proposals by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on cutting aircraft. American officials said Moscow was still resisting strict limits on its training and interceptor planes, among other problems. **********Administration officials also said today that it was unlikely Mr. Baker would be able to respond to a new proposal by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for troop reductions in Europe during a meeting of foreign ministers from NATO and the Warsaw Pact that opens Monday in Ottawa.

In the process, it is turning patents into a major profit center. **********But rival semiconductor and computer companies are rising up in anger, saying that Texas Instruments' demands have become excessive, threatening to stifle innovation and to entangle the industry in wasteful lawsuits. They see Texas Instruments' actions as part of a demoralizing trend in the United States in which companies are becoming more competitive in the courtroom as they become less competitive in the technological marketplace. **********'Getting Everybody Mad' **********They see in Texas Instruments' crusade not a legitimate desire to protect crucial technology but a desperate move by a company that can no longer compete in the marketplace and is seeking instead to live off payments from inventions, many of them unimportant, that it made 10, 20 or even 30 years ago. **********''They are riding on their position from the past,'' said Wilfred Corrigan, chief executive of LSI Logic, a Silicon Valley semiconductor company that has been sued by Texas Instruments. **********''They are getting everybody mad at them,'' Mr. Corrigan said, predicting that companies would retaliate by seeking higher royalties on their own patents. ''The intellectual property weapon is a little bit like poison gas or an atom bomb,'' Mr. Corrigan said. ''Before you throw it, you'd better make sure it doesn't bounce back on you.'' Other executives say Texas Instruments risks losing business from companies it antagonizes. **********Even some executives who have not been sued and who favor tough protection of patents think Texas Instruments might have gone too far. **********''I think they got carried away; I think it's a little abusive,'' said W. J. Sanders 3d, chairman of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., another semiconductor company, who nevertheless said Texas Instruments' intentions are ''fundamentally sound.'' **********Richard J. Agnich, general counsel for Texas Instruments, denied that the company had become uncompetitive or was resting on its laurels. Texas Instruments ranked 17th in the number of patents received in 1989, he said, and some of the patents involved in negotiations with Japanese companies are based on developments in the last decade. Moreover, he said, the company is continuing to fight in the memory-chip business. **********Mr. Agnich said that charging royalties for patent use was another way for a company to earn a return on its investment in research and development, supplementing the traditional way of selling products developed from the research. **********The other companies are reacting as a person would if he were told he would have to pay to use a lawn mower he had been borrowing from a neighbor for years, Mr. Agnich said. The person would get angry, but no one would question the right of the lawn mower owner to ask for payments or stop lending the mower. **********''When people look back 10 years from now, they'll say, 'Those guys were just the first of what has become the norm,' '' he said. Other companies are indeed moving toward more aggressive use of their patents, though none have gone as far as Texas Instruments in making patents a large source of income. Royalty rates, like real estate prices in the 1980's, have been rising sharply. **********Gaining an Edge **********Historically, electronics companies liberally licensed their patents, with royalties of no more than 3 percent, or never even bothered to obtain patents. The ethic was to outrun the competitors, not block them. By the time a patent was issued, it was thought, the technology would be obsolete. **********But as the industry has become more competitive, companies have tried to use every asset at their disposal to gain an edge. The creation in the early 1980's of a special Federal court for handling patent appeals also contributed to stronger enforcement of patents. **********Companies including the Intel Corporation and Apple Computer Inc. have become more diligent in protecting their intellectual property. **********In a more general sense, American companies are relying more on their technological inventions and less on their manufacturing prowess in competing with Japanese companies, which can afford to invest more in plants and equipment. Many newer American semiconductor companies design chips but let others manufacture them, in a sense earning their return on their intellectual work. **********'A Profit Center' **********But Texas Instruments has taken the concept of intellectual property as a source of revenue to a new level. **********''T. I. is one of the first companies that very publicly decided to make its intellectual property a profit center,'' said Robert P. Merges, a professor at Boston University Law School. ''For most firms, patents still occupy the traditional role of being partly a strategic weapon to slow down competition and partly a bargaining chip to negotiate with competitors.'' **********While Texas Instruments' patent policy has the support of the top executives at the company, it is being spearheaded by Mr. Agnich, Mel Sharp, the highest patent attorney at the company, and Richard Donaldson, who is in charge of patent licensing. For its litigation the company has relied on the Cleveland-based law firm Jones Day Reavis & Pogue. **********One reason Texas Instruments stands out, lawyers say, is that few other companies have a patent portfolio as strong. And two that do, I.B.M. and A.T.&T., have been reluctant to press their hands for fear of antitrust lawsuits. **********Suits in Far East **********Texas Instruments first struck five years ago, suing eight Japanese and one Korean semiconductor company, accusing them of infringing semiconductor patents. The settlements have yielded Texas Instruments more than $600 million in payments since 1986. **********Now, Texas Instruments is becoming even more aggressive, pursuing payments on three fronts. **********In Japan, where most of the 1986 licensing agreements are coming up for renewal, the company has been seeking royalties as high as 10 percent on the price of chips, triple the usual level, Japanese press reports say. Texas Instruments' hand was strengthened last year when it finally received a Japanese patent for the invention of the basic integrated circuit by Jack Kilby in 1958. **********If all its demands are met, which is unlikely, Texas Instruments' royalties from Japan could jump to between $500 million and $2 billion a year, from more than $150 million now, according to various estimates by Wall Street analysts and the Japanese press. Japanese companies, calling the demands outrageous, have vowed to resist. **********Texas Instruments is seeking royalties from more than 30 makers of personal computers for use of patents covering how a microprocessor connects with other parts of the computer, work that dates back to the early 1970's. The company has already sued Zenith Data Systems, Samsung, Daewoo and Dell Computer over these patents. **********Lawyers say Texas Instruments is seeking royalties of 2 to 3 percent on the sale of each personal computer, or about $50 for a $2,000 machine. Such royalties could earn the company as much as $100 million a year for five years, said Stuart Lubitz, a Los Angeles patent attorney who is following the case for several clients. **********Smaller computer companies worry that such high payments will put them at a disadvantage compared with some large companies that can use Texas Instruments' patents without paying in exchange for licensing their own technologies. The Tandy Corporation filed an antitrust suit last month accusing Texas Instruments of seeking excessive royalties for invalid patents. **********Dispute Over a Process **********In the American semiconductor industry, Texas Instruments sued five smaller companies last year for infringing a patent, also dating from the early 1970's, that covers a process for encasing a computer chip in plastic. Four of the companies, including LSI Logic, have joined to fight the suit. They argue that the process for which Texas Instruments has a patent is just one step out of hundreds in making a chip. If each of several hundred companies demanded a similar royalty for use of their process, the payments would far exceed the price of the chip, they say. **********Some people support Texas Instruments. Rajiv Chaudhri, semiconductor analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Company, said profit margins in the pharmaceutical industry were three times those of the semiconductor industry, largely because drugs have stronger patent protection than semiconductors. The result, he said, is that while drug companies can sustain themselves, American semiconductor companies, as a group, are not generating enough cash from operations to survive over the long run. **********Texas Instruments needs all the patent royalties it can get. Unlike most American chip companies, it is still in the dynamic random access memory chip business, which requires large investments and is dominated by the Japanese. **********Moreover, its other businesses are hurting. Its computer business has never been very successful. Its semiconductor business is considered to have a lackluster product line and has recently fallen into the red. The company has been sustained through semiconductor slumps by its military electronics business, but that business is now likely to be hurt by Federal budget cuts. **********Mr. Chaudhri of Goldman, Sachs estimates that the company will make no profit on its operations in 1991, but will record after-tax earnings of $333 million, or $4 a share, strictly from royalties, assuming it is successful in getting what it is demanding from Japanese companies. **********Threat From the Japanese **********The threat to Texas Instruments is that companies will find a way to fight back. Japanese companies are among the leaders now in obtaining United States patents for their own technologies, putting them in a position to turn the tables. **********Hitachi showed just how effective this tactic can be after it was sued by Motorola for infringing Motorola's microprocessor patents. Hitachi managed to find one of its patents on which Motorola infringed. Motorola was ordered to halt shipments of its flagship product, the 68030 microprocessor. The companies negotiated a settlement last week that will allow both to continue shipping products. **********In the case of the plastic packaging and personal computer patents, the company's opponents dismiss the patents as old and unimportant and will seek to invalidate them."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/09/business/briefs-187590.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-01-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** Alcan Aluminum Ltd., Montreal, is offering $100 million in 9 1/2 percent debentures due 2010 at 98.986 to yield 9.615 percent through Morgan Stanley & Co.

But the sale of the division is at such a low price that analysts said the deal would be likely to hurt Mr. Farley's position, making it harder for him to line up financing for the rest of West Point. The buyer is the Bidermann Group, a French apparel maker, which will pay $350 million in cash and give a $60 million promissory note to acquire Cluett. **********'A Long Way to Go' **********''Farley still has a long way to go,'' said Kenneth Karwowski, an analyst at Duff & Phelps Inc., an investment research firm based here. He is far from out of the woods.'' **********Mr. Farley's company, Farley Industries, best known for its controlling stake in Fruit of the Loom underwear, announced last spring that it would pay $3 billion for West Point, one of the nation's leading makers of bath towels, sheets and raw fabric. To complete the merger, the industrialist set up a special company, the West Point Acquisition Corporation, which raised $2.9 billion, or roughly 95 percent of what was needed, from banks and private investors. But it was then unable to raise more money. **********For Mr. Farley, selling West Point assets became immediately necessary for two reasons: first, to pay off large portions of the bank debt, and second, to persuade investors to finance his purchase of the remaining 5 percent of West Point. Mr. Farley had said that to make the takeover a success he would need to raise at least $1.3 billion through asset sales. **********Loans in Trouble **********Now that Mr. Farley has succeeded in selling one of West Point's biggest assets, but at a price far lower than he had forecast last year, analysts say that both his bid and the bank loans he took out to finance the first part of the takeover are in trouble. **********In particular, Mr. Farley told investment professionals late last spring that Cluett would command anywhere from $700 million to $750 million, Mr. Karwowski said, adding that ''back in September they still were looking at $600 million.'' As re-cently as January, however, after West Point said it had reached an agreement in principle with Bidermann for Cluett, word began circulating in the investment community that the sales price for Cluett was continuing to drop. One person close to the talks said at the time that a $500 million price was likely. **********Analysts gave two possible explanations for why the price came in even lower. One possibility is that Bidermann reviewed Cluett's fourth-quarter operating results and found them to be worse than expected. The other is that Bidermann drove the price down by exploiting Mr. Farley's inability to raise money in other ways - through, say, the sale of high-yield ''junk bonds.'' **********The sales price for Cluett was ''below our estimate, which in turn was below Farley's projections,'' said Josie Esquivel, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ''It may have been a matter of Bidermann's knowing that Farley was up against a wall.'' **********Effect of Drexel Bankruptcy **********Indeed, now that Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., one of Mr. Farley's lead financiers in the past, is in bankruptcy and the junk bond market he had hoped to tap has dried up, Mr. Farley has little choice but to sell assets to meet his obligations to his bankers, analysts said. In fact, even if Mr. Farley could tap the junk-bond market, he would still have to sell assets, the analysts say. **********''If this deal was going to work, it would be because assets could be sold at high prices,'' said James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, a financial newsletter. ''It was not going to work because West Point produced sufficient sales and earnings to cover the debt. This was to be a leveraged liquidation.'' **********For Mr. Farley's bankers, the lower-than-expected price tag on Cluett makes it less likely that they will be repaid the roughly $1 billion they lent him in the form of a bridge loan to acquire 95 percent of West Point. But analysts said bankers were eager to avoid forcing West Point into bankruptcy, since that would mean that the banks might not get paid for years. As evidence, the analysts pointed to the banks' decision, announced Wednesday, to extend the bridge loan to 1994. **********Some analysts have begun to wonder whether Mr. Farley may be facing a cash squeeze himself. Although he has turned around Fruit of the Loom, bonds of his main operating company, Farley Industries, have been coming due. To meet interest and principal payments on these bonds, Mr. Farley has been selling other assets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/30/business/briefs-487590.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 322, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Acton Corp, Raleigh, N.C., an insurance and real estate concern, agreed to purchase the furniture operations of Hickory Furniture Co., High Point, N.C., for $44.5 million.

That has placed the company, a joint venture of Sears, Roebuck & Company and the International Business Machines Corporation, at the center of a debate about the nature of electronic mail and electronic forums. The stakes are large. Because Prodigy is owned by two formidable companies, and because the service is rapidly gaining customers, the issues raised in the Prodigy debate could have implications for other on-line services. **********Yet Prodigy says there is nothing to debate. In these pages last week, Geoffrey Moore, the company's director of market programs and communications, said: \"The First Amendment protects private publishers, like The New York Times and Prodigy, from Government interference in what we publish. The Constitution bestows no rights on readers to have their views published in someone else's private medium. What the Constitution does give readers is the right to become publishers themselves.\" **********Not everyone sees the issue in those terms.  While Prodigy refers to itself as a private carrier and to its customers as members, it is a public service in the sense that it is open to anyone who pays a monthly fee. Among its services are electronic mail, in which computer users can exchange private messages, and public forums, in which members can post messages on what is, in effect, an electronic bulletin board. And Prodigy is alone among the major on-line information services in screening all messages before they are posted to the public forums, rejecting any that run counter to what Prodigy executives deem appropriate. **********Millions of personal computers users use various on-line messaging services. In the office, such systems are typically private, but these private office mail systems are increasingly being linked to public carriers, allowing a worker to send E-mail, facsimile, telex, digital pager and regular postal messages to workers in other offices or to anyone else linked on the worldwide telecommunications networks. **********Many companies have a formal policy on the use of such systems; those that do not should probably get to work on one immediately. \"Logical policies should be taken for the benefit of both employers and employees, and the policies should be made known,\" said Michael F. Cavanagh, executive director of the Electronic Mail Association, a trade group based in Arlington, Va. \"It's less clear whether or not there should be one policy for all companies. You run into a range of different interests and concerns.\" **********The debate about Prodigy began when some subscribers protested its policy to impose a surcharge on heavy users of its E-mail service. The protest was expressed mainly by posting electronic messages on the service -- certainly one of the first on-line consumer protests. But some of the protesters contacted Prodigy's advertisers through private electronic mail. (Prodigy is also one of the few on-line services that includes paid advertising on every computer screen.) According to Prodigy executives, the advertisers complained and sent them copies of the protesters' private messages. The executives then banned the most vocal protesters and closed the public forum in which the rate increases were being discussed by members. Prodigy has since invited some of the banned protesters to reapply for membership. **********There is no evidence that Prodigy executives read the private mail of the protesters, and they insist that all E-mail is private. However, they acknowledge that they routinely monitor messages sent to the public areas of the network. \"Members agree not to submit, publish, or display on the Prodigy service any defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, obscene, profane, sexually explicit, threatening, ethnically offensive, or illegal material,\" the Prodigy membership agreement states. **********The agreement, to which all Prodigy applicants must agree before they are given access to the system, adds: \"Prodigy reserves the right to review and edit any material submitted for display or placed on the Prodigy service, excluding private electronic messages, and may refuse to display or remove from the service any material that it, in its sole discretion, believes violates this agreement or is otherwise objectionable.\" **********Other on-line information services have similar restrictions against libelous, obscene or otherwise offensive material and will remove posted messages that violate those rules. At Compuserve Inc., whose claimed customer base of 740,000 users makes it the country's largest on-line information service, the policy is to allow all messages to be posted, and then to intervene only if other users complain. In most cases the offending messages are removed and the user is warned by electronic and postal mail. In worst cases the subscriber is kicked off the service. **********Ten users have been terminated from Compuserve in the last three and a half years, said Dave Kissler, a Compuserve spokesman. \"There are two key rules that we enforce strictly,\" he said. \"One is not to use the system to be abusive to others or to lessen the favorable experience of others using the service.\" The other, he said, is not to solicit members to leave for rival services. **********\"We have 240 forums, containing hundreds of thousands of messages at any time,\" Mr. Kissler said. \"Forums are central to the nature of the on-line environment, really the lifeblood of what the communications service provides. Part of that is the lively exchange of opinions on a variety of topics.\" **********The lines get fuzzy when, in the course of that lively exchange, the sender's language or sentiment gets overheated. **********\"There is some debate in legal circles on the extent to which videotex service providers must screen publicly posted messages,\" said Benjamin Wright, a lawyer in Dallas who specializes in electronic communications law. \"If the law sees the provider as more like a newspaper, then the duty to screen is higher. But if the law sees the provider as more like a telephone company, a communications common carrier, then the duty is lower.\" **********\"However,\" Mr. Wright said, \"I believe it will be very difficult for anyone to argue that a service provider cannot set ground rules for its service, such as no profanity, no drug deals and even no political messages to advertisers.\" **********Some critics say the Prodigy ground rules are excessively broad, permitting the service to ban items on the basis of content (such as a protest against Prodigy policies). For example, Prodigy closed a public forum that featured a debate between homosexuals and fundamentalist Christians. Prodigy officials cited lack of general interest in the forum, while critics cited censorship."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/14/business/all-about-minivans-zippy-hybrids-win-a-place-in-the-family-driveway.html": {"writer_name": "Doron Levin", "pub_date": "1990-01-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1393, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ALL ABOUT/Minivans;   Zippy Hybrids Win a Place in the Family Driveway", "print_headline": "ALL ABOUT/Minivans;   Zippy Hybrids Win a Place in the Family Driveway", "body_text": " **********For sheer inventiveness, there is little in the automotive world to rival theVoyager III, the Chrysler Corporation's vision of the ultimate minivan.

Even as minivan sales rise - and station wagon sales stagnate - the auto companies' market forecasters agree that the United States minivan market can't expand beyond one million to 1.5 million sales annually, compared with 835,000 (including cargo, not just passenger, minivans) in 1989. Minivans range in price from about $12,000 to $18,500 and more for deluxe models. **********Automakers are trying to lure minivan buyers with more sophisticated designs and hotter performance. While other minivans have sliding doors, the Mazda MPV, introduced earlier this year, sets itself apart by introducing an oversize side door that swings open. **********Innovations and new designs are evidence that automakers are pouring money and manpower into crossbreeding cars and trucks. The popularity of these hybrids reflects the more active, family-oriented lifestyles of customers and their demand for space without sacrificing comfort. **********Second Try Toyota Redesigns Its American Entry **********The Toyota Motors Corporation stumbled in its first attempt to crack the American minivan market. Now, the biggest Japanese automaker is ready for an ambitious second try. Toyota's original van, a model popular in Japan, failed to capitalize on a strong market in the United States because the design was awkward for Americans. With the front seats located forward of the front axle, passengers had to climb over the front wheel to get in. ''The Japanese are a bit smaller physically, and it wasn't as much of a problem for them,'' said John Koenig, Toyota's product planning manager in this country. **********Later this year Toyota will introduce the Previa, an import from Japan that it boasts is ''a completely fresh approach to passenger transportation.'' Toyota said its engineers evaluated competitor's minivans and concluded that engine and transmission layouts wasted interior room. **********Toyota designed its 2.4-liter, four-cylinder engine to sit at an angle so it fits precisely in the center of the vehicle, under the floor. This layout, Toyota claims, gives the Previa more length and cargo volume than the stretched version of Chrysler's minivan. Toyota added special rear seats that almost completely fold out of the way. Rear-wheel drive is standard, four-wheel drive optional. Mr. Koenig stressed to Toyota designers in Japan that Previa must be wide enough to carry standard-size plywood or dry wall sheets flat on the floor. To make sure Japanese engineers got the point, Toyota's United States planners bought some plywood and shipped it to the home office in Nagoya. **********New Production Automakers Hedge Their Bets **********No automaker wants to arrive at the minivan party with a new model just as the music stops. With plenty of new models on the way, automakers are wary of losses after a binge of enthusiasm and overinvestment. **********The General Motors Corporation has dedicated only one assembly plant, in North Tarrytown, N.Y., to building front-wheel-drive minivans. Production of the Chevy Lumina, Pontiac Transport and Oldsmobile Silhouette minivans, featuring futuristic designs and plastic body panels, began in November and is increasing slowly. **********Last year Chrysler, which was operating minivan plants on two shifts with overtime in St. Louis and Windsor, Ont., agonized over whether to add a third plant before deciding it was too risky. The cost of a new plant would have required the No. 3 automaker to sell more than 700,000 minivans annually, up from almost 500,000 now (24.4 percent of the cars and light trucks Chrysler builds). Instead, Chrysler tried to wring an additional 50,000 units from the St. Louis plant by adding a third shift and asking employees to work four 10-hour days. The workers refused because they couldn't agree with Chrysler on overtime pay. **********Ford Motor Company and Nissan Motor Corporation, both eager to enter the minivan arena, decided to reduce their risk by collaborating. Ford already builds the Aerostar van, smaller than a full-size van but not a true mini. Nissan sells the Axxess station wagon, which has some minivan qualities. Together, they will build a new front-wheel-drive minivan at a Ford plant in Lorain, Ohio, probably beginning in 1992. Early speculation was that it would be a luxury model.  The Honda Motor Company spent heavily to develop its own minivan. But a Honda spokesman said the company concluded there are so many competitors that Honda could not make a profit. So the company decided to buck the trend and bring out another type of utility vehicle that G.M., Ford and Chrysler are turning away from: a station wagon, in a new Accord model. Honda will begin building the wagons at its plant in Marysville, Ohio, later this year. The plant will export to Japan and possibly to Europe. **********Minivan Safety Federal Regulators Tighten the Rules **********As minivans and other truck hybrids become more popular for toting passengers, they face more scrutiny from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. When minivans first appeared in the early 1980's, some car safety rules didn't apply. Minivans weren't required to have head restraints, roofs that could pass crush tests, sides reinforced against impact or shoulder harnesses for rear passengers. Truck safety requirements have been less stringent since they have been used primarily for cargo. **********Federal regulators now are moving to require minivans, utility vehicles (passenger vehicles built on truck chassis) and pickup trucks to comply with the rules for cars. Proposed crushing and impact standards are under discussion. In 1991, all light trucks must have head restraints and rear passenger shoulder harnesses. On January 4, the N.H.T.S.A. proposed a requirement for front-seat passive restraints - automatic seat belts or air bags - for the 1994 model year. **********Even without meeting federal standards, minivans have a good safety record. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says that minivans have proportionately fewer fatalities than all but the biggest cars. **********THE GENDER FACTOR **********Auto executives hate to characterize a vehicle type as the province of one gender - why alienate 50 percent of the public? - but if there ever was a ''man's car,'' they say, the four-wheel-drive utility vehicle is it. **********Utility vehicles, or passenger vehicles built on truck chassis, were inspired by Jeeps, pickup trucks and even British Land-Rovers. Although minivans also qualify as truck hybrids, few buyers consider them as alternatives to utility vehicles. Each has its own strong market, much influenced by gender. **********Utility vehicles are tougher to control but better at handling rough roads. They have a bumpier ride and cabins high off the ground. Minivans handle more like cars, with cabins low enough to enter easily when the rider is wearing a skirt. ''You make a different statement about yourself with a utility vehicle than with a minivan,'' said Joseph Cappy, the Chrysler vice president of brand development. ''One is a macho, daring bon vivant. The other is Joe Family.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/06/business/ex-im-bank-resumes-aid-to-china.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1990-02-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 551, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ex-Im Bank Resumes Aid to China", "print_headline": "Ex-Im Bank Resumes Aid to China", "body_text": " **********The Export-Import Bank, an agency of the Federal Government that provides credit to the customers of American exporters, has made its first loan to China since the military crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators in June, bank officials said today. **********The loan is believed to be the first to China by any Western lending agency since June. **********The $9.75 million loan to the China National Offshore Oil Corporation was signed in Washington on Friday.

''I assume you have not named me to this office so that I, too, should lie to you. **********''We have become morally ill because we are used to saying one thing and thinking another,'' Mr. Havel said. His televised message seemed to be aimed at sobering a people who spent the New Year's holiday in delirious celebration of his election and the new freedom that it symbolized. [Excerpts from Mr. Havel's speech appear on page A13.]  A Sadness 'Inflicted on Ourselves' **********But in an allusion to widespread Czechoslovak resentment of the Soviet Union, he said, ''It would be very unwise to think of the sad heritage of the last 40 years only as something foreign, something inherited from a distant relative.'' On the contrary, he said, ''it is ''something we have inflicted on ourselves.'' **********Mr. Havel, who was elected by the national Parliament on Friday, repeatedly called in his 40-minute address for mutual respect among the Czechs, Slovaks, and other nationalities in this Central European country, without directly comparing ethnic tensions with similar problems in the Soviet Union. **********He announced an amnesty for thousands of prisoners who have been protesting overcrowded conditions, poor food, and the lack of rehabilitation in more than a score of jails across the country. **********He also called for trials to assess responsibility for the Stalinist style of repression in Czechoslovakia over the past 40 years; said he hoped that diplomatic relations could soon be restored with the Vatican and Israel; and invited Pope John Paul II and the Dalai Lama, the winner of last year's Nobel Peace Prize, to visit Czechoslovakia. **********Amnesty for Lighter Offenses **********Mr. Havel is to visit East Germany and West Germany on Tuesday. ''I want to contribute to the cause of peace,'' he said, ''by my short visit tomorrow to our two mutually related neighbors: the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.'' **********''I have decided to proclaim a relatively broad amnesty,'' he said of the prison inmates, ''but I appeal to the prisoners to understand that 40 years of degraded justice cannot be done away with all at once. By uprisings they will help neither the republic nor themselves.'' **********He urged Czechoslovak citizens ''not to be afraid of released prisoners, but to help them in a Christian spirit after their return among us, to find in themselves what our prisons could not instill: repentance and a desire to lead a good life.'' **********Officials said later that the amnesty would free all prisoners serving sentences of two years or less and reduce longer terms by as much as one half. It would not affect people convicted of terrorism, murder, robbery, rape or other sexual abuse, or misuse of public office. The country's jails hold about 50,000 people. **********Ex-Party Chief in Custody **********The highest-ranking Czechoslovak official known to have been taken into custody on charges of abusing his office is Miroslav Stepan, who was the head of Prague's Communist Party organization when the police in the capital moved in to repress demonstrations on Nov. 17. He was arrested on Dec. 23, the Government press agency said. **********Mr. Havel also replaced the Prosecutor General and the Interior Minister today, continuing a shake-up in response to the Nov. 17 crackdown. **********In a series of prison terms beginning in 1977, Mr. Havel served more than five years for refusing to surrender his conscience to the dictates of the Communist state. **********He told his listeners today that he would be ''a President that would speak less but work harder, who will be permanently present among his fellow citizens and listen to them well.'' **********He said that the most difficult work, of insuring that freedom will last, was only beginning, like the cleanup of champagne bottles and broken streamers from Wenceslas Square, Prague's main gathering place. **********From Revelry to Reflection **********The cobblestones were literally wet with champagne Sunday night as tens of thousands of people came out to celebrate the New Year with whatever beverage came to hand, often sparkling wine made in the Soviet Union. Friends and lovers embraced on the square, firecrackers exploded in salutes and the crowd burst into song, marking the end of a year that also brought new freedom to Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Rumania. **********''You have had freedom always,'' said a gray-haired man, Jaroslav Baraban, amid the din, ''but we have only known it for a month.'' **********Like many who filled the vast square, half a mile long and 200 feet wide, between midnight and dawn this morning, the man was nearly weeping. He joined in the repeated chants of ''Havel, Havel,'' ''Long Live Havel'' that demonstrate how much of a symbol the new President has become. **********The celebrations turned more solemn and dignified today as church bells pealed from the medieval towers and baroque domes of the golden city. The gilded baroque interior of the Church of St. James filled with worshipers who flocked to hear a high mass and a performance of Mozart's Coronation Mass by a choir and orchestra. Tonight Mr. Havel and his wife attended a concert of Dvorak's Slavonic Dances in the Municipal Building, where the independence of Czechoslovakia was first proclaimed in 1918. **********A Farewell to Cynicism **********''Everywhere in the world,'' Mr. Havel told the nation in his address this afternoon, ''people were surprised at how these malleable, humiliated, cynical citizens of Czechoslovakia, who seemingly believed in nothing, found the tremendous strength to cast off the totalitarian system in an entirely peaceful and dignified manner within a few weeks. **********''Humanistic and democratic tradition slept on after all somewhere in the unconscious of our nation and national minorities,'' he said. **********But Czechoslovakia also owed its freedom, Mr. Havel said, ''to the courage of those in the Soviet Union, East Germany, Hungary and Poland who had fought for theirs.'' **********''All human suffering concerns each human being,'' he said. He acknowledged that without recent political changes in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia's revolution would have suffered the same fate as the Prague Spring of 1968, the reform movement that was cut short by a Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion. **********Mr. Havel ended his speech with a double echo of Czechoslovak history. He recalled that Thomas G. Masaryk, Czechoslovakia's first President, had taken a prayer by the 17th century Moravian churchman, John Amos Comenius, and paraphrased it: ''Your Government, my people, has returned to you.'' **********The crowd in Wenceslas Square last night also echoed Comenius, breaking into a song made popular by the artist Marta Kubicova during the brief Prague Spring. ''May peace be with this land,'' they sang. ''Let hate, envy, fear and conflict pass. May they pass, may they pass.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/28/business/company-news-wal-mart-net-jumps-by-31.8.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1990-02-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 773, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Wal-Mart Net Jumps By 31.8%", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Wal-Mart Net Jumps By 31.8%", "body_text": " **********An article in Business Day yesterday about the earnings of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. misstated the 1989 net income for Sears, Roebuck & Company's merchandising group.

The end-of-the-year delivery ''implies to me that they're having more difficulty producing those machines than we anticipated,'' he said. **********He said the late delivery would ''have a dampening effect on the stock.'' **********Information about the announcement began leaking out last week when Hewlett-Packard briefed computer industry consultants, and ''the share price has been drifting down because of it,'' Mr. Jones said. On Jan. 2, the stock's closing price was $49.375. **********John Dean, an analyst with Salomon Brothers in San Francisco, said he was disappointed by the late delivery of the high-end machines, particularly because Hewlett-Packard's RISC architecture was designed with multiple processor versions in mind from the start. **********''The question you have to ask is why is it taking so long when it's a basic part of the architecture,'' he said. He had expected the machines to be shipped by midyear. **********Taking a more positive view, Russell Crabs, an analyst with the Soundview Financial Group, complimented Hewlett-Packard for the quantity and quality of the equipment announced. ''The real exciting thing in a technology sense is the new CMOS implementation of the Precision Architecture,'' he said, referring to the use of chips based on CMOS, a type of silicon that operates more coolly and allows more devices on a chip than conventional materials. **********Using CMOS allowed Hewlett-Packard to offer a machine with mainframe-level performance at a far lower price, which will open up a new product category and expand the market for the company's computers, Mr. Crabs said, adding that he was not concerned by the end-of-the-year delivery date. **********''The sales cycle on the high-end systems is so long that if they announce them now it will take that long to close business,'' he said. **********Soundview has had a long-term buy recommendation on Hewlett-Packard shares. Strategically, the company ''is doing all the right things,'' but they are ''still working against a weak computer environment,'' right now, Mr. Crabs said. ''Our approach on the stock is you buy it on weakness,'' he said, adding that it was not a buy at today's price. ''I would rather get the first fiscal quarter behind us.'' **********Peter D. Schleider, an analyst with Wessels, Arnold & Henderson in Minneapolis, is also taking a wait-and-see approach. He said he had hoped to see the CMOS devices in a desktop machine rather than only at the mainframe level but was impressed by the company's aggressive pricing of the new computers. **********The company still ''has a lot of wrestling to do within its customer base,'' he said, as it moves from computers based on its own proprietary software operating system to machines that run Unix, an industry standard system developed by A.T.& T.

Hudner turned his attention to shipping, an industry that had suffered several protracted downturns but that he believed was due for a recovery. In an attempt to persuade skeptical investors, he constructed a new investment vehicle, whose management would not be allowed to invest in new ships or other ventures once it had spent the original amount raised in a public offering. **********The goal of this enterprise, now commonly known as a self-liquidating company, was not to grow and become a shipping company over the long term. Instead, it would buy ships, run them for a time and distribute the profits. It would sell off the ships at opportune times or when their useful years began to wane. **********''They were born to die,'' said James J. Dowling, a shipping analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney, one of the largest financial and investment companies catering to the shipping industry. **********Mr. Hudner's idea was to reduce the chance that managers would spend the company's profits on more ships or some other venture without the approval of stockholders. **********''To make this industry attractive you had to eliminate some risks that burned investors in the past,'' said James L. Winchester of Mabon, Nugent & Company, which managed some of the offerings. **********Investors had been through the latest downturn from 1982 to 1986, when many shipping companies had again overexpanded. Tankers were scrapped and large shipping companies suffered huge losses. Some went bankrupt. **********Since 1987, Mr. Hudner and Arvid Bergvall, who has spent most of his career managing vessels and investments in shipping, have put together three companies whose management is limited in what they can do. **********The three, formed with public offerings, were B&H Bulk Carriers, B&H Maritime Carriers and B&H Ocean Carriers. **********Other investors followed the trend, forming companies with similar structures, like MC Shipping, Global Ocean Carriers and Nortankers. **********As shipping has recovered in the last two or three years, most of these companies have done well. The ships they bought early in the recovery have increased in value. As shipping rates have risen they have made money and paid dividends at a rate of 13 to 15 percent a year. **********Still, the performance of their stocks has been mixed, with shares of some companies trading below the price at which they were issued. One important reason is that companies that have paid out dividends at the promised rates and have paid off the original investment of stockholders began to pay a substantial amount of the proceeds - from about 25 to 50 percent - to management. **********Thus when a company nears the point of having to pay management a good part of the returns, the stocks have generally dropped, because the amount left over for the stockholders drops. B&H Bulk Carriers, for example, was formed in June 1987. It raised $20 million that September through an offering priced at $10 a share. With the money it raised, the company bought nine ships. **********Early last year, the management decided to sell two of the ships, which had gone up in value, and paid a dividend of $7.60 a share. **********After the big payout, the stock price dropped to $9 a share, and it has recently traded at $5. **********He believes that such self-liquidating companies should trade at a discount to the value their ships would bring if they were sold. **********Mr. Winchester said some of the companies are undervalued, since the liquidation value was about $13 a share. Combined with the fact that management would get half the proceeds, this would make the price about $6.50 a share. **********Such companies have aroused the ire of several of the older, better-established shipping concerns. In their view, the self-liquidating companies are taking advantage of a short-term recovery of the industry but are not taking the risk of building for the future. **********But others in the industry see entrepreneurs like Mr. Hudner as a welcome addition. In the past, ship owners raised some of their financing with government help and built their ships with state subsidies. They often ended up overexpanding, which helped bring on the industry's deep slumps. **********Basil Papachristidis, the head of a major shipping company, recently estimated that in the last two and a half years about $650 million had been raised by such firms through private and public offerings. **********S. E. N. Pollock, chairman and chief executive of BT Shipping Ltd., a conventional shipping company, said the protections were needed to reassure investors at the time these companies were formed. ''The self-destruct mechanism was the way people saw things in those years,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/13/business/foreign-investors-held-2-trillion-in-us-in-89.html": {"writer_name": "Martin Tolchin", "pub_date": "1990-06-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 594, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Foreign Investors Held $2 Trillion in U.S. in '89", "print_headline": "Foreign Investors Held $2 Trillion in U.S. in '89", "body_text": " **********Foreign investment in the United States rose to a record total of $2 trillion in 1989, up 12 percent from $1.786 trillion in 1988, according to preliminary statistics released today by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. **********About a third of the $214.6 billion increase, or $72 billion, was in direct investments.

They say the ability of the United States to attract foreign investment reflects its strength in the global economy and improves Americans' understanding of foreign cultures. **********Critics contend that the United States has become overly dependent on foreign capital, which could lead to an erosion of political and economic independence as decisions affecting Americans are increasingly made abroad.

He said he intends to work directly with consumer-product and service companies to find creative solutions to their advertising and marketing problems. **********''There are 850 marketing consultants out there,'' said Mr. MacDougall, who admitted he fabricated the number for effect. ''But nary a one that can sit eyeball-to-eyeball with a marketing director and solve his No. 1 problem, which is creative execution.'' **********In a lesser man, such braggadocio would be ignored or scorned. But Mr. MacDougall is one of advertising's better liked and more successful creative executives, a slightly rumpled Ivy Leaguer with an open face and disarming grin whose sloganeering for a variety of American companies has earned him widespread repute. **********Mr. MacDougall, who is known to all as Mal, inspired the Diet Coke anthem ''Just for the taste of it.''

Webster, the Director of Central Intelligence, said in a little-noticed section of a speech last week that ''Iraq has a sizable stockpile of chemical and biological weapons.'' **********Anthrax Among Weapons **********That was the first time any Administration official had publicly asserted that Iraq had succeeded in developing biological weapons. **********Mr. Aspin told reporters today that American intelligence reports say that by early next year, Iraq will have the capacity to deliver a significant amount of biological weapons, including anthrax. An aide to Mr. Aspin told reporters that the Iraqis would have the capability to deliver the biological agents by bombs, short-range rockets and possibly by Scud surface-to-surface missiles. **********Biological weapons, unlike chemical weapons, are based on living agents like viruses and bacteria.

The official declined to be specific, saying that discussions on the matter were classified. **********A Pentagon spokesman declined to say what if any steps the American military was taking in response to the latest intelligence reports, saying the question had been referred to the United States Central Command in Saudi Arabia. **********Chemical Weapons Noted **********Mr. Webster spoke sparingly last week about Iraq's means of delivering biological weapons, citing the need to protect classified information. **********When a questioner asked if Mr. Webster was suggesting the Iraqis had armed surface-to-surface missiles with biological weapons, the Director said, ''The development of these indigenous capabilties does not mean that in every case and for every type of B.W. [biological weapon]  capability they currently have the corresponding delivery systems with which to be effective.'' **********''The answer is not so important at the present time because of the size of their chemical-warfare capability, with which they can do substantially everything they can do with B.W. capability,'' Mr. Webster said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/25/world/death-in-arab-uprising.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-07-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 145, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Death in Arab Uprising", "print_headline": "Death in Arab Uprising", "body_text": " **********An 18-year-old Palestinian died today from wounds suffered in an earlier clash with Israeli soldiers, Arab reports said.

Laotian peasant farmers once again till lands that are their own, and commerce in this virtually unindustrialized country has largely returned to private hands. **********During a two-week stay in a country that has severely limited press access since the Communist takeover, the bustling commercial life of this capital and the major provincial towns of Savannakhet and Luang Prabang stood in sharp contrast to the political monotony. Where a decade ago the markets were almost as bare of variety as the political scene, they now look virtually as they did under the old Government. **********Bicycles, which then had the streets virtually to themselves, are contending today with motorcycles.

''We could not afford to work subjectively and in a rush to attain socialist goals, but must strive to surmount the difficulties caused by this backwardness for several more decades,'' the Prime Minister wrote in reply to questions submitted before the interview. Political Freedom Is Not in the Cards Sisana Sisane, himself a longtime party leader, who holds Cabinet rank as chairman of the Committee for Social Sciences, said socialism might take a century to achieve. ''We don't have the basis for building a socialist economy,'' he said. **********Mr. Kaysone rejected any borrowing from present developments in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, particularly tendencies to political pluralism or challenges to the sole party's ''leading role.'' **********''The Laotian people have faith in and agree with the People's Revolutionary Party's leadership, since the party belongs to the people, originates from the people and serves the people,'' the General Secretary said. ''Our Laotian party does not yet see any need for establishing other political parties.'' **********Acting President Phoumi Vongvichit explicitly condemned political freedom in an interview. ''If everyone speaks in his own way, I consider that anarchy rather than democracy,'' he said. ''We compare this to a cart drawn by several buffaloes - one pulls to the right, one to the left, another remains standing. Can that cart advance?'' **********A senior Communist diplomat said: ''I prefer not to talk about politics, because anything I'd say would have to be critical. There is no true democracy in this country.'' **********Laotian and foreign residents reported that after a gradual beginning in the mid-1980's, commercial prosperity appeared to take a sharp upward turn only last year. Since 1988, business freedom appears to have known no limits, and a new foreign investment code was adopted to make Laos attractive to investors. **********Almost no figures are available to document what an observer sees. ''There is no hard information whatsoever,'' a Western Ambassador complained. **********A senior international official said: ''No one knows anything. There's not a single statistic that can be checked.'' Control of Economy Is Decentralized A main reason is that in an exception to the practice in other Communist countries, the central leadership has allowed considerable authority over economic life to devolve to the provinces. They are free to conclude trading agreements not only with private companies but also with neighboring countries. Laotians with links to the power structure said Mr. Kaysone allowed this decentralization to take the sting out of power rivalries that might otherwise have weakened his rule. **********As in the pre-Communist past, free trade in Laos amounts to an invitation to Thai business to extend its markets and economic influence. The other neighbors - China, Vietnam, Cambodia and Burma - are too hampered by poverty and state-controlled economies to take advantage of the opportunity. Moreover, Thailand has always been the main route of international access to this landlocked country. **********Thai consumer goods dominate retail trade, from foods, toiletries, medicines and cheap textile goods to television and video sets, motorcycles and cars. What mystifies foreign observers is how Laotian importers and consumers pay for these goods. Exports of hydroelectric power and timber, overflight rights and remittances from refugees abroad are this country's main sources of foreign earnings. A factory producing toothpicks is believed to be the only source of manufactured export goods. **********Laotians and foreign residents suspect that considerable quantities of timber are exported illegally. Even less verifiable is a widespread suspicion that the smuggling of opium and heroin, of which Laotian mountain tribesmen are major producers, also finances consumer imports. **********Communist leaders concede that official corruption and profiteering are on the rise. ''At the beginning, party workers served the interests of the people well,'' Mr. Sisana said. ''Then errors were made. There are now many illnesses among Communists - omissions and corruption.'' **********''Graft is growing and beginning to show,'' a United Nations official said. ''People are showing wealth.'' In a country where Government ministers earn less than $50 a month and lower-level civil servants between $10 and $20, moonlighting jobs and the small shops or market stands that supplement family incomes are not sufficient to explain a recent spurt of home-building and imports of new cars. The Mass Culture Comes From Thailand The flood of Thai goods, and even more the far-reaching penetration of Laos by Thai television and the pop culture that it transmits, have gone a long way to undo the puritanical Communist ways that Laos sought to install when the revolution was young. Tight jeans, which 15 years ago were cause enough to deport young people to harsh labor camps, raise no eyebrows. The state has allowed restaurants that it owns to be turned into discos. **********The prevalence of Thai pop music, posters of Thai pop stars and similar signs of an energetic mass culture spreading across its borders have aroused unhappiness among educated Laotians. A Foreign Ministry official angrily insisted in a hotel bar that the waitress replace a tape of Thai music with Laotian songs. **********Mr. Kaysone said in the interview that the danger of Thai economic dominance ''creates many difficulties for us.'' He did not elaborate on the theme. **********Speaking of the attitude of Laotians in general, a long-serving Western Ambassador said, ''They would rather be robbed blind by the Thais than be a colony of Vietnam.'' **********While Mr. Kaysone and other leaders interviewed affirmed that Vietnam, which played a dominant role in achieving the Communist victory here, continues to hold a special relationship, Vietnam's own economic and political difficulties have clearly diminished its former role of tutellary power. The 50,000 Vietnamese troops stationed here since 1975 were withdrawn by 1987, the Government asserts. **********Vietnam's role as this frail country's ''senior partner,'' succeeding the United States, which followed France, seems to have been assumed by a flourishing international and bilateral aid community. The number of United Nations agencies, national assistance projects - particularly Swedish, Japanese and Australian - and private relief groups like the American Quakers and Mennonites surpass, in the view of some of their representatives, this Government's absorptive capacities. **********''Laos is 'in,' '' said a visiting official of an international lending institution. Diplomats and international officials fear that such pressure will keep Laos from standing on its own feet. ''In the early 1980's there was a greater feeling of a striving for self-reliance,'' a senior aid representative said. **********A Communist Ambassador estimated that Laos received about $130 million yearly in foreign aid, of which $50 million comes from the Soviet Union. Most goes into infrastructure projects in a country that lacks above all roads, transport and communications. Consequently, little immediate effect is felt by the large rural population, the vast majority in a country of less than four million people. **********Basic Services Seen as Neglected Laotians and international officials said basic human services, especially public health and education, were grossly neglected. Many exist on paper only. A United Nations official who travels widely said most of the village schools he sees in the mountain regions are unused, deteriorating buildings. Low pay, often many months in arrears, obliges teachers to find other ways of earning a living. **********In the painfully underequipped province hospital of Savannakhet, the country's second-largest town, the chief physician, Dr. Siheng Sayasene, said firmly that patients were dying for lack of equipment and medicine. Furthermore, the limited number of medical personnel in the country, as well as transport difficulties, are thought to keep the majority of those requiring treatment from receiving it. **********At a large party on Saturday night, at which President Phoumi was the guest of honor to celebrate the birthday of a wealthy businessman from the pre-Communist regime, a former Government official commented sadly that the gathering seemed to sum up Laos today. **********Once again, the official said, the political and business elites live privileged lives, irrespective of what separated them in the past, and the bulk of the Laotian people stand outside looking in."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/18/business/business-scene-reviving-a-role-for-apprentices.html": {"writer_name": "Louis Uchitelle", "pub_date": "1990-06-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 781, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business Scene;   Reviving a Role For Apprentices", "print_headline": "Business Scene;   Reviving a Role For Apprentices", "body_text": " **********ACROSS Europe, apprenticeship programs train millions of young people for skilled jobs. In the United States, where millions of young people leave high school without much hope of entering skilled, well-paid trades, apprenticeship programs barely exist. **********Logically, this ancient form of job training seems due for an American revival, given the rising demand for skilled workers to master the complex computerized machinery and the new technologies that are constantly changing work practices. An effort is afoot to give apprenticeship in America a shot in the arm. For teen-agers who do not go on to college, becoming an apprentice would be a middle ground between high school and full-fledged work. **********The Commission on the Skills of the American Work Force, a panel of business and union leaders, is issuing a set of proposals today that asks Congress to create a nationwide government-regulated apprenticeship program, financed partly through a payroll tax. Separately, the Labor Department has created the Office of Work-Based Learning to support pilot apprenticeship projects. And the Secretary of Labor, Elizabeth H. Dole, is recruiting 25 industry, government and labor leaders for an advisory group that will suggest ways to expand apprenticeship training. **********''We are actively promoting school-to-work programs, but we are not calling them apprenticeship,'' said James D. Van Erden, administrator of the Office of Work-Based Learning. ''The word carries connotations of the union movement and we don't need this negative baggage.'' **********Apprenticeship means learning a trade, over three or four years, through a combination of classroom study and on-the-job training. Most of the nation's electricians, carpenters, plumbers and ironworkers acquire their skills this way, but outside the construction industry, apprenticeship programs exist only sparsely, for some auto and aircraft workers, machinists, mechanics and a few others. **********The Fitzgerald Act, passed by Congress in 1937 to correct abuses inflicted on apprentices, empowered the Labor Department to register the programs and to set standards, like a minimum of 144 hours a year of classroom training. Nevertheless, only 300,000 people are in registered apprenticeship programs, roughly unchanged since 1950. Most programs are the fruit of union agreements, although the military trains 50,000 of the apprentices as an inducement to re-enlist. **********From colonial times until well into the Industrial Revolution, being an apprentice was standard job training. With the advent of the assembly line, millions of jobs were limited to two or three simple, quickly learned tasks. As a result, apprenticeship training retreated to crafts like carpentry and electrical work, which still required complex skills. But now, with the rise of a flexible workplace -one that requires ingenuity and complex skills to carry out a variety of tasks - apprenticeship training is coming back into vogue. **********Reacting more quickly to the change, West Germany, Sweden, France and other European countries are well ahead of the United States in government-sponsored apprenticeship training, often financed through special taxes. ''You can sustain profits in two ways in the international arena,'' said F. Ray Marshall, a Labor Secretary during the Carter Administration. American companies opted for cost-cutting through layoffs and limits on wage increases, he said, while other industrial nations sustained wages, but trained workers so they could produce more. **********Lately, however, some big American companies, like Motorola, Ford, General Electric and American Express, are spending tens of millions of dollars on job training that resembles apprenticeships. They are, in effect, beginning to adopt the European approach. But from a corporate executive's viewpoint, incorporating this individual company training into a national apprenticeship program has two big drawbacks as well as one big advantage. **********The advantage is that the companies could pay a training wage with Government sanction. Ironworker apprentices, for example, currently start at between 35 percent and 50 percent of a journeyman's wage, moving up each year toward full pay. One drawbacks is that companies would have to comply with Federal regulations, particularly rules that insist upon minority hiring for the programs. And they would have to issue nationally recognized certificates to newly graduated apprentices, who could then depart with their licenses for new jobs, just as journeymen carpenters move among employers, offering their licenses as proof of their skills. **********Whatever the pros and cons, other leading industrial nations are moving to train their workers and increase their productivity. ''We do this for college-educated people,'' Mr. Marshall said. ''But we do virtually nothing for people who don't go to college.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/18/business/your-own-account-the-discounters-advantage.html": {"writer_name": "Mary Rowland", "pub_date": "1990-11-18", "snippet": "A BEAR MARKET and a recession shouldn't drive you to drop your investment program.

But they could encourage restructering a portfolio, and certainly encourage an attitude of thrift. With that in mind, a discount broker may be the answer. **********These brokers will trade stocks, bonds, mutual funds, precious metals or options for commissions that can be as much as 90 percent below what you would pay a full-service broker, said Mark D. Coler, whose book \"Investing at a Discount\" was published last month. **********Discount brokers offer no investment advice. But unless you require considerable hand-holding before you make a trade, that shouldn't be an obstacle. \"For most investors who know what they're doing and are seeking execution at the lowest price, discount brokers make sense,\" said John Markese, research director at the American Association of Individual Investors in Chicago. **********Discounters offer a couple of other advantages over full-service brokers. One is that you can buy a variety of securities, including mutual funds, from several different companies and yet receive a single, consolidated statement listing all of these investments. Many financial planners recommend discounters to their clients precisely for that reason, even if the client's entire portfolio consists of mutual funds. **********You can, of course, buy no-load mutual funds -- those without a sales commission -- direct from the company. But if you buy them from several different companies, you will receive a stack of statements, making it difficult to monitor your portfolio. **********\"Financial confusion is at the root of many peoples' investment problems,\" said H. Lynn Hopewell, a financial planner in Falls Church, Va. \"People make big-buck mistakes from confusion.\" **********For example, Jonathan D. Pond, a Boston financial planner, says he recently acquired a new client who was \"a superb investor.\" But she \"must have had 25 mutual fund accounts.\" The only way to roll them into one and get a consolidated statement was to use a discount broker, he said. **********Another advantage is that discount brokers do not have the potential for conflict of interest that full-service brokers do. A full-service brokerage house serves many different clients -- from corporations that issue securities to retail customers.  So it may commit to buy a big block of securities from a major client, planning to funnel some of it to you, whether it's right for your particular portfolio or not.  Brokers may also have a larger stake in selling you mutual funds or other products managed by their employer, on which commissions are greater. **********If you decide to use discounters, how do you evaluate them? Consider commission, of course. If you want just the lowest commission, look for what Mr. Coler calls the \"deep discounters.\" When he prepared an index comparing 20 trades of about $9,000 per trade, he found that the typical full-service broker charged around $206 per trade. The largest discount brokers charged around $92 for the same trade, while the \"deep discounters\" charged $53. On higher-volume trades, the discount could be as much as 90 percent. **********Mr. Markese suggests that you \"come up with what is likely to be your normal trade.\" Then get price quotes from several discounters. One percent or less of the price of the securities \"is truly discount,\" he said. \"If you're paying 2 percent, you're paying full-service rates.\" **********There are both national discounters and regional discounters. If you use a regional broker, you should get a referral from friends or colleagues who are active investors and use discounters, according to Meloni Hallock, a senior manager in personal financial services for Price Waterhouse in St. Louis. \"I wouldn't just look them up in the phone book,\" she said. **********Think about how you plan to use your broker. Some discounters offer additional services, for a fee, of course. For example, Charles Schwab & Company, the largest discount broker, offers research on companies at $7.50 per company, according to Mark Goines, vice president of marketing. You get a report compiled by Standard & Poor's, current news headlines from Dow Jones and a consensus of analysts' outlooks. **********If you plan to use a discount broker for your mutual fund portfolio, you'll want to know which mutual funds are available. Jack White & Company, one of the oldest discount brokers, offers 1,300 mutual funds, which Mr. White, the company's president, claims is the largest list available. The firm, which is located in San Diego, also offers competitive trading prices, financial planners say. **********If you trade stocks, you need a broker good at executing trading orders. This is important if you want to trade at a particular price. For example, you might want a minimum of $31 a share. If the stock trades in a range of $30 to $32 that day, the broker may not sell at $31 if he or she doesn't act quickly. **********\"If you save something on the trade, but they don't trade quickly and the stock is moving around, you might lose it on the price,\" Ms. Hallock said. This can happen occasionally with any broker, she said, but if it happens to you frequently, you should take your business elsewhere.  When to Go Full Service **********DISCOUNT brokers offer advantages for many investors but they are not for everyone. Here are some things you're more likely to get from a full-service broker: *********** New investment ideas. \"There are a lot of people who need a nudge to think about their portfolio,\" said Meloni Hallock of Price Waterhouse. *********** Seminars and research reports. *********** Negotiated commissions. \"If you like to bargain and negotiate, you won't get it from a discount broker,\" Ms. Hallock said. Even a beginning investor can negotiate some sort of deal from a full-service broker if he or she asks, although it would not be as good as one available from discounters. \"It's very common to get a discount of 20 percent from a regular brokerage firm,\" she said. \"That won't happen with discounters because their margin is too thin.\" *********** Personal attention. **********Some investors use both a discounter, for simple stock trades, and a full-service broker, for more complicated trades, like buying options. If you do use both, however, don't take your broker's ideas and execute them through a discounter; a broker who discovers you doing this will cut you off."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/31/business/sponsors-pleased-with-super-bowl.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-01-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 300, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sponsors Pleased With Super Bowl", "print_headline": "Sponsors Pleased With Super Bowl", "body_text": " **********Even though Super Bowl XXIV was the lowest-rated football championship in two decades, advertisers may still have scored well. **********''This is the best way to reach the biggest television audience,'' said Bill Katz, senior vice president at BBDO/New York, which created four minutes of advertising for Pepsi during the Super Bowl.

But all the terms of the joint venture, which will focus on futures and options contracts in interest rates and currencies, were not disclosed. **********Changes for Both **********The deal will enhance Mitsubishi Trust's ability to compete globally with other banks that already offer futures and options, and at the same time will make Chicago Research a different sort of firm. Until now a proprietary firm - that is, one that traded principally for its own account - Chicago Research, after the joint venture, will be working with outsiders, chiefly corporations and other institutional investors. **********Malcolm Hanney, a Chicago Research executive vice president, added that the deal ''will provide Chicago Research serious access to the Japanese market and corporate business in Japan.'' **********The joint venture appeared to be unusual in a number of ways. **********Although Japanese financial institutions have entered into business arrangements with United States financial institutions in the past - Sumitomo Life, for instance, owns part of Goldman, Sachs; Nippon Life owns part of Shearson Lehman Hutton, and Yasuda Life owns part of Paine Webber - the Japanese have been passive investors in those deals. Similarly, in a highly publicized joint venture operating in Japan, Wells Fargo is a passive investor in a money management joint venture with the Nikko Securities Corporation. **********Active Japanese Involvement **********In the Chicago Research-Mitsubishi Trust joint venture, by comparison, both partners will have exactly 50 percent ownership. Moreover, the Japanese are expected to send representatives to Chicago to be actively involved in policy making. **********Additionally, this appeared to mark the first time that the Japanese were formally joining forces with an American firm that dealt strictly in futures and options in this country. Another major futures and options trading firm based here, O'Connor & Associates, a direct competitor of Chicago Research, has a link with the Swiss Bank Corporation. **********For its part, Mitsubishi Trust has been eager to learn more about and participate in the options and futures fields. Many of its corporate clients do business globally and would like to use futures and options for protection against swings in interest and currency rates. But Mitsubishi Trust does not own a seat on either the Chicago Board of Trade or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the two principal futures exchanges here. Mitsubishi Bank, which does own a seat on the Mercantile Exchange, is a separate organization. **********'Seeking Out Expertise' **********''They are seeking out expertise, and this will significantly enhance their ability in these areas,'' said Mr. Hanney, the Chicago Research executive vice president, referring to Mitsubishi Trust. **********The joint venture will solidify what has been an informal but increasingly close-knit relationship between Mitsubishi Trust and Chicago Research. The two first started talking about doing business together in April 1987, when Mitsubishi provided Chicago Research with $37 million in capital by purchasing subordinated bonds. Those bonds were rolled over last year, when Mitsubishi increased its money outstanding to Chicago Research to $45 million. **********A Mitsubishi Trust official in New York, Makoto Oikawa, referred requests for comment to Mitsubishi Trust's headquarters in Tokyo.

Hyatt, an inventor in Southern California, was granted a patent for a design for building a computer on a single chip. Mr. Hyatt filed for the patent in 1970 based on work he started in 1968. **********Attorneys and computer companies were studying the patent today to determine its significance, which could turn out to be far less than Mr. Hyatt hopes. But lawyers said Mr. Hyatt could collect millions of dollars of royalties over the next 17 years from manufacturers of the chips. **********The development could also entail rewriting the history books of the electronics industry. Credit for inventing the microprocessor has generally been given to Ted Hoff, who developed the first such chip at the Intel Corporation in 1971. Texas Instruments Corporation, however, also has a fundamental microprocessor patent issued in the early 1970's. **********The ability to cram the basic functions of a computer onto a single chip gave rise to personal computers and allowed programmable features to be added to electronic devices ranging from microwave ovens and videocassette recorders. A chip is typically a piece of silcon that contains microscopic electronic circuits that are the building blocks of computers and other electronic devices. **********''It looks to me that it's broad,'' said Gary Hecker, a Los Angeles patent attorney who has seen Mr. Hyatt's patent. ''It could be sufficiently broad to cover basic microprocessor design.'' But he added that there appears to be plenty of areas where the patent could be challenged. **********Michael Slater, editor of Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter, said he did not think the patent covered microprocessors but other chips known as microcontrollers. **********Mr. Hyatt's patent, Mr. Slater said, is for a chip containing both the processor and memory needed for a computer. Microcontrollers have both these features and are used in a variety of electronic appliances. Microprocessors generally only contain the processor, not the memory. **********Big Markets Involved **********Microcontrollers represent a larger market than microprocessors. Worldwide sales this year of microcontrollers will be about $3.4 billion and sales of microprocessors about $2.1 billion, according to Dataquest, a market research firm. **********Intel and Motorola Inc. are the leading microprocessor manufacturers. Motorola is the leading maker of microcontollers. But numerous other semiconductor companies make one or both types of the chips. It is also possible that Mr. Hyatt's patent would entitle him to collect royalties from users of such chips, like personal computer manufacturers. **********Spokeswomen for Intel and Motorola said their attorneys were reviewing the patent and that they did not yet have any comment. The patent was issued in July, but not publicized until this week. **********Mr. Hyatt, who is 52 years old, said he began work on the computer chip in 1968 when he started a company called Micro Computer Inc. He said the company closed in 1971 because of a dispute with its venture capital investors before he could make such a chip. Since then, he said, he has been supporting his work as an inventor by consulting for aerospace companies. **********''I always had confidence that we would set history straight,'' he said. **********Mr. Hyatt, who lives in La Palma, outside Los Angeles, said he hoped to license the patent at reasonable rates to provide financing for his research. He said he was negotiating a joint venture with a ''major manufacturer'' that would license his patents and would then try to license them to others. ''Nobody is interested in litigation,'' he said. **********Analysts said if Mr. Hyatt set his rates low enough, he might get what for him would be significant revenue without hurting chip companies. But if he asks for large amounts, he will no doubt be challenged. **********Susan Nycum, a computer attorney in Palo Alto, Calif., said the new patent appears to predate Texas Instruments' patent. That could weaken the hand of the Dallas company, which is now seeking royalty payments from many personal computer companies, based in part on its microprocessor patent. **********In relation to this effort, Texas Instruments has sued Zenith Data Systems and two Korean personal computer manufacturers, Samsung and Daewoo, for patent infringement. A Texas Instruments spokesman said the company didn't think the Hyatt patent would affect its litigation. **********Long Wait for Patents **********Attorneys said it was unusual but not unprecedented for a patent to take so long to issue. Gordon Gould was issued a patent in 1977 for a laser he invented as a graduate student in the late 1950's, and has since been pursuing royalty collection. And the Japanese patent office in November finally issued Texas Instruments a patent for the integrated circuit it had been seeking since 1960. **********Other inventors have also waged long struggles.

Kearns won a $5.2 million jury verdict against the Ford Motor Company, related to Mr. Kearns's development of intermittent windshield wipers about 20 years ago."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/08/business/iacocca-says-he-will-stay-at-chrysler-s-helm-past-91.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Judge", "pub_date": "1990-06-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 710, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iacocca Says He Will Stay At Chrysler's Helm Past '91", "print_headline": "Iacocca Says He Will Stay At Chrysler's Helm Past '91", "body_text": " **********Seeking to allay concerns among investors, dealers and employees that a leadership vacuum could develop at the Chrysler Corporation, Lee A. Iacocca said today that he would stay on as chairman beyond December 1991. **********The 65-year-old executive had previously said he would make a decision on his retirement by the end of 1991, when his current contract expires. **********Mr. Iacocca's decision to stay came at Chrysler's regular monthly board meeting today in New York. No retirement date was set, and a spokesman for the company said board members had not yet negotiated a new contract with Mr. Iacocca. **********Automotive analysts expressed dismay last week when Chrysler's vice chairman, Gerald Greenwald, resigned. Mr. Greenwald signed a five-year contract to become chairman and chief executive of UAL Inc., which owns United Airlines, if financing can be lined up for the proposed employee buyout of UAL. **********Two other top Chrysler executives, the corporate treasurer and an executive vice president, announced plans in recent weeks to leave. While Chrysler appeared to handle those departures in stride, Mr. Greenwald's decision seemed to rattle Wall Street, and some analysts expressed concern that the company's management lacked depth and experience. **********''Clearly there is a crisis of confidence among the white-collar rank and file, dealers and, to some extent, investors,'' said Joseph S. Phillippi, an automotive analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton. **********Robert M. Barboza, who owns a Chrysler-Plymouth dealership in Raynham, Mass., said: ''It's good that he isn't leaving with auto business tough as it is, because he is a seasoned auto pro. There are people who can do Mr. Greenwald's job, but Mr. Iacocca is very essential for us to keep selling cars.'' **********''With Iacocca at the helm, we feel kind of stable,'' said Aaron Taylor, president of Local 7 of the United Automobile Workers union, which represents 3,500 unemployed hourly workers whose hope for the future depends on an unfinished Chrysler plant in Detroit. **********In a statement issued by the company, Mr. Iacocca, who earned $1.4 million in salary and bonus last year, said one of his primary responsibilities would be to arrive at an orderly succession plan. ''We're going to do that according to our own timetable, and it won't be driven by a big X on a calendar,'' he said. **********Chrysler wasted little time dividing Mr. Greenwald's management duties among other ranking executives. But today's announcement is likely to go further in calming the jitters of nervous investment analysts, many of whom said last week that they had hoped for a signal from Mr. Iacocca that he would stay past 1991. **********More Competition Expected **********''I think this is an indication that Iacocca will be more of a hands-on manager than he has been in the last few years,'' said David Healy, an auto industry analyst for Barclays Bank in New York. ''He has said the 90's are going to be so highly competitive. I think he still wants to be there to run the show.'' **********In the current competition for American car and truck buyers, Chrysler has been bloodied more than its rivals. Chrysler's market share for the first five months of the year stands at 8.9 percent, nearly two full points below the 10.7 percent market share it posted through May of last year. **********The company's decision to drop its subcompact Omni and Horizon models and reduce sales to rental fleets accounts for a portion of the decline in market share. But Chrysler has also been losing ground in the remainder of its car models. Even more worrisome to Chrysler is the new competition to its mini-vans and Jeeps, which have been vital sources of profits. **********Chrysler stock has seesawed in the week since Mr. Greenwald made his departure official, trading between $15.375 and $16.625 before losing some of its price at the end of the week.

Some of the protesters here reportedly carried placards with Mr. Houphouet-Boigny's photo and distributed leaflets accusing him and members of his Government of corruption. **********Several hundred youths also marched through the central Boulevard de la Republique, chanting ''Liberty!'' and ''Free our comrades!'' and demanding the President's resignation. In particular, some of the protesters said they wanted a multiparty democracy. **********On Friday afternoon, about 200 students reportedly held a peaceful sit-in at St. Paul's Cathedral. The police responded early this morning with tear gas and rubber truncheons. **********The wave of criticism directed at Mr. Houphouet-Boigny is an extraordinary blow to a man who since 1960 has personally engineered the Ivory Coast's ''economic miracle.'' **********The President is relatively robust at what he says is the age of 84. But many people insist that he is closer to 90 years old. The nation shares borders with five countries, every one of them ruled by a military or authoritarian Government; a sudden void of leadership here could prove convulsive. **********Worse May Lie Ahead **********For now, whether the protests will continue and perhaps even spread seem inextricably linked to Mr. Houphouet-Boigny's economic program. And in the short term, Western diplomats and Ivory Coast analysts say they believe that further strains from the austerity measures seem certain. **********Less than a decade ago, the picture was much different. When prices of the country's main exports, coffee and cocoa, soared to record highs, the Ivory Coast used its surplus earnings to build the largest road network, the most reliable telephone system and the most skilled and educated work force in West Africa. **********But after four years of slumping commodity prices, this nation of 11 million has been plunged into its worst recession in more than 30 years. **********Discontent with the Government's economic program has been exacerbated by anomalies of prosperity and want. Some of the protesters complained about Mr. Houphouet-Boigny's decision to build a multimillion-dollar Roman Catholic basilica in his hometown, Yamoussoukro. **********The President has declined to say how much the basilica cost, insisting that he paid for it with family money. Some reports, however, have estimated that it cost as much as $200 million, and protesters said the money could have been better spent on health care and housing. **********Criticism Through Channels **********There have been other grounds lately on which Government policy has been questioned. In recent weeks, Mr. Houphouet-Boigny has refused to even consider the increasing calls for a multiparty democracy, insisting that this would endanger national unity. **********At the same time, he has said that Government critics are free to voice their opinions within the existing political structure. **********But for now, the state-controlled newspapers and radio stations have completely blacked out news of the protests, which began Monday. Student protesters say this amounts to censorship, and is an apt illustration of why they are trying to open up the political process."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/05/business/real-estate-sales-lure-investors.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1990-01-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1192, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Real Estate Sales Lure Investors", "print_headline": "Real Estate Sales Lure Investors", "body_text": " **********Attracted by the hope of bargains, real estate investors and prospective home buyers are jamming the phone lines of the Government agency that this week began selling billions of dollars' worth of properties owned by failed savings institutions. **********But it is questionable whether the program, which promises to be the largest real estate sale in the nation's history, will result in as many bargains as buyers might hope, real estate experts and Government officials said yesterday. The program will bring thousands of houses, condominium apartments, office buildings, shopping centers and other properties onto the national market, perhaps further depressing prices in already glutted markets like the Southwest. **********But Government officials say they are determined to make sales in an orderly manner. And they note that they must sell each property for at least 95 percent of its appraised value, as the bailout bill requires. **********Where Opportunities Are **********''There are going to be opportunities, but they aren't going to be in buying at a deep discount,'' said Stan Ross, the co-managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal & Company, a real estate consulting firm in Los Angeles. ''The opportunities are going to be in the ability of buyers to sort through and identify properties that they can work on and create more value.'' **********Real estate executives said, however, that many properties would prove unattractive to potential buyers, particularly apartment complexes and small office buildings, and that the Government may be unrealistic in believing that it can command full price for them. **********'Aren't All Cats and Dogs' **********''The properties aren't all cats and dogs,'' said David W. Gleeson, the president of the Lincoln Asset Management Company, one of the largest real estate concerns in Dallas. ''But it is going to be difficult to find investors. It will be a rude awakening for the Government to find that they have to lower prices.'' **********Under the program, the Resolution Trust Corporation is offering for sale residential and commercial buildings and undeveloped land owned by hundreds of insolvent savings and loan associations that have been seized by the Government. The properties are available for sale to anyone interested, from individual home buyers to huge real estate companies. **********Most of the residential properties will be listed by local realtors, which will handle them just as if they were privately owned. The commercial properties will generally be sold through regional offices of the Government agency, through the savings institutions themselves or through brokers hired by the trust agency. **********On Tuesday, the trust agency published an inventory of the more than 30,000 properties it had taken control of through Sept. 30. Since then the agency has been besieged with phone calls - 8,000 on Wednesday alone, with 200 callers on hold at any one time - as people scrambled for information on what many perceived as a fire sale. **********Texas has by far the greatest number of properties for sale - 15,750. Its neighbors in the oil patch also had high totals, with 1,575 in Oklahoma and 2,434 in Louisiana. The only other states with more than 1,000 properties on the lists are Florida, with 1,288, and Arizona, with 1,711. **********In contrast, New York had only 12, New Jersey, 11; Connecticut and Delaware, 2 each, and New Hampshire, 1, while several states had none -Maine, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia. **********Desire for a Bargain **********''There's a lot of desire out there to get a bargain,'' said Stephen Katsanos, a spokesman for Resolution Trust. ''There's a feeling that if they don't get in there now, they may miss an opportunity. But people may be disappointed when we don't accept an outlandishly low offer.'' **********The residential properties on the list encompass everything from a $4 million mansion in Malibu, Calif., to a 500-square-foot house in poor condition in Louisiana. The commercial properties include office buildings, shopping centers, hotels, stables and even boat slips. **********Mr. Katsanos said the Government's inventory of properties was continuing to swell as more institutions were taken over by regulators. He said the properties on the current list were probably less than half of what the Government would ultimately possess. **********The inventory list published this week has only skeletal information about the properties offered for sale, including a brief description of size and location. Asking prices are included for some properties, although the values have yet to be set for many of them. Most listings include the name and phone number of someone to call about purchasing the property. The others include information about which savings institution had the property and how to reach that institution. **********Toll-Free Number **********To take orders for the inventory list, the trust agency has set up a toll-free telephone number: (800) 431-0600. The complete inventory of 26,813 residential properties, 2,516 commercial properties and 794 land parcels is available for a charge of $50. The volumes containing the commercial and land properties can be purchased separately for $10 each, and separate sections listing just single-family or multifamily housing are $15 each. **********In addition to selling properties through local realtors and brokers and consultants who specialize in distressed property sales, the trust agency is also considering a number of unconventional approaches, including displaying some of the properties on cable television programs and working with a company that sets up international auctions by satellite. **********Residential properties listed by local realtors will not be distinguished from other homes and condominiums. ''In a lot of cases the buyer may not even know this is a Government property they're dealing with,'' Mr. Katsanos said. Some real estate experts are skeptical of the Government's ability to manage such a huge undertaking efficiently. ''The first piece of advice I'd give to investors is that they should go into the process with a lot of patience,'' said James W. Field, a liquidation expert at Coldwell Banker, the real estate company. ''It's going to take a lot of time and you're going to have to learn to deal with the foibles of the bureaucracy.'' **********Volume Seen Causing Chaos **********Perhaps more important, some real estate professionals said that the Government will never be able to develop a firm grasp on the value of the properties it is selling, and that the sheer volume of the properties it puts up for sale will inevitably cause chaos in the marketplace and drive prices down in some areas. **********Almost by definition, the greatest concentration of properties the Government is now trying to peddle are in those regions hardest hit by economic downturns and falling real estate prices. As a result, finding buyers for a greater number of properties without pushing prices down may be impossible, some experts said. **********For those who are interested in the properties but do not want to buy the books, the lists are also being distributed to 1,400 libraries across the country."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/19/business/the-media-business-times-co-profit-dropped-in-the-2d-quarter.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1990-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 532, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Times Co.

A qi gong craze has swept China in the last few years, and more than 5 percent of China's population is now said to practice the art. Then there are thousands of qi gong masters who claim to be able to heal the sick, hold light bulbs and make them glow, turn wine into water and increase crop yields. **********As the movement has spread, with some qi gong masters gaining thousands of disciples and asserting that they can transport themselves instantaneously around the country, or that they cannot be harmed by bullets, the Government has become apprehensive. This summer the authorities instituted new restrictions on qi gong clinics, and there has been a sharp cutback on vast assemblies in which qi gong masters transmit their qi upon the multitude and cause the audience to writhe, cry, laugh or otherwise lose control. **********Qi is a vague concept that can refer to air or gas or a vague spirit or life force. Some Chinese believe that qi gong masters emit qi in the form of invisible radiation; others believe that they radiate nothing more than self-confidence. **********''It's classic end-of-dynasty stuff,'' said Geremie Barme, an Australian scholar who recently visited Beijing. ''It's superstitious, spiritual, religious, to give people an alternative to replace the structure collapsing around them.'' **********Mass Fads of the Past **********As Mr. Barme noted, China has experienced similar mass fads in the past. In the middle of the last century, for example, a Chinese with a notion of Christianity pronounced himself the brother of Jesus and led a rebellion that was crushed only after 14 years of civil war and 20 million or more deaths. **********Qi gong researchers in China estimate that the number of practitioners has soared from about 260,000 a decade ago to 60 million today. That is more than the number who practice the somewhat similar but better-known taijiquan exercises. Many Chinese begin each day with qi gong breathing exercises to relax, and such personal exercises are much less controversial than the emergence of qi gong masters with vast followings. **********However strange its variants, qi gong is not a joke: it is taken very seriously here, and some foreign experts believe that the enthusiasm for qi gong masters could pose a political challenge for the Government. The crackdown now under way may be an indication that the leadership agrees, and in July the police in Shanghai detained Zhang Xiangyu, a 47-year-old actress who was treated as a messiah by her thousands of followers. **********Miss Zhang reportedly asserted that the heavens had endowed her with what she called ''natural central qi gong'' to heal the sick, predict the future, see beneath the earth and save her disciples from natural disasters that would engulf the world. Miss Zhang earned the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of dollars by charging people to attend rallies. **********'A Modern Sorceress' **********''Natural central qi gong drips with blood, for it has driven people crazy and even sent them to their deaths,'' the official Health News declared. ''The masses know that Zhang Xiangyu is a modern sorceress who has cheated people of their money.'' **********Despite the crackdown, qi gong is still very much alive in China. Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, is said to have summoned a qi gong master to transmit qi and improve his health. The Beijing Military Region operates a qi gong clinic. **********There are various views about the effectiveness of qi gong. Some Chinese intellectuals are openly skeptical, but most Chinese seem to believe that there is something to it. **********''There is definitely something there, but we don't know what it is,'' said Lin Zhongpeng, who helped launch the ''qi gong fever'' with the establishment of a Qi Gong Study Center in 1979. Yet Mr. Lin believes that most qi gong masters are simply showmen, and he says he once pretended to transmit qi to an audience in the southern city of Guangzhou. **********''Everybody jumped around and laughed and cried,'' Mr. Lin recalled. ''And then I told them I hadn't done anything, and that they had responded simply because they believed in me. Eighty percent of those big meetings is simply psychology.'' **********A Relaxation Response **********Herbert Benson, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who has visited China for research in this area, said by telephone that he believed that qi gong could have medical effects but that these did not necessarily have anything to do with qi. He said that for many ailments and pains, the body responds well to relaxation and a reduced metabolism. **********Qi gong tends to elicit this relaxation response, Dr. Benson said, and so tends to be helpful. But he said there are many other ways to achieve this relaxation, including meditation, prayer, taijiquan and yoga. **********''Of course qi gong works,'' he said. ''But there's nothing unique about it.'' As for the masters who claim to transmit qi, Dr. Benson is skeptical. He said that benefits may be the result of a placebo effect derived from the belief that the treatment will work, and the patient may also gain by relaxing during the treatment. **********''It may be that nothing is transmitted more than faith,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/07/business/maxwell-venture-fund.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Maxwell Venture Fund", "print_headline": "Maxwell Venture Fund", "body_text": " **********The British entrepreneur Robert Maxwell said Monday that he would set up a $1 billion investment fund to finance joint ventures in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.

But the form that it will take is not clear, they said, and in the short term, as the Drexel network of lenders is dismantled, some highly leveraged companies will have to scramble to find new sources of financing. **********Over the next year, there will be new jolts and more volatility in the market for high-yield, high-risk securities, the experts said, as more companies default on their debts, major participants exit the market and the troubles on Wall Street curb the willingness of dealers to trade in these risky securities. **********''Once this current frenzy settles down, it could take six months to one year'' to restore order, said Peter Nadosy, managing director and head of the asset management division at Morgan Stanley & Company. **********All this, of course, means that the few companies that can raise money in the public markets will have to pay dearly for it, while financing for many other low-rated companies may be almost impossible to obtain, bankers say. Indeed, things may get much worse if the credit contraction spreads to other corners of the financial world. **********For now, many companies are considering the following alternatives to junk bonds: debt from the private placement market, which is dominated by insurance companies, equity from venture capital investors and a reduction of debt in exchange for equity. **********''Anybody who's got a bridge loan that's hung up is looking at a number of alternatives,'' said Raymond J. Lemanski, co-head of junk-bond trading at the Prudential-Bache Securities Corporation. **********That would include companies like West Point-Pepperell, Grand Union, Prime Computer and Ohio Mattress, which all used short-term ''bridge loans'' to finance takeovers and other restructurings and now need to refinance those loans. **********The experience at Morningstar Inc. is indicative of the problems these companies face. In recent weeks, bankers at B. T. Securities Inc. have been trying to restructure the finances of Morningstar, the dairy company that B. T. Securities and a group of investors acquired from the Southland Corporation in 1988. Last October, the turmoil in the junk market forced them to postpone a $150 million bond offering. **********Consequently, almost every available source of financing is being considered to help repay the bank debt. Indeed, bankers at B. T. Securities already have made a short-term bridge loan to Morningstar, are proposing a sale of some of the company's assets, are looking for potential equity investors and are trying to replace the bank debt with private financing from insurance companies, said Charles Quattrochi, a managing director at B. T. Securities. **********Whether they will be able to secure such financing and at what additional cost is not clear, said Mr. Quattrochi. ''It's a terrible time,'' he said about the markets. If the bankers and investors had known that they could not tap the junk market at the time they made the acquisition, he said, the original investment ''would have been done with a different capital structure.'' **********Because of the junk market's turmoil, many bankers expect that other low-rated companies like Morningstar will rush to the market of privately placed debt, where the current average interest rate is about 12 percent. While the cost of financing is lower than in the public market, these lenders have generally provided financing only to the strongest companies, or have exacted stiffer terms from the weaker issuers. **********Thus, investment bankers stress that many of the companies that are unable to raise money in the junk market should not expect to find credit in the private-placement market. Only the top tier of these low-rated companies will be able to raise money, they say. And these companies will have to be prepared to include stock or equity-like features as part of the transaction. **********''The marginal deal is shut out,'' said Ralph H. Fletcher, a managing director in the private finance group at Salomon Brothers. **********And after almost a decade of replacing stock with debt, some financiers now see equity as the way to save some of these over-leveraged companies. Forstmann, Little, one of the largest leveraged buyout firms, is in the final stages of raising money from its partners to invest in companies that it believes will fail from the crush of debt. **********For the companies that are able to raise money in the public junk market, the cost is already higher and likely to increase. Junk-bond investors are screening out the weaker companies and lending money only to the so-called quality junk issuers. If this flight to quality junk continues, it will be in stark contrast to the past two years, when easy credit was made available to finance poorly structured deals like Federated and Allied Stores. **********Over the past two years, one popular credit standard used by junk-bond investors - the ratio of a company's cash flow to its interest expense - fell below 1 in many offerings. But investors say that these so-called coverage ratios already are being raised as investors become more demanding. ''You won't see any more deals done at 1,'' predicted Barry G. Coffman, a portfolio manager of junk bonds at Fidelity Investments in Boston, one of the largest investors in junk bonds. ''Investors will be skeptical of deals below 1.5.'' **********But even the stronger companies face higher costs for borrowing in this market. Despite the fact that Sullivan Graphics, which recently sold $100 million in 10-year notes, had an interest coverage ratio of 1.8, its securities were priced to yield 15 percent. And the bondholders demanded restrictions on the company's ability to pay dividends or issue more debt in the future. **********''The rate was higher than we thought,'' said Nicholas Daifotis, a director at Merrill Lynch, the company's underwriter. **********And companies will no longer be able to issue any of the ''gimmicky'' securities, like the so-called deferred interest bonds that littered the junk-bond market in the past few years, market experts say. In recent years, corporate raiders used securities like zero coupon bonds and pay-in-kind bonds that either pay no current interest or pay the investor more securities instead of cash to finance their acquisitions. **********Investors now laugh when these securities are mentioned. ''Those things are out the window,'' said Mr. Nadosy of Morgan Stanley. ''You're going to have to pay real money when you do an acquisition.'' While the new caution is welcome, few on Wall Street say they believe that this purge marks the end of speculative lending. The history of markets and credit has demonstrated too clearly that speculative excesses are part of the human condition. **********The renewed emphasis on higher standards is only a small step on the ''trek to reality,'' and credit standards ultimately will slide again, said Michael C. Aronstein, chairman of Comstock Partners, a New York investment firm. Conceding that he sounded like a character in a ''bad Western,'' he added, ''Wherever a man walks, greed lives.'' **********COWARDLY FUND MANAGERS? **********In the glory days of the ''junk bond'' market, the network of investors, issuers and intermediaries celebrated their power and influence with back-slapping camaraderie at the annual Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ''predators ball'' in Beverly Hills. **********But, like Drexel, those days of bonhomie and good will are history. Two weeks ago, at a junk-bond conference hosted by Merrill Lynch & Company in Phoenix, many portfolio managers were shocked by what they described as the ''condescension'' and insults of Henry Kravis, founding partner of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company. **********Mr. Kravis's leveraged-buyout firm has used billions of dollars in junk securities to help finance the acquisitions of RJR Nabisco and other companies. **********In an after-dinner speech, Mr. Kravis accused the money managers of following a ''herd mentality'' by selling their bonds in recent months. He said that his firm and the bondholders were ''partners'' and that they should hang together during this period. **********Many in the audience inferred that Mr. Kravis was accusing them of being cowards who were swept along in a panic created by the news media. **********They also deeply resented being called partners of Mr. Kravis. As managers of other people's money, they are required to fight for the rights of bondholders. And in recent months that has placed them in an adversarial relationship with Mr. Kravis and other stockholders of highly leveraged companies. **********In ''exchange offers'' proposed by Mr. Kravis's companies, like SCI Television and Hillsborough Holdings, bondholders have been asked to swap securities with high-paying coupons for ones with a lower interest rate. Some bondholders are balking. **********Mr. Kravis's remarks may make his future dealings with investors more difficult, some people who attended the conference said. Mr. Kravis declined last week to comment. **********''That speech may come back to haunt him,'' said J. Michael Pokorny, a senior portfolio manager at Delaware Management, a Philadelphia investment firm that manages more than $3 billion of junk bonds."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/21/world/canada-moves-closer-to-pact-but-barriers-remain.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1990-06-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 584, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Canada Moves Closer to Pact, but Barriers Remain", "print_headline": "Canada Moves Closer to Pact, but Barriers Remain", "body_text": " **********Canada cleared one obstacle toward approval of the Meech Lake constitutional accord today when the Manitoba legislature began debate on the issue, but the prospects that the accord will be ratified before the deadline of midnight on Saturday appeared to be slim. **********In Winnipeg, the Manitoba capital, the Cree Indian legislator who had barred any legislative action on the accord for eight days ran out of ways of keeping the issue from debate. **********But with more delaying tactics expected in the legislature, and with more than 3,000 witnesses waiting to testify at public hearings that must be held before the pact can be approved under Manitoba law, the accord was increasingly being viewed across Canada as doomed. **********If either Manitoba or Newfoundland fails to ratify the accord before the Saturday deadline, the pact, and the provision it makes for special constitutional status for Quebec, will automatically lapse. **********Many Canadians are concerned that failure to adopt the pact will push the Quebec government into measures designed to placate the rising tide of popular support for independence in the province. At the least, the collapse of the pact is expected to set back, possibly for years, the effort to gain Quebec's formal commitment to remain a part of the Canadian confederation. **********For several days, Gary Filmon, the Manitoba Premier, has been saying that the blocking tactics of Mr. Harper, the Cree Indian, have made it impossible for the province to approve the accord before the deadline. That has appeared to leave only one alternative, an extension of the Saturday deadline. **********But constitutional experts have said that giving the two holdout provinces more time would take a constitutional amendment, passed by the national Parliament and all 10 provinces, again by Saturday midnight, to suspend a requirement in the Constitution that sets a three-year limit for approval of measures like those included in the Meech Lake pact. **********Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who was the principal architect of the constitutional accord when it was drawn up in June 1987 has shown strain as the deadline approaches. On Monday, he sent an emissary to Winnipeg in an attempt to persuade Indian leaders that the grievances underlying Mr. Harper's blocking actions could be met through the appointment of a royal commission of inquiry, and by future constitutional measures on behalf of the country's 525,000 Indians. But the initiative was rebuffed by the Indian leaders, who said that they wanted immediate action.

The lower house is expected to respond later this week. **********Though the voting procedures have yet to be determined, politicians from all factions have repeatedly said the elections could take place this fall, thus replacing the only Warsaw Pact leader besides Mikhail S. Gorbachev still in office a year after the Berlin wall was opened. **********On Monday, Lech Walesa, the founder of the Solidarity trade union movement and challenger of Communist rule, announced his candidacy for President. Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who had been nominated to his post as head of government by Mr. Walesa, is understood to be nearing a decision that would have him run against his former patron for the Presidency. **********As General Jaruzelski was, in effect, submitting his resignation to Parliament, political leaders from the factions backing Mr. Walesa and Mr. Mazowiecki completed discussions at which they agreed to press jointly for what was described as the first fully democratic ballot in postwar Poland. According to legislation to be presented in the next few days these would involve balloting for a new parliament as well as the direct election of a president. **********When General Jaruzelski won the presidential office in July 1989, he was elected by a vote of a Parliament in which only a third of the seats in the lower house were openly contested, with the rest reserved for Communists and their allies. At the time, candidates backed by Solidarity won all but one of the races in which they were permitted to run. **********Seeks to 'Promote Democracy' **********In his letter to the Speaker of the lower house of Parliament, Nikolai Kozakiewicz, General Jaruzelski said he was motivated to step down by ''concern to prevent undesirable public sentiment'' and to ''promote democracy'' in Poland. He asked Parliament to end what has turned out to have been a largely ceremonial and transitional stewardship by mandating the election of a president by universal vote, something that will require a change in Poland's Constitution. **********The move came on the eve of a session of Parliament called to discuss constitutional changes. Bronislaw Geremek, speaker of the largest bloc in Parliament, said at a news conference that Parliament would be asked to vote on measures to set the presidential election for sometime later this year, perhaps as early as November, and to set a date for fully democratic elections for a new parliament ''probably in the early spring.'' **********On Tuesday, General Jaruzelski met for a day of talks on the political situation at the residence of the Polish Primate, Jozef Cardinal Glemp, with senior political leaders including Mr. Walesa and Prime Minister Mazowiecki. **********First of Soviet-Bloc Countries **********Though Poland in 1988 was the first of the Soviet-bloc countries to turn its back on Communism, with the appointment of Mr. Mazowiecki to head the first non-Communist government in Eastern Europe since the early postwar years, the nation's Parliament, unlike similar bodies in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Germany, has never been elected in fully free voting. Instead, seating in the lower house, on which Mr. Mazowiecki's authority rests, springs from an agreement reached in April 1988, when Solidarity and the governing Communist Party reached a pact at arduous round-table discussions on dividing up the seats in Parliament. **********Mr. Mazowiecki's policies, particularly on the economic front, are facing a serious test. The Persian Gulf crisis, with its upward thrust on energy prices, has upset the reckoning of Government economists. Moreover, two days of talks with visiting Soviet trade officials this week disclosed that future economic relations with the Soviet Union, Poland's largest trading partner, will be increasingly difficult as both countries move toward putting their trade on a hard-currency basis. **********This week's events were forced in large measure by Mr. Walesa, who led the industrial strife in 1988 that led to relegalization of his trade union, which had been crushed by martial law under General Jaruzelski, and forced the Communist leaders to the bargaining table. In recent months, Mr. Walesa, from his union stronghold in Gdansk, on the northern Baltic sea coast, has grown critical of Mr. Mazowiecki's Government, attacking its severe economic austerity program for not moving fast enough in some areas and not protecting workers sufficiently. **********At his news conference, Mr. Geremek advocated that elections for Parliament be held in the spring after the Presidential balloting since that would allow Mr. Mazowiecki and his team of economic advisers to put the main elements of economic policy in place, including the formulation of a 1991 budget."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/16/business/company-news-executive-raises-stake-in-ultimate.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 169, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Executive Raises Stake in Ultimate", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Executive Raises Stake in Ultimate", "body_text": " **********Norman Elowitz, a New York fashion executive, has raised his stake in the Ultimate Corporation to 8.4 percent from 7.2 percent.

It was one of the largest single-day increases in seven and a half years of trading on the exchange, and marked the ninth straight trading day that the November contract had risen, for a total rise of $8.38. **********Impact on Other Markets **********The jump in oil prices had an impact on other financial markets, with the Dow Jones industrial average off by nearly 60 points. Also, gold prices were up sharply, and long-term interest rates rose to their highest levels in 18 months. [Pages D16 and D17.]  Increasingly hawkish statements by Iraqi leaders on Thursday, Friday and Sunday have sent oil prices spiraling upward after about two weeks of relative stability and small daily increases. **********Sunday's announcement particularly alarmed the many traders and brokers who had assumed that Iraq would go to war only if attacked, said Virginia Wiater, an energy futures broker for United Energy Inc., a New York brokerage. ''That just made everybody completely cuckoo,'' she said. **********About $39 in Informal Deals **********In a further sign of price pressure, traders making informal oil deals after the close of trading on the mercantile exchange were agreeing to prices of about $39 a barrel, said Robert F. Murphy, an energy futures broker at Lehman Brothers Inc. ''Even without war, and without the destruction of the oilfields, we could reach $40'' in trading today, he added, declining to speculate on how high prices might go if war did break out. **********Comparing current prices with those prevailing during the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 is difficult because most oil was then shipped under long-term contracts rather than being traded on markets, and because prices in general have risen in the last decade. **********The highest price paid for comparable oil was $39.80 on March 29, 1980, said Peter C. Beutel, an oil price analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., a consulting firm in Hoboken, N.J. Adjusted for inflation over the last 10 years, that is comparable to nearly $65 now. **********Heating oil for October delivery rose yesterday by 6.71 cents a gallon, to $1.0392, on the mercantile exchange, while October gasoline rose 6.78 cents a gallon, to $1.0423. The contracts for crude oil delivery in December through March all rose the limit of $1.50 a barrel, while heating oil and gasoline contracts for November through March all rose the limit of 4 cents a gallon. **********Jet fuel prices set a record of $466 a metric ton in deals struck yesterday in Europe, far surpassing the previous mark of $420 a ton, set on Jan. 3, 1980, said John H. Kingston, the managing editor of Platt's Oilgram Price Report, a daily New York newsletter. Jet fuel is traded in direct deals between refiners and airlines rather than on a commodity exchange, and jet fuel has been in particularly short supply for the last month because a large refinery in Kuwait was one of the world's main producers. **********Quick Effect Expected **********The recent sharp increase in oil prices is likely to affect consumers quickly, although the direct effect on politically sensitive gasoline prices may be muted. Oil companies are marking up the prices of jet and diesel fuel and heating oil quickly, while accepting much-reduced profit margins on sales of gasoline, said Theodore R. Eck, the chief economist of the Amoco Corporation in Chicago. **********Rising jet and diesel fuel prices are passed on to consumers by airlines, in the form of higher ticket prices, and by trucking companies that must charge more for transporting food and other goods to stores. **********The price of a standard 42-gallon barrel of crude oil has risen from 40 cents a gallon to 91 cents since July 1, including yesterday's sharp increase, said Neil T. Geary, a spokesman for Amoco. During the same period, Amoco has increased the average price it charges to service stations and wholesalers by 21.5 cents a gallon for gasoline and 27.5 cents a gallon for heating oil, he added. Amoco's jet fuel prices have typically climbed about 37 cents a gallon, although increases for specific airlines have varied widely depending on whether they had long-term contracts. **********But Edwin S. Rothschild, the energy policy director at Citizen Action, a consumer group based in Washington, said that oil companies could afford to increase gasoline prices slowly now because they raised them slightly during the first six months of this year, when crude oil prices fell $5 a barrel. ''They're already ahead of the game,'' he added. **********Changes in Payment Practices **********Rises in crude oil prices have affected consumers more quickly in recent years in part because of changes in the payment practices of oil companies. Imported oil meets about half of the needs of the United States, and most of this oil is now paid for by the companies when it arrives at an American port, instead of when it is loaded aboard tankers at jetties in the exporting country. **********As a result, four-fifths of the imported oil pumped at Amoco service stations has belonged to the company for only the five to seven days that it takes to refine the oil, ship it by pipeline and truck to the dealer, and store it in the dealer's tank until sold to American drivers, Mr. Eck said. In the early 1980's, Amoco paid for oil when it was loaded and owned the shipment during the tanker trip to the United States, which lasts four to six weeks for journeys from the Middle East."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/20/world/mideast-tensions-canadians-in-kuwait-quit-their-embassy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 164, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Canadians In Kuwait Quit their Embassy", "print_headline": "MIDEAST TENSIONS;   Canadians In Kuwait Quit their Embassy", "body_text": " **********Canada announced today that its five remaining diplomats had abandoned the country's embassy in Kuwait and had arrived in Baghdad. **********The action left the British, French and United States embassies as the only ones still open in Kuwait, in defiance of Iraq's annexation and order that all embassies in Kuwait be shut down.

Cadillac's changes are aimed at reassuring prospective customers who may be having second thoughts about buying a large car. **********But the two auto makers have been reluctant to push the theme too hard because they are concerned a more vocal approach could backfire and end up heightening fears of impending gasoline shortages. And that could hurt sales even more. **********So Chrysler has added one line at the bottom of its ''Advantage: Chrysler'' ads calling attention to its corporate average fuel economy, which is higher than either G.M.'s or that of the Ford Motor Company. **********''That line was in response to the perception that there was going to be a fuel shortage,'' said Tom Houston, a spokesman for Chrysler. **********Cadillac has revamped some of its television and print ads to play up the Environmental Protection Agency's certification that 1991 Cadillacs can go a little more than 26 miles on a gallon of gas under highway driving conditions, an improvement of one mile a gallon over last year's models. Cadillac's six models get 16 miles a gallon in city driving, unchanged from last year. **********Cadillac executives seized on the highway mileage improvement, accomplished largely by adding smoother-shifting transmissions and new fuel-injection systems, to update their pitch for big cars. A new tagline about the Cadillac being ''as responsible to own as they are responsive to drive'' was patched on to some of the division's television commercials, intended to reassure prospective buyers that they would not be out of step with the times by purchasing a Cadillac. **********''Availability and price of gas doesn't affect luxury car buyers much in their purchasing decisions,'' said Peter R. Levin, director of advertising for Cadillac. ''But many still had memories of previous oil crises, and they did not want to project an image of being irresponsible by purchasing a luxury car.'' **********Cadillac's changes were made based on a survey of luxury car owners in seven major cities a week after the Iraqi invasion. **********''Initially, our 1991 product advertising focused only on the performance aspects of our new engines,'' Mr. Levin said. **********But, he added, ''We don't want to overdo the message about fuel economy because that might cause a sense of panic or discourage people from deciding to buy a luxury car altogether.'' **********Most car companies say they are content to run commercials developed before the Persian Gulf crisis drove up the price of gasoline by more than 20 cents a gallon. With the American appetite for big, less-efficient cars, pickup trucks and mini-vans as keen as ever, auto makers apparently do not risk being penalized in the marketplace for pushing the performance, styling and reliability of their vehicles. **********Some Japanese manufacturers say they are already well positioned with cars that are at least widely perceived as being fuel efficient. **********''There's no need for us to shift our advertising,'' said David W. Danzer, corporate marketing manager for Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., ''because our customers tell us that fuel economy is already one of their highest considerations in choosing a Toyota.'' **********Still, the overall fuel economy of many Japanese manufacturers' fleets has slipped in the last two years as the cars they sell in the United States have grown larger and heavier. **********Mr. Levin said Cadillac did not plan to redo its ad campaign for 1991, but it might tinker further with the fuel economy theme if war broke out in the Persian Gulf and fuel prices soared. **********''In normal times, a V-8 engine is a key signal to luxury car buyers,'' said the Cadillac advertising manager. Cadillac now promotes itself as the only luxury car line besides Rolls-Royce to offer V-8 engines as standard equipment in all of its models. **********''But if the situation worsened, we might not want to emphasize that,'' Mr. Levin said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/24/world/diplomatic-battle-waged-on-kashmir.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1990-05-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1058, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DIPLOMATIC BATTLE WAGED ON KASHMIR", "print_headline": "DIPLOMATIC BATTLE WAGED ON KASHMIR", "body_text": " **********On the day this week that the spiritual leader of thousands of Kashmiri Muslims was shot dead by unknown assassins, India's special minister for Kashmir, George Fernandes, was on his way to Cairo to deliver a letter to President Hosni Mubarak. **********Mr. Fernandes arrived on the heels of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who has just completed an eight-nation tour of the Islamic Middle East. She was asking for Islamic solidarity against India. **********An Indian-Pakistani diplomatic war, fought by envoys from Washington to Beijing, has been gaining intensity over several months. But so far it has been a war of accusations rather than a debate over objectives. What each side wants, and why, is not always clear to governments outside this region, diplomats say. A Campaign of Repression?  Islamic Pakistan asserts that India has unleashed a military campaign of repression against the Muslim majority in the Kashmir Valley, where alienation from New Delhi has been growing for three years and where many people want to exercise the right, denied them for 40 years, to choose whether they want to be part of India. **********This week those charges were intensified as Indian paramilitary forces fired into a crowd of mourners carrying the body of the slain Muslim cleric, Maulvi Mohammed Farooq, from the hosptial to his religious headquarters in Srinigar, the capital of Kashmir, on Monday. Dozens of people died. **********In Srinagar today, witnesses told reporters that there had been no exchange of fire between troops and militants, as Indian authorities have insisted in describing the troops' action as self-defense. **********In New Delhi, officials regard the question of Kashmir's future a matter over which there can be no debate. The problem, they say, has become simply one of Pakistani support for armed militants. They say that until Islamabad stops that support, there can be no hope of negotiations inside Kashmir or with Pakistan. **********Three Border Wars **********But beneath the surface, politicians on both sides of the border say, there are other motivations and other reasons for the standoff between two countries that have fought three wars along the Kashmir border. **********In Pakistan, resentment has festered for nearly 20 years over India's support for a Bengali Muslim independence movement that in 1971 - with the help of the invading Indian Army -created Bangladesh out of what had been East Pakistan. **********Over the last decade, not only Pakistan, but also Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka have watched as India backed other guerrilla armies in the region, most prominently the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in the Sri Lankan Northeast. Indian intelligence agencies have also supported guerrilla groups in the Chittagong Hills in Bangladesh. Pakistan fears Indian influence in its already troubled province of Sind. **********A Chance for Revenge **********''So here in Kashmir, Pakistan has the perfect opportunity to pay us back,'' an Indian politician said. ''They have only to give enough support to keep an insurgency running for a long time.'' **********For India, the Kashmir situation is fraught with so much potential danger that the Government of Prime Minister V. P. Singh seems unwilling or unable to gamble on bold political moves - including opening the border between Indian Kashmir and the Pakistani part of the region or talking with Islamabad about how to build a new political entity in Kashmir that would satisfy both countries. India seems intent on crushing the revolt by force before looking for the roots of the problem. **********The Singh Government is supported by a Hindu-based party that includes people willing to press a case against Muslims anywhere. **********The Kashmir Valley is only about a third of India's Jammu and Kashmir state, and the only Islamic area -Jammu is largely Hindu and Ladakh is Buddhist. But Kashmir's population is large enough to make Jammu and Kashmir the only Indian state with a Muslim majority. It is important to India's image as a secular nation with religious freedom to have a predominantly Muslim state. **********Furthermore, in India, religion is an explosive subject even in normal times. There is always the danger that the crisis in Kashmir will set off conflagrations elsewhere. Several thousand people died at the hands of Hindu mobs last fall in several Indian states because of a dispute over a mosque in Ayodhya over which Hindus wanted to construct a temple. **********Economic and Political Issues **********Kashmiris argue, however, that their problems with India are not religious, but economic and political. They and their supporters in Pakistan accuse India of emphasizing their religion in order to undermine their cause in the West, where Asian Muslims often believe there is a prejudice against them. **********The Kashmir Valley, which India had been developing as one of its prime tourist areas, suffered from a low investment level in industry, gorwing unemployment, poor communications, limited air services and inadequate roads connect it with to the rest of India. People here have come to believe that the produce of their orchards and farms might move more quickly through Pakistan. **********Buddhists Ladakhis have similar complaints. Apricots not available anywhere in Indian cities ripen and rot on Ladakhi hillsides for lack of refrigerated airfreight services. **********Under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her son and successor, Rajiv, New Delhi began interfering with Kashmir's internal politics, ultimately dominating the National Conference, the last Kashmiri party with any claim to Kashmiri nationalism. As a result, many Kashmiris were pushed outside mainstream politics. A 1987 state election, which more or less everyone admits was rigged in favor of Mr. Gandhi's Congress Party and its National Conference allies, provided recruits for new militant groups. **********An Indian attack on Pakistan will not solve these problems, say citizens groups here and in Islamabad who are beginning to fear an accidental war that neither side wants. Both sides accuse each other of massing troops. Both fear the coming of summer, when snows melt in the border mountain ranges and a season conducive to both military maneuvers and guerrilla infiltration begins."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/04/business/continental-s-risks-in-a-chapter-11-filing.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Weiner", "pub_date": "1990-12-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 772, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Continental's Risks in a Chapter 11 Filing", "print_headline": "Continental's Risks in a Chapter 11 Filing", "body_text": " **********The words \"Chapter 11\" have never helped a company's public image. The question facing executives of Continental Airlines is just how serious the damage will be. **********In filing for bankruptcy protection yesterday, Continental has taken great pains to reassure its customers and travel agents that it will be business as usual for the nation's fifth-largest airline. While many travelers say they will indeed continue to fly the carrier, some remember Continental's bankruptcy filing eight years ago, when some flights were canceled and some passengers were left with worthless tickets. **********One travel agent said yesterday that he had temporarily stopped booking tickets on Continental.   A 'Dangerous' Move **********\"In this environment, it's dangerous to go into Chapter 11,\" said Raymond Neidl, an analyst with Dillon, Read & Company. \"Other airlines will pounce on you and try to steal customers and scare travel agents.\" **********Hollis H. Harris, Continental's chairman, said yesterday that the airline would continue to fly its normal schedule, would honor its contracts with travel agents and other airlines and would refund money to any customer who wanted it. **********\"The travel agent and consumer can book Continental Airlines with absolute confidence,\" said Ned Walker, a Continental spokesman. He said that of the airline's approximately 1,400 scheduled flights yesterday, not one was canceled because of Continental's financial condition. Of 4,600 calls to its reservations line surveyed by the company, only nine cancellations were reported, which was a lower rate than average, Mr. Walker said. **********But the real test of consumer confidence, industry analysts said yesterday, will come early next year, when demand for travel historically falls off. By filing for bankruptcy protection in the midst of the busy holiday travel period, Continental has cushioned itself against, or at least delayed, any consumer backlash. **********\"They picked a good time,\" said John Pritchard, a New York lawyer specializing in bankruptcy law. \"No judge is going to want to strand these people.\" A bankruptcy judge has broad powers in deciding how a company would operate and could, as a last resort, call for liquidation. **********With flights already booked through the end of the month, most Continental ticket holders have few options. **********Ron Smith, the executive vice president of the American Society of Travel Agents, said the trade group was telling its members to book customers on Continental. \"We're telling people to hang loose and keep booking them,\" he said. **********To some, the stigma of Chapter 11 may not be as strong as it once was. \"The public is more callous about these things,\" said Russ Thayer, the senior vice president of Airline Economics, a consulting firm in Washington, noting that at least three well-publicized airline bankruptcy filings have occurred in the last decade. In only some of the cases did the airlines stop flying altogether. **********Travelers flying Continental from Newark International Airport yesterday had mixed reactions to -- and varying degrees of understanding about -- the filing. \"I hope it doesn't go through for at least five days because that's when our flight home is,\" said Leo Bergeron of San Francisco. **********Others showed greater loyalty. \"It's a temporary setback,\" said Gene Carter of Columbia, S.C. \"It's a great airline.\" **********But some travel agents are suggesting that their clients not fly Continental, at least for now. \"We are suggesting alternative airlines until the smoke clears,\" said David Perelman, the owner of the D.M.S. Travel Group in New York. \"In the past, the passenger and travel agent have been left holding the bag,\" he said. **********In recent years, the travel industry has been seeking greater protection for itself and its clients, should an airline stop flying. The industry has been pushing for a small \"default\" fee to be collected on each ticket, with the amassed funds to be used to reimburse passengers and travel agents should a carrier stop flying. **********The law currently affords passengers little protection. \"Passsengers are unsecured creditors who go to the end of the line,\" said Cornish Hitchcock, legal director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, a group based in Washington.  'Put Me on Someone Else' **********Other travel agents said they were informing passengers of Continental's financial situation when making reservations. Thomas Nulty, the president of Associated Travel in Santa Clara, Calif., said that after being told of the filing, \"every single person said put me on someone else.\" **********Most of Continental's 37,000 employees learned of the filing from the news media. One pilot, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said he was not concerned about his job security, but he added, \"It's aggravating to have it hanging over our heads all the time.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/04/business/consumers-borrow-less.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-12-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 257, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Consumers Borrow Less", "print_headline": "Consumers Borrow Less", "body_text": " **********Consumers were scaling back borrowing in the July-September quarter as the economy appeared to be headed toward a recession, a banking group said Monday. **********The percentage of consumer loans 30 or more days delinquent was a seasonally adjusted 2.56 percent at the end of the third quarter, virtually unchanged from the 2.55 percent rate at the end of the April-June period, the American Bankers Association said. **********The rate was 2.46 percent at the end of the first quarter and 2.64 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 1989. **********\"Consumers are well aware of the slowing economy and are making efforts to consolidate and repay debts, rather than take on new ones,\" said Robert H.

The path has not been smooth. First Saatchi said Hay was not for sale; then it said the group was worth triple the $100 million to $200 million Mr. Krief was offering; then Mr. Krief refused to sign a confidentiality letter that Saatchi wanted before it would show him its books. Now several Hay managers are trying to buy Hay for about $90 million. Still, Mr. Krief, whose 150-person Bernard Krief Associates is a fraction the size of Hay, which has a staff of more than 2,000, is persevering. **********Q. Why do you want Hay so badly? **********A. We are only in four countries - France, the United States, Russia and Belgium. Hay would give us instant entree to 32 countries. **********Q. Couldn't you spread out yourself? **********A. Consulting start-ups are difficult, because so much depends on your image. In Germany, for example, it would take years to establish the Krief name, while the Hay name is already known. **********Q. If this merger means so much to you, why would you not sign the letter of confidentiality? **********A. I had to promise not to meet with the Hay consultants, and not to participate in any tender offer anyone might make for Saatchi. That is asking too much. If you go into a store to buy six shirts, no one should tell you you can't see the shirts first, and that you must promise you'll never cooperate with anyone who buys the store. **********Q. Some Hay managers are trying to buy the company themselves. Aren't you afraid they will quit if you outbid them? After all, the only assets a consulting firm has is its people. **********A. That's one reason I wouldn't sign that letter. About 150 people are the leaders at Hay. I want to sit down with them and see if they want me. If they don't, I'll walk away. But I think many of them will be interested in what I have to offer. **********Q. And what is that? **********A. I offer them participative management, and a willingness to spend a lot of money on research and development. I'd ask them to buy 10 percent of the company at first. I'd offer them stock options for another 30 percent down the road, as well as financial incentives to help them buy stock. **********Q. But why would people who want to own the business be happy with a minority stake? **********A. Not all of them are interested in the buyout. But if they wanted to eventually own 80 percent, that would be fine, too. **********Q. Actually, you are like the little fish trying to swallow the big fish. If you got Hay, wouldn't its sheer size undermine Krief Associates? **********A. It would be perfectly O.K. if they absorbed me. I'd even be willing to move to the States. What's important is that there be cross-fertilization, not only between Krief and Hay, but between the Hay operations in the different countries. **********Q. Still, how many Hay consultants could you lose and still feel you made a good deal?. **********A. It's not a question of numbers, but of names. I would need to hold on to most of the 150 top people. I would treat them like partners, not employees. **********Q. But don't you feel that their corporate culture would overwhelm yours? **********A. I'm not an autocrat, I'm a team worker. I would want the 150 top people to sit on a strategy committee, to help with planning. I don't think they have that with Saatchi, but that would fit right in with the culture of our company. **********Q. What happens now? **********A. I'm expecting a more normal letter of confidentiality any day now. If I get it, I will sign, and start meeting the consultants. **********Q. And what if you don't land Hay? Do you have other plans for growth? **********A. I just signed another letter of confidentiality this week. I have other negotiations going on, and I'm open to the idea of joint ventures with consulting firms from other countries, either to help us get into countries we're not in or to help us get into consulting areas like logistics in which we have no expertise."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/04/business/cigna-net-falls-by-half.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cigna Net Falls by Half", "print_headline": "Cigna Net Falls by Half", "body_text": " **********The Cigna Corporation said today that its earnings fell by half in the first quarter, partly because of large claims resulting from severe winter storms in Europe.

He incorporates religious themes in his performances of the Bharatanatyam dance forms of South India, where he was born. **********''My main purpose is to understand Christ within my culture,'' he said as he prepared to perform on Monday evening. **********With the rise of Hindu militancy all over India, and the success of Islamic fundamentalists in Kashmir, India's Christians have reason to take stock of their position and ask questions about their future as a religious minority. **********Indianness of Christianity **********Christianity, some of its adherents say, must prove its Indianness not only to avoid becoming a target of the Hindu revival but also to make itself credible as an alternative to other religions in a materialistic age. Rising islands of urban affluence in a sea of rural poverty disturb many Indians, who are searching for responses. **********''The Christian has something to offer,'' said George Ninan, who gave up a career in advertising to devote his life to the Assemblies of God, an evangelical church. ''I think that what India needs is more of an awareness of the other person, a concern for the neighbor.'' **********The roots and beliefs of Christianity are about to get their first national public airing this year, when the Government television network, Doordarshan, begins broadcasting stories from the Bible. Most of the filming is being done along India's southern coasts, where studio crews have built large models of Noah's Ark and the Tower of Babel. **********Indian Christians say their earliest churches were founded in the region by St. Thomas the Apostle in the first century A.D. Although there are no written records, Indians believe St. Thomas was martyred in South India and buried in Tamil Nadu. Over the centuries, other branches of Christianity were brought by European colonizers and American missionaries. **********Christian Sense of Community **********In Bangalore, a city of churches as well as the capital of Indian science and research, nearly all the country's diverse Christian communities are represented: the Roman Catholic Church; the ancient Syrian Church of Kerala, well established by the sixth century A.D.; its reformed counterpart, the Mar Thoma church; Protestants from the Church of South India, which groups Anglicans, Lutherans and other older denominations, and newer evangelical groups with links to the United States. **********There are thought to be up to 24 million Christians in India, only 3 percent of a national population now above 810 million. But their influence has been strong, particularly in education. In areas where their numbers are significant, literacy rates and the status of women are generally very high, and birth rates are lower. **********Leela Rao, a professor of film at Bangalore University's Central College and a Hindu Brahmin who has taken part in seminars on communications in India organized by Mr. Ninan, said in an interview that Hinduism, India's majority religion, was essentially a self-centered but not selfish creed. Christian churches seemed to have more of a sense of community, she said. **********''As a Hindu, you go to the temple only as a means to your own salvation,'' she said. ''No one can do anything for you, and you can't do anything for anybody. Spiritual salvation is never for a community. The universe is one. You find yourself and become part of that universe.'' **********Agents of Foreign Influence **********But the Christian churches often have problems putting across their message of social justice and good works because of their shortsightedness or because the Hindu establishment casts them as agents of foreign influence, Mr. Ninan said. **********He drew attention to a Christmas Eve program broadcast on Indian television that featured a talk by the American evangelist Billy Graham. **********''Billy Graham is great,'' Mr. Ninan said. ''As an evangelical Christian, I couldn't have thought of anyone better. But not for India.'' **********''People have been putting out the idea that Christianity is a foreign religion, and here you have this white man talking,'' he said. ''It stuck in the minds of people.'' **********'Self-Appointed Saviors' **********A religious experience as a young man ultimately led him into an evangelical church, he said, but he has been disturbed by its links to evangelists in the United States who think ''writing a big check'' is serving God. **********''There are a lot of people who have become self-appointed saviors of India,'' he said, recalling an American preacher who came to India seven years ago and saw a film he thought had the power to convert the country if it could be widely distributed. **********Returning to the United States, the evangelist raised money for the project. ''He is thought to have collected millions of dollars,'' Mr. Ninan said. ''Indians got none of it.'' **********Mr. Ninan, like Father Francis, said he believed that Indian forms of communication like music, dance and drama - frowned on as immoral and all but obliterated by 19th-century and early 20th-century missionaries - needed to be revived to tell the Christian story. **********Mr. Ninan's wife, Pamela, and two other writers are now adapting for young Indian readers the English-language Good News Bible for Children. The adaptation, to be published by the Bangalore-based Bible Society of India, hopes to replace drawings like those of a slim, blond Eve and a Tarzan-like Adam with more appropriate Indian illustrations. **********Father Francis also performs essentially Hindu dances because, he said, the arts are are a way to bring people from those different cultures closer together. **********''That's what the arts are for,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/02/business/company-news-upjohn-gets-stake.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 143, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Upjohn Gets Stake", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Upjohn Gets Stake", "body_text": " **********The Upjohn Company has acquired stock and options equal to a 5.6 percent stake in Clinical Technologies Associates Inc., an Elmsford, N.Y., pharmaceutical research concern.

In an interview with the Government newspaper Rzeczpospolita, for example, he reaffirmed his commitment to take Mr. Tyminski into an unspecified type of custody if he wins the voting this Sunday. **********\"I want to ask all the services concerned,\" Mr. Walesa said. \"Tyminski must not be let out of the country. He must account for everything that brought Poland harm, and for abusing Poland's good name in the world.\" **********Polish television aired a broadcast this week that quoted a neighbor of Mr. Tyminski in Toronto as saying he beat his wife and abused his children. The report provided no documentary support for the charge and Mr. Tyminski replied with a letter to Polish television that threatened a lawsuit against the head of Polish television. He said the woman making the accusations \"had done so under the influence of her alcoholic husband.\" **********Polish television also broadcast, without comment, tape of Mr. Tyminski's assertion that he had caused Jeffrey Sachs, the economist, to lose his temper during a discussion the two men had on the ABC News program \"Nightline.\" A tape of Mr. Tyminski's making this remark at a news conference was followed by a shot of Mr. Sachs showing the American economist speaking in a completely calm tone of voice. **********Today, Interior Minister Krzysztof Kozlowski held a news conference at which he said the intelligence agencies of Canada and the United States were looking into Mr. Tyminski's backgroud."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/04/business/long-distance-bill-cleared.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 166, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Long-Distance Bill Cleared", "print_headline": "Long-Distance Bill Cleared", "body_text": " **********The House of Representatives passed a bill today that would place new restrictions on companies that provide long-distance telephone service to hotels, hospitals and college campuses. **********The legislation, which was passed earlier this week by the Senate, is meant to address complaints about overcharging for calls placed through ''alternative operator services.'' **********Such companies lease long-distance lines and provide service to people staying in hotel rooms, for example, but their prices have often been far higher than those charged by conventional long-distance services, like A.T.&T., MCI or U S Sprint. **********The bill would require such services to let customers reach their own long-distance carriers, using their long-distance calling cards. **********It would also require that alternative operator services identify themselves to customers and provide information about their prices upon request."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/18/world/fighting-erupts-in-the-salvadoran-capital.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 195, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fighting Erupts in the Salvadoran Capital", "print_headline": "Fighting Erupts in the Salvadoran Capital", "body_text": " **********Fighting broke out between leftist guerrillas and Government troops in San Salvador tonight and loud explosions were heard in several sections of the city. **********The authorities said that a number of people were wounded. **********Witnesses said they saw army helicopters dropping flares and firing with automatic weapons at suspected guerrilla positions near the Ilopango air base, a few miles east of the capital, and at other points in the city. **********Reporters said they heard a number of loud explosions, apparently caused by bombs in the poor neighborhood of Soyapango on the city's east side, and in Delgado to the northeast. **********A Red Cross spokesman, who insisted on anonymity, said in a telephone interview that there was fighting in the southern part of the city. **********The armed forces press office said it had no immediate details. **********''We know there have been explosions, but we don't know where,'' a military spokesman said in a telephone interview."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/11/business/papers-end-joint-accord.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 159, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Papers End Joint Accord", "print_headline": "Papers End Joint Accord", "body_text": " **********The Knoxville News-Sentinel and The Knoxville Journal agreed last week to dissolve their four-year-old joint operating agreement by the end of 1991, ending a lawsuit. **********The News-Sentinel asserted in its lawsuit that The Journal's owner, the Persis Corporation, violated terms of the agreement when it bought The Daily Times in Maryville in neighboring Blount County in December.

The series has since been on the shelf at the state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation, which spent 1.7 million rand, currently about $680,000, to make the series but was too nervous to show it until now. **********In the interim, John Cundhill, who wrote the series five years ago, emigrated to Australia.

And President F. W. de Klerk has embarked on a policy of evolutionary change that includes formal recognition of a handful of multiracial neighbors, despite the existence of legal residential segregation. **********The South African Broadcasting Corporation is showing ''People Like Us'' at 10:25 on Saturday night to avoid inciting or offending whites. The late time slot reportedly was chosen because the majority of viewers at that hour are black, and impressionable children of any race are usually in bed. One television reviewer, Richard McNeill, accused the corporation of cowardice and said the series should be shown on prime time weekdays so more whites would watch it. **********South Africa's answer to Archie Bunker is Barney Bosman, a municipal building inspector who argues that just as antelopes stick to antelopes and giraffes to giraffes, so people should not deviate from their own kind. Barney, played by Michael Brunner, does not confine his intolerance to non-whites; he does not like Jews, Portuguese and Greeks either. And his insistence that a lioness does not attempt a lion's work makes clear where he stands on feminism. **********''A lot of things have changed since Dr. Vorster,'' Barney Bosman tells his son-in-law, Biff Britz, alluding to John Vorster, South Africa's Prime Minister in the heyday of apartheid. ''But that's not to say we can't change them back again.'' **********A Mixed-Race Doctor **********But Barney's life is changed when Glen Kinnear, a white upper-class property developer, renames the neighborhood Honeysuckle Heights to lure Johannesburg yuppies and begins buying up houses. The developer, who runs short of cash, sells his own house in the wealthy northern suburb of Bryanston and moves in next to the Bosmans in Randjiesuitsig, to the mortification of his snobbish wife, Tessa. ''I saw a woman on the street with her hair in curlers,'' she says of their new Afrikaner neighbors. ''Imagine the accents.'' **********Biff Britz, who lives with his father-in-law, quietly buys the other house next door, and resells it to Ben Paulsen, a mixed-race doctor. Dr. Paulsen and his wife are implausibly upscale - she owns a fashion boutique - but his surly kid brother, Russell, on probation for car theft, readily stoops to the occasion with Barney. **********The characters include a British immigrant couple who moved to South Africa, they announced, ''to get away from the blacks.'' But the series gives short shrift to the country's black majority. The only blacks in the first two episodes walked on as construction workers and a gardener. **********Yet ''People Like Us'' conveys with some poignancy the desperation of mixed-race South Africans who yearn for the things whites take for granted. ''I want to own a house, Ben,'' pleads Dr. Paulsen's wife, despite the fear that Randjiesuitsig will not welcome them. **********Abusive Phone Calls to Actors **********Though ''People Like Us'' confronts racism on tiptoe, Tanya Logan, who plays Barney's liberated tomboy daughter, Barbie, said in a newspaper interview that she and her husband had received dozens of abusive telephone calls, and the other actors have braced for a backlash. But they said they considered the series relevant for South Africa. **********''It is not a series that hammers any messages or that will radically alter anyone's viewpoint, but rather tries to show that change doesn't signify the end of the world,'' Gray Hofmeyr, the director, said in an interview with The Johannesburg Star newspaper. ''It's a series that will develop the ability of South Africans to laugh at themselves.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/30/business/the-executive-life-for-the-cognoscenti-anything-custommade.html": {"writer_name": "Deirdre Fanning", "pub_date": "1990-09-30", "snippet": "LEAD: What do Merv Adelson, former chairman of the Lorimar Telepictures Corporation, former Postmaster General Preston Robert Tisch and Stephen Wynn, the chairman of Golden Nugget Inc. in Las Vegas, have in common?", "word_count": 918, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Executive Life;\n\nFor the Cognoscenti, Anything Custom-Made", "print_headline": "The Executive Life;\n\nFor the Cognoscenti, Anything Custom-Made", "body_text": " **********LEAD: What do Merv Adelson, former chairman of the Lorimar Telepictures Corporation, former Postmaster General Preston Robert Tisch and Stephen Wynn, the chairman of Golden Nugget Inc. in Las Vegas, have in common? **********What do Merv Adelson, former chairman of the Lorimar Telepictures Corporation, former Postmaster General Preston Robert Tisch and Stephen Wynn, the chairman of Golden Nugget Inc. in Las Vegas, have in common? **********Several times a year each of these busy executives can be found standing in a small, wood-paneled room lined with mirrors on West 57 Street, as William Fioravanti, a custom tailor, hovers around them with a measuring tape and a loaded pin-cushion. For what seems like an eternity, Mr. Fioravanti pokes and prods, looking for the errant bulge or the unseemly high waist; the flat or curved seat; the barrel chest or the bow-legged stance. His mission: to camouflage any particular flaw beneath the seams of a well-cut suit. The price of his craft? Upward of $3,000 per suit.  Recession or not, the custom-made traditional men's suit is back in the executive suite in a big way. After years of dabbling in the flashier duds of European designers like Giorgio Armani and Gianni Versace, male executives are returning to the more conservative, somberly patrician look of a Savile Row suit. **********Of course, some, most notably bankers, never left that look. But for those who did stray, the reasons for a return are many, not the least of which is the instant aura of Old World money that custom suits bestow on their owners. It was no coincidence that Oliver Stone, the director of ''Wall Street,'' starring Michael Douglas as the ruthlessly ambitious arbitrager Gordon Gekko, allowed the camera to linger on his star's elegant, custom-made English suits. **********There are also some practical reasons for the renewed popularity of these suits. ''The English suit is very flattering to the person,'' noted Henry Stewart, another leading New York custom tailor. ''The Italian and French suits are not at all flattering. They're too tight in the wrong places: they remind me of a tight-fitting lady's dress.'' **********Added Mr. Fioravanti, ''Our client wants to look no-nonsense and efficient. He doesn't care to look like a kid in a disco.'' **********But coming up with the $3,000 to finance the purchase of one of these gems is only the beginning. There is serious suit etiquette among the executive cognoscenti; and violators quickly become the subject of scorn, regardless of how powerful or successful they are in business. Simply put, there are rules to dressing like Cary Grant or Prince Charles, and they must be followed if an executive is to look at all comfortable - at all natural - in one of these power outfits: *********** Buttonholes: Always insist that buttons on a jacket sleeve are unbuttonable. Never, however, stoop to the obvious ploy of leaving the top button nonchalantly unbuttoned, thereby alerting the world to the fact that you've paid extra for real buttonholes. This practice, particularly popular among ambitious young Wall Street investment bankers, is an instant sign of clod-like naivete. *********** Monograms: A bad idea. ''Monograms are for the most affected jerks,'' snorted one partner at a prominent Wall Street law firm. ''They also suggest, at the very least, that you can't remember what the hell your name is.'' *********** Baggy trousers with narrowed ankles: Too trendy. As Mr. Fioravanti explained, ''When I see a very pegged leg with a wide knee, well, this is not attractive.'' *********** Custom-made shirts: At $150 a pop, these are perhaps the ultimate luxury in custom tailoring. A noted New York tailor, John Reyle, said: ''The custom-made shirt fits. Some of the commercial-made shirts are so blousy around the waist, it's disgusting. Brooks Brothers shirts, for example, I abhor. They must make them for a 44-inch waist.'' Most top executives, however, go through shirts like water and so tend to rely on less expensive, off-the-rack makes from Turnbull & Asser and The Custom Shop. Remember to keep the collar small and narrow. *********** Ties: Hermes or, better yet, custom-made. *********** Shoes: Again, if you can afford $2,500 for custom-made shoes, by all means do so. Serious executives used to make a trans-Atlantic trek to the London shop of the shoemaker George Cleverley, before he retired. Mr. Cleverley would cut a last for you from which he could fashion a lifetime of shoes - usually about eight pairs. In his absence, lace-up oxfords from Church's or loafers from Bally do nicely. Minimize purchases of Gucci loafers: they're starting to look very Wall Street-Hollywood. **********It all seems like a lot of fuss. Yet aficionados of power dressing claim they really spend less time on their clothes this way than if they shopped at a store. ''I'm not a fast thinker when it comes to clothes,'' explained Mr. Tisch, the president and co-chief executive of the Loews Corporation. ''With a Fioravanti suit, my wife goes with me once to pick out the fabric, I go alone for the fitting, and it's done. They know my taste, my size, and there's no pressure to buy. They also shorten my wife's skirts at the same time.'' **********But perhaps the most important reason top executives favor custom-made conservative suits is the image they convey. Supple lapels, minimum shoulder padding, high-cut arm holes and dark wools: they whisper quiet prosperity and success, and for many men that is worth any price.

Shevardnadze, the first visit by such a high-level official since the end of World War II. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is due in Japan next year. **********It was a week in which Mr. Gorbachev met with no less than three delegations from Japan, and officials here said afterward they had the impression that the Soviet leader was focusing personally on improving relations with Tokyo for perhaps the first time since taking office. **********Looking for a New Attitude **********''We have the impression that Gorbachev would like to his devote more time now to Japan-Russian relations,'' a senior Japanese official said. **********Many Japanese say they are hopeful that the Soviet Union will eventually have to adopt a more conciliatory attitude to Tokyo if it wishes to tap Japan's financing and technological expertise to improve its economy. So far, they acknowledge, this has not happened. **********In official talks in Moscow, Japan and the Soviet Union agreed to begin discussions on Tokyo's offer of technical assistance to improve the Soviet economy. Also slated are talks on improving the environment and on Japan's offer to help victims of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant accident. **********Still, Mr. Gorbachev was quoted as expressing frustration over Japan's refusal to make concessions on the territorial matter, saying that it might not be worth his visiting Japan if Tokyo kept insisting on its way. **********Moreover, Mr. Shevardnadze complained that he was ''profoundly saddened'' by recent comments from Japan's Foreign Minister, Taro Nakayama, that giving economic assistance without major changes in the Soviet economy would be like ''throwing money down the drain.'' **********''This means that our nearest neighbor has no understanding of perestroika,'' Mr. Shevardnadze was quoted as telling a delegation of politicians from Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party. **********The root of the main dispute is Japan's claim to the tiny islands off its northern coast that were seized by the Soviet Union in the final days of World War II. Moscow maintains a historical claim to the islands, but Tokyo views the Soviet move as an example of cold war ''expansionism.'' **********As cold war sentiments have lifted, Japan has fallen short of its goal of ''internationalizing'' the issue. The major industrial democracies at the Houston summit meeting in June, for instance, took note of Japan's claim but termed it a bilateral dispute, not a major international issue. **********Rejecting a Compromise **********From time to time, some Japanese commentators and politicians suggest there may be room for compromise, that the Soviet Union might be willing to give up two of the four islands and declare the whole area a demilitarized zone that could be visited freely by Japanese. **********Japanese officials always reject such suggestions. Most recently, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has said Japan could not settle for anything less than return of all the islands. Absent such a settlement, he said Tokyo would not take part in any proposed economic aid program for Moscow. **********As seen here, Mr. Gorbachev sent mixed signals on the islands this week. First, he told the Speaker of Japan's lower house of Parliament that the Soviet Union was not occupying anyone else's territory, saying with some impatience: ''I repeat again today: we do not have a territorial issue.'' **********But later he was said to have told Daisaku Ikeda, leader of a Buddhist sect known as Soka Gakkai, that ''large concessions'' would be necessary if relations were to improve. Mr. Ikeda said afterward that he understood this to be a reference to Soviet concessions in the territorial dispute. **********In the meeting with Mr. Ikeda, Mr. Gorbachev was quoted as sounding both conciliatory and perhaps wistful. ''The fact that we have no dialogue with our neighbor country Japan is not a normal situation,'' he was quoted as saying. **********Then, when told that the springtime cherry blossom season would be a good time to schedule his visit next year, the Soviet leader added: ''That is what I would like.

The name of the publication born two years ago as a newsstand test product is about to turn up in all sorts of unlikely places. **********For starters, in October Memories will become a monthly. Its rapidly growing circulation rate base will jump to 800,000 for 1991, from 600,000 this year and 450,000 in 1989. **********But it's the appearance of Memories in media other than print that is causing advertisers to take notice. For Diamandis Communications Inc., a unit of Hachette S.A. and the magazine's publisher, these multimedia deals mean, at the least, circulation-building publicity. **********For advertisers, the mainstreaming of Memories may be the ultimate in ''added value,'' as the magazine industry calls support for advertisers that transcends the printed page. **********The magazine's first venture beyond print began eight months ago with the Satellite Music Network, a division of the ABC Radio Network. Some 500 radio stations across America now play daily ''A Memories Minute,'' celebrity profiles or miniature histories ''from the pages of Memories magazine,'' as the announcer says. **********In the late fall, Doubleday will publish the ''Memories Magazine Yearbook,'' a collection of photographs of celebrities drawn from their high school annuals, packaged and produced by the magazine. And last week, the magazine concluded a deal with Polygram Records to create a Memories record label, to be applied to compilations of old songs. **********At Diamandis, executives are using the same term for Memories that baseball teams apply to a superstar in his prime. They are calling it ''the franchise.'' **********The relationship involving Memories, NBC News and LBS Communications, a syndicator of television shows, promises the most. The three companies have created a weekly television series, called ''Memories . . . Then and Now,'' which will feature yesterday-and-today footage of famous people, places and events. NBC is paying the magazine a small licensing fee, and using its own video archives to produce the show; LBS is finding the stations and selling the advertising. **********The partners expect the show, which makes its debut in the fall, to reach 85 percent of the country. Seventeen of the top 20 television markets are already covered. In New York and Los Angeles, the program will be broadcast from 7 to 7:30 on Saturday nights. **********The most unusual aspect of the venture is the effort by LBS and Diamandis to sell print and broadcast advertising jointly. A marketer committing to one commercial each week on the television show would pay $2.34 million. If the advertiser separately buys two pages each month in the magazine, it will pay $369,000. But an advertiser buying print and television together will receive a 2.5 percent reduction on the television spots for the first year. The advertiser will be guaranteed a television rate increase of no more than 5 percent for the second year, will receive a 30 percent discount on the 1990 print ad rates and no print rate increase in 1991, despite the planned growth in circulation. **********Other benefits the magazine says it can toss into the package include free commercials on ''Flashback,'' a radio series that LBS syndicates, and free commercials on the Nostalgia Channel, a cable network. What is more, because the show will include features drawn from the magazine's pages, like the yearbook photos, some advertisers will be offered coincidental print and television positioning for their ads. **********''In an environment where the word 'synergy' is overused, I believe we are offering a real opportunity to make one plus one equal three,'' said Gergory C. Coleman, the magazine's publisher. **********Last week, LBS and Memories signed their first joint advertiser: the Andrew Jergens Company, the maker of hand lotion and soaps. Dawn Sibley, the media director of Ally & Gargano, Jergens's agency, said, ''The cross of both media will give us a better result than just a scattered print and television buy.'' **********''You can use TV to seed an image and use print to go for the buy,'' she said. ''This way, we can go for both.'' Ms. Sibley said the agency was considering creatively coordinating the print and television ads."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/04/business/company-news-stock-options-at-chrysler.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-07-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 222, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Stock Options At Chrysler", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Stock Options At Chrysler", "body_text": " **********The Chrysler Corporation has granted some top managers stock options to keep their compensation packages competitive, a company spokesman said on Monday. **********The nation's No. 3 auto maker granted the options last week to about 1,800 executives. **********''People were moving on because their package was noncompetitive,'' the spokesman, Lee Sechler, said. **********Since May 1, Gerald Greenwald has quit as Chrysler's vice chairman and Michael Hammes has resigned as vice president for international operations.

But Mr. Tartikoff is a showman by every possible definition. **********The Tartikoff show is going to continue at NBC, but not as before. And if NBC does not show Mr. Tartikoff something that he wants to see, the show might not run too long. **********What Mr. Tartikoff wants to see is that NBC is serious about expanding in directions that will alter the entire concept of a network. **********Mr. Tartikoff has been president of NBC Entertainment for more than 10 years, longer than anyone else in the business. Last week, though, he announced that he was giving up day-to-day control of NBC's programming department and becoming chairman of a newly created entity, the NBC Entertainment Group. **********Several NBC executives described the move not as the end of an era at the network, but rather as a shifting of priorities. The succession of Warren Littlefield, Mr. Tartikoff's chief programming lieutenant, as entertainment president assures a smooth transition, the NBC executives said. **********But it will still be a transition, and that has inescapable implications for NBC. Mr. Tartikoff has been the most successful television executive in a generation, leading a department that climbed from laughingstock to television supremacy, pulling in up to $500 million a year in profits. **********He has been closely associated with NBC's hits over the last decade, from ''Cheers'' and ''Hill Street Blues'' to ''Cosby'' and ''Golden Girls.'' **********But those shows have made their creators and studio owners far more money from syndication profits than Mr. Tartikoff or NBC earned from selling the commercial time in them. Now, Mr. Tartikoff said, with the economics of television in upheaval, it is possible for such hits to become ''loss leaders'' for a network while they continue to make their owners rich. **********As he see it, there is a need for a a new form of television network, resembling a large Hollywood studio. **********The word studio is much on Mr. Tartikoff's lips these days. The new opportunity he most wants is to run a movie studio that NBC's parent company, the General Electric Company, would buy for him. **********The network put in a determined effort to keep Mr. Tartikoff, who said he had communicated for seven months his ''diminished interest'' in several aspects of the programming job. Mr. Tartikoff has frequently been wooed by studios, most recently this last March when he declined a feeler to take over the troubled Orion studio. **********Mr. Tartikoff called a studio a ''big toy to play with.'' He does not necessarily expect G.E. to run out and buy him one. But, he said, ''I don't rule it out either.'' He has told associates that he would like to see NBC move to buy a studio by January, especially if the networks win a ruling in December from the Federal Communications Commission authorizing them to take some profits from programs sold into syndication. **********As long as the networks are excluded from those profits, owning a studio makes less sense. But Mr. Tartikoff believes that such a move is necessary - both for NBC and his own personal growth. **********A small studio, he said, could provide the network with the packaging, experience and distribution to make middle-budget movies, those costing $12 million to $14 million. **********But, he added, he can see NBC moving to a higher level by taking advantage of its assets, including its large news and sports staffs and the production abilities of its local stations. **********Even if the studio does not work out right away, Mr. Tartikoff sees other ''sparkling opportunities.'' He has ideas for working inside NBC in a separate production unit, spinning out international co-productions and other creative programming deals. **********The arrangement calls for Mr. Tartikoff to explore these areas, while maintaining ultimate authority over his previous empire, the NBC programming division. **********But Mr. Littlefield says he will be running NBC Entertainment, using Mr. Tartikoff as a consultant. **********Mr. Littlefield participated in developing virtually every NBC show now on the air and is respected in Hollywood for his programming talent, if not his rap singing. **********In an interview last week, Mr. Littlefield acknowledged, ''Brandon casts a very large shadow.'' **********So despite the carefully muted talk of the end of the Tartikoff era in network programming, the evidence is growing that the shadow has moved on to a position in front of a different set of spotlights."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/29/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-japan-putting-limits-on-aid-to-nations-hurt-by-embargo.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1990-08-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 654, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Confrontation in the Gulf;   Japan Putting Limits on Aid To Nations Hurt by Embargo", "print_headline": "Confrontation in the Gulf;   Japan Putting Limits on Aid To Nations Hurt by Embargo", "body_text": " **********Japanese officials attached new conditions today to the financial aid pledge Japan made last week to help Middle Eastern countries hurt by the trade embargo on Iraq. **********The shift is likely to slow the rate at which the support is delivered and make it contingent on contributions from other countries, principally the United States. **********''Japan should make a significant contribution in this field, but there is a limit to what any one country can do,'' a senior Finance Ministry official said at a briefing here today for foreign reporters. **********''An international network of support might be necessary,'' said the official, who insisted that he not be identified. **********He said that meant that Japan would try not to act on its own, but would seek to be part of an aid consortium that would include the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the United States and other industrial nations. **********No 'Cash Dispenser Machine' **********The comments marked a change in tone from last week, when Government officials said Japan was preparing to move swiftly to offer the equivalent of billions of dollars in financial support to nations that were taking part in the embargo on Iraq and were suffering economically because of it. Principally, the Government was focusing on Jordan, Egypt and Turkey, neighbors of Iraq and Kuwait. **********The remarks thus appeared to be an attempt to temper global expectations about how much Japan would contribute and the terms under which it would make loans, grants or other forms of aid available. Japan has initiated programs to help recycle the vast trade surpluses achieved in recent years, but it has fought against developing an image as a ''cash dispenser machine'' for aid, as one official here put it. **********Japan's Constitution restricts its use of military forces in international disputes, and the Government has been engaged in a fierce internal debate over how it can directly take part in the embargo without changing the law or jeopardizing political support at home. **********A number of officials had seized on financial aid to the ailing Middle Eastern countries as a form of support not restricted under the law, but which would mark a positive Japanese contribution. Those officials had said that a package of low-interest loans and other forms of aid would be announced shortly to demonstrate Japan's commitment. **********Scaling Back Expectations **********On Wednesday, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu is expected to disclose his long-awaited package of measures for bolstering the multinational forces opposing Iraq. But a number of officials have said it would be just a preliminary step, and would include little of the financial aid pledged earlier. **********Press reports here have said the other measures are expected to be: sending medical personnel to the Persian Gulf region, refugee aid and transportation equipment, perhaps chartered jets and ships. The second part of the package, the financial measures, is now expected to be incomplete and contingent on talks with other countries. **********Japan is more dependent on Middle Eastern oil than any other industrialized nation, getting slightly more than 70 percent of its crude from the region. Shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait, Japan froze the assets of the two countries and decided to join the trade embargo. Getting beyond those initial steps has proven difficult. **********The note of caution sounded by the Finance Ministry official today irritated some in the Foreign Ministry, who had hoped for a quicker and more decisive response to promote Japan's image as a leading player in international issues. **********''If we miss this wave, the wave will be gone,'' said a Foreign Ministry official, who backed a swifter commitment by the Government.

G. Monks has a resume that might endear him to any corporate board: a Harvard-educated lawyer who made his fortune as an industrialist; former chairman of a leading Boston investment firm; two-time Republican candidate for the United States Senate in Maine. And, he held top positions in the Reagan Administration. **********In this case, appearances are deceiving. Mr. Monks is the scourge of many executive suites for his outspoken - and influential - views on corporate proxy battles. From a Georgetown office, Mr. Monks, 56 years old, heads a consulting business that for a fee advises more than 100 institutions, including the mammoth employee pension funds of New York City and California, on how to vote their proxies. And he has been a behind-the-scenes player in recent proxy contests, with victories at the Lockheed Corporation and Honeywell Inc. **********For Mr. Monks, shareholder activism is a calling and he minces no words on its behalf. ''American chief executives are close to becoming the absolute monarchs that we saw in the 18th century,'' he said in an interview. ''Managements of large American corporations are only accountable to themselves. The words I use may be of governance and process, but what is really being said in a masculine, emotional way relates to power. In a psychological sense, it's like I'm gelding these guys.'' **********First-Hand Knowledge **********What sets Mr. Monks apart from other proxy advisers is that he used to run companies himself. Nor does it hurt that he has enough wealth to pursue his interests. He took over a family coal and oil business that was eventually split and sold in 1972. He successfully speculated in oil during the energy squeeze in the mid-1970's and was chairman of the Boston Company, an investment firm, until it was taken over by American Express. **********And while he has attacked corporate boards, he has sat on a few himself - not without criticism over possible conflicts of interest. Because of such questions, he recently decided to leave the board of Jefferies & Company, the Los Angeles brokerage that has advised corporate raiders. But he still holds paid advisory positions at Lambert Brussels Associates, which held a 33 percent stake in Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and is an adviser to the American unit of Mitsubishi of Japan, though he says he may terminate these relationships. **********He approaches corporate governance with a born-again fervor, gained during his years of Government service. He came to Washington in 1981 as a director of the ill-fated Synthetic Fuels Corporation and became, in 1984, head of the Labor Department's pension and welfare benefits program. Soon, he began to exhort pension fund managers to flex their power over intransigent corporate managers. **********''I got the idea that stock ownership was a responsibility,'' he said. ''Before, I just wanted to trade.'' **********His 1984 speech ''The Institutional Investor as a Corporate Citizen'' set Labor Department policy that has encouraged proxy activism by pension funds and is considered a seminal work by shareholder activists. After leaving Government, he began, like a well-heeled Paul Revere, to travel the country, meeting pension-fund managers and spreading his views. **********Passion Into Business **********A passion turned into a business, and Mr. Monks's vehicle was Institutional Shareholders Services, a company he founded to analyze proxy questions and make recommendations - for a $10,000 annual base fee. His timing was right. Institutional funds were growing, and few had the in-house expertise, or willingness, to analyze complicated proxies, which meant that they often automatically sided with management. And, senior Labor Department officials had begun to put pressure on large institutions, which own nearly half of all corporate equities, to consider voting their proxies as a fiduciary duty. **********''One of the major criticisms of institutional investors is that they own stocks but don't know enough about the companies they own to make an informed proxy vote,'' said John Wilcox, a managing director at Georgeson & Company, a New York proxy solicitor. ''It's a perfect situation for them to seek assistance, and Bob Monks has taken advantage of that.'' **********In running his business, Mr. Monks has walked a tightrope - between conflicts in his business activities and between promoting his own ideas and the interest of his clients. **********Eyebrows were raised when Mr. Monks served as an unpaid adviser to the Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons, who led a proxy battle for control of Lockheed. Mr. Monks took pains to disclose that relationship because his firm was recommending that institutions side with Mr. Simmons. But Mr. Monks did not make similar efforts to disclose that he was a director at Jefferies, which was advising Mr. Simmons. Mr. Monks has since left the Jefferies board but still holds an equity stake in that firm. (His one remaining corporate directorship, is at Tyco Laboratories, a New Hampshire concern,) Others are concerned that Mr. Monks's zealousness for shareholder rights makes him recommend proxy-contest positions that are sometimes not in his clients' economic interests. Lilli A. Gordon, a managing director of the Analysis Group, a rival consulting firm based in Boston, pointed to the recent proxy bid by Torchmark, an insurance company with steller earnings, for American General, an insurance company with a weak stock performance. Mr. Monks recommended that his institutional clients oppose Torchmark because it has anti-takeover provisions in its own bylaws. **********''When he gives advice that could potentially decrease value for the shareholders, he's ultimately not serving his clients,'' Ms. Gordon said. **********To Mr. Monks, however, corporate governance leads to superior corporate performance. ''I'm not interested in having the world's most successful consulting firm, but in promoting my own agenda,'' he said. **********So far, that agenda has led to major shareholder victories at Honeywell and at Lockheed. In both cases, he was instrumental in connecting with a well-known investor willing to foot the bill to wage a proxy battle -which can cost between $1 million and $5 million. **********The 1989 Honeywell battle grew out of conversations Mr. Monks had with the Texas investor Richard E. Rainwater, once a financial adviser to the Bass brothers of Texas. Mr. Rainwater and other Texas investors owned 4.4 percent of Honeywell. Mr. Rainwater's group was unhappy with the company's stock performance and upset that Honeywell was asking shareholders to approve two anti-takeover measures. **********If Mr. Rainwater's group would lead the proxy battle, Mr. Monks would rally the pension funds. After a one-week blitz, their side won. The effort was remarkable because the group worked without a complete list of Honeywell shareholders. They bypassed small shareholders and relied almost exclusively on institutional votes. ''This said institutions could ignore all other shareholders and still block management initiatives,'' said Mr. Wilcox, the proxy solicitor. **********Another deep pocket for Mr. Monks was Mr. Simmons, chairman of NL Industries, who was willing to spend $11 million to take on Lockheed, in which NL had a $500 million stake. Even though Mr. Simmons did not succeed in ousting Lockheed's board, the company agreed to add three shareholders' representatives to its board and enacted three shareholder-rights measures that Mr. Simmons had proposed - overturning Lockheed's ''poison pill,'' opting out of anti-takeover protections provided by incorporation in Delaware, and confidential proxy votes. **********New Plans Afoot **********With these victories, Mr. Monks is plotting again. He wants to oppose management initiatives to issue ''sweetheart'' stock to thwart takeovers. He also wants corporations to create shareholders' advisory committees for their boards and opt out of Delaware's anti-takeover protection, if incorporated there. **********In the current USX Corporation proxy battle, he has sided with the investor Carl C. Icahn, who wants to split the company. **********Not all his clients follow his bidding, however. Paul Quirk, head of the Massachusetts Public Reserves Investment Management Board, said Mr. Monks's views are ''very refreshing'' but not always followed by his group. And Robert C. Pozen, general counsel at Fidelity Investments, terms Mr. Monks's opinions ''useful, but one of many views.'' **********Still, Mr. Monks thinks he's working on their behalf. ''It's difficult for many of my clients to take a high-visibility position,'' he said. ''I'm saying that I'll be the lightning rod.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/03/world/polls-in-peru-show-a-tight-race-shaping-up.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1990-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 578, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Polls in Peru Show a Tight Race Shaping Up", "print_headline": "Polls in Peru Show a Tight Race Shaping Up", "body_text": " **********Peru's presidential race nears the runoff vote on June 10 with a near-tie in the polls between the two candidates: Mario Vargas Llosa, the novelist, and Alberto Fujimori, an agricultural engineer. **********The race may tip decisively on Sunday night as Peruvians watch the only scheduled television debate between the candidates. **********Because of a slow vote count from the first-round election, the national election board in mid-May moved the date from June 3 to June 10. **********The debate may favor Mr. Vargas Llosa, a free-market advocate, who enjoys a slight lead in the polls in Lima, home to one-third of Peru's 22 million people.

Lang know him as the New York philanthropist who struck an imaginative deal with a class of Harlem sixth graders: If they finished high school, he would pay their college expenses. The idea, which has been widely copied, brought Mr. Lang national celebrity. **********Mr. Lang's for-profit company, the Refac Technology Development Corporation, is far less famous, and is drawing far less favorable reviews from some quarters. Based in New York City, Refac promotes itself as a ''white knight'' for small-time inventors who lack the resources to fight their own legal battles. But critics - and there are many - angrily charge that the company makes millions of dollars through ''patent blackmail'' and the cheeky manipulation of weaknesses in the legal system. **********What has prompted their outrage is Refac's use of patent infringement suits; it has filed against 2,000 companies so far and has threatened to file against more than 1,000 others. Among the targets are manufacturers like International Business Machines and Eastman Kodak; retailers like R.H. Macy, Sears and Radio Shack, and scores of small importers and distributors. Critics say Refac is, in effect, practicing a form of litigation extortion. They charge that the company merely acquires obscure patents that have little real value and do not hold up in court and uses them as weapons to create enough fear and and confusion to force settlements. **********''They are trying to live off industry by using fear and intimidation. It's a disgrace of the legal system,'' said Bernard E. Appel, president of the Tandy Corporation's Radio Shack retail chain, which Refac has sued more than once. Surjit P. Soni, a lawyer for electronics importers in Pasadena, Calif., who recently succeeded in getting a Refac suit thrown out of court, said: ''I believe this has been a scheme from day one, a concerted plan to extort money through the abuse of the legal system.'' **********Not true, responded Mr. Lang. ''We prefer not to litigate,'' he said. ''Our interest has always been in representing small companies or individuals who do not have the experience or expertise to represent their own interests effectively. Philosophically, my basic interest has always been to represent the little guy. I am a little guy myself.'' **********If the volume of Refac's activity seems audacious, the scope of its technological claims is truly breathtaking. Among other things, it claims ''basic'' patents in the following: *********** Liquid crystal displays, for virtually any digital readout found in a watch, electronic calculator, consumer appliance or automobile dashboard. *********** Automated teller machines, present at bank branches around the country. *********** Credit card verification systems, like those used by retailers to automatically check Mastercard and Visa numbers. *********** Bar code scanning systems, such as those used in stores and factories to read price tags and shipping labels. *********** Videocassette recorders, audiocassette tape players and camcorders. Refac says its patent covers the method of threading tape used by all manufacturers. *********** Electronic keyboards. Refac is demanding royalties from every major manufacturer of electric pianos and organs. *********** Spreadsheet software. In its biggest splash yet, Refac filed suit during the summer against five top companies in the $700 million to $800 million market, including the Lotus Development Corporation, over its Lotus 1-2-3 program. **********Refac's philosophy has paid off handsomely. The company's revenues, mostly from royalties, have surged from $3.2 million in 1985 to $10.2 million in the first nine months of last year, and Refac enjoys a robust, 25 percent after-tax profit margin. If its current claims prove even marginally successful, moreover, these sums will be just pocket change. **********Yet the most striking feature of Refac's performance is the contrast between its success in obtaining royalties and its failure to win court cases. The company has not won any lawsuits, although it has benefited hugely from fundamental laser patents obtained and defended in litigation by the laser pioneer Gordon Gould. Several Refac cases have been thrown out of court on summary judgment, often amid scathing criticism by Federal judges of Refac's tactics. **********But even Refac's angriest detractors agree that it is simply the most aggressive example of a much larger trend. Court awards in patent suits have been skyrocketing since the early 1980's, as a new Federal appeals court has begun enforcing patent claims much more rigorously. **********The courts have also allowed juries to handle more decisions, and many have proven eager to side with inventors against large companies. The upshot is what one expert calls a ''judicial lottery,'' an often unpredictable system that can yield huge rewards for those who are sufficiently aggressive. An important indicator of the lucrative new opportunities, however, is that high-powered patent law firms are now agreeing to gamble with millions of dollars worth of their time by representing lone inventors on a contingency-fee basis. Until recently, most refused to do that, because the cases are so time-consuming and the prospects so uncertain. **********That is changing. In November, for example, an independent inventor in Princeton, N.J., Jerome Lemelson, won an award of $25 million after fighting a 12-year case against Mattel Inc. over its line of Hot Wheels toys. **********This month, an even bigger case, not related to Refac, is being tried in Detroit. The seemingly improbable suit, brought in 1978 by Robert Kearns, an independent inventor, against the Ford Motor Company, claims rights to the intermittent windshield wiper and could, if successful, cost automobile makers as much as $1 billion in royalties. The battle is being waged on a contingency basis by one of the most respected patent firms in the country, Houston-based Arnold, White & Durkee. **********Refac was founded in 1952 by Mr. Lang, and for most of its years was a fairly quiet licensing company that achieved modest success by skillful negotiation. Typically, Refac acquired a patent in exchange for assuming the burden of negotiating for royalties or, if need be, litigating. In most cases, the company then split the profits from any license fees with the inventors. In almost all cases, said Mr. Lang, Refac owns the technology and acts as a principal, not as an agent for the inventor. **********Even today, Mr. Lang said, there are some technologies that do not require litigation on Refac's part. Still, the most lucrative of those account for less than 15 percent of Refac's revenues. **********The moving force behind Refac's legal strategy was Philip Sperber, who, until his death in a Dec. 13 automobile accident, was the company's vice president and lead litigator. A strong believer in litigating as a negotiating tool, he was instrumental in transforming Refac from a mere licensing company to a litigation factory. **********Mr. Sperber developed a basic strategy of suing great numbers of companies at one time, and not only the manufacturers alleged to be infringing, but distributors, retailers and customers as well. **********Refac's aggressiveness has sometimes gotten it in trouble. When the company pressed claims against makers of automated teller machines, United States District Judge Nicholas Politan in New Jersey dismissed the case as frivolous and lectured Refac on its tactics, saying Refac had ''unnecessarily contacted and harassed'' customers of Diebold Inc. **********Suing retailers and customers is perfectly legal, however, and Mr. Lang defended the practice as the only way to identify the manufacturers. ''How are we going to reach the manufacturers if they're in Hong Kong?'' he asked. **********But lawyers for retailers and customers charged that Refac was exploiting the fact that such companies are simply more likely to settle because they have less stake in the issue. ''It's patent blackmail,'' added Harold Wegner, a Washington lawyer whose firm has defended numerous small companies. ''Refac coerces manufacturers to settle for high license fees, because if they don't, the retailers and distributors will go to their competitors.'' **********Despite its track record in court, Refac hasn't stopped seeking royalties or threatening new lawsuits. In October, the company notified some former defendants in California that it was offering a 50 percent discount from Refac's normal royalty rates while it appealed. **********In the meantime, Refac reminded them by letter, ''you may be at risk'' of suits in other jurisdictions ''regardless of what happens on appeal in this case.'' **********HELPFUL HINTS FOR LITIGATORS **********The man most responsible for transforming Refac from a licensing company to a litigation factory is Philip Sperber, who was vice president and lead litigator until his death in an automobile accident last month. Mr. Sperber often wrote about licensing, and was forthright about his fondness for suing. **********''While no one can replace him,'' Eugene M. Lang, the president of Refac, said of Mr. Sperber, ''we are in a position, happily enough, to pick up the pieces.'' **********The following examples of Mr. Sperber's thinking have appeared in Les Nouvelles, the journal of the Licensing Executive Society: **********On the cost of litigation: ''It only makes sense to view the cost of litigation as bargaining leverage to force a settlement on terms favorable to the party that can litigate the matter to death without worrying about the cash flow.'' **********On jury trials over arbitration: ''If patent validity or infringement is questionable, why take a chance with an arbitration expert who will know exactly how weak the patent is and how dubious infringement is? It makes sense to take one's chances with a judge inexperienced in the technical and legal aspects involved. If the infringer is much bigger than the patentee or an entire industry has copied the patent, a jury trial would be much more beneficial than arbitration because of the sympathy and deep-pocket doctrine that can be played to the hilt.'' **********On suing retailers and customers as well as manufacturers: '' . . . Retailers and users sued for patent infringement frequently establish a policy of buying only from suppliers licensed by the patent holder. This results in manufacturers, importers and foreign exporters voluntarily asking for a license. This industrywide litigation strategy also has a synergistic effect that encourages settlement on the part of infringers.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/21/business/finance-new-issues-pemex-re-enters-us-debt-market.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 158, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Pemex Re-enters U.S. Debt Market", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;   Pemex Re-enters U.S. Debt Market", "body_text": " **********After an absence of about eight years, Petroleos Mexicanos, also known as Pemex, the Mexican national oil company and one of the world's largest industrial companies, has returned to the American private placement market with a $100 million note issue. **********Paine Webber Inc.'s private placement group said yesterday that it had received commitments for the 11.43 percent senior notes due in 1995 to be issued by the oil company.

But in a slight shift of focus in Washington's efforts to open Japan's financial markets, it added that some of the worst impediments faced by foreign firms were informal barriers, or unwritten business and government practices. **********An example of this sort of barrier has cropped up recently in what is becoming one of the most closely watched confrontations between an American securities house and Japanese ways in years. **********Salomon Brothers Inc. appeared to have staged a coup recently in breaking the lock grip that big Japanese brokerage houses have on underwriting the yen securities of Japanese companies. It won the mandate to be the lead manager on two big offerings of convertible bonds in the Euromarkets for Oji Paper and Fujisawa Pharmaceutical.  'Like Exporting AIDS' **********But just 10 days later, Japan's biggest broker, Nomura Securities, protested vehemently against what it described as the unsound way Salomon planned to trade the bonds after they were issued, a complex technique that is common in the more innovative New York markets. The yen-denominated securities were going to be swapped into dollars, combined with options and sold to American insurance companies as private placements instead of publicly listed securities. **********\"It's like exporting AIDS from Wall Street,\" Tadashi Takubo, an executive managing director at Nomura, was quoted as saying in the Japan Economic Journal, the country's leading business newspaper. \"We have to protect the soundness of the Tokyo market from the U.S. threat.\" **********Asked about the story, Fujisawa Pharmaceutical said yesterday that it had not decided who would underwrite its convertible bonds and Oji Paper said it would neither confirm nor deny the reports. **********But Salomon officials insisted the Big Four securities houses had intimidated the companies into backing away from using an American lead underwriter, in spite of the better terms Salomon was offering.  Importance of Cultural Factors **********\"We offer good technology and some good market opportunities, but how a Japanese company comes to a decision on its underwriter is the critical question at the end of the day,\" said Kunihiko Kumagai, a managing director at Salomon Brothers. \"The cultural, or invisible factors can be the most important part of doing business.\" **********He added, \"We need to learn a lot more about how to persuade a Japanese company.\" **********Earlier this year, Salomon sailed into another controversy when it stunned the Big Four by underwriting some dollar-denominated bonds for Mitsui Toatsu, a big chemical company. Shortly afterward the Japanese newspapers were filled with complaints from the big Japanese brokerage houses on how Salomon's program trading was behind a steep slide in share prices. **********The report issued today is a so-called national treatment study, intended to determine whether American financial institutions are permitted to compete on an equal footing with Japan's own banks and securities firms within Japan. The latest report, the fourth in the last decade, repeats the conclusion that Japan still restricts the operating ability of foreign bankers and investment bankers. **********According to Treasury estimates, foreign banks have actually been losing ground here. **********Foreign banks' share of total lending has tumbled from 3.5 percent in March 1983 to 1.7 percent at the end of last year. By contrast, Japanese banks have taken more than 25 percent of the lucrative California banking market. **********No Japanese bank has been acquired by a foreign bank and foreign banks must pay much higher rates to borrow yen and acquire funds to operate in Japan, the report says. **********Specifically, the Treasury contends that despite several important openings since 1986, keiretsu, or big groupings of industrial companies and banks, exclude foreign banks. Relatively inexpensive short-term loans from the Bank of Japan are difficult for foreigners to obtain. Japan's short-term money markets remain underdeveloped. And many regulations continue to be delivered orally or in ways that are difficult for foreign banks to obtain and cary out. **********On the securities side, the report argues that foreign firms are still excluded from the underwriting business. They are still not free to trade in foreign currencies. New financial products are accepted here only after substantial delays.

But critics ranging from free-market economists to doctrinaire Communist leaders fear that the plan's high-voltage jolt can cause the rusting, brittle economy to explode before it heaves forward. **********No one denies that Poland's pioneering program to move toward capitalism, which includes painful steps like removing price controls and ending most subsidies to consumers and industry, is fraught with risks. The biggest risk is that the plan's painful results, including a spike of inflation, high unemployment and numerous bankruptcies, will provoke a wave of strikes or other unrest that can drag the economy further into the mud. **********Fears of such unrest did not diminish in January, when prices rose about 70 percent, far above the 45 percent forecast by the Government. At the same time, the purchasing power of an average family plunged an estimated 30 percent in January alone, because of strict wage controls. The Government had predicted that its shock program, which began on Jan. 1, would push down family incomes 20 percent over several months. **********Desire for Capitalism **********For critics of the plan, many of whom share a desire to transform Poland into a capitalist economy, January's unhappy statistics bear out their fears that reformers tried to do too much too quickly. The critics argue that prices will rise more, and purchasing power will fall faster, than the Government predicted. In their view, the Polish economy was too rigid to adapt as quickly as the Government had hoped. **********The critics said, for example, that the Government was too optimistic about inflation because, in their view, it paid too little attention to monopolies. Single enterprises have controlled many industries here for 40 years, and many of those companies raised prices substantially after price controls were lifted and they were told they must become self-supporting in the new ''sink or swim'' era. **********''Any well-trained economist knows that if you apply market mechanisms to an economy with no market infrastructure, you're not going to be able to achieve what you want,'' said Jan Vanous, research director of PlanEcon, a Washington-based consulting group that monitors Eastern Europe. ''It could be an utter disaster.'' **********Possible Social Unrest **********One thing on which the plan's architects and critics agree is that there may be social unrest if inflation continues to rage in February and wages remain far behind. The fear is that there could be dozens of strikes instead of the half dozen that took place in January. **********Nonetheless, Government officials defend their plan, saying a ''big bang'' was the only way to awaken Poland's prostrate economy and bring down the inflation rate, which was more than 500 percent last year. These officials say it is better to take very bitter medicine for a short time, in the hope of regaining economic health, than to suffer severely for a long time with no hope of a cure. **********Polish officials point to some evidence that the plan is starting to work. Prices rose more slowly at the end of January than at the beginning of the month. They note that the price of milk, meat and some other items even fell after rising steeply. **********Success on Currency **********What is more, the Government's efforts to create a convertible currency appear successful. Finance Ministry officials are pleasantly surprised that the zloty's official exchange rate remains stronger than the black-market rate. A stable currency helps bring down expectations of inflation. The Government hopes that after the January burst of price increases, inflation will fall to a monthly rate of 4 percent or less this spring, and the economy will start to grow again after a decade of stagnation. **********Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz insists that the plan is the best one for Poland. ''A gradual program can work when you have minor inflation,'' he said. ''I would prefer a gradual approach if I knew it would work. But if you want to get rid of hyperinflation, you have to accept a crash program.'' **********The biggest test of the Balcerowicz plan will be getting inflation under control as soon as possible. The plan limits monthly wage increases to 30 percent of inflation, which aims to check inflationary pressures and help shell-shocked companies stay in business. In January, prices jumped 70 percent and wages rose 21 percent, meaning a 30 percent loss in purchasing power. If inflation remains strong in February, the wage controls could mean a cumulative drop in purchasing power of 40 or 50 percent. **********In January, the Government conceded modest wage increases to striking coal miners, but did so in a low-key way. In addition, after farmers protested that they were being driven out of business, the Government quietly increased subsidies to buy tractors. **********Some economists say a wiser approach for Eastern European nations moving away from Communism would be to take a series of preliminary steps to increase competition before lifting price controls. That is the path Czechoslovakia has chosen. **********Although there is disagreement about prices, everyone agrees that removing price controls is essential to encourage companies to produce more and to give them a true measure of profitability and efficiency. **********Timing Mistake **********''The mistake is to begin price reforms with a monopolistic structure,'' said Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus of Czechoslovakia. **********Czechoslovak officials say that before lifting price controls, they want to break up monopolies and encourage start-up businesses. In Poland, a tight credit policy is intended to squeeze out inflation. **********In addition, Czechoslovak officials say they want to allow more imports, to increase competition from abroad, before freeing prices. To help preserve hard currency and prevent domestic bankruptcies, the Polish Government has imposed high duties on imported cars and electronic products. **********Mr. Balcerowicz, the Finance Minister, admits that Poland's plan has some imperfections. But he has repeatedly said that Poland's economy was disintegrating too quickly for the Government to have the luxury of taking months to hammer out an ideal program. In his view, the problem of hyperinflation was paramount, and Poland could not devote a year or two to gradual competition-creating policies before lifting price controls. **********''No one has ever stopped hyperinflation with a gradual approach,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/07/business/company-news-sharp-s-color-fax.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-03-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Sharp's Color Fax", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Sharp's Color Fax", "body_text": " **********The Sharp Corporation of Japan said it had developed a desktop facsimile machine that can transmit photograph-like full-color images.

Kodak was the second-most-active issue on the Big Board, with 2.7 million shares traded, and Polaroid was the sixth-most-active, as nearly 2 million shares changed hands. $909.4 Million Award The decline in the stock price was largely attributed to Polaroid's experiences in court. On Friday, after the market had closed, it was announced that Judge David Mazzone had awarded Polaroid $909.4 million, but that was about $600 million less than Wall Street had expected. **********The key to the ruling was Polaroid's failure to convince Judge Mazzone that Kodak had intentionally and willfully trampled on Polaroid's instant photography patents. Many analysts expect Polaroid to appeal the ruling. **********The earnings reported yesterday by Polaroid were helped by a sharp 27 percent increase in overseas sales and lower taxes. However, some of the foreign increase was attributable to the decline of the dollar, which increases the value of overseas sales. **********Domestic Sales Decline **********Offsetting the unexpected good international news was Polaroid's report that domestic sales had declined 6 percent from a year earlier. That marked the fifth consecutive quarter of decline. In addition, operating margins have continued their slide from a peak of 18.9 percent in the second three months of 1989, to 12.9 percent in the recently completed quarter. **********I. MacAllister Booth, president and chief executive of Polaroid, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., said yesterday that the earnings reflected heavy investments in marketing and new product development to make the company more competitive. But he also warned that the investment needs and the weak business climate in the United States might lead to further earnings disappointments. **********With the damage award out of the way, analysts are once again focusing on Polaroid's sales and earnings. And some are skeptical. **********''It's hard to figure out what they can do to really turn around earnings in the long run,'' said B.

W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela, the deputy president of the African National Congress, announced that the meeting would go ahead. The congress consented after Mr. de Klerk told Mr. Mandela that he would ask his Cabinet to approve an independent judicial inquiry into the deaths in Sebokeng. **********The announcement of the agreed date was withheld until today because Mr. Mandela said approval was needed from the African National Congress's national executive committee, which remains in exile in Zambia. **********The congress said previously that at the meeting it planned to press its demands that the national state of emergency be lifted, that an unconditional amnesty be extended to all political prisoners and exiles and that political trials end.

Mr. Tshwete, who sits on the group's national executive committee, said Mr. Mandela would brief it on his meeting with Mr. de Klerk and his visit earlier this week to townships in Natal that have been caught in fighting between rival black factions. **********Tonight, Mr. Mandela was scheduled to meet with a delegation from the Azanian People's Organization, a black consciousness movement, in what he indicated earlier was an effort by the African National Congress to build alliances with rival black organizations. **********''We are considering the question of pooling our resources with all anti-apartheid forces,'' Mr. Mandela said Thursday. The Azanian People's Organization has refused to join the negotiations proposed by Mr. de Klerk, that are intended to lead to a new constitution for South Africa giving political rights to the black majority. **********Mandela to Move to Mansion **********The African National Congress also announced today that Mr. Mandela would immediately move into the 15-room mansion in Soweto that his wife, Winnie, had built for him while he was in prison. A statement issued from Lusaka by Alfred Nzo, the organization's general secretary, said the decision was based on Mr. Mandela's personal requirements and his obligations to the congress. **********The mansion reportedly cost 500,000 rand, or about $200,000, to build.

In the two months since his release from prison, he has received journalists and other visitors in his front yard or cramped living room. **********The poor security of the house, with Mr. Mandela's bedroom visible from the street, is believed to have motivated the decision to move into the new two-story house, which sits behind a high wall."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/24/business/briefs-217990.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 286, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur, which holds a 13.3 percent stake in Global Marine Inc., Houston, an offshore drilling company, said it might sell its 13.46 million common shares. *********** Digital Microwave Corp., San Jose, Calif., lost half its value yesterday, falling $13.875 a share, to $14,125 in over-the-counter trading.

EASING CURBS AS CHINA DECLARES MARTIAL LAW OVER", "body_text": " **********China lifted martial law in Beijing today, and within hours the United States announced that it was easing its blanket opposition to World Bank loans to China. **********Prime Minister Li Peng, who announced the lifting of martial law in a nationally televised speech, warned against unspecified foreign and domestic ''hostile forces'' that he said were working to subvert Communism in China. But he said that by and large, China had returned to normal. **********Despite the official end of martial law, the Chinese authorities retain the ability and apparently a desire to suppress any signs of political unrest, experts on China said. [An article and excerpts from Mr. Li's speech are on page A10.]  Administration's China Policy Vice President Dan Quayle said the lifting of martial law vindicated Mr. Bush's efforts to re-establish normal diplomatic ties with China. But experts on China challenged the Administration's assertion that Mr. Bush's policy had helped persuade China to lift martial law. **********The Chinese action did not quell Congressional anger over the crackdown, in which hundreds of Chinese civilians were killed. Nor did it seem likely to mute Congressional criticism of President Bush's policy, which many lawmakers consider excessively sympathetic to the Chinese leadership. **********The White House and the State Department praised China's decision to lift martial law as ''a positive step.'' Neither publicly acknowledged that strict laws banning dissent remained in force in China. **********The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said that in ''a partial change of policy'' the United States would examine loans on a case-by-case basis. **********Support for 'Human-Needs Loans' **********Proposals for seven loans totaling $780 million have been held at the World Bank since the beginning of the crackdown in June. **********Mr. Bush does not want economic sanctions to ''hurt the Chinese people,'' Miss Tutwiler said.  ''Our view is that basic human-needs loans - for instance, earthquake relief - should be permitted periodically to go forward,'' she said. **********Miss Tutwiler said the United States' revised position had been under consideration for months and was ''not connected'' to the end of martial law. The timing, she said, ''is sheerly, honestly coincidence.'' **********Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said the lifting of martial law was ''an empty gesture.'' **********''Beijing can lift martial law because it does not need martial law to crush dissent,'' she said, noting that China had adopted a series of measures outlawing anti-Government demonstrations and authorizing security forces to stop protests. **********Mrs. Pelosi is the author of a bill that would prohibit the United States from sending Chinese students back to China. Mr. Bush vetoed it on Nov. 30. Congress is likely to override the veto soon after it reconvenes on Jan. 23. Congress is also likely to approve a package of economic and military sanctions banning arms sales to China and suspending Federal insurance for private investments in the country. **********Quayle Sees Policy 'Dividends' **********Martial law was imposed in parts of Beijing on May 20, after more than a million people filled the streets of the capital to support demands for greater democracy. **********Sweeping restrictions were imposed, including total bans on rumor-mongering, boycotts of classes, petitions, meetings and anything else that was deemed threatening to what Beijing called ''the normal order.'' **********After the June 3-4 military crackdown on the democracy movement, the Government banned all dissident organizations and gave the police the right to shoot demonstrators. Thousands of arrests and scores of executions followed. **********It is not clear if China made a commitment to lift martial law when Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, visited Beijing last month. **********Mr. Quayle said today that the lifting of martial law illustrated the ''dividends from the President's policy toward China.'' A White House spokesman, Roman Popadiuk, said the Administration would like to think that the trips to China by Mr. Scowcroft, in July and December, ''played a part'' in China's decision to lift martial law. **********Repression Said to Continue **********But outside experts expressed doubt. A professor of Chinese history at Boston University, Merle Goldman, said ''the Chinese have been suffering economically'' and need financial assistance from the World Bank. **********''The lifting of martial law is essentially a cosmetic or symbolic gesture to show that things are back to normal and to impress the outside world,'' she said in a telephone interview. **********If China released student leaders, intellectuals and workers imprisoned in the crackdown on the demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, that would provide tangible evidence of political liberalization in China, Mrs. Goldman said. **********Senator Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the lifting of martial law was ''a small step in the right direction.'' **********But Mr. Pell, a Rhode Island Democrat, said, ''It does not change the fundamental circumstance of repression in China or the many serious issues that remain - human rights and freedom for arrested students and workers, human rights and an end to martial law in Tibet, and a halt to Chinese arms for Pol Pot and the murderous Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.'' **********Mr. Popadiuk said: ''We are pleased with the lifting of martial law and see it as a positive step.'' **********He said that the lifting of martial law was ''another in a series of positive steps'' by China. In the last few weeks, he said, the Chinese Government has readmitted a reporter from the Voice of America, has discussed renewal of a student-exchange program suspended since June and has curtailed criticism of the United States in Chinese newspapers and broadcasts. **********Mr. Popadiuk also said the Chinese had ''announced that they would not be selling medium-range missiles to the Middle East.'' **********But an Arabic-language newspaper published in London said this week that Syria had ''officially received assurances from the Chinese Government of its commitment to military cooperation between the two countries.'' The report said that China had rejected American pressure to stop selling weapons to Syria. **********Pledge to Halt Missiles Sales **********Chinese officials concluded that they needed to maintain the military capabilities of Syria and Israel's other Arab neighbors because ''Israel is being armed with the most technologically advanced weapons,'' the report said. **********Asked about that report, Miss Tutwiler affirmed that China had announced that it ''would not be selling medium-range missiles to the Middle East.'' She said she did not know if the Administration was monitoring China's adherence to its pledge. **********It was not immediately clear what types of World Bank loans would be acceptable to the United States. Miss Tutwiler said that though Washington might support some ''basic human needs loans'' to China, it would continue to discourage ''project loans.'' A spokesman for the Asia division of the bank, Pastor B. Sison, said the distinction was not obvious, because loans for specific projects could also serve basic human needs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/14/world/on-the-ethiopian-front-rebel-confidence-rises.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1990-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1592, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "On the Ethiopian Front, Rebel Confidence Rises", "print_headline": "On the Ethiopian Front, Rebel Confidence Rises", "body_text": " **********On the peak of this stone-laden mountain, a wiry guerrilla fighter ducks and weaves along a waist-high trench. Through binoculars he peers at the enemy trenches of the Ethiopian army, an ocher ribbon carved around the hill several hundred yards in front. **********In the distant valley, the 32-year-old guerrilla, Michael Abraham, picks up a glistening patch where the early sun catches a mosque, a church and a moving car, a sign that the Ethiopian town of Keren, 12 miles away, is coming awake. **********This is the front line in Africa's longest-running civil war, a battle almost three decades old, being waged between Eritrean rebels, who want independence from Ethiopia, and the Ethiopian Army. It is a match pitting a flinty, well-organized guerrilla force estimated at 30,000 strong against an Ethiopian force thought to number 230,000 and backed by almost as many militia. **********A little more than a decade ago, the guerrillas barely knew how to operate artillery. Today with divisions' worth of sophisticated Soviet equipment captured from the Ethiopians, a Soviet diplomat concedes that the Eritreans fight better with it than the Ethiopians. [In its most daring assault in the war since 1977, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front attacked the Red Sea port of Massawa last Thursday, and claimed to have captured it. The rebels mounted an almost simultaneous offensive on the Keren front, north of Massawa. The Government acknowledged that its army and navy had taken ''big sacrifices'' in heavy fighting.]  War, Devastation and Drought As the cold war recedes and the superpowers disengage from proxy wars elsewhere, the Ethiopian civil war shows no sign of a peaceful solution. At the same time, the war is compounding the devastation caused by yet another Ethiopian drought that is evident everywhere in the bare, dusty brown hills and the stark silhouettes of dying baobab trees that lead the way to the front line here. The United Nations says the failure of last season's rains threatens more than four million Ethiopians with starvation in coming months. **********The civil war spread beyond Eritrea last year as another rebel group, the Tigrean People's Liberation Front, helped in critical battles by the more experienced, technically superior Eritrean forces, scored big victories against flagging Government troops. The Tigrean rebels, fighting for the overthrow of the Ethiopean Government but not secession, pushed the army out of the entire province of Tigre, which has at its heart the venerated 2,000-year-old historical capital, Axum. That new alliance between the previously quarreling rebel groups has put even more pressure on the increasingly strained Ethiopian leader, Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam. After taking Tigre, the rebels, still assisted by the Eritreans, pushed farther south, occupying large hunks of the provinces of Wollo and Gondar and even penetrating well into Shoa province. In December, they took towns only 100 miles north of the capital, Addis Ababa. **********New Element: Israeli Aid **********The Soviet Union has encouraged its shaky Ethiopian client to settle with the Eritrean and Tigrean rebels at the negotiating table. But Western military analysts say the Soviets pumped high levels of equipment into Ethiopia last year. More than $800 million of Soviet military hardware, including new generation T-62 tanks and B-24 multiple-rocket launchers, arrived in Ethiopia by ship and plane last year, far surpassing the supplies of the previous year, those analysts say. **********Since its military commitment in 1977, when the Soviet Union and the United States switched clients in the Horn of Africa - the United States dropped Ethiopia for Somalia and the Russians dropped Somalia for Ethiopia - the Soviets are estimated by Washington to have sent $11 billion of arms to the Ethiopians. **********The United States has stayed out of the Ethiopian war in the last dozen years, disliking the hard-line Marxist-Leninist Government of Colonel Mengistu that overthrew Washington's old ally, Emperor Haile Selassie. Washington was also unimpressed with the Marxism espoused until recent years by the Eritrean People's Liberation Front. But despite its distaste for Colonel Mengistu, the United States along with most Western powers and all African states, has agreed with the Ethiopian Government's argument that the Eritreans should not be allowed their goal of separating the Eritrean province from Ethiopia and creating an independent state. **********The arrival of Israel on the side of the Addis Ababa Government has added a new, potentially highly charged element to the civil war. Western and Eastern-bloc diplomats say they don't yet know the magnitude of Israel's military assistance. But they say that whatever the size of the Isreali help, it is bound to generate more supplies for the Eritreans from Arab countries. **********'The Generals Are New Generals' **********In a narrow riverbed valley behind Giguru mountain, Halibai Fesshae, a 35-year-old division commander on the Keren front, exuded quiet confidence that the Eritreans would prevail militarily. He was relaxing just before 3 P.M. The next two hours would be the danger zone, when Soviet MIG's of the Ethiopian Air Force often fly over this region of Eritrea. **********''I have learned that deploying a lot of force doesn't give you any priority,'' Mr. Halibai said in his rarely practiced but proficient English. **********''Without troop morale, air and military weapons can't mean anything. A major factor is morale. Theirs is totally flat, zero.'' **********He was dismissive of the Ethiopian Army's command. Since the failed coup of May last year, he said, ''Most of the generals are new generals.'' **********The Role of Morale **********''They were serving 10 to 15 years in social-service agencies,'' he said, referring to Colonel Mengistu resorting to old trusted allies pulled out of military retirement to take the place of officers assassinated or imprisoned after the failed coup last year. **********Mr. Halibai - there are no military titles of rank in the Eritrean front -said he had seen the bad morale at close quarters. Last March, the Ethiopians started an offensive to dislodge the Eritreans from their Mount. Giguru trench lines, he said. The battle lasted eight days with the Eritreans holding their ground. ''Their new recruits don't have enough food or medecine,'' he said. ''They are not well trained. Even physically they are underaged, they cannot fight. Of 60 prisoners of war taken at the battle last year, 80 percent were under the age of 16.'' **********Like many of the senior commanders in the Eritrean front, Mr. Halibai left high school in Asmara, the capital of the province, in the mid-1970's, when persecution against Eritreans by the Government was particularly strong. He has seen the guerrillas grow from an inexperienced, somewhat factionalized group to a formidable fighting force. **********As Mr. Halibai spoke under the shade of a thorn tree, a shiny Soviet jeep was parked nearby, a minor prize from the battle of Afabet two years ago when the Eritreans captured scores of tanks and a number of rocket launchers. **********Western military analysts say the vast majority of the military equipment comes, as the Eritreans assert, from the Ethiopian Army. Some supplies come from Arab countries, they say. **********Fleet of Speedboats **********The Eritreans are not Arabs; indeed the leadership of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front is largely Tigrean-speaking Christians. But about half of the 2.5 million population of Eritrea is Muslim, a factor that helps account for sympathy from Arab countries who also don't like the idea of a strong, united Ethiopia on the Red Sea. The Eritrean People's Liberation Front keeps offices in a number of Arab countries, including Kuwait and Abu Dhabi, where there are large numbers of wealthy Eritrean businessmen who give generously to the front. It also has offices in Syria and Libya. **********The rebel leaders refuse to say where they got their newly acquired naval force, a fleet of high-powered speedboats that patrol their Red Sea coast and were definitely not captured from the Ethiopians. The rebel front has put new emphasis on the Red Sea, the main delivery artery for Soviet, and now it appears, Israeli equipment. ''We can't control the coast,'' Mr. Falahai said. ''But we can reduce the total transportation on the sea.'' **********Wherever a visitor travels in the rocky terrain of northern Eritrea, the cult of the Kalishnikov is pervasive, hardly surprising among a young adult generation that has known nothing but life at war. In a school room in Orota, for example, where the children of fighters played in a basement classroom on shiny new Yamaha violins donated from Norway, a Kalishnikov assault rifle was slung against a window. It belonged to the teacher, who like all teachers in the countryside - the rebels hold very few towns - are considered fighters, an escort from the rebel front said. **********The escort was Girma Asmaron, the head of information for the front's foreign ministry, who graduated from Bowdoin College in Maine in the early 1970's. He wore a Soviet Red Star pistol on his waist, along with a hand grenade, a pack of bullets and a flashlight, all neatly held in a specially tailored, Eritrean made, leather belt. It was not that he expected trouble as he traveled through the rebel-held area, he said, ''But I carry it so you get used to the idea of carrying a gun.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/04/business/factory-orders-rose-1.8-in-august.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 507, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Factory Orders Rose 1.8% in August", "print_headline": "Factory Orders Rose 1.8% in August", "body_text": " **********Rising oil prices helped push up the value of orders to factories for manufactured goods by 1.8 percent in August, the Government reported today.

Verleger, the commodities market expert at Charles River Associates, a consulting firm based in Boston, pointed out recently that buyers of the units do not expect a price per barrel of four times the share price (or $13 on Friday); they are expecting a gain, in exchange for the use of their money for the intervening years. Assuming a cost of money of 12 percent, the share price implies a 1995 price in the neighborhood of $24 a barrel. Such a figure, Mr. Verleger said, would be \"strikingly low,\" especially since it represents the price after inflation has taken its toll. Many other oil experts agree, although with global production capacity and inventories rising, a price crash after the crisis is resolved could also be envisioned. **********Anyone with a little cash on hand who thinks theprice in mid-decade will be above the mid-$20's could place a bet by buying units of the Phibro trust; if the sale price in 1995 exceeds $24, the buyer's return would exceed 12 percent. An investor who wanted to place the opposite bet, that prices would be even lower, might buy stock in a company that prospers when prices are low, like a refiner and marketer of petroleum products. **********In the oil markets, five years is almost forever. In 1981, for example, when oil prices were near record highs after the revolution in Iran, almost no one foresaw the price collapse of 1986. And no one was predicting that year that Iraq would invade Kuwait in 1990, causing oil prices to double in a few weeks. **********Before the invasion, oil analysts pointed out that the world's surplus capacity lay almost entirely within OPEC's control and was dwindling as demand rose. This situation was a recipe for significant price increases in the mid-90's, they said. **********The chief economist of the Amoco Corporation, Theodore Eck, predicted before the events of the last five months that oil would sell for $25 in the mid-1990's. \"I don't see that anything's happened to change that forecast,\" he said last week. **********Independent of Saddam Hussein, he said, the world's largest and third-largest producers (the Soviet Union and the United States) are going through rapid declines in production, and the Persian Gulf (home of the second-largest, Saudi Arabia) still has the great bulk of the known, easy-to-pump oil. \"Price is going to continue to be a function of the leading countries in OPEC: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran and Iraq,\" he said. \"Thosefour determine what the price is.\" **********Those countries were successfully raising prices before the invasion, he said. And if the crisis over Kuwait has had any effect, it is to raise the revenue requirements of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq; Iran was already hard pressed for money. **********At the First Boston Corporation, William Randol, who follows the oil market and oil stocks, said that the recent price shock had helped slow the economies of various nations, depressing demand, but that overall demand was still growing. He predicted a price above $30. Last month, Texaco Inc. predicted prices rising two to three percentage points above inflation; inflation of 4 percent, Mr. Randol said, would yield a price of $27.75 in 1995. **********Norman P. Higby Jr., an analyst in Menlo Park, Calif., laid out a different projection. Saudi Arabia, already a partner with Texaco in a joint venture for refining and marketing that covers the Eastern United States, would expand that effort nationwide and provide gasoline cheaply, to gain market share. Others, he said, would have to follow with low product prices to stay competitive, lowering the value of crude. Prices would be volatile, he said, ranging from $15 to the high $20's or $30. **********Thomas R. McHale, an energy economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said he saw China becoming an importer instead of an exporter, and Soviet production falling sharply. Outside the Middle East, he asked, \"where else do we have any great potential for expansion of oil production?\" **********His forecast implies a higher price, but he added that many analysts underestimate the long-term capacity of countries facing higher prices to use less. He would not speculate on a 1995 price. **********And the completely unforeseen is always a possibility. At Bear, Stearns & Company, William E. Byers, a futures expert, warned that in oil, copper, soybeans or any commodity, projections made by extrapolating current conditions and inflation rates are seldom accurate. His bottom line on 1995 has a ring of sincerity to it. \"I have no clue,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/15/business/kerkorian-buys-9.8-of-chrysler.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Judge", "pub_date": "1990-12-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 853, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kerkorian Buys 9.8% Of Chrysler", "print_headline": "Kerkorian Buys 9.8% Of Chrysler", "body_text": " **********The Chrysler Corporation said today that Kirk Kerkorian, an investor with a history of corporate deal making, had acquired 9.8 percent of its common stock for $277 million. **********The news surprised many analysts, who regard Chrysler's pension liabilities, modest cash flow and relatively weak prospects as impediments to investors seeking quick returns. **********Chrysler's board responded this morning by reducing to 10 percent, from 20 percent, the amount of its shares that a hostile investor can amass before the company's \"poison pill\" anti-takeover provisions kick in. **********In a statement, the Tracinda Corporation, Mr. Kerkorian's investment company, said: \"We were surprised by the action of the Chrysler board, especially since Tracinda's purchases are for investment. It is hard for us to see how the steps taken by the board today are in the best interests of all the shareholders.\" **********Last month Mr. Kerkorian sold the MGM/UA Communications Company to an Italian financier, Giancarlo Parretti, for $1.3 billion.   Disclosure Statement Planned **********Tracinda, which is based in Los Angeles, said it would file a disclosure statement on Monday, giving further details, with the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********Chrysler declined to speculate on Mr. Kerkorian's motives, but it did say that Mr. Kerkorian had met at its request with Lee A. Iacocca, the chairman of Chrysler, in New York on Dec. 7. The meeting was called after Chrysler became aware that Mr. Kerkorian, whom Mr. Iacocca knows socially, had amassed about 5 percent of its stock, a spokesman said. The company said Mr. Iacocca sought an agreement that would have capped Tracinda's investment at 5 percent, but Mr. Kerkorian declined. **********The spokesman said Mr. Kerkorian had told Mr. Iacocca and Robert S. Miller Jr., the auto maker's vice chairman, that he considered himself a passive investor, that he supported management and that he thought Chrysler's shares were undervalued.  Advisers Retained **********Chrysler has retained the First Boston Corporation and the Blackstone Group as financial advisers. **********Chrysler's executives and directors remained wary, judging from the action taken today by the board to amend an anti-takeover provision that was adopted in 1988. As amended today, that provision entitles all common stockholders except those with a stake of 10 percent or more to purchase common stock at half price, once an investor has amassed a 10 percent stake. Such an action would require Chrysler to issue a significant amount of new stock. **********Also today, the board approved a second option enabling the company to give an additional share to every holder of one share -- except a holder of 10 percent or more -- effectively cutting in half the holdings of any hostile suitor. **********Mr. Kerkorian is now the largest Chrysler stockholder. According to Chrysler's 1989 proxy statement, Windsor Funds Inc. holds 8.68 percent of its shares and Sanford C. Bernstein & Company has 6.22 percent. **********News of Mr. Kerkorian's stake had little effect on Chrysler's stock, which closed unchanged today on the New York Stock Exchange at $12.25. It was the sixth-most-active issue, with more than 1.5 million shares changing hands. **********While most auto analysts say Chrysler may eventually need a big partner to compete globally, several expressed doubt that such a linkup was imminent. Chrysler and Fiat recently ended negotiations after nearly a year of talks. **********Some analysts suggested that Mr. Kerkorian might have begun to acquire his shares earlier this year on the assumption that Chrysler and Fiat would make a deal.   Stock Has Been Stable **********Other analysts said they thought Mr. Kerkorian had amassed his holding over the last month or so, which would help explain why Chrysler's share price has remained relatively stable while those of General Motors and Ford have fallen. In any case, the Los Angeles investor has roughly doubled his stake in the last week. **********Another strategy that Mr. Kerkorian may be considering, analysts said, was to find someone else interested in buying his holding, possibly Chrysler itself. Mr. Healy raised the possibility that Mr. Kerkorian might seek a premium price from the company for his stake, a practice known as \"greenmail.\" **********Ann Knight, an automotive analyst with Paine Webber in New York, said, \"Generally, auto makers don't attract this kind of attention, because they are deeply cyclical, capital-intensive companies.\"  Deals Involving MGM **********Because so many of Mr. Kerkorian's interests are privately held through Tracinda, it is difficult to assess his wealth. But several bankers who have followed his dealings say it probably exceeds $1 billion. **********In 1969, he bought 45 percent of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $82 million, and in 1980 split it into MGM Grand Hotels and the MGM Film Company. The film company in turn bought United Artists a year later. **********Tracinda began shedding those assets in 1986, selling MGM Grand to the Bally Manufacturing Corporation and then MGM/UA to the Turner Broadcasting System for $1.5 billion. As a 51 percent owner, Mr. Kerkorian kept $765 million and bought back some of the assets for $480 million, selling part of that company to the public. Earlier this year, Mr. Kerkorian sold that stake to Mr. Parretti for $1.3 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/29/business/company-profits-down-gnp-growth-at-1.1.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 967, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Company Profits Down; G.N.P. Growth at 1.1%", "print_headline": "Company Profits Down; G.N.P. Growth at 1.1%", "body_text": " **********Profits of American companies fell by 3.2 percent in the final three months of 1989 mainly because of rising labor costs, the Commerce Department reported today. **********For the full year, corporate profits from current production dropped by 8.3 percent; in 1988 they rose by 10 percent. The decline was the first significant drop since a 20.2 percent decrease in 1982, the most recent recession year. **********While profits from current production are the purest gauge, the Commerce Department reports other measures of profits. Current-production cash flow - the internal funds available for investment - fell by three-tenths of 1 percent after rising by 1.9 percent in the third quarter. Profits before taxes eased by five-tenths of 1 percent after a 7.1 percent decline, and profits after taxes rose by 2.8 percent, the first quarterly gain in a year. **********Calculation of Growth **********The profits report accompanied the department's latest calculation of the pace of economic growth in the fourth quarter, now put at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.1 percent. **********This suggested that the economy was slightly firmer than shown in last month's estimate of nine-tenths of 1 percent. The first estimate, in January, had said the gross national product expanded at an annual rate of five-tenths of 1 percent in the quarter. **********The figures on corporate profits, although not unexpected, reinforced the worries of some analysts that corporations would not have the means or the incentive to invest in new plant and equipment during 1990. **********Not a 'Painless Landing' **********''This shows that a 'soft landing' is by no means synonymous with a painless landing,'' said Robert G. Dederick, a former Commerce Department official who is now chief economist for the Northern Trust Company of Chicago. ''One of the key questions now is whether this year is going to be dragged down by businesses responding to last year.'' **********A ''soft landing'' refers to the effort of policy makers, so far fairly successful, to restrain the economy enough to keep inflation under control without tipping the economy into a recession. **********Profits are a principal source of money for expansion, the other being loans. Many lending institutions have, however, been tightening credit standards recently, with lending to smaller companies seeming to be the most seriously affected. **********Higher Final Sales **********The latest revision of the G.N.P. growth figure reflects higher final sales for most major components partly offset by a $4 billion downward adjustment in the growth of inventories. The gross national product measures the output of goods and services, and production adds to the G.N.P. even if the goods pile up on dealers' shelves. The latest data were considered something of a plus for the business outlook because it means inventories are under good control and production will not need to be scaled back to bring them into balance with sales. **********The rise in the G.N.P. fixed-weighted price index, a measure of inflation, remained at 3.6 percent, up from 2.9 percent in the third quarter. **********The 3.2 percent quarterly decline in profits reflected a fall-off of $9.5 billion, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $285.7 billion. Profits would have been far worse had it not been for a sharp increase in earnings abroad. **********The foreign component jumped $9.7 billion, up from $2.1 billion in the third quarter. This represents the amount by which dividends paid to United States residents and reinvested earnings of foreign affiliates of American companies exceed corresponding amounts paid to foreign residents. **********Domestic Profits Down **********Domestic profits of nonfinancial corporations skidded by $13.9 billion, far more than the $3.8 billion decline in the preceding three months. Gross corporate product rose while profits per unit of real product fell; lower unit profits reflected difficulty in raising prices combined with higher costs. **********Kenneth A. Petrick, a Commerce Department specialist, said much of the narrowing of profit margins reflected higher labor costs as companies appeared to hold on to workers in hopes that the economy would regain momentum. **********Mr. Petrick also said the net interest costs of nonfinancial corporations seemed to have leveled off, suggesting diminishing pressure on profit margins this year. He acknowledged, however, that some of the interest reduction figure could be a reflection of defaults on debt. **********Domestic profits of financial corporations fell by $5.2 billion during the quarter, less than half the third-quarter drop of $10.8 billion, which reflected large costs incurred by casualty insurers because of hurricane and earthquake damage. The fourth-quarter decline reflected the problems of banks and savings and loan associations. **********Data included in the revision of the gross national product for the fourth quarter of 1989 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates.

'That we are engaged here in South Africa in an irreversible process that we will follow to its logical conclusion.' '' **********Mr. de Klerk's use of the word ''irreversible'' was clearly not accidental.

Both sides have been making conciliatory statements, but they remain far apart on what a ''new South Africa'' should look like. **********Mr. Baker's visit was the first by an American Secretary of State to South Africa since Cyrus R.

Its general manager, Thomas Tomaszek, said the plant should break even next year and eventually produce a 25 percent return on investment. **********Moreover, it has become a valuable proving ground for a new generation of larger plants that its owner, a consortium of polystyrene producers known as the National Polystyrene Recycling Company, expects to be even more profitable. **********''This is the first plant to demonstrate that it's viable to recycle food packaging with today's technology,'' said E.

The new operations are planned to be roughly four times the size of Plastics Again, which at full capacity can process about three million pounds of polystyrene annually. **********Last week, the Dart Container Corporation announced plans to set up operations at its factories in Mason, Mich.; Leola, Pa.; Plant City, Fla., and Campbellford, Ontario, to reclaim between one million and three million pounds annually of foamed polystyrene coffee cups and packing materials. Unlike the National Polystyrene plants, Dart's will not accept materials that must be washed. **********One thing that may help is the growing number of programs to recycle other products. Plastics Again, for instance, has benefited from bottle recycling that began when Massachusetts passed a bottle-deposit law. The reason: New England Crinc, a company that had established an extensive bottle hauling-business, was able to collect polystyrene as well at a reasonable price. **********Plastics Again pays 5 cents a pound for deliveries that are at least 98 percent polystyrene by weight. For now, at least, it also takes less clean supplies, which may be contaminated by a wide variety of foods, textiles and metals, but it charges a fee of up to 24 cents a pound for a fast-food restaurant that has done little sorting. **********Clean and Serene Appearance **********These days, a truck pulls up every three hours or so to the back of the grass-verged plant, which looks serene and spotless from the outside. The polyethylene bags are pulled out, cut open so their contents can be poured onto conveyor belts, and set aside to be baled and sent to a polyethylene recycler. **********Bags filled with relatively large pieces move down a conveyor belt, where two workers quickly separate other types of waste before the polystyrene feeds into a shredder. The contents of the other bags, most of them from McDonald's or a handful of other fast-food restaurants, ride a separate conveyor up to a hopper that relies on vibration to sort out waste like cans and loose change. Both streams are then washed and fed into a high-speed grinder. **********The next stage is rinsing, followed by a spin dryer and then a screw-dryer that wrings more liquid from the polystyrene shreds before feeding them into an oven dryer. The shreds emerge from the oven stuck together like caramel corn and must be reground before being sent by vacuum tube to the extruding system. **********Another machine stuffs the shreds into the extruder, which presses the plastic through screens that remove residual wastes like bits of aluminum, bone, stone and fiber before it is chopped into small, round pellets. Colors, modifiers like rubber that make the plastic more resilient, and chemicals to make it more resistant to ultraviolet light can be added during extrusion. **********Combs and Cafeteria Trays **********The end product is then cooled in a water bath and packaged in 1,100-pound boxes. The boxes are sold by the truckload to processors that make the polystyrene into products including reusable cafeteria trays, insulation, egg cartons, office products, combs, tape-cassette cases and flower pots. Water used in the plant is recycled and a scrubber system cleans the air, which is changed six times an hour. **********Samples of the pellets are run through standard tests in a nearby room to establish the key characteristics of each load, like the melting point, density, and how easily it will flow as it melts. **********''You don't need a master's of science to run this system,'' Mr. Tomaszek said. **********Flies and Low Wages **********One does, however, need a fair number of workers who will accept low wages and put up with unappetizing conditions. Plastics Again relies largely on Vietnamese immigrants supplied by an employment agency at $7.50 an hour. Mr. Tomaszek said he was working hard to improve conditions, including getting rid of the flies without using pesticides. But the long-run need is more automation, particularly at the messy front end of the process. **********National Polystyrene plans to break initial processing down into three separate systems in its new plants, each handling a different kind of polystyrene waste, said James H. Browne, a process engineering expert at Law Environmental Engineering, a Kennesaw, Ga., consulting firm hired to oversee National Polystyrene's programs to locate, design, secure permits, buy equipment and build plants. **********The key equipment in the new design is a $500,000 twin-screw extruder, made by Werner-Pfleider of West Germany. The extruder is more energy-efficient than single-screw devices and better suited for adding compounds that can increase the value of the recycled polystyrene. **********Sorting Is Important **********To take full advantage of it, National Polystyrene will probably have to require those sending polystyrene to its plants to do a better job of sorting. Polystyrene makes up about 80 percent of the material arriving at Plastics Again. George Mackey, the Dow Chemical executive who is chairman of National Polystyrene's technical committee, says the newer plants will probably specify 95 percent purity. **********''You don't want to put valuable additives into the product until you are confident that you have consistent quality,'' Mr. Mackey said. **********Unless coloring is added, the pellets produced at Plastics Again emerge looking like green BB's. Virgin polystyrene can be clear and thus has more potential markets. Plastics Again's products sell at a 20 percent discount to standard polystyrene, but National Polystyrene wants to close the gap. ''I believe that someday, good-quality recycled polystyrene will sell at the same price as virgin,'' Mr. Mackey said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/31/world/tokyo-opposes-cuts-in-us-forces-in-asia.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-01-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 204, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tokyo Opposes Cuts in U.S. Forces in Asia", "print_headline": "Tokyo Opposes Cuts in U.S. Forces in Asia", "body_text": " **********Reacting to the cutbacks announced in President Bush's proposed military budget, a senior Japanese Government official argued today against any reduction in the United States' military presence in Japan or the rest of Asia because of a continuing Soviet menace. **********''The situation in Europe is one thing and the situation in Asia is another,'' a senior Foreign Ministry official said.

Mr. Perez de Cuellar responded by saying that he would not send the team.  U.N.

The talks were intended to demonstrate the eroding political influence of the central Government in Moscow as much as to calm the regional crisis. **********Decentralized Populism Gains **********By creating this new sort of political initiative, leaders from the separatist movements of the two warring republics and of the Baltic lands, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, feel that they have considerably advanced the cause of decentralized populist politics now challenging the Communist Party's authority in major parts of the nation. **********''This was historic and shows how strong these movements truly are -not for the Government but for the people,'' said Anda Anspoka, a spokeswoman for the Baltic Council. That is an alliance of the powerful popular fronts in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia that have been crafting peaceful initiatives to secede from the nation in the face of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's objections. **********''Until yesterday we were not sure that the two sides would ever agree to even meet in the same room with mediators,'' Miss Anspoka said, noting the long history of enmity between the Azerbaijanis and Armenians and the current spate of violence that has posed a critical problem for the central Government. **********No Reaction From Gorbachev **********The five popular fronts made a point of not inviting Kremlin officials to the talks, held in Riga, Latvia's capital, aiming to show that they had the people's confidence while the Government did not. Mr. Gorbachev has offered no reaction to the two-day meeting, which was mentioned briefly in Soviet news accounts with no reference of the Baltic sponsors. Miss Anspoka said the talks that produced the agreement lasted from 6 P.M. Friday until 3 A.M. today. She added that the negotiators from the Armenian National Movement and the Azerbaijani Popular Front were so involved that they had asked for an additional session this afternoon limited to themselves without Baltic Council mediation. **********''Who would have imagined these hot-blooded people finally talking directly this way,'' she said. **********One factor was the decision to exclude from the agenda the most delicate of their differences, the ethnic turmoil around Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave within Azerbaijan but populated mostly by Armenians who prefer allegiance with the neighboring Armenian republic. The two sides even ventured to raise this issue before the final session ended this evening in Riga, Miss Anspoka said. But they reported no progress after restating their fimiliar differences over the communal violence, which began two years ago and in which scores of people have been slain. They did agree that their dispute was rooted in territorial and political issues, not in the religious differences between the Islamic Azerbaijanis and the Christian Armenians. **********Under the terms of the communique, the popular front leaders agreed to return to their people in Armenia and Azerbaijan to explain the agreement and to effect an end to all border violence no later than Feb. 15. They also agreed to investigate all hostage-takings in the region by that date and to effect an exchange no later than March 1. It is believed that 18 Armenians and 47 Azerbaijanis are being held as hostages from the numerous village raids and reprisals. **********Before leaving the negotiating table at the Latvian Writers' Union, the two sides also jointly condemned the Kremlin's sending of emergency troops to the region, and contended that the ethnic violence could be better contained by earlier and more accurate and credible investigations of tensions by popular front representatives rather than Communist Government officials. **********Local Party Is Displaced **********The popular unrest in the republics has increasingly revealed the local Communist machines as being out of touch with the new wave of politics being brandished by the popular fronts. In Azerbaijan, the party apparatus was routed by popular front leaders. In the Baltics, local party leaders have been joining the secessionist challenge to central authority to win popularity. **********The Riga talks came about after Mr. Gorbachev declared a state of emergency and sent troops into Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, on Jan. 20 to reclaim civil authority from the Azerbaijani Popular Front. He also sought to stop maurauding gangs of Azerbaijanis who killed dozens of civilians from the Armenian minority in a week of insurrection. **********At least 100 more people were killed in the troops' storming of Baku. The Soviet leader said the move was needed because popular front ''extremists'' were on the verge of fully displacing local Communist authority. **********But the popular front's contention, endorsed by the signers of the Riga accord, was that the Government had fomented ethnic violence as a pretext for imposing martial law so as to head off a devastating defeat for the Communists by the popular front in coming local elections."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/10/business/saudi-oil-minister-predicts-a-sellers-market-in-90-s.html": {"writer_name": "Matthew Wald", "pub_date": "1990-03-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 419, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Saudi Oil Minister Predicts A 'Sellers' Market' in 90's", "print_headline": "Saudi Oil Minister Predicts A 'Sellers' Market' in 90's", "body_text": " **********The Saudi oil minister, Hisham M.

One corporate maverick, Federal Digital Cellular, claims to know the answer: monopoly power. It is asking Federal regulators to make room for a third cellular phone competitor in each city. **********There is, however, a giant catch: The slice of the airwaves the company wants is already being used by GTE Mobile Communications to operate air-to-ground pay phones on domestic airliners. **********Putting this piece of radio spectrum up for grabs would put GTE's Airfones out of business. Perhaps more significant politically, it would threaten the interests of established cellular telephone companies, whose lock on mobile communications is now valued in the tens of billions of dollars. **********In the mid-1970's A.T.&T. estimated that by 1990 just 100,000 Americans would be willing to shell out $100 or more each month for the luxury of phones in their cars and briefcases. Competition-minded policy analysts thus thought they had scored a victory in convincing the Federal Communications Commission to make room for second cellular systems, independent of the local phone company, in every metropolitan area. **********But the cellular phone has proved to be the biggest electronic hit since the Walkman.

Cellular phone companies must race to keep the supply of circuits ahead of demand. **********It is not surprising then that franchise holders are not competing on the price of calling time. According to Paul Kagan Associates, a consulting firm, mature cellular systems enjoy a 60 percent profit margin on sales - five times the average margin for regulated public utilities. **********Cellular franchises, by custom freely tradable once they have been assigned, now change hands for about $200 per resident. This figure implies that the right to run one of the two cellular systems in every big city is worth a staggering $37 billion. **********One way to prevent consumers from being gouged would be to regulate rates. But the F.C.C. is loath to extend its reach in an area of rapid innovation and productivity improvement. **********The alternative, Federal Digital Cellular argues, is to carve out enough room on the airwaves for a third competitor in each market. Little space would be needed, the company asserts. While the two current systems take up 50 megahertz of spectrum, a third using new digital technology could be squeezed into four megahertz. **********As a practical matter, however, the only chunk of spectrum available is the one used for air-to-ground phones. In April 1988 the commission proposed to convert GTE's experimental license, issued in 1984, into what would amount to a permanent entitlement. Federal Digital Cellular is now petitioning to reopen the proceedings. **********Some members of the commission staff are reported to be reluctant to undo a completed deal. And no one is eager to penalize GTE for its innovation in air-to-ground communications, or disrupt Airfone service to consumers. But a number of considerations may yet convince the regulators to think again. **********Even by GTE's optimistic revenue projections, the potential value of a third cellular franchise in major markets is at least five times as great as the value of Airfone service. Air-to-ground service, moreover, could be accommodated on higher radio frequencies by using satellites. Indeed, one company, the American Mobile Satellite Corporation, is already licensed for the service and expects to be in operation this year. **********Federal Digital Cellular's real ace in the hole, however, may lie in the White House. The Bush Administration has taken no public position on how best to allocate the contested chunk of spectrum, and is not likely to do so. **********But as part of the effort to meet the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction targets in 1991, Administration budgeters projected $3 billion in revenue from a new system of auctioning communications rights to the highest bidders. And it is virtually inconceivable that the goal could be met without earmarking the most desirable portions of the unallocated spectrum to cellular phones. **********A reopening of the proceedings would not necessarily mean victory for proponents of the third cellular option. But it would give them a chance to make their case - and perhaps make a side deal with GTE to drop out of the contest. After all, if additional cellular service is so much more valuable than current air-to-ground service, there ought to be some way to compensate GTE for its loss of the franchise and still come out ahead."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/01/world/party-in-guatemala-names-its-candidate-for-president.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Party in Guatemala Names Its Candidate for President", "print_headline": "Party in Guatemala Names Its Candidate for President", "body_text": " **********The governing Guatemalan Christian Democrat Party today named former Foreign Minister Alfonso Cabrera Hidalgo its presidential candidate in elections to be held in November. **********In a 30-minute acceptance speech filled with praise for President Vinicio Cerezo, Mr. Cabrera told about 3,000 cheering supporters that improving social services and stopping the drug trade were his top priorities. **********In a bitter primary election last August, Mr. Cabrera handily beat Rene de Leon Schlotter, the party's founder, and Raquel Blandon de Cerezo, the President's wife."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/02/world/croatia-s-serbs-declare-their-autonomy.html": {"writer_name": "Chuck Sudetic", "pub_date": "1990-10-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 404, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Croatia's Serbs Declare Their Autonomy", "print_headline": "Croatia's Serbs Declare Their Autonomy", "body_text": " **********In an atmosphere of rising ethnic tension, Serbs in the Yugoslav republic of Croatia today declared the republic's predominantly Serbian-populated counties to be autonomous. **********The declaration, based on the results of a vaguely worded referendum on Serbian autonomy conducted throughout Yugoslavia over the last two months, was signed by Milan Babic, a local politician who heads the Serbian National Council, a Yugoslav press agency report said. **********More than 99 percent of the approximately 750,000 participants in the referendum voted for autonomy, the report said.

And in fact, more and more tasks that once required a mainframe are now being tackled by the PC or its more powerful desktop sibling, the work station, strung together on a network. **********But far from killing the mainframe, in many businesses work station networks have fostered a complex computing environment that plays to the mainframe's strengths. Mainframe revenues are still growing at a little more than 10 percent a year, which off a base of more than $14 billion in 1989 is hardly indicative of a moribund industry. As one industry executive puts it, if these are dinosaurs, they are an awfully frisky breed. **********Indeed, the three mainframe makers with the fastest growth are each preparing to introduce a new generation of machines. Hitachi Ltd., which has historically been a distant third to the International Business Machines Corporation and the Amdahl Corporation, tried to gain an advantage in June when it announced its next-generation mainframes well in advance of those two rivals, which are not expected to announce until sometime next year. **********But analysts said the impact of the Hitachi announcement was lessened somewhat by delivery dates so far in the future - the second quarter of 1991 - that they will not predate the new I.B.M. or Amdahl machines by much. **********Industry executives and analysts say the mainframe business has averaged about 10 percent growth a year for the last 20 years and could well continue at that rate for the next 10. But this is revenue growth, driven by existing customers upgrading to new and ever-larger machines. Unit growth, created by sales to new customers or new sites, is only in the low single digits and is not expected to accelerate, analysts say. **********Analysts also say the growth is limited to I.B.M., which has 83 percent of the market, and to the so-called plug-compatible manufacturers, which make mainframes compatible with I.B.M.'s. These are Amdahl of Sunnyvale, Calif., and Hitachi of Japan, which resells its machines in the United States through Hitachi Data Systems Inc. in Santa Clara, Calif. **********Two emerging trends in computing are expected to drive demand for mainframes and work stations simultaneously. **********One is ''enterprise wide'' computing, where all the computers in a company are connected on a series of networks, a task of such complexity that it could be managed only by a mainframe. The other is ''client-server'' computing, where tasks are divided between the client - a work station or PC - and the server - a larger computer elsewhere on a network. While most work station companies also make machines they call servers, on complex installations the server is likely to be a mainframe. **********''Legitimately, some work has gone from big machines to small machines, and it was the right place to go,'' said John C. Lewis, Amdahl's chairman and chief executive. ''That will continue, but what I think is going to happen is that customers are going to find that the best technical solution is a combination of centralized computer server capability and decentralized work stations,'' he said. **********While work stations are increasingly used for personal productivity - design work in engineering or producing presentations and reports in the commercial world - data and applications crucial to a business are still likely to reside on the mainframe. When it comes to managing all of a bank's automatic teller machines, or coordinating reservations for airline seats, the mainframe's robustness and ability to process huge amounts of data are key. **********''There are quite a few Fortune 500 companies whose health of the business is based on the ability of these monsters to keep running,'' said John B. Jones Jr., an analyst with Montgomery Securities. **********Many companies have begun to use their large computer systems as an offensive weapon. Aided by a software technology called relational data base management, which is adept at processing complex requests and breaking down vast amounts of information in many ways, these companies constantly review their internal data, looking for ways to drive down the time to market of new products, cut inventories and improve manufacturing efficiency. **********''People find as they start doing that, it gets complicated,'' said M. Bernard Puckett, the president of I.B.M.'s data systems division. ''The thing that mainframes remain good at is managing that complexity.'' **********As the ability of networks to move data has improved, companies are also finding that their efficiency is improved by having fewer mainframe sites. Organizations that used to have many data centers, each with their own modest-sized mainframe, are now consolidating those operations, which has driven demand for the very largest mainframes. **********So while having the most powerful mainframe on the market has always been important for a manufacturer's bragging rights, it may now give a significant competitive edge, said Stephen Cohen, an analyst with the Soundview Financial Group in Stamford, Conn. **********In the past, I.B.M., based in Armonk, N.Y., was able to offer the biggest mainframes. I.B.M. did not get as much power from a single computer processor unit as did Amdahl or Hitachi, but it was able to couple six processors while its competitors were limited to four. **********Compatibles Gain Market Share **********In the next generation of mainframes, which could ship in late 1991 or early 1992, Mr. Cohen expects the compatible manufacturers to still have the largest single processors, but that all three companies will reach parity at eight processors coupled together. ''I think I.B.M. will end up losing share in the marketplace,'' he said. Hitachi and Amdahl ''will have product equal to if not superior to I.B.M.,'' he added. **********The plug-compatibles have been gaining share from I.B.M. for several years. Like the Compaq Computer Corporation in the PC business, they have done this by offering lower prices, superior performance or new features in advance of I.B.M., while remaining scrupulously compatible. Amdahl, for example, was the first to offer a complete mainframe version of Unix, the industry standard operating system software popular on work stations. **********Gary Moore, president and chief executive of Hitachi Data Systems, said the company's early announcement of its new mainframes had more to do with allaying customer worries than getting a jump on the competition. ''We were seeing concern from our customers - 'What are you going to do next?' '' he said. ''A lot of customers do planning nine to 12 months out; you don't just go out and buy a $14 million computer.'' **********Maintaining customer loyalty is difficult in the mainframe business because compatibility allows different manufacturers' products to be mixed and matched within a single installation. Customers know that buying a single piece of Amdahl or Hitachi equipment will improve their bargaining power with I.B.M. on the next sale, and analysts say discounts as deep as 45 percent are not unheard of. **********I.B.M. Dominates Software **********While some analysts worry about the growing power of the Japanese in the mainframe business - Amdahl is 44 percent owned by, and gets key components from, Fujitsu Ltd. -others say I.B.M. will remain dominant because it sets the software standard to which I.B.M., Amdahl and Hitachi must adhere. **********''The operating system and related data base software are so important that just because the Japanese can produce faster processors before I.B.M. - in the eyes of the customer that doesn't mean that much,'' said Ulric Weil, an analyst with Weil & Associates in Washington. ''On the software side, the Japanese simply are not able to solve that riddle.'' **********And despite its forays into PC's, work stations and minicomputers, I.B.M. remains very bullish about the mainframe. ''If it were going to go away, we would need to be the first to know,'' Mr. Puckett said, noting that I.B.M. budgets new mainframe developments seven to 10 years ahead of their appearance in the market. **********Mr. Puckett said the mainframe market was at the front end of a new demand cycle as more companies used the big machines to improve their own efficiency. And each year, he said, the dinosaur ''rattles its tail and lumbers forward for a few billion dollars more in revenues and profit.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/15/business/good-profit-margins-shown-at-saks-and-marshall-field.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1990-02-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 648, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Good Profit Margins Shown At Saks and Marshall Field", "print_headline": "Good Profit Margins Shown At Saks and Marshall Field", "body_text": " **********Prospectuses for Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field show that both companies have produced profit margins about twice the norm for department stores catering to higher-income clientele. **********The 46 stores of Saks, which is based in New York, are somewhat more profitable than the 24 stores of the Chicago-based Marshall Field, according to the documents. **********Both chains have been put up for sale by their British owner, B.A.T.

Today Mr. Gorbachev said the need for revamping the party was urgent and proposed that the meeting be moved up to June or July. **********Gorbachev's Argument **********The debate today focused on Mr. Gorbachev's call on the party to relinquish its ruling position, guaranteed by Article 6 of the Constitution, and to recognize the tumult of new political forces unleashed by several years of liberalization. **********''The party in a renewing society can exist and play its role as vanguard only as a democratically recognized force,'' he said. ''This means that its status should not be imposed through constitutional endorsement. **********''The Soviet Communist Party, it goes without saying, intends to struggle for the status of the ruling party,'' he continued. ''But it will do so strictly within the framework of the democratic process by giving up any legal and political advantages, offering its program and defending it in discussions, cooperating with other social and political forces, always working among the masses, living by their interests and their needs. **********''The extensive democratization under way in our society is being accompanied by mounting political pluralism. Various social and political organizations and movements emerge. This process may lead at a certain stage to the establishment of parties.'' **********Time Frame Uncertain **********The Soviet leader was vague about when new parties would materialize. Two Soviet republics - Lithuania and Estonia - have already legalized competing parties and have begun officially registering rivals like the Social Democrats, Christian Democrats and Greens. In these and other republics, popular fronts that combine members of various parties - including the Communist Party - and others have challenged the party's power. **********If enacted, Mr. Gorbachev's recommendation on pluralism would make the Soviet Union the last Communist country in the Soviet bloc to relinquish its legal guarantee of power. **********The formal Communist monopoly dates to Stalin's 1936 constitution, but in practice there have been no multiparty elections here since shortly after the Bolsheviks seized power in 1917. **********Mr. Gorbachev's remarks drew a wary response from Communist Party insurgents, who on Sunday organized a march of 100,000 people through Moscow to demand more democracy. **********Vasily S. Shakhnovsky, a leader of an alliance of Moscow Communist clubs that sponsored the demonstration, said a constitutional amendment would be an important symbol, but no assurance of political freedom. **********''Power will still remain in the hands of the party apparatus,'' he said tonight. ''It's more an emotional thing, and it will depend on whether he really wants to give the power away.'' **********Shift of Power May Be Goal **********Mr. Gorbachev's speech today seemed to confirm what many think is his overall strategy: a transfer of responsibility and power from the party machine to the presidency and the elected Parliament. **********Many say they think that if this is accomplished he will surrender his position as party leader to focus on his term as President, which continues until 1994. **********The Soviet leader seemed to side with those who contend that the President, like chief executives in the United States or France, should have more power. **********Critics of the current system say Mr. Gorbachev is too hemmed in by the fractious Parliament, which prevents him from responding quickly to ethnic disorders or economic crises. **********Mr. Gorbachev today said that ''the question has arisen'' of equipping the President ''with all the necessary powers to implement the policy of perestroika.'' **********''The draft platform naturally speaks about this concisely, stressing the need to act without delay,'' he said. ''I think this idea deserves discussion by this plenum.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev asked the Central Committee to endorse a major reorganization of the party, creating a chairman with two deputies in place of the current General Secretary, and streamlining the Central Committee to 200 members. **********He called for ''rethinking the principle of democratic centralism,'' the policy of centralized discipline that requires all party members to follow the line decreed from above. **********Disappointed Consumers **********Mr. Gorbachev grimly admitted the failure of his program to produce tangible results for Soviet consumers, describing the national mood as ''social tension and anxiety'' mixed with ''apathy and disappointment.'' **********He passionately defended his decision to send the army last month to the embattled southern republic of Azerbaijan, asserting that if a state of emergency had not been imposed ''the blood of not dozens but of thousands upon thousands of people would have been shed.'' **********The intervention, he said, headed off a coup by nationalists who ''sought to establish a dictatorship - not a democracy - by naked force and through militant nationalism.'' **********Although his draft platform reportedly called for lifting the party's categorical objection to private ownership of industry and farmland, his speech did not touch on this point and it did not figure in the debate excerpted tonight by Tass."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/04/business/futures-options-precious-metals-are-down-while-crude-oil-prices-rise.html": {"writer_name": "H.

Most of rises are expected to be about 7 percent, with fares to some areas of the world going as high as 8 percent. **********While the increases are subject to approval by the governments of the nations where a carrier flies, such approval is expected quickly. **********The carriers in the United States are expected to seek antitrust immunity from the Transportation Department to consult with one another and raise their fares. **********A Strong Case **********The airlines have a strong argument in seeking the higher fares, since increased fuel prices quickly affect the cost of an airline's operations. Fuel makes up 20 percent to 30 percent of an airline's operating cost, depending upon the age of the fleet and the length of the carrier's routes. **********Carriers have little capacity to store fuel and therefore have little choice but to pay market prices, which have risen recently. **********Dennis Eklof, a senior consultant at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Cambridge, Mass., said yesterday that Kuwait had invested heavily in sophisticated refining capacity and had become a big supplier of jet fuel. **********The loss of the capacity, along with the added demand for jet fuel created by the military buildup of the United States in the Middle East, he said, was ''severely straining the capacity to make jet fuel on a worldwide basis.'' **********Thus the pressure on prices for jet fuel have been greater than other products like gasoline, which is in less demand after the peak summer driving season. **********Rises May Not Be Enough **********Edward J. Starkmann, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc., said yesterday that the latest increases would not cover the airlines' added costs and that they might have to seek additional increases if the crisis in the Middle East persisted. **********Mr. Starkmann said that the fare increases on international routes tended to be more ''monolithic'' and that they would be felt by the business traveler as well as vacationers paying discount fares. **********The increases would also come during a slow period of travel for the industry but one during which most travelers are going on business.

Eagleburger. He acknowledged in recent Congressional testimony that the repression continued after his visits to China, that there has been no ''rapid payoff'' from Mr. Bush's policy and that China has no plan to lift martial law in Tibet. Mr. Eagleburger secretly visited Beijing with Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, in July and December. **********Getting Worse, Not Better **********Administration officials say the crackdown has become harsher in the last few months, with more surveillance of dissidents, more political education classes for students, more restrictions on overseas study and more persecution of the Roman Catholic Church and other religious groups. **********In addition, the officials said, the Government has recently purged or punished many Chinese journalists and police officials who expressed support for the democracy movement or did not take a firm stand against it. **********Administration officials said they hoped that, by openly expressing their disappointment with China, they could coax Beijing to end the abuse of human rights. **********In a surprise to the Administration, trade with China was booming even as repression increased there. Commerce Department data show that Chinese exports to the United States rose 42 percent last year, to a total of $12 billion. Much of the increase occurred in the second half of 1989, despite the killings in and near Tiananmen Square early in June. The Beijing authorities have been hard pressed to obtain convertible currency to pay off foreign-debt obligations. **********Personal Embarrassment to Bush **********For Mr. Bush, these developments represent a special problem because he invested a lot of political standing in defending his China policy and risked his reputation as someone knowledgeable about the country, where he served as chief of the United States mission in 1974 and 1975. **********Mr. Bush now voices such disappointment, sometimes even irritation, but has no new policy. In an interview with NBC News last week, he acknowledged that ''there hasn't been much'' give yet by the Chinese, and he said, ''I wish there would be more.'' **********His criticism of China is far milder than that in the State Department's annual report on human rights, which sharply assailed Chinese abuses. ''I believe I know how to go about trying to see things move forward again,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Some think isolation -bring them to heel by publicly slapping people. I think I know China well enough to know that this isn't the way to do it.'' **********Beijing vilified Mr. Bush for allowing the State Department to issue the report. It further strained relations with Washington this week when it expelled an American businessman, John P. Cragin, on a charge of conducting ''illegal religious instruction.'' China said he had done ''missionary work under the guise of holding English-language- training courses in Tianjin since October 1989.'' **********How State Dept. Sees It **********A State Department official said: ''We hoped there would be more of a response to the President's overtures. We are still hoping. The people in power in China today fear that if they do the things we would like them to do to heal the wounds of last June, they will jeopardize their own personal positions.'' **********The increase in trade between China and the United States would have been impossible if Congress had imposed stiff economic sanctions, as many lawmakers advocated last summer. Mr. Bush persuaded Congress to hold off, arguing that commercial contacts were good because they ''have led, in essence, to this quest for more freedom'' in China. **********''The Chinese are desperately trying to increase exports,'' said Jan M. Whisler, an economist at the United States International Trade Commission. ''China must now depend almost entirely on export revenues for the hard currency needed to service its foreign debt of nearly $40 billion.'' Major payments on the debt are due this year. **********A new fight looms in June over trade benefits. China's most-favored-nation status, which generally guarantees the lowest possible tariffs on exports to the United States, is scheduled to expire July 2. Administration officials say Mr. Bush will seek a regular annual extension of that status for China. Many in Congress are already gearing up to resist. At least six bills have been introduced to suspend or terminate China's status as a most favored nation. **********Use of 'Forced Labor' **********Senate Republicans are collecting evidence to show that some of China's exports, particularly textiles, were produced in prisons and labor camps. Federal law prohibits the importing of any goods produced in a foreign country by ''forced labor'' or ''convict labor.'' Textiles accounted for $3.2 billion of the $12 billion in Chinese exports to the United States last year. **********Roger W. Sullivan, president of the United States-China Business Council, a trade association of 300 American companies doing business there, said there would be ''a very strong challenge by Congress to renewal of most-favored-nation status for China.'' **********Although quick to acknowledge that Mr. Bush has not achieved his objectives, White House officials are sensitive to criticism of the President's China policy. **********Mr. Scowcroft complains bitterly that his toast ''to U.S.-Chinese friendship,'' at a banquet in Beijing on Dec. 9, has been misread as an endorsement of the military crackdown. Likewise, Douglas H. Paal, the senior specialist on China at the National Security Council, severely criticized a report on China issued last month by Asia Watch, a human rights group. When Is Ferocity Restraint?  Mr. Paal marked up a copy of the report with marginal commentary, like a professor's comments on a student's essay. Asia Watch said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army had shown ''ferocity'' in suppressing the democracy movement. **********Mr. Paal wrote: ''Some of the P.L.A. actions were indeed ferocious - other units at other times did show great restraint.'' **********Asia Watch said that thousands of peaceful dissenters were being detained in China without trials. Mr. Paal wrote, ''The very fact that so many detainees have not been tried indicates some degree of restraint.'' **********People who originally backed Mr. Bush's policy say they, too, have been disappointed. A. Doak Barnett, professor emeritus of Chinese studies at Johns Hopkins University, said he supported Mr. Bush's effort to ''halt the downward spiral in our relations with China'' by sending Mr. Eagleburger and Mr. Scowcroft to Beijing in December. **********''That mission had valid objectives and was worth trying,'' said Mr. Barnett, who has been studying China for more than four decades. ''But the Chinese have not responded sufficiently to indicate a reversal of repressive trends or to have a significant impact on American public opinion or Congress.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/18/business/cbs-records-chief-seen-in-2-year-pact.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1990-08-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 627, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CBS Records Chief Seen In 2-Year Pact", "print_headline": "CBS Records Chief Seen In 2-Year Pact", "body_text": " **********Walter R. Yetnikoff, the 56-year-old chief executive of CBS Records, has signed a new contract under which he will remain as chief executive for two years and then become a consultant to the company, several top-level industry executives said. **********Mr. Yetnikoff spearheaded the sale of CBS Records to the Sony Corporation of America, a unit of the Sony Corporation, in 1988 and was given a $20 million multiyear contract. **********A spokesman for the Sony Corporation of America said the company would neither confirm nor deny Mr. Yetnikoff's employment arrangements, which were reported in The Wall Street Journal yesterday morning. Mr. Yetnikoff was on vacation and did not return telephone calls. **********Several record industry executives at other companies said that they believed that Mr. Yetnikoff's current salary was about $3 million and that it was likely he would get at least a comparable salary in his new contract. **********These executives added that Mr. Yetnikoff's relations with some of CBS's most widely known performers, including Bruce Springsteen, had deteriorated in recent months. **********Neither Mr. Springsteen's manager, John Landau, nor his lawyer, Allen Grubman, returned telephone calls yesterday. **********The executives also added that Michael Jackson no longer worked with his former manager, John Branca, who was close to Mr. Yetnikoff, and that Mr. Branca's departure could affect the nature of Mr. Jackson's relationship to CBS. Mr. Jackson has recently brought in a new team to handle his affairs. **********''That matters because these singers are legends in the industry,'' said one record industry executive who strongly declined to be identified. He added that news that Mr. Yetnikoff would relinquish the leadership of the company would make him virtually a lame duck for the next two years. **********Reason for Contract Unclear **********Mr. Yetnikoff built the company, and his reputation, in part on his relationships with his superstar talent. But what precisely prompted the restructuring of his contract was not clear. At least one record industry executive said he believed that Mr. Yetnikoff was not unhappy, at least with the financial arrangements of the deal. Michael Shulhof, the head of the Sony Corporation of America, was away and did not return telephone calls. **********Mr. Yetnikoff had long chafed at working for CBS, under both its current chairman, Laurence A. Tisch, and its former president, Thomas H. Wyman. He was outspoken both in his criticism of those executives and in his desire to accumulate capital in any sale of CBS Records. **********The natural successor to Mr. Yetnikoff would be Tommy Mottola, whom Mr. Yetnikoff brought in to replace his longtime associate, Alvin N. Teller, as head of the domestic record company. Under Mr. Mottola, the company has promoted a number of new performers, including New Kids on the Block. **********Record industry executives said that CBS had somewhat recovered from a tough period it suffered last year, when its market share tumbled compared with that of its giant rival, Warner Brothers Records Inc. But Sony does not break out the figures for its record company publicly. Nevertheless, CBS's international businesses are believed to be doing well. And over all, Sony is considered to have made a smart purchase in buying CBS Records. **********Peter Guber, the co-chairman of Sony's Columbia Pictures unit, said yesterday that he knew nothing about Mr. Yetnikoff's plans for departure. But there was speculation yesterday that Mr. Guber and his partner, Jon Peters, would assume overall responsibilites for Sony's record operations as well."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/22/business/company-news-gerber-is-selling-day-care-centers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 135, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Gerber Is Selling Day-Care Centers", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Gerber Is Selling Day-Care Centers", "body_text": " **********The Gerber Products Company said it would sell its 115 day-care centers in another divestiture aimed at getting the company back to the basics of baby food.

With new management from Germany in place, the company's American division is introducing a new ad campaign later this month by Burkhardt & Christy Advertising Inc. of New York. **********BMW's ad spending on motorcycles shriveled last year to only $200,000, as the company's market share dwindled to 2.2 percent. The company expects its sales to increase this year by 30 percent. **********But the Munich-based BMW, or Bayerische Motoren Werke A.G., still has a long way to go to catch Harley-Davidson Inc., the sole American maker of motorcycles, which dominates the market for the powerful large-engine motorcycles known as ''hogs.'' **********Harley, based in Milwaukee, had 59 percent of the market last year. The four large Japanese manufacturers - including the overall industry leader, the American Honda Motor Company - had more than 38 percent of the market. About a third of the 260,000 motorcycles sold last year were these big bikes, according to the Motorcycle Industry Council, a trade group based in Irvine, Calif. **********The motorcycle business foundered in the 1980's as the population aged, depriving the industry of many of its traditional young customers, and because the average price of a motorcycle rose sharply, to about $4,000. **********Harley, whose powerful bikes can cost double or triple the average, benefited in part from a high tariff on similar Japanese motorcycles. But it also successfully marketed its born-in-the-U.S.A. and ''Born to be Wild'' images to an older, tamer consumer. Some in the industry called these college-educated, affluent new Harley buyers ''Attila the Stockbroker.'' **********BMW says some of these older consumers may not be attracted to Harley's image. ''Harley triggers more of a machismo thing, a wild outlaw image,'' said Ron Burkhardt, a principal with Burkhardt & Christy, which BMW hired last year. ''BMW has a more conservative, more serious high-tech image.'' **********Hans Koudella, who became the director of marketing for BMW of North America's motorcycle business last October, says it somewhat differently. ''Harley's success is based on a mixture of American pride and interest in a classical, but not high-tech, motorcycle,'' he said. ''We are not selling a hot bike; we are selling technical proficiency.'' **********Mr. Koudella, the parent company's former worldwide marketing manager for motorcycles, also knew that BMW's reputation in building high-performance cars would help in the marketing for the company's motorcycles. **********But first, Burkhardt & Christy had to convince people that BMW made motorcycles in the first place. It was an embarrassing lapse for a company whose first business was motorcycles and considers the United States its most important foreign market. **********Where BMW once advertised only in motorcycle enthusiast publications, like Cycle magazine, it now advertises in ''life style'' magazines, like Skin Diver and Yachting. In marketing lingo, the potential BMW customer was an ''outdoor energetic.'' **********Mr. Burkhardt said, ''Our whole strategy was to get the doctor, the lawyer and the other professionals who would be interested in BMW motorcycles, if they only knew that BMW made motorcycles.'' **********The agency also had to address the high price of BMW cycles - $6,000 to $13,500. With the increasing value of the German mark lifting the lofty price of BMW's, the company saw its motorcycle sales plunge from a peak of 5,000 in 1986 to just 2,600 last year. **********This year, sales are expected to reach 3,380 and approach 4,000 next year. Customer traffic at BMW's 180 dealers - Harley has more than triple the number - has risen by as much as 40 percent. **********The agency devised a slogan that addressed the high price tag as one of value: ''Worth the obsession.'' **********In advertising that began this month, BMW is putting new emphasis on the motorcycle rider. Previous ads emphasized the sleek aerodynamic lines of the motorcycle. ''The old ads were all right, but they seemed somewhat aloof,'' Mr. Koudella. One new ad says: ''Remember adrenalin?

''It will be a great benefit to us.'' **********The agreement, signed in Paris today by Polish officials and the nation's government creditors, would stretch the payments of interest and principal over 14 years. **********''It's the most extraordinary agreement we have ever had,'' said Jean-Claude Trichet, the chairman of the Paris Club and head of the French Treasury. ''It indicates the confidence that the governments have in Poland.'' **********The Paris Club has rescheduled the payment of debt for many nations, mostly in Africa, Asia and Latin America. But the Polish accord involves the largest amount of debt ever rescheduled by the club. **********'An Exceptional Case' **********Obviously aware of the reaction their generous decision might bring in other debt-troubled countries of Eastern Europe and South America, Poland's Western creditors said in a communique that they were ''convinced that Poland was an exceptional case'' and were impressed by its ''very courageous'' economic program. **********Poland has leapt ahead of other Eastern European countries in seeking to transform its economy from Communism to capitalism and has taken painful steps like allowing layoffs and bankruptcies, lifting price controls and slashing subsidies to industry and consumers. [A watchdog group including Western nations has agreed to start relaxing controls on the export of sophisticated technology to Eastern Europe, but the United States has insisted that some concessions not yet apply to the Soviet Union, Western officials at the meeting said.

West Germany is the largest creditor; the United States ranks behind Britain and France. Most of the rest of the $13 billion in foreign hard-currency debt is to private interests. **********Terms of the Agreement **********Under today's agreement, the payment of $3.4 billion overdue at the end of last year will be rescheduled, as will all the interest and principal repayments due until the end of March 1991. Polish officials said the agreement allows this $9.4 billion to be repaid over 14 years, with an eight-year grace period on the payment of principal. **********One Polish official estimated that this would reduce Poland's annual debt repayments to about $1.1 billion. Poland's debt service has amounted to about $3 billion a year, but in recent years the country has fallen behind and paid only about half that amount annually. **********Officials also said that under the agreement Poland would repay no money at all during the next 12 months. **********A Plea to Bank Creditors **********Mr. Trichet called on commercial banks that are also creditors of Poland to follow the lead of the Paris Club and offer similarly generous debt-relief measures. The club wants the commercial banks to postpone all interest payments that Poland owes them for an extended period. **********Last week, Poland's Prime Minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, sent a letter to the heads of government of the creditor nations asking that all of Poland's debt repayments be postponed this year and that the creditors work to reduce Poland's debt through forgiveness or other means. **********Poland's Vice Minister of Finance, Janusz Sawicki, said the agreement was a vote of confidence in Poland, but he said the problem of reducing Poland's debt remains. **********At his news conference today in Paris, Mr. Trichet also said, ''We have already decided that we have a moral commitment not to leave Poland without a good new agreement after March 1991.'' **********Mr. Trichet said a task force was being formed to study means of debt reduction as well as future debt rescheduling. **********The agreement announced today comes on the heels of other major Western assistance efforts for Poland.

By late in the day the securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.66 percent. **********Other Signs of Weakness **********The interest rates were not the only sign of weakness. **********Demand was tepid, with $8.16 billion worth of bids received. By comparison, the last Treasury auction of 30-year bonds, in November, brought $20.4 billion in bids for the $10 billion in bonds that were sold. **********And the Resolution Funding Corporation's first sale of $4.5 billion of 30-year bonds in October generated $12.9 billion in bids. **********Moreover, the bids on yesterday's issue covered an unusually wide range. **********Nearly 60 percent of the bids were at a price to yield 8.65 percent, while the low bids came in at a price to yield 8.55 percent.

''It's very ugly.'' **********Officials Satisfied **********Still, officials at Refcorp, as Resolution Funding is known in the credit markets, said they were satisifed. **********''We shaved 12 basis points off the bonds sold in October,'' said William S.

Gorbachev said today that ending the Communist Party monopoly on power in the Soviet Union would not be a ''tragedy.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev was speaking at the end of a tense three-day visit to defiant Lithuania, where despite warnings from Moscow the parliament has legalized rival political parties and where the Communist Party has declared itself independent of the national party in Moscow. **********''I don't see any tragedy in a multiparty system if it arises and actually answers the interests of society,'' Mr. Gorbachev said in response to a question at an often stormy meeting with several hundred Lithuanian Communists. **********'Should Not Be Afraid' **********''We should not be afraid of it, the way the devil is of incense,'' he said, adding that a multiparty system ''should not be artificially imposed.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev has strongly opposed efforts to end the Communist Party's constitutionally guaranteed domination, arguing that the party is the only force capable of uniting the country in a period of political and economic crisis. **********Lithuania has been a persistent political problem for the Soviet leader, and people here have increasingly called for independence from Moscow. After three days of travel and meetings in the republic, Mr. Gorbachev failed to persuade Communists here to reverse their decision last month to break with the central party in Moscow or to reconsider their calls for an independent Lithuanian state. **********Election Due Next Month **********The Lithuanian Communists' decision was made after the party's prestige and membership began to drop sharply as Lithuanians calling for greater freedom saw the party as a tool in Moscow's hands. The party suffered widespread defeats in elections last March to a new Soviet Parliament and made the break from Moscow partly in an attempt to prevent similar embarrassments in elections next month for the republic's legislature. **********Today's meeting with members of the breakaway party and Communists who chose to remain loyal to Moscow was Mr. Gorbachev's final attempt to convince people of the dire consequences of secession from the Soviet Union. **********While acknowledging, as he has several times these last few days, that each republic has the constitutional right to secede, Mr. Gorbachev warned that the republic was ill-prepared for such a course. **********'Think a Thousand Times' **********''Think a thousand times before embarking on an independent drift, without a compass, without a map, reserves of fuel and a competent crew,'' he said. ''You cannot drop people on an iceberg and say, 'Let them swim.' '' **********At today's meeting, which was broadcast live on Lithuanian television and radio and was reported as the main item on the national evening news from Moscow, Mr. Gorbachev reflected the various postures he has taken during his trip, organized as a fact-finding mission after the Communist Party's Central Committee failed to agree on a response to the Lithuanians' defiant split. **********Mr. Gorbachev joked with the people in the hall, chastised them, appealed to them and lectured them. In one of his most fervent pleas to the listeners to abandon their drive for independence, he said, ''There is no absolute freedom, and you will not find absolute independence anywhere even with a high-powered telescope.'' **********This was far from a passive audience, and even before Mr. Gorbachev began his address speaker after speaker told him firmly that they remained convinced of the correctness of their choice despite the intensive visit by Mr. Gorbachev and a 40-member Moscow delegation. **********''Maybe we are taking a risk,'' said the party chief from the port city of Klaipeda, ''but we cannot just sit on our hands.'' **********Worker Criticizes Gorbachev **********Although the purpose of the trip was to assess the mood among Communists in the republic, to understand better why so many chose to reject Moscow's control, the focus became the popular movement in the republic toward secession. **********A factory worker sharply criticized Mr. Gorbachev for spending his time in Lithuania lecturing people rather than listening. **********''We know your ideas,'' he said. ''You should have listened to our ideas.'' **********''I already know your opinion,'' Mr. Gorbachev snapped back. **********Vladislav Sved, the temporary leader of the party's pro-Moscow faction, called the decision by his former colleagues ''illegitimate'' but said it was a reality the party leadership had to deal with. **********'Psychological Pressure' Cited **********One speaker said the pro-independence forces in the party applied ''psychological pressure'' in Lithuania, preventing people from comfortably disagreeing with them. **********''If this is where freedom and independence begin,'' he said, ''then excuse me, where are we going?'' **********Mostly the speakers today chiseled away at arguments Mr. Gorbachev presented in trying to make a case for pursuing the goal of independence through a radically restructured Soviet Union. **********Kazimiera Prunskiene, deputy prime minister and a leader of the newly independent Lithuanian party, said Lithuania had to make decisions based on current realities, not on a promised federation that does not yet exist. **********''If our arguments about the secession of Lithuania from the Soviet Union under today's conditions and the independence of the Communist Party of Lithuania are not convincing,'' she told Mr. Gorbachev, ''then think how skeptical we are of a new union whose plan we have never seen.'' **********Little Party Change Seen **********Algirdas Brazauskas, the leader of the breakaway Lithuanian party, explained that it had split with Moscow because the Communist Party as a whole ''had changed little'' in the last few years when Mr. Gorbachev began directing a restructuring of the country's economic and political life. **********''Time waits for no one, as life shows,'' Mr. Brazauskas said, adding, ''Different times require different decisions.'' **********In his speech, Mr. Gorbachev rebuked Mr. Brazauskas, saying, ''If nothing had happened in the party, we would not be speaking today about this subject.'' **********He also challenged Mr. Brazauskas to say how the Moscow authorities had interfered with his work in Lithuania. **********Mr. Gorbachev and the Central Committee delegation have apparently decided to hold off on any decision about the party's relationship with the Lithuanian Communists.

The opposition Islamic Salvation Front adopted the trabendos, organizing relations between buyers and sellers. **********So it is no surprise that Nasreddin, who would not give his full name, is one of nearly six million Algerians who voted on June 12 for the fundamentalist Islamic Front in Algeria's first free elections since the nation won independence from France in 1962. **********An Unexpected Victory **********Sweeping aside predictions that it could win no more than 30 percent against the ruling National Liberation Front, the Islamic Salvation Front, known by its French initials, F.I.S., received almost 65 percent of the popular vote. It won 55 percent of 15,000 municipal posts throughout the country and took control of Algiers and 32 of the country's 48 provinces. The ruling party was a distant second, and the eight other parties hardly made a mark. **********''I voted for the F.I.S. out of revenge,'' said Jamal Merouane, an electrician in his mid-30's who left his Government job three years ago to drive a taxi because his salary was too low, inflation too high and promotions given only to those connected to the ruling party. **********''In this country, if you are a young man like these kids at the trabendo markets, you only have four choices: you can remain unemployed and celibate because there are no jobs and no apartments to live in; you can work in the black market and risk being arrested; you can try to emigrate to France to sweep the streets of Paris or Marseilles, or you join the F.I.S. and vote for Islam,'' Mr. Merouane said over a cup of coffee in a neighborhood cafe. **********A week after the elections, the growing consensus of Algerians and foreign diplomats here is that the fundamentalist triumph is only the beginning of a long period of severe social unrest as secular Algerians and fundamentalists battle for the hearts and minds of the people of this North African country. **********'The New Generation' **********''God rest the soul of the National Front for the Liberation of Algeria,'' said Yousfi Abdelbaqi, a former National Liberation Front supporter and veteran of the war for independence from France, led by the front, known as the F.L.N., from 1954 to 1962. ''The Islamic movement is the true heir of the F.L.N. This is the new generation, which has had enough of the parasites that demolished the F.L.N. I wish them luck, but it really does not matter, because they are here to stay.'' **********The Islamic Front has been vague about its policies. What is clear so far is that it has struck an alliance of sorts with Algeria's merchants and seems to espouse a free market. Some of its leaders, describing a woman's primary role as rearing a family, have suggested that women limit themselves to jobs like nursing or teaching. **********But whether they agree with the Islamic Front or not, most Algerians are thrilled and proud of the difference the free ballot has made in their lives. In this capital, there is a sense of excitement that can only be experienced in the aftermath of a genuine revolution. **********Even educated, cosmopolitan Algerian women, who are the first to argue that Islamic fundamentalism represents a direct threat to their future, do not regret the outcome of the elections. **********''The most important thing is that people are free to talk, to express their views,'' said Dalida Ramadani, a 24-year-old chemistry student at Houari Boumediene University who voted for the National Front. ''The fear has gone.'' She vowed to fight any fundamentalist attempt to force her to wear a veil or stay at home. **********''I want to see if the F.I.S. will respect the freedom of others, if they can rebuild the country's economy,'' she said in the midst of a heated conversation with supporters of the Islamic Front and other parties. ''If they can do it, why not support them? We are all for a good, honest administration and for democracy.'' **********Algeria's President, Chadli Benjedid, is under mounting pressure to dissolve Parliament, which is exclusively made up of National Front members and has little claim to legitimacy in the aftermath of the vote. But many opponents of the Islamic Front say Parliament should not be dissolved for at least six months, to allow secularists to reorganize. **********No matter what happens next, everyone agrees that in today's Algeria the only organized political force is the Islamic Front, which draws on a network of 9,000 mosques across the country. **********''For the next five years there is no alternative to the fundamentalist movement in Algeria,'' said Ammar Ben Hemmer, an editorial writer for the National Front's newspaper. ''The only thing we have to do is make sure that Islam does not turn to fundamentalist militancy, because in this country Islam has always been a tolerant religion.'' **********For West's Leaders, A Grave Quandary **********For the West, the events of Algeria pose a grave quandary. The Mediterranean countries of Western Europe, particularly France, are already struggling to absorb the estimated four million legal and illegal Arab immigrants from North Africa. Now they worry about another huge influx, this time of Algerians fleeing Islamic fundamentalism. **********''For France, Algeria is already what Mexico is to the United States,'' a senior Western diplomat said. **********Western envoys concede that the democracy movement, something they have championed in Eastern Europe and Latin America, is producing something quite different in North Africa -a virulent brand of anti-Western Muslim fundamentalism. **********Many said the momentum gained by the Islamic Front and similarly militant Islamic movements already active in other North African countries like Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt may be unstopable. **********''Islamic fundamentalists are the primary political force in the Arab world today,'' said Francois Burgat, who has written a book on Islam in North Africa and who came here to observe the elections and analyze their aftermath. ''Islamic discourse has become the only nationalistic discourse today.'' **********But a senior West German diplomat said, ''The point is that they have had absolutely free democratic elections here, even though the party benefiting from this does not believe in freedom.'' **********Strikes and Lines: A Bitter Economy **********Monday, noon: As the hot sun bakes Algiers, the smell of uncollected garbage is getting stronger. Sanitation workers have been on strike for more than a week, demanding higher wages. There have been no newspapers for days because drivers and deliverers have also been on strike. Long lines of cars are lined up at the few gasoline stations still working; most workers at the Government oil monopoly, Naftal, are on strike too. And at hospitals only urgent cases are treated, because doctors have been striking. **********If not for the trabendos, most Algerians could not get everyday items -including spare parts, batteries, cooking oil and light bulbs - that are legally obtained only by the ruling elite. **********''The Government has nothing in the stores,'' said Nasreddin, the merchant in the Aguiba market. ''You cannot find a razor in Algiers, and they arrest us for selling things people need. You just wait. This place is going to blow up like Ceausescu. It is going to be another Romania here.'' **********With $27 billion in foreign debt, Algeria is spending nearly 70 percent of its estimated $10 billion annual oil revenue to pay off the debts and interest, leaving precious little to pay for new housing, schools and jobs. **********''The country is falling apart,'' said Larbi Alilat, a winning candidate from the secular Rally for Culture and Democracy, which is vehemently opposed to both the ruling National Front and the fundamentalists. ''I think Chedli and his ministers would like nothing better now than to leave, provided there is no accounting for their past mistakes.'' **********''What we need now is a government of transition, made up of acceptable figures from several parties, that will normalize the situation and stabilize democracy,'' Mr. Alilat said. But on Monday his party rejected an invitation from the National Front to join its ranks. **********Is Running Algeria Simply Impossible? **********But a Government minister who declined to be identified thinks that the fundamentalists will fail, too. ''Of course allowing the F.I.S. to go ahead and institute its social program in the municipalities will be controversial and very messy,'' he said. ''But the question is, Can they pick up the garbage? Can they create housing? Is their anti-French rhetoric going to pay our debts to France? Our best estimate is that they simply cannot run the country, because they have no programs, no experience and no easy solutions to the lack of money and jobs. It is better to open the abscess now and clean it up rather than to sit on millions of people who believe, rightly or wrongly, that Islam is the answer to everything.'' **********In Islamic fundamentalist circles, word has gone out in several neighborhoods to pitch in and pick up the accumulated garbage. And just to make sure that they are not blamed for the economic mess, many Islamic Front candidates are demanding audits of the bankrupt municipal governments they are about to inherit from the National Front. **********On Friday, in an address to a huge flock of the faithful who came to celebrate their victory at the Abelhamid Ibn Badis mosque in Al Kuba, a fiery leader of the Islamic Front, Ali Belhaj, cautioned his followers not to be too confident of victory until more battles were won. **********''We have won the votes, but can we win in the field?'' he asked. ''Votes come and go, but deeds and proper behavior are never overlooked or forgotten.'' **********An eventual Islamic triumph here still depends on many factors. **********Many Algerians who opposed the Islamic Front say they are confident that Algeria's army, silent so far, will act if necessary. If secularists fail to stop the Islamic wave, it is said, the army will stage a coup, forcibly suppressing fundamentalists and reinstituting a military dictatorship. **********In October 1988, Algeria's generals supported the Government and faced hundreds of thousands of youths who took over the streets of all major cities and towns for the better part of 10 days protesting against the country's drifting policies. Thousands were wounded and at least 100 were killed. Will the army do it again? ''Absolutely not,'' said Tomasz Wojewoda, a counselor at the Polish Embassy here, who said he spoke with the experience of his own country in mind. ''The time for this kind of thing has passed, not only here but in the whole world.'' **********The Government minister said a coup would be pointless, partly because there was nothing the army could do about the disastrous economic situation. Besides, he said, it is too early to pronounce Algeria an Islamic republic. **********''We don't want a blood bath here,'' he said. ''At what price should we deny democracy in Algeria?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/08/business/your-money-returning-to-cash-in-uncertain-time.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-12-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 874, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Your Money; Returning to Cash In Uncertain Time", "print_headline": "Your Money; Returning to Cash In Uncertain Time", "body_text": " **********For uneasy investors, it may make sense to lighten up on portfolio holdings before the end of the year, combining tax and market strategies. **********\"With the continued uncertainties over war and recession and job stability, a lot of people are interested in cash right now,\" said George E. L. Barbee, executive director of personal financial services for Price Waterhouse. \"We're finding that mindset.\" And comments from market professionals show there is good reason for that view. **********Edward A. Taber 3d, director of T. Rowe Price's taxable bond division, said at his firm's briefing this week on the 1991 investment and economic outlook, \"The more risk you took, the less reward you got\" in 1990, and that could continue early next year. So far this year money market funds have had a 6.5 percent return, he noted, while high-yield funds have lost 11.5 percent, and long Treasury funds have returned only 1.3 percent. **********Paul W. Boltz, the firm's economist, saw a mild recession, beginning in this quarter and lasting two or three quarters, with a slight drop in short-term interest rates. He expects the Fed to tighten credit as recovery sets in, but he sees an outside possibility of a severe recession, should war break out in the Persian Gulf or a major bank fail. **********John H. Laporte, president of Price's New Horizons and New America Growth funds, concurred, saying, \"We think the bear market has farther to go.\" But he added, \"The stock market as usual will begin to recover well before the economy.\" He added that small growth stocks, which have been battered this year, could lead a cyclical recovery in 1991, so he advised investors to focus on growth companies with high financial returns and assured earnings growth. **********Investors should inventory their portfolios,determining paper losses and gains, and identify candidates for sale, Mr. Barbee said, and then decide whether to move into a cash position like a Treasury bill or C.D. or to reinvest in the market. **********If a portfolio has both losses and gains, an investor can use the losses to offset the gains, so that cash is raised without incurring tax liability on the gains. Also, net capital losses of up to $3,000 can offset ordinary income, so from a tax standpoint, he said, \"it makes sense to admit to yourself you were wrong and sell.\" **********\"It is paramount to run some calculations before the end of the year and see if there is an A.M.T. situation,\" Mr. Barbee added, referring to the alternative minimum tax, which is intended to make sure that no taxpayer with substantial income avoids taxation. **********The rate is 21 percent, compared with a normal 28 percent or 33 percent, but a number of tax breaks that are allowed in regular tax calculations are taken away. As a result, those who are snared have a larger taxable income and fewer deductions than they would have under regular rules. **********The reason to see if there is an alternative tax liability is that the three things most likely to subject a taxpayer to it are commonly considered inyear-end planning. They are: sizable state and local taxes, the exercise of incentive stock options and the donation of appreciated property to charity. The timing of these items is often the opposite for regular taxpayers and those subject to the alternative tax. **********For regular taxpayers, appreciated securities, for example, may be deducted at market value -- and making such a contribution at year-end can be an effective way to help a favorite charity and lower one's tax bill. But for those subject to the alternative tax, the deduction is based on the original cost. Therefore, if a taxpayer were to be subject to the alternative tax this year but not next year, it might be a good idea to delay the donation until January. **********As for gifts of valuable artwork, the new tax law provides a one-year window in 1991 in which donors will not be subject to the alternative tax. **********Sam Radin, president of the National Madison Group, which advises lawyers on tax and estate planning, noted that for regular high-income taxpayers it might be advisable to wait until early January to fulfill a 1990 charitable pledge because the deduction will be worth more in 1991, when it will be taxed at 31.93 percent after the phase-out of all exemptions, compared with 28 percent in 1990. **********\"The value of a $100,000 charitable deduction in 1990 is $28,000; in 1991 it is $31,930,\" he said. The difference \"represents a 14.04 percent net after-tax return -- with no risk.\"  'What If' Tax Strategies **********Probably the fastest way to try \"what if\" tax strategies is to use income tax software in a personal computer. Turbo Tax from Chip Soft, which has been the best-selling program for I.B.M. and compatible machines in recent years, has also introduced a Macintosh version this year. **********Headstart versions are now on retail shelves. A big plus for this program is that it has 1991 tax rates as well as 1990's, so that in the planning mode users can see what the effect would be of recognizing income or taking a deduction this year versus next year, for example."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/15/world/albania-reportedly-sends-troops-to-halt-riots.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-12-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 368, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Albania Reportedly Sends Troops to Halt Riots", "print_headline": "Albania Reportedly Sends Troops to Halt Riots", "body_text": " **********Albanian troops were sent into the central city of Elbasan today to halt a mob of about 1,000 as rioting continued in Albania for a second day, journalists said. **********Official Albanian radio confirmed the unrest in Elbasan, about 20 miles southeast of the Albanian capital, Tirana. The radio said six members of the security forces were injured by stones and that two were in the hospital. **********The Albanian news media also reported that 10 people were hurt, 30 were arrested and extensive damage occurred on Thursday in seven hours of vandalism and looting in the northern city of Shkoder. **********An editor of the Albanian A.T.A. news agency said that Elbasan, a city of about 80,000 residents with a giant steel mill, was quiet tonight after soldiers and security forces moved in.

But this week the Federal Reserve Board reported that helped by a jump in auto sales, industrial production rose two-tenths of 1 percent in September, and it revised its figures upward for July and August, showing a slightly rising trend for the third quarter. **********The basic trend in the overall economy right now can be described as wiggling around zero. The consensus forecast of the 50 economists surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators calls for real G.N.P. to decline six-tenths of 1 percent in the current quarter and one-tenth of 1 percent in the first quarter of 1991, which would technically make it a recession. But the consensus calls for recovery to start in the second quarter of 1991 and pick up gradually as the year wears on. **********There is still some chance, however, that we can pull ourselves out of the current morass. Most important, the Fed is likely to bring down interest rates once a budget agreement between the Administration and Congress is set. **********The Fed is worried about a credit crunch that could dump the economy into recession and crack its financial structure. In his Congressional testimony last July, Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, said: ''We have been closely watching various interest rate spreads and other indicators to determine if the pulling back of commercial banks to less lax lending standards is moving over the line, so to speak, and in effect creating a tightening in credit markets independent of actions by the Federal Reserve.'' His conclusion: a tightening ''of modest dimensions may be occurring.'' **********Since then, the danger to borrowers and banks alike has increased. As James J. O'Leary, economic consultant to the United States Trust Company of New York, puts it, ''Many commercial banks and life insurance companies, including many large ones, are seriously undercapitalized, raising the risk of insolvencies as large loan losses continue.'' Hard pressed for reserves, and nervous about nonperforming loans, many banks are turning down borrowers who once would have been considered creditworthy. **********A tightening of private credit has the same impact on the economy as a tightening by the Fed, as Mr. Greenspan has made clear. To prevent the system from seizing up, and falling, many businesses say, the Fed should make more reserves available and bring down interest rates. **********After the lending binge of the 1980's, the restoration of stricter lending standards is necessary and healthy. But the Fed is now worrying about signs that the banking system is contracting more than it should and endangering the economy. **********However, the Fed still believes that the money-supply indicator it watches most closely - M-2, which includes currency in circulation and demand deposits plus time and savings deposits - is growing adequately, within its 1990 target range of 3 to 7 percent. But M-2 is in the lower half of that range, and has been slowing. A more decisive move toward easing by the Fed may be needed to prevent a worsening credit crunch that would chop into the nation's money supply. **********The gulf crisis and the surge in oil prices have stirred both recessionary and inflationary fears. But higher oil prices have also spurred spending in the United States for oil drilling and production. And, assuming no further acceleration in oil prices or, preferably, a continuation of the decline that set in this week, the prospects of recovery in 1991 will be strengthened. **********The biggest risk to this forecast of sluggish growth or moderate recession through the rest of this year and early next year, followed by a gradual recovery, is the threat of a financial crisis that would result if several major banks were to go under. But it is unlikely that the Federal Reserve, Congress and the Administration would permit that to happen. A more likely outcome involves rescues and mergers of threatened major institutions. **********Another big risk is that of an outflow of foreign capital. Yutaka Yamaguchi, the chief representative in the Americas of the Bank of Japan, that country's central bank, said in an interview in New York that he was not greatly concerned whether the United States was in a slight recession or still growing slightly - it came to much the same thing. What he was worried about, he said, were ''external shocks that could have a negative impact'' on America's highly leveraged corporations and financial institutions. He expressed strong agreement with the Federal Reserve's policy, which he called ''very cautious.'' Too sharp a fall in United States interest rates, while foreign rates are rising, could increase capital outflow. **********This must be the best-advertised, most carefully watched financial contraction ever. That in itself may help to keep it from becoming an economic catastrophe like the one in the early 1930's."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/14/world/press-reports-conflict-on-albanian-turmoil.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-01-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 246, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Press Reports Conflict on Albanian Turmoil", "print_headline": "Press Reports Conflict on Albanian Turmoil", "body_text": " **********Newspapers today quoted an Albanian border guard who fled the country as saying that the security forces had fired on protesters last week and that one city was in a state of ''revolution.'' **********But Yugoslavia's press agency said there was ''nothing unusual'' going on in Albania, just a day after reporting that the authorities there had imposed ''extremely strict'' security measures to prevent unrest. **********The official Albanian press agency also quoted an Italian diplomat as denying that there was unrest in the isolated country.

A man throws a small wooden glider and it immediately crashes at his feet, whereupon a disdainful child chases after him and kicks him in the shins. Badminton players get entangled in their net. And a woman riding a tiny tricycle pedals into a swimming pool. There also are, of course, the obligatory shots of hopelessly inept adults struggling with Hula-Hoops. **********What makes these commercials powerful is watching people make fools of themselves. **********In these commercials, the scenes were not staged. The agency cast about 200 non-actors, whom it found by advertising in local newspapers in the Long Island resort town of East Hampton. Children and adults picked their toys and set out to have a little fun. The goings-on were filmed by cameramen using telephoto lenses. **********\"We had to make sure that people weren't aware they were being photographed,\" said Linda Kaplan, a group creative director at the agency. \"Otherwise they would have been too self-conscious to have fun.\" **********The agency also did not tell people what to do or interfere once the action began. While the strategy paid off with some wonderful candid footage, it also made for a long, tedious production. \"We filmed people for hours when essentially nothing interesting was happening,\" Ms. Kaplan said. **********After the two weeks of shooting for the commercial, many of the toys used were donated to children's hospitals and orphanages. **********This is Thompson's second go-around with Toys \"R\" Us. The agency lost the account six years ago and won it back in March. **********The television campaign is not intended to sell particular toys, said Ernie Speranza, the vice president of marketing and advertising at Toys \"R\" Us Inc., based in Paramus, N.J. \"We leave that to the individual manufacturers.\" he added. \"We want to create a brand-name image for the store as a fun place to go shopping for toys.\" **********With annual sales of about $5 billion, Toys \"R\" Us has a commanding lead in the $15 billion toy market, Mr. Speranza said. **********The company intends to use the commercials in other parts of the world. Toys \"R\" Us has been aggressively expanding in Europe and East Asia and plans to have 100 stores overseas by the end of this year. **********Toys \"R\" Us has also begun its largest print campaign, in which some popular items like Nintendo video games and Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtle toys are spotlighted. The company figures that when times get tough economically, it is the best time to take business from competitors."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/07/world/attack-on-israelis-upsets-palestinians-in-egypt.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1990-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 885, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Attack on Israelis Upsets Palestinians in Egypt", "print_headline": "Attack on Israelis Upsets Palestinians in Egypt", "body_text": " **********The Egyptian authorities said today that the men they suspected of killing nine Israelis in a rifle and grenade attack on a tour bus near here on Sunday were Palestinians. That has come as no comfort to a dwindling minority of 40,000 Palestinians whose roots here, once firm, have weakened with time. **********''Many Palestinians who used to look at Egypt as the refuge feel some resentment at the loss of Egypt as that major haven of support,'' a senior Palestinian said. He said he feared that the Egyptian dragnet for the killers might draw in innocent people. **********The police say the hunt for those who killed the Israelis, who were slain on a main desert highway east of Cairo, has narrowed to a Palestinian who used a Jordanian passport to hire the car used by the assailants. Along with the 9 who died, 17 Israelis were wounded in the attack. A faction of the Islamic Holy War terrorist group in Lebanon took responsibility for the raid. **********Passport Is Discovered **********The passport was discovered in an apartment close to where the abandoned car was found, in a village just north of Cairo. The photograph in the passport has been circulated to the police, who have been ordered to check hotels, car-rental companies and apartment agencies. The driver of the bus was also a Palestinian, police officials said, and he has been detained for questioning about whether he cooperated with the assailants. A second attacker is being sought. **********The use of a Jordanian passport is seen by Western diplomats as significant. With Egypt, Iraq and Yemen, Jordan is a member of the Arab Cooperation Council, whose nationals are not required to have visas to enter the four countries. More than half of Jordan's population is of Palestinian origin. **********On Monday, when the Shiite fundamentalist group in Lebanon took responsibility for the attack, it used a Syrian radio station often associated with a Palestinian extremist movement, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, General Command. **********For some of the Palestinians who live in Egypt and seek to avoid confrontation with the Government, the attack and the identification of Palestinians as the assailants is a burden. **********''We do not want to be singled out, either as a community or as individuals, as terrorists,'' said a Palestinian businessman who asked not to be identified. ''We don't want ordinary Egyptians to come to regard us as people who have brought bloodshed to their land.'' **********The Palestine Liberation Organization representative, Sayed Kamal, denounced the assault and reaffirmed P.L.O. policies prohibiting armed actions outside Israel and the occupied territories. But unease among other Palestinians reflects a sense that their position in Egypt has been eroded by economic pressures, as it has in other Middle Eastern countries. **********The contrast is particularly striking in Cairo. Under Nasser, the first wave of Palestinian refugees after the creation of Israel had special status. Many of the leaders of the P.L.O., including Yasir Arafat, the chairman, were educated here and began their political careers as students. Moreover, said Dr. Nabil Shaath, a prominent Palestinian, in an interview before the raid, Nasser gave Palestinians the same work, property and rights as Egyptians. **********''The community probably never exceeded 100,000, but its quality has deteriorated in terms of education,'' he said. At one time, 40,000 of the 100,000 Palestinians were in Egyptian universities. Now, he said, ''the majority are very poor and because they are uneducated have little mobility.'' **********''Many feel this is part of a much broader Egyptian problem, that Egypt is not in an economic condition that allows largess,'' said Dr. Shaath, a businessman and a member of the Palestine National Council, which the P.L.O. calls a parliament in exile. **********But some Palestinian institutions survive. In a Cairo suburb, 2,000 patients, half of them Palestinians, are treated at the Palestine Hospital, run by the Palestine Red Crescent Society, whose chairman is Fathi Arafat, the younger brother of the P.L.O. chairman. The hospital is in the same Cairo suburb, Heliopolis, as the Egyptian hospital where Israeli wounded were treated after the attack on the bus. **********List of Israeli Dead **********JERUSALEM, Feb. 6 (Special to The New York Times) - The authorities today provided this information on the identities of the slain tourists: **********BERDITCHEV, Leah, 57 years old, of Moshav Ein Vered, no occupation given. **********BERLINER, Ruhama, 48, of Mevasseret Zion, a botanist with Hebrew University. **********BINYAMINI, Issachar, 72, of Tel Aviv, a ceramic artist and construction worker. **********HOROWITZ, Shmuel, 57, of Har Adar, no occupation given. **********MEIRI, Aya, 66, of Tel Aviv, a retired statistician for the Ata Textile Company. **********MIRON, Eli, 39, of Bat Yam, tour guide. **********SCHUMERT, Zvia, 67, of Jerusalem, a retired chemist for Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. **********SHIFTAN, Zeev, 70, of Jerusalem, a retired director of the Hyrological Department of the Tahal water planning company. **********WEISBARD, Eugenia, 72, of Tel Aviv, a retired technician with Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/09/world/guatemala-s-campaign-trail-murder-shadows-candidates.html": {"writer_name": "Lindsey Gruson", "pub_date": "1990-10-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1300, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Guatemala's Campaign Trail: Murder Shadows Candidates", "print_headline": "Guatemala's Campaign Trail: Murder Shadows Candidates", "body_text": " **********Celso Milagro, who was running for Mayor, died on a cobblestone street here, holding the hand of his 3-year-old daughter. **********Mr. Milagro, the popular candidate of the National Center Union, was killed while walking to market several weeks ago by a lone gunman who stepped out of the milling crowd and shot him four times in the chest. **********Revenge was apparently exacted 18 days later. This time Sebastian Morales, a regional director of the ruling Christian Democratic Party, who was backing Mr. Milagro's rival, was the victim. He was passing the small cemetery on his way home from an independence-eve party when he was ambushed and killed. **********The slayings in this hilltop town of 16,000 people 120 miles northwest of Guatemala City reflect the wave of political violence that has swept over Guatemala as it prepares for presidential, legislative and municipal elections in November. **********''Small town, big hell,'' Jorge Skinner Klee, a leading Congressman from the National Center Union, said in an interview in his book-lined Guatemala City study. ''Politics are so much more bitter at the local level. The confrontation is so much more immediate.'' **********The coming election is to lead to a democratic watershed for Guatemala: the first time in the country's history that power is to be transferred from one elected civilian to another. But despite new high-water mark for the democratic process, the campaign is focusing attention on what many here consider as the failures of President Vinicio Cerezo, Guatemala's first civilian President in almost two decades, to build a foundation for democracy. **********Law enforcement is often little more than a political tool. The chief of police in Quiche, the departmental capital, whose responsibilities embrace Jocopilas, said in an interview he had not bothered to open an investigation into the killings. He said he did not see any point in driving the 10 miles to the scene of the crime. **********''We only go to pick up cadavers,'' said a patrolman at police headquarters. **********The spiraling political violence and common crime has coincided with a drawn-out depression, which has left 7 in 10 Guatemalans struggling below the poverty line and aroused demands for political change. The front-runner, in most surveys, is the main opposition party, the National Center Union, an amalgamation of rightists led by Jorge Carpio Nicolle, a Guatemala City newspaper publisher. **********Spur to General's Campaign **********Increasingly, many Guatemalans have begun to equate democracy with anarchy and this is seen as favoring the law-and-order campaign of Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, a former dictator who ruled with an iron fist in the early 1980's, when thousands were killed in his campaign against a leftist insurgency. Among his supporters are many who remember his 16-month tenure not for the death toll or other violence, but for what they recall as its stability. **********''He's an order man, but not a lawman,'' Congressman Klee said in reference to General Rios Montt. **********Despite the polls showing Mr. Carpio to be in the lead, there are many election anaylsts who say it is conceivable that the general could win a majority in the first round of the balloting, provided he can get around a constitutional provision that bars former dictators from coming to power, though it does not keep them from running for office. **********The general's aides are hoping to stall the court response until after the elections on the assumption that the decision of the judges will be less meaningful than the mandate of the electorate. **********Meanwhile, the killings here - and the police chief's reaction - are by no means exceptional. At least one Congressman and several other municipal candidates have been slain as have a couple of prominent businessmen linked to President Cerezo and other leading politicians. **********Most of the victims tend to be far less well-known than the two men killed here. Their mutilated bodies are found in the morning by the roadside and quickly buried as ''XXs,'' a designation that after decades of political violence has become the Guatemalan equivalent of John Doe. **********This society first opened up to political debate and popular organizing in the days after Mr. Cerezo's 1986 inauguration. Increasingly, however, intimidation and fear spread, leading Guatemalans to avoid taking public stances or calling attention to themselves. Although Mr. Milagro was killed on a crowded market street in front of dozens - maybe even hundreds - of witnesses, not one has come forward to identify the killer. **********With real live and thus vulnerable candidates shrinking from public view, the violence has turned the campaign into something of a battle of the billboards, which bedeck almost every vertical surface in the capital and every utility pole in the countryside. **********Traveling With Protection **********Harris Whitbeck, the running mate of General Rios Montt, never travels without what he calls his ''tank'' - a blood-red jeep. Its inch-thick armor and bulletproof glass force him to use the air-conditioning whenever he is in the car and have given him a permanent cold. Congressman Klee, whose great-grandfather came here as a Prussian consul, notes that colleagues call him crazy for walking the couple of blocks from his law office to the legislature. **********''Under current conditions, there can be no democracy for the country -there can only be elections among a small privileged club,'' Philip Heymann, the director of the Center for Criminal Justice at Harvard Law School, said recently in testifying before the United States Congress about why he had decided to abandon a three-year-old effort to build a justice system in Guatemala. **********Here in Jocopilas, Mr. Milagro's murder had led to the near collapse of the Center Union campaign. What began as a serious challenge to the dominant Christian Democrats has turned into something of a beauty contest with one competitor. ''It should have been a civic festival,'' acknowledged Carlos Lopez Giron, the party's senior official in the department. ''But we're not ready. There are lies, rumors and attacks.'' **********Most polls show Mr. Cerezo's Christian Democrats as being widely unpopular. Its candidate, Alfonso Cabrera, handpicked as Mr. Cerezo's successor, is trailing badly. But in a largely illiterate country, the polls are considered little more than an indicator of sentiment in the capital, where about a quarter of the 3.3 million registered voters live. **********Many politicians and analysts predict that the governing party's organizational muscle in rural areas like Jocopilas could propel it into the January runoff, provided none of the 13 candidates receives a majority in the November balloting. **********Constitutional Hurdle **********But first, the country must overcome the looming constitutional crisis posed by General Rios Montt's challenge to the constitutional provision that would seem to preclude his assuming power. **********Mr. Whitbeck, the general's running mate, said their small army of lawyers is planning a barrage of motions to delay a court ruling until after the voting. **********Asked what would happen if the courts deny their petition to be on the ballot, he said: ''If they say no, they'll be saying no in February or March. By then, it will be the will of the people, not part of the politicians' game.'' **********Many Guatemalans fear that such a strategy represents a formula for political chaos. In a country where the recent history is a story of coups, there is widespread speculation about how much turmoil the divided, the politically powerful army would tolerate. **********''For the moment, we've got the devil bottled up in his barracks,'' Congressman Klee said.

Now, accountants report, many clients are asking whether they can file amended returns. **********In one case, Nader Soliman, an anesthesiologist, worked in operating rooms at three hospitals, none of which provided him with office space. So he used one room in his three-bedroom home to keep patient and billing records, medical textbooks and journals, and a telephone and answering machine to keep in contact with surgeons and patients. **********The I.R.S., relying on its traditional test, asserted that the hospitals were the ''focal point'' of Dr. Soliman's business and denied a home-office deduction. The court, applying a new ''facts and circumstances'' test, said he had ''to perform two very different functions: to render medical services at hospitals and to care for administrative chores.'' It allowed the deduction, ruling that ''both functions were equally essential to a successful medical practice,'' and that the second required an office. **********In the second case, applying the facts-and-circumstances test, the Tax Court allowed a musician who earned his living performing in restaurants to deduct the expenses of a home office where he practiced, kept records and recorded music. **********John L. Norman Jr., national director of taxation for Pannell Kerr Forster in Washington, said: ''Quite a few clients heard about it. I think the medical grapevine has been working overtime.'' **********Many people may now qualify for the deduction, he said, like consultants and salespeople, as well as musicians and professionals. But those who take it should realize that ''there is a high probability the service will audit them,'' he said. The I.R.S. has asked the Tax Court to reconsider the decision. **********Still, he said, he advises those who have a reasonable case to take the deduction, provided they can document it and are willing to have their returns scrutinized and to litigate the matter. **********Tim Kochis, national director of personal financial planning for Deloitte & Touche in San Francisco, said, however, that given the I.R.S.'s ''unwillingness to abide by this decision, I wouldn't recommend that it would be a good idea to go back and amend returns with any expectation of success.'' **********Coopers & Lybrand, while noting that some people might be able to claim deductions on amended returns, cautioned clients in a recent newsletter that an office must be a principal place of business and used only for business to be deductible. **********''If you keep your books and records in a den, but the family watches TV there, too, in the evenings, you can't take the deduction,'' the firm said. **********Sidney Kess, a New York lawyer and certified public accountant, said, ''If the court decisions permit it, you should take it, if you qualify.'' As for amending returns, people might wait to see the outcome of the I.R.S. challenge, he suggested. There are ancillary benefits for those who can take the deduction, Mr. Kess said. Unlike commuting costs, transportation expenses between a home office and another place of business are deductible, and it may be easier to write off a computer. **********Fear of Filing **********Some people, overwhelmed because they owe taxes and do not have the money, think they have no choice but to delay filing. Meanwhile, they live in fear of the I.R.S. **********''The I.R.S. has done a very good job of scaring people,'' Mr. Kochis of Deloitte said. ''In some cases they are immobilized.'' **********But the worst thing to do is nothing. If possible, taxpayers should borrow the money and file either the return or Form 4868 for an automatic extension to file, he said. If no loan is available, they should still file and work out a late-payment arrangement with the I.R.S., he said. Form 1127 is used. **********Actually, the interest the I.R.S. will charge is generally lower than interest on personal loans, he added, but for peace of mind most people would rather borrow privately. Failure to file can bring heavy penalties, he noted, as can failure to pay taxes. **********''The overall key in dealing with the I.R.S. is communication,'' said Thomas P. Henry, an Ernst & Young tax partner in Hartford and a former I.R.S. agent. The service views failure to file and to communicate as irresponsible, he said, ''and they take that very seriously.'' **********But people who honestly do not have the money to pay can work out a payment schedule before the matter goes to the collection division, he said. He warned, however, that the I.R.S. would ''not believe a lot of hard-luck stories'' and would attach assets like C.D.'s, stocks or bonds, if they exist. **********''The I.R.S. has much more authority than any general creditor'' to attach assets, he added, and people who lie or try to hide assets can face severe penalties."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/16/business/company-news-investor-seeks-more-of-henley.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 221, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Investor Seeks More of Henley", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Investor Seeks More of Henley", "body_text": " **********Libra Investment Ltd., a Swiss investment firm controlled by the Lebanese investor Toufic Aboukhater, said it would seek Government antitrust clearance to raise its stake in the Henley Group Inc. to 49.9 percent from about 25 percent. **********In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Aboukhater said he had ''no present intention to seek or obtain control'' of Henley, a health and scientific, aerospace and specialty materials company in Hampton, N.H.

Schacht, once hailed as the ''king of the Rust Belt'' for patiently trying to make the Cummins Engine Company as efficient as its Japanese rivals, is under fire. **********His ambitious and expensive five-year plan to revitalize Cummins, undertaken in 1982, has yet to yield any clear benefits for shareholders. And now, the engine maker's largest shareholder wants to know why. Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., which owns 14.9 percent, promises to challenge Mr. Schacht's management performance at the company's annual meeting here on April 3. **********''He's simply not delivered,'' said Bruce A. Hancox, the chairman of Brierley Investments Ltd., the New Zealand conglomerate that owns a majority of the Hong Kong-based Industrial Equity. ''We definitely will be asking some questions.'' **********Faced in the early 1980's with a slackening in demand for diesel engines and reports that the Japanese were about to introduce cheaper models that would compete with Cummins' most popular diesel engines, Mr. Schacht, the chairman and chief executive since 1977, mapped out the $1.1 billion revitalization program. Cummins, founded 70 years ago, is the world's largest independent maker of diesel engines. **********While the 56-year-old Mr. Schacht was lionized for his vision by the media and was added to large corporate boards like the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the Chase Manhattan Bank, his plan, which called for new products, lower prices and streamlined production, has never delivered on its promise. **********Cummins shareholders have enjoyed almost no return on their investment in recent years. In fact, the company has essentially borrowed in 7 of the last 10 years to pay the dividend on its common stock, a situation that the balance sheet can support for only so long. **********''This company is under threat of takeover, not by me, but by the lenders,'' Mr. Hancox said. ''The lenders will own the company. It's being given to them bit by bit every day.'' **********Wall Street analysts agree. ''There's no doubt that the Cummins shareholders continue to be low on the scale of importance,'' said Eli S. Lustgarten of Paine Webber Inc. in New York. **********Neither is David G. Sutliff, a capital-goods analyst with S. G. Warburg & Company, also in New York, enamored of Mr. Schacht's performance. ''The job he's done has been all right, just all right,'' he said. **********Because of Cummins's lackluster performance, Industrial Equity is now questioning Mr. Schacht's level of commitment, given the chairman's involvement on numerous boards, and even the independence of the company's 13-member board, which includes several individuals who serve on other boards. $400 Million Is Too Much Mr. Hancox, for one, says the company's investment of about $400 million a year in research and development and on capital spending should be cut. [The investment works out to about $40 a share per year on what is now a $46 stock, its closing price Monday on the New York Stock Exchange after falling 62.5 cents a share.]  Cummins's anti-takeover tactics are another source of conflict. Though deemed as fair to the shareholders by the company's advisers at Morgan Stanley & Company, the $72 million deal that Cummins orchestrated last July to buy out an uninvited suitor, Hanson P.L.C. of Britain, placed burdens on the company's balance sheet and has been criticized in shareholder lawsuits as unfair. **********The dispute between Cummins management and Industrial Equity could be long and contentious. The Hong Kong company has been a powerful and persistent adversary. And when many corporate raiders have fled the United States, Industrial Equity has made more than 52 large investments in companies here in recent years and has sought to play a more active role in 21 of them, according to a confidential analysis circulated among members of the Cummins board. **********Board Request Is Denied **********But this time, Cummins has been forced to rely on conventional anti-takeover warfare. It has denied Industrial Equity's requests for a seat on its board. It has sued the Hong Kong company over what it contends is its disregard for American securities laws. It has also alerted regulators to possible violations in Industrial Equity's public filings. **********Cummins is unlikely to find an investor to help block a takeover as it did last summer. To thwart Hanson, three members of Cummins's founding family paid Hanson $72 million -paying a $5 million premium - for its 10 percent stake and immediately converted their entire holdings of 1.6 million shares into high-yielding Cummins securities. **********But largely for estate-planning reasons, the Miller family lacks the wherewithal to stage a second rescue. ''It is out of the question,'' said William I. Miller, 33, a spokesman for the family who is also one of Cummins' newest directors. **********Cummins's deteriorating balance sheet has also made it difficult to attract other ''patient investors,'' those whom Mr. Schacht describes as sticking with a cyclical company through its ups and downs. **********'Be Patient' **********Mr. Schacht, who graduated in 1962 with top honors from the Harvard Business School, calls many of Industrial Equity's allegations absurd, but he concedes that the next few months will test his credibility. ''The major responsibility falling on this management at this time is having said 'Be patient,' '' he said. ''We've now got to earn.'' **********He added, ''To the extent we're not able to do it, we'll not have met our responsibilities.'' **********Mr. Schacht insists that Cummins's poor performance is more the result of problems with implementation than with flaws in his vision. **********Mr. Miller, who did not sell his shares in the Hanson transaction, agrees. ''The board of directors has a lot of confidence in what he's doing,'' he said. ''It's been a long and painful implementation of strategy, not all of which has gone perfectly.'' **********Consider what happened last year. The company's sales and earnings in the first two quarters had risen over the previous year, an indication that Mr. Schacht's vision might finally pay off. Several months of modest price increases had generated an extra $80 million in sales volume, almost all of which was expected to fall to the bottom line. **********Big Drop in Sales **********But an abrupt downturn in heavy-duty truck orders hurt sales in the second half of last year. More troubling, Cummins's 1989 warranty expenses totaled $169 million, or 4.9 percent of sales, up from 2.9 percent in 1988 and 1.9 percent the year before. **********Mr. Schacht attributes the change to new technologies that Cummins developed to meet 1991 emissions requirements, design choices that have turned out to have unintended consequences. **********While it is possible that Cummins's competitors will wrestle with similar costs as they improve their own emissions performance, the $71 million increase in warranty expenses over 1988 wiped out most of the $80 million windfall from the price increases. Cummins finished the year with a $6.1 million loss, on sales of $3.5 billion. **********Mr. Schacht moved quickly to cut discretionary costs, and, along with other officers, took a 7 percent pay cut in the fourth quarter on his $450,000-a-year salary. **********Some Allies Bruised **********But the episode was enough to give even some longtime allies pause. ''Can I hold management responsible for the downturn in the heavy truck market?'' said Mr. Miller, the family spokesman who also sits on Cummins's technology subcommittee. ''No, that's not reasonable. Can I for the warranty payments? That's a gray area.'' **********Mr. Schacht cannot easily afford to misstep again.

The half-dozen or so commercials offer a behind-the-scenes look at the Spring Hill plant and the workers who gave up jobs elsewhere and uprooted their families to join the Saturn project. The campaign is the first step - and the most logical, according to Riney executives and others in the industry - in Saturn's effort to create an image of an American-built car that is just as good as Honda's Civic or Toyota's Corolla. **********''We'd sell every Saturn built if we could bring everyone to Tennessee and show them the plant, let them touch the car, and let them sense the dedication,'' said Patrick Sherwood, senior vice president at Riney and the agency's director for the Saturn account, estimated to be worth $100 million yearly. ''We can't do that, but we can bring Spring Hill to Los Angeles, Portland or wherever.'' **********It is not entirely new territory for advertising. For years, Ford, fighting an early 1980's image problem, has promoted ''quality'' as its ''job one'' in commercials filmed on the assembly line. **********The Saturn Corporation also has a problem with its image: it does not have one. The number of people who know about the division is minuscule. So the most expedient way to build name recognition for Saturn and create the idea that the cars are different and even better than Japanese models, the agency says, is to focus on the mile-long assembly line, the entire manufacturing process and the workers. **********''We can't just say we've got the quality, we've got the quality,'' Mr. Sherwood said. ''We have got to demonstrate why people ought to look at our car. One way is to focus on the state of the art plant, but we can go way beyond that and show the commitment of our team members, the risk they are taking and how they chose to join.'' **********One 60-second advertisement gives a worker's view of the American auto industry, its early fascination with big cars and huge grilles, and then the sudden decline of the industry in the wake of the Arab oil embargo. The unidentified worker tells how he and his friends grew frustrated with Detroit's problems, and how he decided to join Saturn. **********A second advertisement focuses on Jim Peters, a Saturn executive who played a role in the plant's design and believes it was necessary for Saturn to start with a clean slate. **********There is no jingle and not much of a slogan. But all of the advertisements use a catch phrase: ''A Different Kind of Company. A Different Kind of Car.'' **********Each advertisement contains what is easily recognized as what has become known in the industry as the ''Riney touch,'' sentiment-laden messages replete with references to Americana and family. Other emotional Riney campaigns were created for Alamo rental cars and Gallo wines. **********The two commercials, which were shown to advertising executives yesterday at a luncheon in Los Angeles, involve montages containing scenes of that most American image: baseball. **********There are eight print ads that follow the same themes as the television campaign. All are based on hundreds of interviews Riney executives conducted with Saturn workers. **********Additionally, Riney created an eight-page magazine insert that is scheduled to run regionally when car introductions take place later in the fall. **********Saturn's lineup includes three cars, two sedans and a coupe. The cars, which will cost about $10,000 to $12,000, will be available first in California and parts of the Southeast and will be available nationally by early next year. **********Besides telling the story of one Saturn worker, the magazine insert contains a four-page spread of two of Saturn's cars. **********The campaign ''is really in tune with the times,'' said Jeremy Anwyl, president of USP Automotive Research, a market research firm in Irvine, Calif.

Hills, the United States trade representative, told Congress today, disclosing that Washington and Tokyo had reached agreement on the last major item on their current trade agenda. **********Japan has ''moved further this year than any other country'' in opening its markets, Mrs. Hills said. Citing Japan under the ''Super 301'' provision of the tough 1988 trade law again would impede further progress, she added. **********The accord announced today, the culmination of a negotiating process set forth by that law, involved wood products and is expected to raise American exports to Japan by $1 billion a year. Under earlier accords, which are expected to increase annual exports by $700 million, Japan agreed to open its markets for American supercomputers and satellites. In Tokyo, the announcement was viewed favorably.  Ignoring of Law Seen The comments of Mrs. Hills before the Senate Finance Committee elicited challenges from most of the Senators present who contended that only constant pressure yielded results. **********Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the panel and was one of the sponsors of the 301 provision of the trade law, argued that the Administration would be ''ignoring'' the 1988 law and could ''poison the well'' for Congressional consideration of trade accords that it is expected to seek later with the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, China and members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a Geneva body that promotes trade liberalization and resolves trade disputes. **********Mr. Bentsen, who takes a hard line on Japan, issued an unusually stern rebuke, contending that the constitutional form of government ''cannot work if the Administration refuses to implement laws.'' **********On the other hand, both Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who heads the Finance Committee's trade subcommittee, and Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon termed the wood products pact ''significant.'' Because of the prominence of wood-producing industries in their states, both had taken leading positions demanding Japanese liberalization. The two Senators said they had spoken with industry representatives who welcomed the accord. **********Senator Packwood, the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, was among the few Senators at today's session to speak out against citing Japan. **********President Bush has been caught between his reluctance to offend powerful lawmakers and his desire to reward his new friend, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan, whose undertakings at a meeting with the President last March in California have led to the spate of accords, including today's on wood. **********Change in Dynamics Seen **********In addition to the successful conclusion of trade agreements, the Administration's tilt against branding Japan results from changing political dynamics, many analysts believe. **********While many Americans still think that Japan does not play fair in world trade and is seeking commercial hegemony with its vast surpluses, the resentments are not as intense as last year, the analysts say. **********According to William T. Archey, vice president, international, of the United States Chamber of Commerce, ''What's different this time round is the political imperative doesn't have the same oomph.'' **********A declining trade imbalance with Japan and the fact that Japanese surpluses are financing American budget deficits are among attentuating factors. **********Cabinet Meeting Scheduled **********Later Mrs. Hills told reporters that the Administration had yet to make its final decision on whether to name Japan as an unfair trader. A first Cabinet meeting on the issue is scheduled for Thursday morning. But Administration officials said was unlikely that her position would be reversed. **********The law gives the Administration some discretion in naming countries that will be subject to Super 301 procedures. Congress can ''jawbone'' the President, but short of enacting new trade legislation it cannot overrule his decision. Among the criteria the President must consider is whether it is in the United States' overall interest to name a country. **********Already in Mrs. Hills's camp, Administration officials said, are Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d; Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady; the head of the Office of Management and Budget, Richard G. Darman, and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Michael J. Boskin. **********But Mrs. Hills insisted that ''we are not backing off, or taking the pressure off.'' She said that the talks aimed at overcoming the pervasive policy and cultural obstacles confronting foreign business in Japan, known as the Structural Impediments Initiative, had achieved significant preliminary results perceisely because they were proceeding outside the 301 process, which carries the threat of sanctions. **********''I must be given a small amount of discretion to be able to tell members of this committee where I think the tools ought not be used and where they should be used,'' Mrs. Hills said. **********She added that she wanted ''to very surgically use the tool of Super 301 in a manner that is so careful that in balance it does not cause a distraction or, in fact, a permament impediment to achieving our multilateral goal'' of opening markets. **********First Step in Process **********Citing a country is the first step in a process that could lead to reprisals in the form of 100 percent duties on a country's exports to the United States, if improvements in what the United States considers unfair trade practices are not made. **********Monday is the statutory deadline for citing countries for ''priority'' negotiations under the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, reflecting practices that pose, according to the law, ''significant'' barriers to American exports. **********Japan was named under the Super 301 law last year for its closed markets in satellites, supercomputers and wood products. Today's pact, under which Japan would alter product standards, building codes, product certification and tariffs in ways to accelerate the flow of wood imports, means that Japan has now reached agreements in all three sectors. **********The supercomputer and satellite agreements were both concluded within the last month. Under the supercomputer pact, which is expected to lead to increased sales of as much as $500 million a year, Japan would use practical benchmarks to select among machines, instead of the ''hypothetical'' standards used in the past to undercut American-made supercomputers. **********Open Process Required **********The agreement on satellites, which could increase exports by up to $200 million a year, requires the Government of Japan to buy all commercial and operational satellites in an open and competitive procurement process. It opens up the Japanese market to American commercial, communications and broadcast satellites and to non-research and development satellites. **********The accords have come against a backdrop of improvement in the American bilateral trade balance with Japan. In the first two months of this year, the American trade deficit was running at an annual rate of $35.8 billion, a 27 percent improvement over the $49 billion trade deficit for all of 1989. **********Reaction in Japan **********TOKYO, Thursday, April 26 (Special to The New York Times) - Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said today of the announcement by Mrs. Hills: ''It is good that we have settled the problems of our shared perceptions.'' He had no further comment. **********Earlier, a Foreign Ministry spokesman offered guarded support, saying Japan had always ''firmly believed our country will not be cited once again'' under the United States trade law known as Super 301."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/27/world/consuelito-journal-sugar-harvest-s-bitter-side-some-call-it-slavery.html": {"writer_name": "Howard French", "pub_date": "1990-04-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 976, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Consuelito Journal;   Sugar Harvest's Bitter Side: Some Call It Slavery", "print_headline": "Consuelito Journal;   Sugar Harvest's Bitter Side: Some Call It Slavery", "body_text": " **********Just off National Highway 3, in the gently rolling green countryside best known for producing major league baseball players, thousands of dirt-poor Haitians work 15-hour days in vast sugar-cane fields. **********Because of their low wages, the tiny barrack rooms shared by as many as seven, and a diet often composed of little more than cornmeal and water, they have been likened to slaves by international human rights groups and by Dominican missionaries and other church workers. **********Lured by recruiters who promise decent wages and housing or impelled by the mean conditions in Haiti itself, the plantation workers - sun-wizened and hollow-mouthed old men and shallow-ribbed, glassy-eyed boys - cut and gather a ton of cane to earn the equivalent of $2. **********The wages are not paid to the workers directly in cash. Instead, they receive vouchers from the plantation owners, the State Sugar Council, which they are allowed to convert to cash at the plantation canteen only twice a month. In the meantime, they live on steep credit advanced by the canteens, helping to insure that they rarely accumulate any savings. **********Cutting Cane 'Is Slavery' **********''I've been here for 27 years, and as far as I am concerned cutting cane here is slavery,'' said Fines Herman, a 46-year-old Haitian, who crouched on the ground to relieve a persistent pain in his back. ''I don't have any way to get back home. I don't have any money. I don't even have any way of knowing how many tons I have cut. They decide everything here.'' **********Mr. Herman said that in nearly three decades of cane cutting he had never felt he had earned enough to try to make his way back to his country with his head high. **********While some workers have periodically returned home without major incident, many others who have sought to make their way back to Haiti had nothing but tales of woe. **********Cachena is a typical batey, or plantation village, strung along the road to San Pedro de Marcoris, the provincial capital 70 miles east of Santo Domingo made famous by its supply of players to American baseball teams, including George Bell and Pedro Guerrero. A newcomer there, Ceraphin Baillard, said he dreams about returning home. **********''When this season ends, I'm leaving and I won't be back,'' said Mr. Baillard, an illiterate Creole-speaking worker in ragged clothing who guessed his age as 20. ''See my ticket. I earned only 20 pesos for three days of work. That's nothing; I can't even eat well for a day with this.'' **********Gathered around their concrete barracks, where they sleep in bare rooms on metal-framed bunk beds without mattresses, others who had lived the bitter experience of being stopped on Dominican highways at police roadblocks, seemed almost to taunt Mr. Baillard for what they suggested was naivete. **********''You'll get home only if they don't rob you and send you back,'' an older worker said to the approving nods of the group. ''We would all go home right now if it were so easy.'' **********The State Sugar Council owns and manages 12 large sugar plantation factories, which were the property of the dictator Rafael Trujillo until his assassination in 1961. General Trujillo institutionalized the use of cheap Haitian migrant labor, signing an agreement with Haiti in 1952 for the provision of workers. By 1983, the Dominican Government was paying the Government of the Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier as much as $2.25 million a year under the arrangement. **********While the official exchange of workers for money lapsed when Mr. Duvalier was forced into exile in 1986, the State Sugar Council remains dependent on imported labor. To meet its demand, the council has stepped up the use of recruiters paid by the head to lure people from southeastern Haiti, a recent report by Americas Watch, the international human rights organization, said. **********The report said the recruiters travel to Haiti and promise well-paying jobs to young men, usually not mentioning that the work will be in the sugar industry. When the recruits arrive at the border, the report said, they are seized by the army and taken by truck to one of the 280 or so plantation villages that dot the Dominican countryside. **********About 40,000 workers are needed each year to harvest the crop. An undetermined number are recruited in this way. Many others, the report said, are simply rounded up from the large number of Haitians living within the Dominican Republic, who, because they are seen as illegal aliens, enjoy few rights. **********The State Sugar Council declined to make anyone available to discuss its labor practices. The Ministry of Agriculture also declined to comment, saying it had no oversight of the sugar industry. **********There was a widespread fear of speaking for the record about plantation conditions among missionaries and volunteer workers who in recent years have become involved in efforts to spread word about the bateys and have quietly petitioned the Government for changes. One reason for their fear, many said, was the threatened expulsion of people who had cooperated with groups like Americas Watch in the efforts to draw attention to the laborers' predicament. **********''In my view this is not slavery, it is something worse,'' said a Dominican who worked as an inspector for the Sugar Council before joining a philanthropic group's efforts to improve conditions. ''A slave is a form of capital. These Haitians don't receive the benefits one would accord to valued capital. Slavery doesn't capture what is going on here.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/27/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-us-cargo-fleet-is-found-wanting.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Schmitt", "pub_date": "1990-09-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 998, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  U.S. CARGO FLEET IS FOUND WANTING", "print_headline": "CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;   U.S. CARGO FLEET IS FOUND WANTING", "body_text": " **********Nagging problems with the fleet of cargo ships designed to carry American military equipment in emergencies have forced the Navy to charter dozens of foreign vessels to help carry thousands of tons of supplies to Saudi Arabia. **********The troubles with the Ready Reserve Force, an armada of 96 retired commercial ships that wait in mothballs until summoned in a crisis, have drawn criticism from Congress and rekindled a simmering debate between lawmakers and the Administration over responsibility for maintaining the fleet. **********The commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, has complained that the breakdown of several ships carrying cargo and combat equipment has slowed the buildup, but added that the United States has still been able to mount a credible defense in Saudi Arabia against an Iraqi attack. **********At a hearing today of the House Merchant Marine Subcommittee, lawmakers repeatedly questioned senior officials from the Navy and the Transportation Department about the need for renting foreign ships at a cost of about $10,000 a day when comparable American vessels lay idle in East and Gulf Coast berths. **********Navy officials responded that foreign vessels have often been closer to loading ports and more ready to sail than ships in the Ready Reserve that need to be cleaned, inspected, refueled and equipped with a full crew. 14 of 41 Were on Time ''We needed to get ships on berth and get cargo moving,'' said Vice Adm. Francis R. Donovan, chief of the Military Sealift Command. ''We didn't want to wait for the Ready Reserve breakout and risk the possibility of a delay.'' **********The Navy's contingency plans for a major military sealift have always included chartering a small number of foreign vessels to supplement its transport fleet, Pentagon officials said. But the urgency of the Persian Gulf crisis forced Navy officials to rent more foreign vessels than planned. **********Ready Reserve ships are maintained by the Maritime Administration, a division of the Transportation Department, and are supposed to be ready to sail with civilian crews in 5, 10 or 20 days. Only 14 of the first 41 Ready Reserve ships, however, reached their loading ports on time, sealift officials said. Seventeen ships were one to five days late, six ships were six to 10 days late and four ships were 10 to 20 days late. **********The United States also owns eight faster transport ships, which are being used, but the vast amount of cargo headed for Saudi Arabia has required officials to rely heavily on the Ready Reserve vessels. **********Admiral Donovan said that chartered foreign vessels cost about $10,000 a day, roughly half the price of maintaining the Ready Reserve ships or renting American commercial ships. But he said that vessel availability, not cost, was the Navy's main consideration in deciding which ships to use. **********Blaming Each Other **********In addition to the 43 Ready Reserve ships that have been called up, the Navy has chartered 38 foreign vessels and 10 American commercial ships. **********Cargo planes delivered the first wave of supplies and virtually all American ground forces to the desert kingdom, but transport ships are carrying 95 percent of the military's cargo and equipment to the Middle East. **********So far, more than 750,000 tons of equipment and cargo have been delivered or are en route to Saudi Arabia, sealift officials said. **********Congress and the Bush Administration have blamed each other for the woeful state of the Ready Reserve ships, some of which had not been used in a decade. **********The Adminstration, for example, requested $239 million to maintain the fleet in the fiscal year that ends on Sunday, but Congress approved only $89 million. **********''Funding has been kept so low that the readiness status of many R.R.F. ships is not realistic,'' Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner said in a speech on Tuesday. ''Congress, in effect, is taking the 'ready' out of the Ready Reserve Force.'' **********Delays Have Been Cut **********Committee members accused the Bush Administration of failing to address the problem with anything more than piecemeal approaches. **********''I've yet to see any administration come through with a national maritime policy,'' Representative Helen Bentley, Republican of Maryland, said in an interview after the hearing. ''When this is all over, we'll have to restructure the whole thing.'' **********Admiral Donovan said in a brief interview during a break in today's hearing that the sealift operation was several days behind schedule, in part because of delays caused by the Ready Reserve Force, but that the gap was narrowing. **********He said that the delays had been whittled from 14 days a week ago to about six days now. **********Under Repair in Spain **********Admiral Donovan said that three ships had broken down and had to be towed, including one of the fast transport ships, the Antares, which is now under repair in Spain. Three other ships were forced to stop for repairs, causing minor delays of several days. **********Shipping specialists said the problems with Ready Reserve are no surprise. A Presidential commission warned in February 1989 that the United States was dangerously short of the transport ships it would need in a major war. The panel recommended a 10-year, $13 billion construction program to meet the shortfall. **********Pentagon officials have pointed out that the constituent ships within the Ready Reserve do not meet military requirements. **********Only 17 of the Ready Reserve's 96 ships are the so-called roll-on, roll-off freighters, the most efficient ships for transporting tanks, armored personnel carriers and other vehicles. As a result, the Navy has had to charter 17 additional freighters from American or foreign companies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/17/business/2-guilty-of-insider-trading-in-case-involving-magazine.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 508, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 Guilty of Insider Trading In Case Involving Magazine", "print_headline": "2 Guilty of Insider Trading In Case Involving Magazine", "body_text": " **********A former printing company worker and a stockbroker were found guilty of insider trading today for buying stocks based on advance knowledge of the contents of Business Week magazine. **********William N.

There were no shots fired, and no deaths. **********Instead, they said, at about the time President Nicolae Ceausescu was fleeing his headquarters in Bucharest three weeks ago, the first party secretary of Iasi County hurriedly called her principal deputies together. **********''I am a niece of Ceausescu,'' the party chief, Maria Ghitulica, supposedly said. ''Take good care of this. I've got other things to do.'' Off in a Twinkling With that, the story goes, she was out the door and off in a limousine. The other Communist leaders followed pell-mell, as did the entire staff of the local detachment of the state security police from their nearby headquarters. **********Within an hour, thousands of Iasi citizens and units of the Rumanian Army who had been alerted to the events in Bucharest by radio reports. They gathered in front of the party and police headquarters, then simply walked in unopposed, said Luca Arbore, a journalist. The first several hundred inside the party headquarters proclaimed Doru Tigau, a 43-year-old philosophy professor, the head of the local branch of the newly formed Council of National Salvation. **********He and others addressed the crowds from the same balcony used by President Ceausescu when he last spoke in Iasi, on Sept. 15. Among the speakers was Pimen Suceveanu, vicar of the local archbishopric of the Rumanian Orthodox Church. **********''I spoke as a pastor,'' he said, ''to keep order and discipline and not to allow a hatred or wrath to boil over.'' **********As the speeches continued, army units tracked down Ms. Ghitulica, her deputies and the security police chiefs and placed them under house arrest, pending investigation by a still-to-be-appointed independent commission. **********Cranking Up the Marconi **********Over at Radio Iasi, which had been closed in 1985 along with four other regional stations on the order of President Ceausescu, Stefan Daraban, a technician, picked up Radio Bucharest's signal of the dictator's downfall. Within two hours he and a makeshift crew had cranked up the Marconi transmitter and put Grigore Ilisei, a former radio reporter, on the air. **********''Here is Radio Iasi,'' he proclaimed. ''Thirteen hundred kilohertz. After five years of silence, years of the dictator Ceausescu, you hear the voice of Radio Iasi in liberty.'' **********The station is now broadcasting eight hours a day, although so far no one on the staff has been paid. **********Iconoclasts Have Their Day **********All over Iasi, citizens have moved swiftly to eliminate reminders of Mr. Ceausescu - his photos, his books, his propaganda banners. **********At the huge Cultural Palace, which includes museums of history, ethnography and fine arts, staff members happily ripped down a giant tapestry picturing Mr. Ceausescu and his wife, Elena. The work been forced on the museum by the now-deposed Minister of Culture, Suzana Gadea. **********''We had been able to stall on having a section in the historical museum on the Ceausescu epoch,'' said Doina Lemny, an art historian, ''but not the tapestry.'' **********''Ceausescu didn't like Iasi,'' Ms. Lemny said. ''His last visit to Iasi was a fiasco. People stayed away. It was passive resistance.'' **********Iasi (pronounced yahsh), founded in the 14th century, was the capital of Stefan the Great, the ruler of Moldavia. It emerged as Rumania's leading cultural center in the 19th century. Its university, founded in 1860, is the nation's oldest, as is its fine arts museum, founded the same year. **********An Unsteady Hand **********It now appears, however, that the daring young men who took over the town and county government three weeks ago never really got a grip on things. **********A new mayor of Iasi was named Wednesday and ousted Thursday. In another incident last weekend, a rumor spread that Arab terrorists had attacked the post office. **********Mr. Tigau, receiving a warning Thursday while in the midst of aninterview, pulled a pistol and ordered the army to counterattack. The terrorists turned out to be some Yemeni exchange students who were simply trying to reach him by telephone. **********''My policy is nonviolence,'' said Mr. Tigau. He said that the closest Iasi came to real trouble was when two helicopters landed some elite police troops about 18 miles outside of the city. ''They vanished into the forest,'' he said. **********''A revolutionary has to know how to drive and how to use arms,'' Mr. Tigau said, his voice hoarse from chain-smoking. ''I thought I was apolitical. I suddenly discovered I was a highly political person.'' **********The Rewards of Vigilance **********With that he invited two foreign journalists to accompany him on a 50-mile drive northwest to the Cotnari Winery, where, he hinted darkly, there was a threat of violence in the vineyards. **********He took the wheel of a five-speed Dacia and drove at speeds of up to 80 miles an hour on the narrow highway, dodging horse carts, tractors, hikers, bikers, trucks, stray dogs and a pig. **********At Cotnari it turned out that all was well, and he settled in for a brief wine tasting. **********This morning, Mr. Tigau found himself out of the politics of the new Rumania. He and the entire leadership of the Iasi National Salvation Front were removed by army commanders, a highly placed official said. **********''Things were getting too chaotic under them,'' the official said. ''So the army will run things in the county until a new governing commission can be formed. The same thing is happening in some other counties.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/10/business/business-technology-adding-noise-to-cut-a-car-s-noise.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1186, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Adding Noise to Cut a Car's Noise", "print_headline": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;   Adding Noise to Cut a Car's Noise", "body_text": " **********Automobile engineers seeking to make a car quieter have typically padded body panels with a bit of cloth or fiberglass and added rubber to motor mounts. Now, researchers at Lotus Engineering in Britain have devised a way to cut interior noise with microphones and microchips, a technique dubbed ''anti-noise.'' **********The basic principle of anti-noise -stifling sound by creating the acoustic mirror image of the unwanted noise - has been known for decades. But it is the recent use of specialized computer chips, called digital signal processors, that made it possible for Lotus to develop a lightweight noise-muffling gear that should add only about $150 to a car's price if the car already has a stereo. **********Lotus has tested its anti-noise device in a variety of vehicles and expects to produce the system commercially within two years. **********The engineers at Lotus, which is owned by the General Motors Corporation, have tackled one of the few areas of automotive technology that has improved little in recent years. Cars have become faster and more frugal with a gallon of gasoline, but most have not become quieter. And the smaller-engine models tend to be noisier than heavier cars. **********Indeed, the four-cylinder engines now commonly used are more economical, but have more inherent vibration than six- or eight-cylinder versions, and lightweight bodies are more resonant, amplifying engine vibration, exhaust and road noise into a constant drone of background noise. Traditional noise reduction techniques add weight and are only partly effective. **********Sound Is Analyzed **********So Lotus researchers turned to electronics. They mount microphones, which monitor noise, in the car's passenger compartment and feed the information to a small computer. The computer analyzes the sound and produces a signal, through the car's stereo speakers, that is identical in pitch and volume but reversed, so that the peaks of its sound waves coincide with the troughs of the original noise, effectively canceling most of what is known as the resonant boom. The anti-noise signal is not audible on its own and does not interfere with music reproduction. **********While the concept of reducing noise by producing twice as much of it seems odd, it is by no means new. **********''The first patent we dug up was filed in the U.S. in 1934,'' said Malcolm McDonald, general manager of noise, vibration and harshness for Lotus Engineering, the research and consulting unit of Group Lotus, the British sports car company. The procedure has been made possible recently by ''advances in digital signal processing and the modern digital signal processing chip,'' Mr. McDonald said. He added, ''We are using not just one speaker, but four or six and feedback from six microphones; it's the ability to process that all very rapidly which has made it possible.'' **********A Computer on a Chip **********Like the microprocessor at the heart of a personal computer, a digital signal processor is essentially a computer on a chip. But it is optimized for certain intense kinds of computation rather than the general purpose input and output functions of a standard microprocessor. Thus, digital signal processors, like the Texas Instruments Inc. chip used by Lotus, are extremely fast and can process several tasks at once. **********Digital signal processors are also relatively inexpensive, allowing Lotus to add an anti-noise system to a car already equipped with a good stereo system for about $150. Previous anti-noise systems, also known as active noise cancellation devices, have cost $18,000 to $25,000, limiting their use to aircraft cockpits and industrial installations. Mr. McDonald said the cost could drop as low as $15 in a few years. **********Mr. McDonald declined to name customers for the system as Lotus's consulting contracts are confidential. But he said the company was working with a number of auto makers around the world and had installed anti-noise devices in more than 30 cars. The greatest noise reduction was 27 decibels in a van; in typical cars, the noise level was reduced by 10 to 20 decibels. Every 10 decibels cut is half the noise, on a logarithmic scale. **********'It Gets Far Quieter' **********''It's quite dramatic,'' said Peter Egan, senior editor of Road & Track magazine, who drove several antinoise-equipped cars at Lotus's headquarters. ''You can get in a cheap little econobox car that's pretty noisy; flick the switch and it gets far quieter, much smoother sounding,'' he said. **********Mr. Egan noted that four to six pounds of anti-noise equipment could accomplish more than 100 pounds of sound-deadening material. ''I think there will be a lot of interest when people understand what it is and what it can do,'' he said. **********The Lotus anti-noise system is designed to curb mainly lower frequencies, where most ''booms,'' or crests of resonant background noise, occur. In addition, the Lotus unit cancels only constant noise, so sounds like speech and police sirens are not affected. But an advantage of the system over traditional methods is that it can simultaneously reduce noise from several sources, and at different points in the car. **********''When it was cut in at full boom, the noise-reducing effect of the system was immediately impressive,'' Steve Cropley, editor of the British magazine Car, wrote after driving an antinoise-equipped Toyota Celica. The magazine has often described this model as ''boomy'' at British freeway speeds. ''It wasn't that the engine itself seemed to get much quieter, but the oppressiveness of the boom vibration, which seemed to arrive at the ears from every direction, was simply eliminated,'' Mr. Cropley wrote. **********Starts Auto Vibration **********Booms are a problem to auto manufacturers because the insides of car bodies have a resonant frequency, much like the inside of a guitar. Noise that excites that resonance sets the car to vibrating, creating a standing wave of sound that is almost self-sustaining. But this same principle actually works for the Lotus system when anti-noise is applied. **********Because the boom is a resonance, ''You need very little power to excite it, very little to cancel it,'' Mr. McDonald said. The Lotus system uses only one watt of power to cancel a standing wave by 20 decibels, he said. In contrast, one headlight consumes 55 watts. This means the car need not have a huge stereo system to employ anti-noise devices. **********Lotus will offer anti-noise systems to all automobile manufacturers when the system is produced, within two years, the company said. But it has no plans to incorporate it in its own cars, neither the $80,000 Turbo Esprit nor the just-introduced $35,000 Elan. Part of the reason is that these cars are quite boom-free by design, Mr. McDonald said, but he added that part of the reason was that ''a sports car needs to sound like a sports car; it has to make a certain amount of noise.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/26/business/industries-in-a-squeeze-on-prices.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1990-12-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1308, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Industries In a Squeeze On Prices", "print_headline": "Industries In a Squeeze On Prices", "body_text": " **********Prices of oil, related products and some raw materials have been rising, but manufacturers across a wide spectrum of industries are having great difficulty passing along the higher costs to their customers. **********Because of the squeeze, profits of manufacturers have been tumbling for most of the year. Many manufacturers have cut back on their plans to modernize and have deferred plans to hire additional employees, and some have begun to lay off workers. **********On the other hand, resistance to price increases has created benefits for consumers, who have seen prices rise only moderately in the last few months. **********Examples of the squeeze on manufacturers are many. The nation's leading steel companies had originally planned on price increases of 8 percent at the beginning of next year but they have scaled that back to 4 percent, even as their costs of raw materials like zinc, coke and ferromanganese have increased at double-digit rates in the last two years. Higher Energy Costs **********At the same time, energy costs for steel makers and other manufacturers that are heavy consumers of power have climbed by as much as 50 percent since the Persian Gulf crisis began last summer. **********Big tire companies announced price increases of up to 5 percent in October, in an attempt to recover increases of as much as 19 percent since August in the cost of oil-related chemical products. Dealers have responded unenthusiastically and tire prices have remained substantially unchanged since the summer. **********The chemical makers themselves have been squeezed. Prices of two important petrochemicals -- ethylene and xylene -- have increased 46 percent and 70 percent, respectively, since July. Chemical companies have not recouped the higher costs of these petroleum-based chemicals in their efforts to pass along the price increases to manufacturers. As a result, the chemical industry will see its after-tax profits fall this year for the first time since 1985, to below $22.5 billion, from $24.8 billion last year, according to the industry's trade association. **********Similarly, machine tool makers complain that they cannot pass on the higher costs they have incurred this year for energy and electrical materials like wiring in making turning machines, which form cylindrical parts, and machining centers, which make parts with edges. Those costs have risen an average of about 10 percent this year, machine tool makers say. **********Indeed, manufacturers are meeting fierce resistance from their customers, who contend that they cannot pass along the costs to consumers. For example, the Ford Motor Company has asked its suppliers of plastics, steel and other products to cut their prices by 1 percent because of the auto maker's inability to pass along higher costs. **********While some of the higher costs of manufacturing are a result of higher energy prices, economists also point to higher labor costs. For example, contracts signed last year between the nation's large steel companies and unionized workers have caused wages and benefits to climb by 3 to 5 percent from their level of a year ago. **********Economists contend that the current situation is a hallmark of a recession. Demand for products is too weak for customers to pay more for products. At the same time, the levels of production of many manufactured goods are high and companies are eager to sell those products, often at prices too low to make a profit. Tight Rein on Inventories **********\"It's a component of the recession that is now under way,\" said Jerry J. Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. \"This means that there is a very tight rein on inventories, and companies will avoid personnel increases. If things get worse, there will be cutbacks in the employment rolls to reduce overhead costs, and then research and development budgets get cut, along with capital spending budgets.\" **********Frantz R. Price, vice president of industry analysis with the WEFA Group in Philadelphia, said nearly all of the manufacturing industries are now having trouble passing along their higher costs. **********For example, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, like other tire producers, has had trouble getting price increases accepted by dealers. After a price increase of 2 to 5 percent in August, Goodyear was rocked by the increases in crude oil prices. The company's costs of synthetic rubber increased by as much as 7 percent. At the same time, the cost of carbon black, an important ingredient in tire making, increased 15 percent and the cost to Goodyear of butadienne, an important petrochemical component in tires, increased 19 percent. So in October, Goodyear announced another price increase of 2 to 5 percent to recover those higher costs.  Excess Tire-Making Capacity **********But analysts say that the October price increases are not holding firmly and that discounting is common. **********\"The No. 1 problem now in the industry is the pricing issue,\" said Tom H. Barrett, Goodyear's chairman and chief executive. \"With the automotive and truck industry down in the United States and Europe, there is some excess capacity available.\" **********Mr. Barrett noted that petroleum products were an important ingredient in tires -- the average passenger tire contains about five pounds of oil -- and that the company had been hurt by the higher price of oil. The company announced in August that it was cutting production and laying off about 800 workers at three North American plants. **********At Johnson Controls Inc.'s plastics group in Michigan, the higher cost of polyethylene terepthalate has made it more expensive for the company to produce plastic soft-drink bottles and food containers. With the cost of the petroleum-based chemical product rising more than 10 percent since the summer, Johnson Controls, like other makers of plastic bottles, has increased its own price to customers only marginally. Company officials say there is more than enough capacity to meet the current demand and that producers are eager to keep their customers' business. **********\"We have a number of agreements with our customers that amount to being cost pass-through agreements,\" said Leonard Zabinko, a manager in the company's plastics technology group in Manchester, Mich. \"But over time, you have competitive pressures counteracting those agreements. And, as a result, our own margins are squeezed.\" . **********Johnson Controls' plastics division has decided \"not to hire people, and we are considering deferring some capital spending,\" Mr. Zabinko said. He added that because of the prospect of prolonged higher petroleum prices, \"We're taking steps to make more permanent changes in our strategy in terms of capital spending.\" **********At Ford, said G. Leon Picuch, the director of supply policy and planning, \"there is a lot of unused assembly capacity and that's going to create a continuing competitive market.\" **********. \"The days of passing along costs to the consumer have gone,\" he said. **********In the steel industry, where producers have been forced to lower their price increases, pricing conditions will probably continue to deteriorate into next year, said John Jacobson, a steel analyst with AUS Consultants in Philadelphia. **********\"The first quarter will be the worst for the industry,\" he said. He added that service centers, the smaller companies that cut and form steel into various shapes for customers, \"report that a lot of their customers are now slower in paying their bills.\" **********\"What this essentially means is that we're definitely in a recession,\" Mr. Jacobson said.  The Situation at Dow **********Executives of the Dow Chemical Company have been meeting with customers in an effort to persuade them to agree to higher prices. **********\"We are re-examining our working capital, tightening inventories where appropriate and reconsidering our payment terms,\" said Harry W. Mohlmann, vice president of Dow's chemical and metals product department. \"And we are reviewing our capital spending, to be sure it is in line with the new environment.\" **********When will manufacturers find it easier to raise prices to their satisfaction? In a recent survey of the nation's purchasing managers, the executives said they thought that economic conditions would pick up in the second half of next year, but that the first half of the year would be characterized by recession."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/23/business/the-media-business-facts-on-file-sale-is-seen.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-03-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 231, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Facts on File Sale Is Seen", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;   Facts on File Sale Is Seen", "body_text": " **********Facts on File Inc., a New York book publisher and information service to libraries, is being offered for sale, publishing industry executives said yesterday, ''At this time we have no comment,'' said Thomas Conoscenti, the division vice president for North American and European publishing at Commerce Clearing House Inc., the Chicago company that owns Facts On File. **********Facts on File, which has more than 90 employees, had revenue of about $15 million last year, industry executives said, with the bulk of it from book publishing.

It also wants to let investors move between them, and the plan is considered likely for approval. ''Investors will have more of a choice, and the funds can be more focused,'' said Glenn O. Head, the group's chairman. **********And not a moment too soon. Some critics see this as a way for First Investors to dig itself out of a mess it created when it took big risks with shareholder money in hopes of high returns. ''This may be a way of covering up this past mistake,'' said Don Phillips, editor of Mutual Fund Values, a fund advisory service in Chicago. **********First Investors' yields - which have been among the highest in the junk fund sector during the last four years - lured new investors into the company's $1.1 billion Fund for Income and $646 million High-Yield Bond Fund. ''The current high yields have been the funds' primary objective and that comes as a result of taking somewhat higher risks in some cases,'' said Mr. Head. **********But because First Investors' went for yield, its junk funds have much more lower-grade junk - and worse performance records - than similar funds. The Fund for Income, for example, had the worst 10-year record of all junk funds for the period ending March 31, 1990, according to Morningstar Inc., a Chicago-based mutual fund consultant. As for the newer, High-Yield Bond Fund, it lost 3 percent in the three-year period ended March 31, 1990, while all junk funds were up one-tenth of 1 percent. In 1989 alone, both funds lost 8.1 percent while the junk group lost an average 1.6 percent, Morningstar said. In the first quarter this year, the group lost 4.3 percent, but the Fund for Income lost 5.4 percent and the High Yield Bond Fund lost 6.1 percent. **********But maybe First Investors is on to something with its new plan. Contrarians believe the $26 billion market in junk bond mutual funds has sunk so low that a turnaround may be in the offing. If so, First Investors may be poised to take advantage of it, and may provide a model for others. Its proposal to split its funds is the first of its sort. **********The proposal is also a recognition that all junk is not equal. At first, the junk market consisted of a homogenous group - all the bonds were lower-grade or unrated issues - but the market's structure shifted in the last two years to a two-tier system. **********As the market deteriorated and investors grew more skittish about lower-grade issues, many fund managers started upgrading the credit quality of the bonds in their portfolios. By the time the market was knocked almost senseless by the Campeau bankruptcy, the downgrade of RJR Nabisco, and Drexel's demise, it was clear that funds loaded with junky junk were out cold but that the top tier of junk was affected modestly. **********To be sure, even as many investors grew scared and demanded higher quality bonds, there were still aggressive investors willing to trade lesser quality for higher yield. These two constituencies made it increasingly difficult for portfolio managers to strike the right balance between credit quality and yield. **********First Investors thinks that, with its new plan, it has found a solution to this quandary. The philosophy behind it, Mr. Head said, is that some people want protection from volatility while others prefer to take risks in return for possible big gains. **********Its plan works this way. The company's two junk fund managers will separate all the issues in each of their funds on the basis of credit quality, as measured by yield to maturity. Then they will split the list down the middle and create four funds: two in the higher-yielding, lower-quality issues, and two with higher-quality but lower-yielding issues. **********When the transaction is complete, current investors in a given fund will get shares of each new fund, but will be able to move from one to another whenever mood or market shifts. Note, however, that such shifts would be taxable. **********''Investors can choose what they want to do without the fund having to incur expenses to buy or sell issues,'' Mr. Head said. ''And it lets portfolio managers focus their energy and direction on the higher-yielding or higher-quality part of the market.'' He said he expected that when the High Yield Bond Fund was split into two, the conservative part would yield about 10 1/2 percent while the aggressive fund would yield about 16 percent. **********The proposal is on the ballot for shareholder approval in June. If approved, the new funds would begin operating this summer. **********WHO OWNS MUTUAL FUNDS? **********Investors earning less than $50,000 a year owned more than half the mutual funds held by households surveyed between May 1987 and May 1989, according to the Investment Company Institute, the industry trade group, which conducted the studies. **********But some trends suggest that wealthier investors are beginning to play a bigger role in the market. **********Baby boomers, who are entering their prime earning years, are moving into the market. Avi Nachmany, an analyst with Strategic Insight, New York-based mutual fund consultants, said that many stockbrokers are now pushing funds to their clients, rather than individual stocks, presumably to minimize the risk of their recommendations. Further, he said, treacherous markets have led more investors to shy away from direct ownership of stocks and to put more of their money in managed portfolios such as mutual funds. **********Already, he said, fund shares make up one-third of the average investor's portfolio."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/04/world/upheaval-east-east-germany-house-democracy-some-pluralism-for-berlin.html": {"writer_name": "Henry Kamm", "pub_date": "1990-02-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 945, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: East Germany;   At House of Democracy, Some Pluralism for Berlin", "print_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: East Germany;   At House of Democracy, Some Pluralism for Berlin", "body_text": " **********A single building, a solid five-story structure from the days of the last Kaiser, houses more political groupings today than this capital has known since Hitler came to power 57 years ago. **********A modest handwritten cardboard sign at the entrance names it the ''House of Democracy.'' It is the headquarters for most of the new parties and movements that will take part in elections on March 18, striving to seal the demise of the Communists, who ruled East Germany without opposition until last fall's peaceful popular rising. Until last month, the house was the headquarters of the Communist Party for the center of East Berlin. **********The party vacated the building in response to opposition demands for equality of chances in the voting for East Germany's first freely elected Parliament. **********Now, Democratic Reawakening, which describes itself as a conservative party, shares the house at 165 Friedrichstrasse with the Initiative for Peace and Human Rights, whose leaders do not bridle at the label of ''anarchists'' (although they say they wouldn't choose it for themselves) and the United Left, which puts itself left of the Communists. **********Green Party and Green League **********The Green Party keeps house next to the Green League, which refuses to become a party, and the Citizens Movement Democracy Now, which fuses Christian and Socialist ideas.

Sometimes the subject is organization, because all the parties and movements are still in gestation; sometimes the conversation cuts across party lines, as representatives of different groups talk about election coalitions. But all doors appear to be open, and none seems to lead to the smoke-filled rooms of older democracies. **********Two Parties Stand Aside **********Only two of the new movements stand aside from this marketplace of the new politics. At separate headquarters are the Social Democrats, who in the consensus of the other parties have received so much assistance from their West German patrons that they feel sure they will emerge as the strongest party, and the New Forum, which was the most prominent organization in bringing about the downfall of the Communists but plans not to present candidates. **********Despite the multiplicity of views, most of the organizations in 165 Friedrichstrasse are on speaking terms. They agree on one issue: none seem to want to speak to Democratic Reawakening, which is said to be receiving almost as much help from the West German Christian Democrats as the Social Democrats get from their Western partners. **********''They have climbed on Kohl's lap and got their candy for it,'' says Vera Wollenberger, a leader of the Green Party, speaking of the group's links to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party. **********'They Are Swallowing Us' **********Throughout the building, a feeling prevails that the Social Democrats and Democratic Reawakening, are not only like their West German counterparts but also the principal mechanisms for rapid reunification of the two states. Leaders speaking for the other groups unanimously expressed concern over what they consider the greatly quickening pace toward formation of a single Germany, entirely on West German terms. **********''They are swallowing us,'' is a phrase that sooner or later turns up in conversations throughout the day's chats in offices and corridors. **********''It may be going too fast,'' conceded Erhard Neubert, a theologian, sociologist and former evangelical pastor, who is deputy chairman of Democratic Reawakening. ''Unity will come de facto by public pressure.'' **********Mr. Neubert said he and others had hopes before the public pressure grew for reunification that the first three parliamentary votings would be contested by a coalition of all non-Communist forces against the ruling party. He said such a parliament would have been best able to deal with issues specific to a country that developed separately from the other Germany. **********Interest From West Germany **********''It has become impossible because of the massive West German intervention,'' he said. ''Now we have to orient ourselves along the West German political spectrum. Our own problems will receive short shrift. We cannot put the brakes on this process, but we must try to steer and shape it.'' **********Above all, Mr. Neubert said, the first non-Communist East German Government must control the influx of West German capital and see to it that the bulk goes to smaller enterprises and leads to the creation of a middle class in this largely egalitarian country. **********But Mr. Neubert said that not only was his party accepting material help from its West German sympathizers -as other groups do also in varying degrees - but also the services of 15 to 20 West Germans who cross daily. **********''We don't have organizational experience to build a party structure,'' he said.

That way, the envoys said, the agreements could be resumed without penalty after a resolution of the gulf standoff and the lifting of the United Nations trade embargo against Iraq. **********The dispute follows a strong warning to Baghdad on Nov. 30 by the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, that Moscow would not hesitate to send military forces to the region to protect Soviet citizens whom Iraq prevented from leaving the country. **********On Dec. 4, Baghdad announced that all Soviet experts wishing to leave the country were free to do so as of the next day, but said it would hold the Soviet Government responsible \"for reneging on contracts.\" **********About 80 of the Soviet specialists still here are working on military contracts, including agreements to maintain high-technology combat aircraft and air defense networks, diplomats said. **********\"I can't say that the specialists make a substantial contribution to the military,\" a diplomat said. \"But their advice may be valuable.\" **********The envoy added that acquiring spare parts was now more important to the Iraqis, but that expert Soviet advice could be important in helping the Iraqis devise methods to work around shortages of major components.  Retaining the Specialists **********\"Maybe that is why they are trying to keep the specialists as long as they can,\" the diplomat added. **********So far, Soviet officials have made it clear to the Iraqi military authorities that as each contract expires, Moscow will not extend the term and will evacuate the Soviet specialists who were working under the contract. But Iraq has controlled the pace of Soviet evacuation by requiring that each specialist obtain an exit visa, which requires a letter certifying that the person has fulfilled all his contractural obligations. **********More than 300 Soviet technicians have left Baghdad in the last week. But even under this arrangement and the current pace of Soviet evacuation, there could still be a significant number of Soviet military technicians in Iraq on Jan. 15, the date after which the United Nations Security Council has authorized the use of military force to evict Iraq from Kuwait. Market for Soviet Arms **********If there is a war, the Soviets would try to find safe places for their people, the diplomat said, adding, \"But it cannot be excluded that the specialists, because they are at some military installations, will not be under attack by Americans.\" **********Iraq is the largest third-world export market for Soviet arms and industrial projects in terms of hard currency earnings. These projects generate annual payments to Moscow consisting of $1.5 billion in oil and $200 to $300 million in cash, an official said. **********But after the Aug. 2 invasion and the United Nations trade embargo imposed on Iraq, Baghdad suspended payments on the approximately $700 million it still owed for 1990, a delinquency that worsens Moscow's already significant financial problems. **********The single largest Soviet project affected here is the $700 million Western Qurna oilfield development project north of Basra that employed 3,000 Soviet technicians. About 1,500 are still there, a knowledgeable diplomat said, and arranging their their departure is the most difficult aspect of the commercial dispute between Moscow and Baghdad.  Costly Equipment Breaks Down **********In July, the Soviet contractor for the Western Qurna project took delivery of more than $100 million worth of oilfield equipment from Italy. Soviet officials paid for this equipment in hard currency, and they now are concerned that they will not recover their investment from Iraq. Meanwhile, the equipment is corroding in the harsh sand and saltwater environment of southern Iraq. **********\"I'm afraid this is a total loss,\" a diplomat said. **********The Iraqi authorities have told the Soviets that if they walk away from their projects in Iraq, all costs and losses associated with delays to the project will be deducted from Iraq's calculation of its debt to Moscow. Such a move could cost the Soviets several hundred million dollars, a diplomat said. **********About 500 Soviet technicians remain at Iraq's Diwaniya irrigation project in northern Iraq, and 300 more are still working on a hydroelectric project near Baghdad on the Euphrates River. **********\"Some are going to leave after a while,\" an East European diplomat said. \"The Iraqis want to prolong contracts to keep the specialists longer,\" But he added that \"we made it quite clear\" that Moscow intended to bring the experts home. **********The arriving Soviet delegation was carrying draft proposals for a document that could set terms for a temporary suspension of work. **********\"The Iraqis have taken a very tough position that everything connected with cancellation -- any losses -- is the responsibility of the Soviet Government,\" the East European diplomat said. **********The Soviets have kept their dispute with Baghdad at a relatively low profile, and Soviet officials are clearly trying to preserve for the long term a strong trade relationship with Baghdad.  Greater Scrutiny in Moscow **********Diplomats said Soviet military sales to Iraq, which at their peak provided 70 percent of Iraq's arms needs, would in the future come under greater scrutiny by the Soviet Parliament and would be affected by any international agreement to curb sales of sensitive military technologies to Iraq after the current crisis is resolved. **********Among the sophisticated Soviet weapons sold to Iraq in the last decade are the MIG-29 and MIG-25 fighter planes and several other Soviet export models; the T-72 main battle tank and its predecessors, and a variety of anti-aircraft radar and missile systems."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/13/business/executive-changes-653890.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 296, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** Allstate Insurance Co., Northbrook, Ill., a subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck & Co., promoted Rita P.

But recently things have gone strikingly well for the New Line Cinema Corporation. Last weekend, ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,'' a film about the four turtles made famous in comic books and on television, opened to the ninth-biggest audience in history, grossing $25.4 million. **********At a time when many independent studios have failed, a handful have survived. Among the publicly traded companies, New Line and Carolco Pictures Inc. are perhaps the most prominent. Although their strategies are markedly different, their discipline in adhering to their niches has set them apart from their counterparts, many of which ran into trouble by trying to do too much too quickly. **********A Second Hit Film **********New York-based New Line makes inexpensive films aimed initially at specific audiences: youngsters in the case of ''Ninja Turtles'' and blacks in the case of ''House Party,'' a musical comedy about two black teen-agers that was released in early March. New Line spends most of its money on distributing its own films. On the success of ''House Party,'' which has so far pulled in $16 million, and in anticipation of a potential hit in ''Turtles,'' New Line's stock climbed to a high of $12.375 a share last week, after trading as low as $5 in the last 12 months. It closed yesterday at $11.50, up 25 cents, on the American Stock Exchange. **********In contrast, Los Angeles-based Carolco makes high-budget films. It spends its money attracting well-known stars whose films are highly prized by distributors, but Carolco wants no part of distribution. Carolco's stock has been relatively flat recently, closing yesterday at $11.50, down 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Its recent releases have not done as well as the ''Rambo'' series, featuring Sylvestor Stallone, on which the company's reputation was built. But analysts believe the star appeal of two films now under way, featuring Mel Gibson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, could result in big turnouts at the box office this summer. **********The vagaries of the movie business have made life erratic for both companies. New Line's 1989 profits fell to $664,241 from $4.6 million in 1988, although sales rose to $61.8 million from $57.1 million. The company said the decrease occurred because it released only one film last year, ''Nightmare on Elm Street V,'' which did not fare as well the other movies in that series. **********Carolco, which has a market capitalization of $360 million, more than four times that of New Line, has not announced its 1989 earnings but they are expected to be down from the 1988 figure of $35.5 million. Revenues are expected to rise slightly to about $145 million from 1988's $139.1 million. **********Thomas Levine, vice president for corporate development, said the decline was attributable to a lack of box-office hits last year and to the fact that Orbis Communications, its TV division, did not perform as well as anticipated. **********An Expensive Business **********The rising costs of the film business and the resulting consolidation into the hands of the major studios over the last five years have made it difficult for independents to survive. Today, advertising and marketing costs for a film average about $10 million. **********Where there once was a host of small film companies like Dino De Laurentiis Productions and New World Pictures, there are now only a few. Some of them, like New World, have stumbled despite their roster of popular films because they expanded too quickly and entered related businesses like television. **********''A lot of companies started with $3 million films and moved right into $10 million pictures,'' said Roy Furman, a partner at the Wall Street firm of Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney. ''As the costs of marketing rose, it became a brutal business. Maybe you could get back enough money to cover production expenses, but not distribution, too. In some cases, they simply tried to make too many movies. '' **********A Lawyer Who Loves Movies **********New Line has avoided some of those pitfalls. The company was formed in 1967 by Robert Shaye, a lawyer by training with a passion for film, who broke into the business by starting a company to distribute movies to college campuses. **********Mr. Shaye produces films that are inexpensive and have a narrowly focused appeal. ''That way we can market the films very carefully,'' he said. ''House Party,'' for example, cost less than $3 million to make. **********''We had a whole range of options for opening the picture,'' said Mr. Shaye, who is 51. ''We decided to go for the core audience and then to make it accessible to a broader audience. The movie has a core black audience, but it is funny enough to appeal to a wider audience.'' **********Though New Line now has teen-age films, a movie for blacks and one for children, the foundation of its success is the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' series of five horror movies that began in the early 1980's. **********Although many independent companies have trouble competing against the major studios for screen time, Mr. Shaye believes that ''screens are a function of the films you have.'' **********''If you have the films people want to see, you will get the screens you want,'' he said. **********Big Spending on 'Turtles' **********Nevertheless, New Line spent $12 million on the movie prints and advertising for ''Turtles.'' It earns the standard fee of 30 percent of box-office sales for distributing the film and also recoups its print and ad costs. The balance goes to the producers, Golden Harvest Films, a unit of the Golden Communications Company. **********Mr. Shaye says he has no interest in diversifying New Line. In fact, the company's next release, due out this September, is another teen-age film, a comedy about growing up called ''Book of Love,'' in which Mr. Shaye will make his debut as a director. **********Carolco takes the reverse approach. The company steers clear of distribution because of the enormous cost of promoting a wide-release film and because one huge failure could be fatal. Instead, it concentrates on producing big-star action films that it hopes will have as much appeal abroad as they do in the United States. **********The company was formed in 1984 primarily to produce films starring Mr. Stallone. The worldwide appeal of Mr. Stallone enabled Carolco to build strong relationships, particularly with foreign distributors. Peter Hoffman, chairman of Carolco since 1986, hopes to use those relationships to build a broad-based entertainment company. **********Carolco's films typically feature big-ticket talent. The company can afford these stars because it presells distribution rights to its network of foreign distributors. For instance, even before filming began, foreign distributors agreed to buy the theatrical rights to ''Total Recall,'' starring Mr. Schwarzenegger, whose previous pictures, ''The Predator'' and ''The Terminator'' had worldwide appeal. Those commitments enabled Carolco to raise a large portion of the $50 million it needed to finance the movie. **********To lay off marketing risks, Carolco struck a deal in 1985 with Tri-Star Pictures, which now has exclusive rights to distribute all of Carolco's films in the United States. Tri-Star pays the print and advertising costs, and after recouping these expenses, it keeps an average of 35 percent of the film's net profits. **********Two New Entries **********Mr. Hoffman, who is 40, has also begun to diversify into new categories of films. Carolco's recent forays into categories other than action films include ''The Music Box'' and ''Mountains of the Moon,'' both released in the last six months. **********Neither has had much impact at the box office in the United States, but Carolco may be counting on the overseas market. ''The Music Box'' was directed by Costa-Gavras, whose work is highly regarded abroad. And ''Mountains of the Moon'' is about the expedition by Sir Richard Burton and Sir John Speke to discover the source of the Nile. **********Carolco has also bought control of what is now called Live Entertainment, a videocassette business; Orbis Productions, a television production company, and the Indieprod company, an independent movie concern that has produced hits like ''Footloose'' and ''Roxanne'' and is headed by Daniel Melnick. **********Mr. Hoffman defends his acquisitions of Live and Orbis, arguing that they will enable Carolco to keep the ancillary rights to its films. ''When companies sold off all the ancillary rights, they could only look to the theatrical business to recoup their investment,'' Mr. Hoffman said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/18/business/tokyo-stocks-close-lower.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-09-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 220, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tokyo Stocks Close Lower", "print_headline": "Tokyo Stocks Close Lower", "body_text": " **********Stock prices regained some lost ground in afternoon trading here today, after falling to a new trading low for 1990. **********The 225-share Nikkei index closed at 23,884.82, down 480.78, or 1.97 percent.

By evening, however, defeat was written across their faces too. **********It now seems likely that acting Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir will be invited to try to form a Likud-led Government on Thursday afternoon. **********Through the day today, at least two possibilities remained for Labor. A dissident member of a religious party who once supported Labor but switched his allegiance to Likud was ordered by a Rabbinical court this morning to abide by his agreement to vote for Labor. And Yitzhak Modai, a former member of Likud who has taunted both parties with the suggestion that he might support either one, flirted with Labor this evening before announcing in the end that he was going to support Likud. **********'This Unpleasant Fact' **********Chaim Ramon, who leads the Labor Party's Parliamentary faction said: ''The conclusion is clear. Apparently the mandate will go to Shamir. We must live with this unpleasant fact.'' **********Many in the Labor Party are now openly calling for another ''national unity'' government with Likud - exactly the situation that Labor declared intolerable when it brought down the last Government in March. **********But Tuesday night, acting Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Likud said: ''We had a unity Government with Labor for a year and a half, and I think it's an understatement to say that it didn't work out. I think we have to learn from it, and I don't expect the Government that the Likud will establish will be a unity government.'' **********As the last several weeks of coalition negotiations have shown, however, anything is possible in the end. **********Likud Seeking Partners **********Mr. Shamir has already begun meeting with smaller rightist and religious parties, saying he wants to form a narrow, right-wing Government. With that in mind, Likud and the smaller parties are initialing coalition agreements. **********And as the pendulum swings toward Mr. Shamir, both the Likud and the smaller parties around it are beginning to shift positions, abandoning earlier statements of principle to take advantage of the new circumstances. **********The ruling issued today by Jerusalem's rabbinical court was against Eliahu Mizrahi, a member of the rigorously Orthodox Agudat Israel party. **********He and the other party members signed a coalition agreement with Labor last month. But at the last minute, just as Mr. Peres was about to present his new Government to the Parliament, Mr. Mizrahi and another party member, Avraham Verdiger, changed their minds and left the party, saying they would go with Likud. **********Rabbinical Court Ruling **********Last week, Mr. Verdiger changed his mind again and returned to Labor. The court decision today ordered Mr. Mizrahi to abide by the coalition agreement he signed and support to Labor. **********He has not made his intentions known and probably will not until he is forced to. On the day Mr. Verdiger announced his return to Labor, much of the country was asking what Mr. Mizrahi would do. So he called the phone company, had the number changed for his car phone and then drove around the country all day, to be sure that no one could reach him. **********If the mandate reverts to Mr. Shamir on Thursday, he will face the same 60-to-60 parliamentary deadlock that is thwarting Mr. Peres. Just as Labor has tried for five weeks to win over just one member of Parliament to break the deadlock with Likud, so Likud is now wooing individual legislators, including some from the Labor Party. In this circumstance, every one of the Parliament's 120 members potentially holds the Government's future in his hands. Every one can make demands and negotiate deals with Likud, just as several did with Labor. **********All this has so infuriated the public that citizen protesters say they have acquired 600,000 certified signatures from Israeli voters demanding a change in the nation's electoral system, meaning that more than one-quarter of the nation's voting age population has signed. **********Changes in Eletoral System **********Three weeks ago, Mr. Shamir let it be known that his goal was to form a short-term ''national unity'' Government with Labor for the sole purpose of changing the electoral system so that Israel would never again face the prolonged coalition-making process under way now. **********''People are fed up, fed up,'' Avi Pazner, Shamir's aide, said on April 5, when Labor appeared close to forming a Government without Likud. **********But as the Likud proceeded through its own coalition negotiations today, there was no public mention of a short-term, interim government, no talk of electoral reform. **********In fact, responding to a court order, both Labor and Likud made public their coalition agreements with smaller parties on Tuesday. And the newspaper Yediot Achronot reported this morning that Likud's agreement with the small religious party Torah Flag, a strong opponent of electoral reform, says Likud will not support changing the electoral system without the party's agreement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/30/business/the-credit-markets-fed-acts-to-lower-key-rate.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1990-10-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1375, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fed Acts To Lower Key Rate", "print_headline": "THE CREDIT MARKETS; Fed Acts To Lower Key Rate", "body_text": " **********Honoring a pledge it indicated would be fulfilled once Congress passed a new Federal budget, the Federal Reserve Board yesterday sent a clear signal that it had lowered interest rates. **********Analysts, however, said the drop was modest would do little to spur an economy many contend has fallen into recession. Additional evidence of economic weakness will be needed before the Fed acts again, they said. **********Some expect that those signs will emerge soon, though -- possibly in the employment report due out on Friday -- and that the Fed could push rates down again by as early as mid-November.  Action Was Expected **********Yesterday's action had been widely anticipated and fell on deaf ears in the credit markets. Prices of most Treasury securities fell and interest rates moved slightly higher. The move also appeared to have had little effect on the stock markets, where traders focused on the Middle East crisis and problems with the banking industry. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.94 points.  [ Page D8. ] **********The Fed sent its signal by adding money to the banking system in late morning, a time when it normally conducts business in the Treasury securities market. That action trimmed the Federal funds rate, the key short-term interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans, by one-quarter of 1 percentage point.  Below Target Level **********When the Fed entered the market, the overnight rate, which is the interest rate most directly controlled by the Fed, was trading at 7 3/4 percent. That was below the 8 percent level analysts said has been the Fed's target since mid-July, the last time the Fed chose to ease monetary policy and allow rates to decline. **********Through its action, the Fed added liquidity to the banking system, insuring that the supply of funds would exceed the demand and cause the funds rate to drop. The Fed often sends signals on the direction of interest rates by adding or draining reserves through its operations in the Treasury securities market. **********The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, had indicated publicly on many occasions during the past few months that the central bank would push the short-term interest rate lower once a \"credible\" Federal budget package had been passed by Congress. **********With a weakening economy, the Administration had been advocating lower interest rates for months. Inflation pressures, aggravated by the sharp increase in oil prices since early August, had, however, persuaded the Fed to resist those pleas. **********\"This move was a quid pro quo for the budget package,\" said Alan Leslie, chief economist at the Discount Corporation of New York, a primary dealer in Government securities. \"But it was also a step that had already been widely anticipated.\" **********Market participants, who often buy securities on rumors and then sell later when the rumors become fact, hewed to that formula yesterday. **********Even though traders had pushed short-term money market rates down considerably last week, before the Fed's move, traders cited additional reasons why they chose to sell securities yesterday.  Treasury Auctions Ahead **********Specifically, with the uncertainty about the budget now removed, dealers face a flood of new Treasury debt auctions, beginning with today's sale of a record $12 billion worth of two-year notes. On Wednesday, the Treasury is expected to announce the size of its quarterly refunding auctions. Analysts expect that the Treasury will need to sell around $34 billion of new securities at the refunding auctions, which will probably begin on Nov. 6. **********In addition, market participants were slightly unnerved when remarks by the Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, flashed across trading screens. **********In an appearance at Washington College in Easton, Md., Mr. Brady said that in the first nine months of the year, the economy grew at a 1.5 percent annual rate. The comments unsettled traders because they appeared to suggest that Mr. Brady had prior knowledge of a preliminary report, which is expected to be released by the Commerce Department today, on how the economy performed in the third quarter.  Higher Than Expected **********Given the 1.7 percent increase in the first quarter and a much more modest four-tenths of 1 percent rise in the second, the economy would have had to expand at 2 percent or more in the third quarter to make Mr. Brady's comments stand up. Most Wall Street analysts are forecasting the preliminary figures would show the gross national product grew by slightly more than 1 percent during the third quarter. **********A Treasury aide said later that Mr. Brady did not have advance knowledge of the third-quarter growth figures, but was merely making a general point that the economy was still expanding. **********Mr. Brady's comments did not help matters, but traders said the market was primarily focused on the upcoming auctions. In order to spur demand for the issues, dealers said interest rates will have to move higher. **********\"The Fed can ease all it wants, but we still have to deal with record supply,\" one Treasury bond trader said.  Some Strong Demand **********While longer-term securities may require higher interest rates, demand for high-quality, short-term Treasury bills remains strong. **********At yesterday's weekly auction of three-month and six-month securities, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.12 percent, down from 7.2 percent at last week's sale. It is the lowest rate on a three-month bill since the auction of Aug. 15, 1988. **********Meanwhile, bids for the six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 7.13 percent, down slightly from last week's average rate of 7.16 percent. It is the lowest rate on a new six-month bill since the auction of July 25, 1988. **********In advance of the two-year auction, the securities were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 7.82 percent.  Long Issues Hurt **********In the secondary market for Treasury securities, longer-dated issues fared the worst. **********In late trading, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 99 1/8, down 21/32, to yield 8.83 percent, up from 8.76 percent late Friday. **********Among note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 14/ 32, down 11/32, to yield 8.67 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 31/32, down 1/8 of a point, to yield 8.24 percent. **********In other developments, the rate on $75 million worth of Citicorp 49-day auction-rate preferred stock was reset at 12.50 percent yesterday. **********That rate, while sharply higher than the one set at the issue's last auction in late August, was in line with a similar Citicorp auction held last Wednesday.  Alberta Notes **********Elsewhere in the corporate debt market, the Province of Alberta offered $300 million of seven-year notes through an underwriting syndicate led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. **********The 9.20 percent securities, which mature Nov. 1, 1997, were priced at $99.80, to yield 9.238 percent, which was 68 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, higher than the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing. **********The securities, which are non-callable for life, are rated AA-1 by Moody's Investors Service and AA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. **********In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, dealers said that prices of most issues slipped by 1/4 of a point to 3/8 of a point in light trading. **********Municipal bond traders said that prices of most widely quoted secondary issues fell by about 1/4 of a point. **********Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills: (000 omitted in dollar figures)               3-Mo.

But the feuding that tore Shongweni asunder caused it to be nicknamed the Valley of Death. **********In one year, 150 or more inhabitants were shot, stabbed, hacked or burned to death in clashes between members of the Zulu political movement Inkatha and supporters of the United Democratic Front, an affiliate of the African National Congress. Hundreds of homes were burned down in Shongweni and thousands of families fled. **********The killing consuming Shongweni, about 20 miles west of Durban, was appalling even by the standards of other impoverished black communities across Natal, where 4,000 people have been killed in the last four years in fighting involving supporters of Inkatha and the congress. **********But then a miracle descended upon Shongweni. The fighting ceased and a fragile peace that passes understanding has held for the last 14 months.

Inkatha started a drive in 1988 to sign up new members, he said, resorting to methods just short of coercion. In protest, local youths burned down the home of a municipal councilor who was active in Inkatha's campaign. Older Inkatha supporters retaliated, and a cycle of revenge prompted more battles.  Six Shops Are Burned **********As the war seesawed across the rolling hills, six shops were burned down, leaving Mr. Mkhize's store one of the last businesses still operating. **********\"It was when they attacked the house across the road that I decided it was time for me to call it quits,\" Mr. Mkhize said. He told Thulane Zulu, the local leader of the United Democratic Front, and Victor Sibisi, the Inkatha leader, that he would close. **********Mr. Mkhize said: \"My aim was not to talk peace to these people. After the brutal and gruesome deaths I had seen, I never cherished a hope that the day would come when these guys would talk about peace.\" **********\"I asked them why they were fighting,\" Mr. Mkhize said. \"They were fighting over nothing -- a meatless bone.\" **********Maj. Ray Harrald, then a captain in the South African Police, had arrived to command a nearby police unit trained in riot control. He greeted villagers in rudimentary Zulu, unlike the riot police officers who patrolled buttoned up in their vans. He helped an old man and his daughter build a fence around their home. When the local bus company withdrew service to Shongweni because of the fighting, Captain Harrald told his men to give rides to elderly residents in violation of police rules. **********\"He completely changed the image of the police as we knew them,\" Mr. Mkhize said. \"He was a high-ranking police officer who was prepared to stop and chat and extend his hand. He would come down to the level of the people in Shongweni. This meant quite a lot.\"  A 'Fantastic' Accord **********Major Harrald became so popular that Mr. Mkhize asked him to mediate the peace talks he was trying to start. Mr. Mkhize said of the policeman: \"We have a roundabout way of expressing a very simple idea. He would sit and listen patiently.\" **********Major Harrald describes himself as a born-again Christian motivated by faith that blacks and whites are created in the same image. \"As far as I was concerned, they were entitled to the same treatment as anyone in South Africa,\" he said of Shongweni's people in a telephone interview from Pretoria, where he has been reassigned after a promotion. **********On Aug. 29, 1989, after repeated quarrels and walkouts, the adversaries met under a scorching sun and pledged support for an unwritten peace accord. \"It was fantastic,\" Major Harrald recalled. \"There wasn't a weapon in sight. One of the most important things they came to realize was that the violence was getting them nowhere.\"  A Joint Feast Is Held **********In December, both sides gathered to apologize to their ancestors and to slaughter three oxen for a feast at which adherents of the United Democratic Front and Inkatha dined together. **********\"We respect each other now,\" Mr. Madonsela said \"The young people don't interfere with us. We can even walk about in the night.\" **********Shongweni's success has been studied elsewhere for clues to ending the fighting. \"It should be done by local people because they have undergone the whole experience,\" Mr. Mkhize advised. **********A sympathetic police response also helped, but Major Harrald said Mr. Mkhize and the people of Shongweni had resolved not to let anyone disrupt their reconciliation. **********\"It is by the grace of God that that peace has held,\" he said. \"All I did was I got the ball rolling, and they took it from there.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/25/business/vote-ends-wine-commission-in-california.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 574, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Vote Ends Wine Commission in California", "print_headline": "Vote Ends Wine Commission in California", "body_text": " **********The California Wine Commission was voted out of existence today, the victim of a rebellion by the state's small wineries. **********A state agricultural body that oversees the commission said that the vote, taken over several weeks, was 125 to 111 against a five-year continuation of the commission, which was created in 1985. The commission will end its term in June. **********The Wine Commission is a state-administered marketing group that assessed a tax on all wineries that crush more than 100 tons of grapes in a season. About 80 percent of the money collected was turned over to the Wine Institute, a San Francisco-based lobbying body for the California wine industry. **********Small wineries, however, complained that they were assessed disproportionately in their payments to the commission and that the institute failed to represent their interests in its promotions. **********''The rank and file out there knew that they were getting the short shrift,'' said Bill MacKiver, the co-owner of the Matanzas Creek Winery, a small producer of premium wines. He and Brice Jones, the owner of the Sonoma Cutter Vineyards, whose slightly larger wineries are in Santa Rosa, led the effort to end the commission. **********''The main industry body did not listen to its members,'' Mr. MacKiver added. **********Mr. MacKiver and Mr. Jones conducted a telephone and letter-writing campaign to other small vintners, pointing out that they were being assessed at up to $14 for a ton of grapes, while the E. & J. Gallo Winery in Modesto, Calif., the world's largest, was paying only $2 a ton. **********They contended that Gallo and Seagram's, another large wine producer, dictated the Wine Institute's policies and promotions and that those policies benefited the large wineries at the expense of the small premium producers. **********A Gallo spokesman said the winery's owners, Ernest and Julio Gallo, had no comment. **********The Wine Commission has 237 members, mostly small- and medium-sized vintners. The institute has about 550 members. **********Breakdown of Vote **********Mr. MacKiver said the 111 votes cast to continue the commission represented about 88.5 percent of the volume of wine produced by its members, while the 125 votes to end it represented 11.5 percent. **********Sam Folsom, a spokesman for the Wine Institute, said it would now revert to relying on voluntary contributions, as it did before the commission was created in 1985. **********''We're disappointed that the commission wasn't reapproved, but in terms of the overall picture and our continued existence, nothing changes,'' Mr. Folsom said. ''Now that the wineries are not going to be paying into the commission, we'll revise our dues structure'' to cover the shortfall in revenues, he said. **********Before the commission began, wineries that belonged to the institute paid dues of 7 cents a gallon. **********A possible problem for the institute is that multiple organizations now exist to represent the wine industry's interests, and some could siphon off funds that had been going to the institute. **********Some of the same vintners that have opposed the commission have formed the American Wine Alliance for Research and Education, a group also based in San Francisco that tries to present a positive view of wine's relationship to health and society."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/19/business/macy-will-report-deeper-losses-for-the-fourth-quarter-and-the-year.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1990-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 584, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Macy Will Report Deeper Losses for the Fourth Quarter and the Year", "print_headline": "Macy Will Report Deeper Losses for the Fourth Quarter and the Year", "body_text": " **********R.

For the full year, Macy's sales rose 4.3 percent, to $7.27 billion from $6.97 billion. **********The preliminary figures for the year were published in The Wall Street Journal and Women's Wear Daily yesterday.

The tax aspect does not apply to a company losing money. In the fourth quarter, earnings before inventory accounting adjustment rose 7.2 percent, to $179 million from $167 million. ''The drop in those earnings was due to higher inventory accounting charges, which reduced the income by $35 million,'' said one executive close to Macy. **********Macy is one of the nation's most highly leveraged retailers, following its 1986 leveraged buyout and its 1988 acquisition of the Bullock's and I. Magnin stores in California. In its regular, informal report to credit agencies, Macy said that its inventories were $560 million less than a year ago, which could be seen as an indication that Macy, along with most other retailers, does not expect a robust Christmas selling season. **********''I think Macy's primary markets in the Northeast and California suffered from very sluggish consumer buying,'' said Janet Mangano, research director for Jesup, Josephthal & Company, New York. ''That produced the kind of top line or sales that would affect any retailer leveraged or not. But then the high leverage makes weak results seem even weaker.'' **********'Macroeconomic Factors' Cited **********Ms. Mangano said that Macy had had a relatively good third quarter ended April 28 after two ''very weak'' quarters. But the improved trend waned in the fourth quarter ''probably due to the macro-economic factors,'' Ms. Mangano continued. ''But the fourth quarter may have implications for arranging future lines of credit,'' she added. **********Frank Basile, chairman of the CIT Group/Factoring, New York, which has been closely monitoring Macy, said yesterday: ''You can't help but be concerned when dealing with such highly leveraged companies as Macy.

The requirements could include inspections after delivery abroad, restrictions on the use of certain kinds of software, agreements by foreign governments to comply with restrictions on use, and audits of compliance. **********Export License Would Be Needed **********The proposal requires exporters of a computer with a speed of more than 100 million floating point operations per second (also known as megaflops) to obtain an export license. Supercomputers would remain embargoed to Warsaw Pact countries. **********The export of supercomputers troubles many experts concerned that the machines will be used to speed the design of nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles and other arms. **********In the past, supercomputer exports have been controlled by a complex licensing process on a case-by-case basis.

If the company is sold, the managers and board members are likely to reap a tidy profit themselves. **********Xtra, one of the nation's largest lessors of truck and rail trailers, has revamped its operations in the last few years. Unhappy with the performance of the stock, a dissident group that controls more than 21 percent of the company's common stock has taken aim at management. **********The dissidents, which include several investment partnerships and Gintel & Company, a New York securities firm, have been seeking to replace the board with its own committee of directors. The group contends that Xtra has been mismanaged, that much of its capital has been wasted and that its executives, particularly Charles F. Kaye, the chairman, have been excessively compensated even as they were running the company into the ground. The group filed complaints yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court to force Xtra's management to hold the annual meeting as soon as possible. The dissidents also said they did not believe management would be able to find a buyer for the company in its present condition. **********Xtra, which had been trading at close to its 52-week low of $23.50 for several months, shot up on the prospects of a sale. Xtra closed up $5.25, to $30, yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. **********The dissident shareholders are determined to unseat Mr. Kaye, whose compensation package has been continually sweetened in the last 10 years, despite the company's erratic earnings and stock performance. Indeed, Mr. Kaye has tied his bonus to cash flow rather than earnings at a time when he has sold off divisions, greatly adding to the cash flow. In addition, controlling Xtra's capital expenditures seems to be a problem that has bedeviled the company's management, although they have noted the need for this in public documents. **********''If you look back at the annual reports, you will find that they have been promising reduction of capital expenditures all along,'' said Lewis Rubin, a member of the executive committee established by the dissidents' group and the former head of two leading transportation leasing companies. **********Instead of reducing expenditures, Mr. Kaye has spent more than $600 million in three years for acquisitions that have not yet produced substantial bottom-line gains. **********''They have added nothing to free cash flow or profitability after spending more than $600 million,'' said John J. Lee, another member of the shareholder group's executive committee and a former president of Phibro Resources, a unit of Salomon Inc. ''You don't have to be a genius to see that the money has been misused.'' **********Xtra's stock has been remarkably sluggish despite the bull market of most of the 1980's. In 1980, the company had revenues of $179 million and earnings of $12 million. In the decade sales and earnings fluctuated widely, with earnings reaching a high of $26.6 million in 1984. In the fiscal year 1989, the company had $212 million in revenues, or a compounded annual growth rate of 1.8 percent over 10 years. Over the same period the company has spent more than $1.2 billion, about $190 a share, on various capital expenditure programs. **********But despite the sales of divisions, the one-time gains and the realignment of some of the company's business, the increased capital expenditures have apparently not helped Xtra's earnings. Last year sales fell some 5 percent and earnings dropped nearly 50 percent. Some of the shareholders are particularly piqued because despite the divestiture of several divisions, payouts to shareholders did not increase to reflect the gains. As for the stock, it ended the decade only 75 cents higher than it stood at the beginning of the 1980's. **********Moreover, according to the dissident shareholders' group, Mr. Kaye ''has reaped excessive personal benefits from the company in the form of bonuses and stock grants.'' They note that his compensation has increased 73.5 percent, while returns to shareholders fell 4.4 percent. **********Xtra's management has defended the compensation structure based on cash flow rather than the company's earnings. Although such a structure has resulted in higher bonuses, Mr. Kaye has said in letters to shareholders, an independent committee of directors had determined that it was a better measure of the company's performance. Mr. Kaye has declined to be interviewed. **********As for the underperformance of the stock, management has defended its leasing practices, which the dissidents have criticized, and argues that the market had not recognized that it is leasing a larger percentage of its trailers than in the past. They did not, however, explain the costs of these added leasing arrangements nor the nature of the contracts, both significant omissions. **********The dissident shareholders' group contends that it can reduce Xtra's operating expenses by at least $10 million and that it will sharply reduce capital expenditures. Unfortunately, it has not been specific about the cuts. It did not rule out sales of divisions, the entire company, or a move to take the company private."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/20/world/amid-sea-of-difficulties-india-s-prime-minister-welcomes-a-small-victory.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1990-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1427, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Amid Sea of Difficulties, India's Prime Minister Welcomes a Small Victory", "print_headline": "Amid Sea of Difficulties, India's Prime Minister Welcomes a Small Victory", "body_text": " **********As his Indian Air Force jet climbed into a hazy morning sky over the Bay of Bengal, Prime Minister V. P. Singh was relishing a moment of triumph. **********Huge crowds at two huge rallies in Madras, the largest city in South India, had responded with happy enthusiasm to his affirmative action plan that would set aside 27 percent of Federal jobs for millions of disadvantaged Indians, in addition to 22.5 percent already reserved for outcasts and tribes. Posters welcomed Mr. Singh as the ''Savior of Backward Classes.'' **********Mr. Singh has found the going much tougher in recent weeks in North India, his political base. Not only are defiant upper-caste Hindus paralyzing campuses and city streets in violent protests against his promise to extend the share of Government jobs reserved for the poor and socially marginal, but a Hindu-Muslim confrontation also looms over a disputed holy site, and cracks are appearing in the fragile political alliance that keeps the Prime Minister in power. In the states of Punjab and Kashmir, dozens continue to die daily in clashes that pit separatists against the police. **********''I think there is a fair chance that these difficulties will be overcome,'' Mr. Singh said in his low-key style on Monday as the plane headed north toward the Vindhayas, the mountains that form India's psychological Mason-Dixon line. ''But certainly we cannot say we are out of all risk.'' **********Opening to Foreign Investment **********Moving aside two envelopes of files, Mr. Singh, a hard-working political loner, spoke about the frustrations he has encountered as he has sought new sources of investments abroad to hasten the development of India, campaigned to rid India of social inequities and worked to keep his minority Government in power through the time-consuming process of building consensus on every major issue. **********He said now that India was facing the loss of ''some of the comforts'' of its longstanding relationship with the Soviet Union, New Delhi had ''no option'' but to open the country to more foreign investment and seek to integrate itself into a fast-changing world economy. In his comments he echoes the view of many Indian officials who have been contending that Moscow, caught up in economic revolution, can no longer be counted on as an economic and diplomatic cushion. **********''Within certain national priorities, we do want foreign investments and technologies, which will go a long way toward strengthening our production base,'' Mr. Singh said, particularly those ''which will give a boost to our exports, or in frontier technologies for which we don't have the facilities for research.'' India, which has been historically protectionist, also needs investment in agriculture, he said. **********Quiet Negotiations **********''That's our biggest industry, our area where our employment generation need is largest,'' he said. **********But Mr. Singh said that to advance those plans, he was negotiating with the ''friendly parties'' that support him in Parliament though they remain outside his National Front coalition: the Left and the nationalist pro-Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party. **********Characteristically, the process goes on behind the scenes. Mr. Singh, who confides mostly in his wife, Sita Kumari, rarely thinks aloud. Cabinet leaks are almost nonexistent. When the Prime Minister feels the moment is right, he makes an announcement, sometimes to the surprise of his closest aides. On the question of investment, he evidently has yet to achieve consensus. **********''I do hope that there will be a movement forward,'' he said. ''But it cannot be a unilateral movement in the present political context.'' **********Wants 'Consensus Approach' **********Mr. Singh, whose Janata Dal Party includes politicians whose attitudes toward international corporations border on paranoia, wants to breach the wall of bureaucratic hurdles that drive away foreign and Indian investors. **********''People complain about our procedures,'' he said. ''So we are examining those procedures, and the Industry Minister would be announcing these policies. But certainly, we want to go with a consensus approach on this.'' **********Prime Minister Singh's minority Government, which he calls a ''unique experiment'' in India, survives on layers of agreements, each adding to the tradeoffs inherent in coalitions. **********At the heart of the Government is Mr. Singh's Janata Dal Party, where a wing led by an ambitious rival for party leadership, Chandra Shakhar, plots incessantly. **********Shoring Up Coalition **********Next is the National Front coalition, in which Mr. Singh's party shares Government power with several regional parties and splinter groups. Mr. Singh had been visiting Madras to shore up relations with one of his partners, the Dravidian National Party of Tamil Nadu's Chief Minister, Muthivel Karunanidhi. **********Still a minority in Parliament, the National Front relies on the two disparate voting blocks outside the governing coalition, the Bharatiya Janata Party, inspired by Hindu revivalism, and the left, including two Communist parties and other Socialist groups. **********Mr. Singh acknowledged that barely a month after consolidating his position within his party in August, when he dismissed his Deputy Prime Minister, Devi Lal, he faces ''an element of fluidity'' in his political position. **********Temple at Center of Conflict **********This time, the Bharatiya Janata Party is threatening to withdraw its backing because of the Government's opposition to the Hindu militants' plan to build a temple on the grounds of an old mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya, which they believe is the birth place of the god Rama. The issue, which has inflamed the conflicting passions of Muslims and Hindus, has been simmering for a year but is due to erupt again by Oct. 30, when the Hindus say construction will begin. **********The Bharatiya Janata Party - one of whose leaders has no objections to sati, the outlawed Hindu practice in which widows burned themselves on the funeral pyres of their husbands -also opposes any compromise on Punjab, where militants drawn from the Sikh religion are demanding more autonomy, and Kashmir, India's only Muslim majority region, where an independence movement is growing. Many Hindus would like India to declare itself a Hindu nation and abandon its secular political creed. **********Mr. Singh conceded that in an effort to build consensus, he had sacrificed his best opportunity to deal with Punjab, where nearly 2,000 people have died this year at the hands of separatists, security forces and common criminals taking advantage of a disruption in law and order. **********A Missed Opportunity **********''I ought to have gone for elections in Punjab in the first six months,'' said Mr. Singh, whose first bold act in office was to ride through the streets of Amritsar, the heart of Sikh separatism, in an open car. But influential members of his party, and intelligence agencies, argued against calling an election in the state, officials say. **********''The people of Punjab had great faith,'' Mr. Singh said. ''The Sikhs had great faith and confidence. There was an environment for elections, but somehow I couldn't get a consensus on it and I stalled. I have made a mistake and I will not forgive myself for it. It's a golden opportunity, which I missed. I shouldn't have listened to anyone.'' **********Asked about how to bring Kashmiri Muslims back from alienation, Mr. Singh asked how they got there in the first place. **********''The first target of the terrorist is the ballot box,'' Mr. Singh said. ''Their first target is to eliminate those who are in the democratic process, to disrupt all channels of normal political expression.'' In Kashmir, he said, separatists have created an atmosphere of fear by the ''systematic throttling of democracy.'' **********Pervasiveness of Politics **********''I think when the human-rights debate is raised, this debate should be raised along with it,'' he said, asserting that the separatists had adopted a deliberate policy of ''drawing out the state machinery'' and provoking it to ''come down heavily.'' **********Shifting into a broader philosophical look at India, Mr. Singh said one of its development problems was the pervasiveness of politics in Indian life. **********''Or you may say, that politics hogs too much attention, while efforts in other sides of life, contributions in other areas, do not find the recognition they deserve,'' he said. **********''The limelight the politician gets perhaps our artists don't get, our writers don't get, our scientists don't get,'' he said. ''And there are so many activities by voluntary organizations. I think we must correct this for a balanced life in our country.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/05/world/evolution-europe-dubcek-rebukes-slovak-protesters-who-disrupted-speech-havel.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Engelberg", "pub_date": "1990-06-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 906, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Evolution in Europe;   Dubcek Rebukes Slovak Protesters Who Disrupted Speech by Havel", "print_headline": "Evolution in Europe;   Dubcek Rebukes Slovak Protesters Who Disrupted Speech by Havel", "body_text": " **********Alexander Dubcek, the hero of Prague Spring, shed his image of kindly geniality today to chastise a large crowd of his fellow Slovaks after some of them had disrupted a speech by President Vaclav Havel, who comes from the Czech part of this country. **********Mr. Dubcek's forceful speech largely silenced several hundred Slovak nationalists. **********''I know that you are drunk from freedom, but if this is the expression of democracy, we should be ashamed,'' Mr. Dubcek told an audience that numbered in the tens of thousands. ''We have not been fighting against one totalitarianism so that another can come in. It's not civilized to prevent Presidents from speaking.'' **********Mr. Dubcek was this country's leader when Soviet forces invaded in 1968 and ended a brief attempt to invent ''socialism with a human face.'' He spent much of the next 21 years in menial jobs, including as a clerk in the national forestry service. **********Much of the rally in the hot afternoon sun in Bratislava was consumed by shouting matches between the small group of nationalists and the much larger contingent of Havel partisans. The insults each side chose were revealing. **********Slovak Sentiments **********The nationalists chanted: ''This is our house,'' ''We want free Slovakia'' and ''Speak Slovak.'' In response, the majority of the crowd, their arms a milling sea of the two-fingered V-signs that symbolized the revolution here and in Poland, replied: ''Long live Havel,'' ''You are making us ashamed'' and ''United we stand.'' **********Mr. Havel reminded the crowd that he opposed the efforts of the Communists to stamp out Slovak nationalism, to create the illusion that this country had only one culture. He said that he rejected both this ''mirage of Czechoslovakism'' and the ''totally wrong notion of totally independent republics.' **********Elections for a national constituent assembly, which will take place on Friday and Saturday, have touched off a groundswell of nationalist sentiment in Slovakia, the eastern region of what is now called the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic. The Slovak Nationalist Party, which is separatist, is expected to get about 10 percent of the vote, while the Christian Democrats, who have been sympathetic to secession, command a more sizable following estimated at 25 percent of the electorate. **********Polls predict that the Civic Forum, the organization led by Mr. Havel, will come out ahead when all the votes are counted nationwide. The race in Slovakia is closely contested, with the counterpart to the Civic Forum there, the Public Against Violence, running even with the Christian Democrats. Six months after the revolution that toppled Communism, Mr. Havel remains a national hero, and even his routine trips through Prague are an occasion for crowds to surge toward his car. **********A Plea for Understanding **********Today on his last campaign swing through Slovakia before the election, Mr. Havel took his message of national unity and tolerance for minorities from the Hungarian border to Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. He got a decidedly mixed reception. **********At two of the three appearances, his speech was accompanied by leather-lunged groups of protesters waving the signs of the Slovak Nationalist Party. He ignored the hecklers on his visit to Komarno, a tired shipbuilding town largely populated by Hungarians, but in Bratislava he looked up from his prepared text, peered over the rim of his gold reading glasses, and responded with some of the wryness that distinguishes his work as a playwright. **********''Where were you in November?'' he asked, referring to the month when the Czechoslovak revolution began last year. ''The most important thing we have to do is not submit ourselves to the voices of those who have appeared from nowhere,'' he continued, ''those who are fighters now but were servile to the former lords, those who are appealing to the basest of emotions.'' **********While Mr. Havel implored Slovaks to join in a national rebuildling effort, he made it clear that if the majority here decides to sever ties with the Czechs, the central Government in Prague will not stand in the way. ''It does not make sense,'' he said, ''to kick an open door.'' **********In Czech, With a Slovak Finale **********In Bratislava, Mr. Havel spoke in his native Czech, which is easily understood by Slovak speakers, but concluded with a sentence in Slovak. ''We are fellow citizens,'' he said. ''and I'm looking forward to my next visit to Slovakia.'' **********One sign of the rapid development of this country's political culture is that voters in Slovakia seem quite willing to separate their personal feelings for Mr. Havel from their inclination to vote for his party. **********When Mr. Havel spoke earlier in the day in Nitra, an agricultural center of Slovakia, the crowds were friendly and surged toward the stage, creating a crush of people chanting ''Long live Havel.'' **********Yet, Julius Petko, a mechanical engineer and a supporter of the Public Against Violence, said that most of the people in the crowd would likely vote for the Christian Democrats. ''Slovakia is very strongly Christian,'' Mr. Petko said of the Roman Catholic Church's role in the city's politics.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/14/business/connecticut-projects-no-car-needed-at-this-suburban-condo.html": {"writer_name": "Diana Shaman", "pub_date": "1990-09-14", "snippet": "LEAD: Dependence on the automobile is usually unavoidable in new suburban developments, but a builder has tried to make car ownership optional for residents of a 167-unit condominium being built on Forest Avenue in Old Greenwich, Conn.", "word_count": 792, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Connecticut Projects;\n\nNo Car Needed at This Suburban Condo", "print_headline": "Connecticut Projects;\n\nNo Car Needed at This Suburban Condo", "body_text": " **********LEAD: Dependence on the automobile is usually unavoidable in new suburban developments, but a builder has tried to make car ownership optional for residents of a 167-unit condominium being built on Forest Avenue in Old Greenwich, Conn. **********Dependence on the automobile is usually unavoidable in new suburban developments, but a builder has tried to make car ownership optional for residents of a 167-unit condominium being built on Forest Avenue in Old Greenwich, Conn. **********Still, it is unclear whether buyers leaving the city will be drawn to the more urban-style developments like this one. **********At the complex, called Old Greenwich Gables, a rear gate will lead directly from the condominium into the adjoining parking lot of the Old Greenwich train station, and shopping, houses of worship and a library are all within walking distance. **********Although suburban development more commonly occurs away from transportation, shopping and the workplace, the Regional Plan Association, an agency serving New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, has encouraged suburban developers to focus projects around railroad stations and other transportation hubs to reduce dependence on cars. **********The Collins Development Corporation of Stamford, Conn., which is developing Old Greenwich Gables, says that buyers, especially those from Manhattan, will want the conveniences the condominium offers. **********''We are so convenient that you could say we are Madison Avenue north,'' said Arthur Collins, president of the development company. ''It's like living near the subway while being in the country.'' **********But sales have been somewhat slow. Since the condominiums were put on the market 18 months ago, only 33 have been sold, and the developer has reduced the size of the rest of them in an effort to speed sales. **********Prices, which had ranged from $280,000 to $600,000 for 1,000-square-foot to 2,200-square-foot apartments, some of which had included duplexes, now start at $240,000 for a 900-square-foot one-bedroom apartment and range up to $370,000 for a 1,300-square-foot three-bedroom unit.

The town of Greenwich includes Old Greenwich. **********The eight-acre parcel had been zoned for industrial use and was part of a 20-acre site on which stood a 425,000-square-foot Electrolux vacuum cleaner factory that closed in 1987. Collins had purchased the property in 1987 for $20 million and had originally proposed to build a 210,000-square-foot office building on the site. **********But the plan was rejected because of community opposition to a commercial project. To appease residents, the local Zoning and Planning Commission agreed to rezone much of the property for residential use. In 1988 it approved 24 single-family houses on six acres; a 167-unit condominium on eight acres, and 40,000 square feet of office space on two acres. Four acres were acquired by the town for municipal parking. **********The town might have required that the condominium be smaller to alleviate the potential traffic buildup in the area. But it allowed the condominium a higher density - of 20 units to the acre - than is permitted under the town's multifamily zoning because it assumed that its close proximity to shopping and transportation would minimize the use of cars by residents, said James G. Sandy, the town planner and zoning coordinator. **********The density also permitted the developers to build private recreational amenities that may well have been unaffordable to buyers if the number of units had been lower. **********Amenities will include a clubhouse, a health spa, saunas, an indoor squash court and an outdoor swimming pool. These will be shared by tenants of the adjoining office building as well as by the owners of the 24 single-family houses. Those two groups will contribute to the cost of operating those amenities. **********The three-story attached town houses, which have brick, stucco or wood frame exteriors, are being designed by Do H. Chung & Partners of Stamford. Each contains two or three apartments. Ground-floor units have private patios, and those on upper floors have balconies. The courtyards around which the units are grouped are landscaped with fountains and paved in brick. **********Design changes have been made on 134 apartments.

But together those nationalities are expected to account for about one-third of the total Soviet population in the year 2050, according to projections by the United States Census Bureau. #125.5 Million in 2050 The bureau estimates that the seven major Muslim nationalities will account for 125.5 million people, out of a total Soviet population that is projected at 386.5 million for the year 2050. **********Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's national security adviser, wrote in the winter issue of Foreign Affairs that there was a ''growing prospect of truly intense and potentially quite bloody international strife within the Soviet Union.'' **********''National passions are being unleashed'' in the non-Russian republics, and ''the national issue has become the central dilemma of Soviet political life,'' he said. ''The approximately 50 million Soviet Muslims currently produce as many babies per year as do the 145 million Russians.'' **********Paul A. Goble, deputy director of research for Radio Liberty, which broadcasts to the Soviet Union from Munich, said that the Azerbaijanis ''are vastly more educated and more urbanized'' than most Soviet Muslims and are mainly Shiites, whereas most Soviet Muslims are Sunnis. **********Russian Percentage Declining **********Shiites have a stronger sense of martyrdom and revolution and have displayed a greater desire than Sunnis to effect change through political activity. **********''The forces driving the unrest, demands and pogroms in Azerbaijan do not have exact equivalents'' in other Muslim areas of the Soviet Union, Mr. Goble said. ''I think we will see communal violence in Central Asia, but it will probably not be as intense or widespread as in Azerbaijan.'' **********The Russian population is just now falling below one-half of the Soviet total. Muslims account for a steadily growing proportion of the non-Russian population of the Soviet Union. **********W. Ward Kingkade, a demographic statistician at the Census Bureau's Center for International Research, foresees ''explosive growth'' of the population in Soviet Central Asia. But he said the Muslims ''are not going to be a majority'' of the total Soviet population at any point in the next 60 years. **********Religion Not Tabulated **********Soviet census takers do not ask questions about religion, so in the Soviet Union, as in many other countries, it is difficult to count the Muslims precisely. For the sake of convenience, many demographers assume that members of nationalities with an Islamic history or background are Muslims. Five of the seven biggest such nationalities -Kazakh, Tadzhik, Kirghiz, Uzbek and Turkmen - are in Central Asia. **********In a recent report, the Census Bureau said that those Central Asians account for 13 percent of the current Soviet population, but ''will contribute a disproportionate share of total population growth in the U.S.S.R.: roughly half of all growth through 2010 and nearly two-thirds of growth through 2050.'' **********Mr. Kingkade, the author of the study, said that Uzbeks alone, who represent only 6 percent of the current Soviet population, would ''account for roughly 25 percent of the population growth to the year 2000 and over 33 percent of the growth'' through 2050. **********The growth of the Muslim population is particularly notable among Soviet citizens 15 to 19 years old. In this age group, which includes military conscripts and people joining the labor force for the first time, the Russian population is leveling off and is expected to decline in the next 20 years, while the Muslim population is increasing rapidly. **********Foreign Policy Implications **********The Census Bureau estimates that the number of Russians in the 15-to-19 age group, now 10.3 million, will decline to 8.8 million by the year 2050. The bureau says that the population of the major Muslim nationalities in that age group, now 4.8 million, will probably reach 8.2 million by the year 2050. **********Some experts see the growing dependence on Muslim conscripts as a threat to the efficiency of the Soviet armed forces. Prof. Martha Brill Olcott, chairman of the department of political science at Colgate University, said, ''The Muslim population has deficiencies in Russian language training and technical education.'' **********In addition, she said, the growth of the Muslim population has implications for Soviet foreign policy. ''Muslim leaders of the world will mistrust Moscow if its own Muslim population is considered abused, especially in light of the unpopular Soviet occupation of Afghanistan,'' where Muslim guerrillas expelled the Soviet Army, she said. **********Demographers and political scientists generally do not expect Muslim-versus-Russian civil war in the Soviet Union. Nancy Lubin, a political scientist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said that historic feuds between Muslim groups in the Soviet Union made a pan-Islamic movement unlikely. For example, she said, there have been longstanding conflicts between Uzbeks and Tadzhiks over territorial and other claims in Central Asia. **********Fertility Rates Higher **********The Soviet Union is the world's third most populous country, and the Soviet census lists more than 100 nationalities. **********Fertility rates for the Central Asian nationalities of the Soviet Union equal or exceed the average for third world countries, while the rates for Russians and many other European nationalities in the Soviet Union are below the levels required to maintain the size of the population in the long run. **********The total fertility rate reflects the number of children a woman is expected to bear, on the average, over her reproductive life. For the Soviet Union as a whole, the fertility rate was 2.4 in 1983-84. The rate was 2.1 for Russians, 2.4 for Tatars, 3 for Azeris, 4 for Kazakhs, 5.7 for Uzbeks, 5.8 for Kirghiz, 6.1 for Turkmen and 6.6 for Tadzhiks. (For the United States it was 1.9.) In the last decade, fertility has declined among Soviet Central Asians, and in the last few years it has risen in the European republics of the Soviet Union. But large disparities remain. **********Interest in Islam Growing **********Most of the Muslim nationalities are concentrated in republics like Uzbekistan, where the name of the republic resembles the name of the nationality. The Tatars, however, are spread out. Their homeland is in the Crimea and the Volga region of European Russia, but they were forcibly resettled by Stalin in Central Asia. **********A revival of religious feeling in Central Asia may increase the potential for outbreaks of ethnic violence. **********Professor Olcott said that popular interest in Islam had increased since the mid-1970's. ''Intellectuals write more frequently about the Islamic past of their peoples, there is a new pressure from college-age youth demanding to learn Arabic'' and celebration of long-neglected celebration of long-neglected religious holidays is now popular, she said. **********A State Department official noted the construction of new mosques and said, ''There is a renaissance of religious feeling in Central Asia.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/19/business/business-technology-keeping-in-touch-while-airborne.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-09-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 311, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Keeping in Touch While Airborne", "print_headline": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;   Keeping in Touch While Airborne", "body_text": " **********Several companies are developing satellite-based systems that will enable airline passengers to make phone calls or send facsimiles from a plane flying virtually anywhere in the world, spawning what one company calls the ''office in the sky.''

Mr. Daghir and two Iraqi engineers were there to conclude a deal to purchase 85 special capacitors, 40 of them with specifications identical to those used in setting off nuclear weapons. They discussed how to disquise the objects to get them past United States Customs. **********In fact, the American was Daniel Supnick, a special undercover agent for the Customs Service. That encounter led to the arrest of Mr. Daghir and several other people in London today after a long and complex charade carried on by the British and American authorities. Officials said that an indictment charging conspiracy to export defense articles against a number of those involved, none Americans, is expected to be unsealed in San Diego on Thursday. **********Government sources familiar with the investigation gave this account of how it developed: **********It all began 18 months ago when the San Marcos company, CSI Technologies, received an inquiry from a company in Britain, Euromac (London) Ltd. in Surrey, about buying capacitors, which are common industrial devices that hold electrical charges. But the manufacturer became suspicious because the specifications - in size, inductance, resistance to stress and gravity - could have been only for military use, most probably to help detonate a nuclear warhead. As such, the item is listed on the State Department's munitions list, which bans its export to certain countries. The device is used in the Midgetman warhead. **********Cooperation Sought **********The Customs Service asked CSI and its president, Jerold D. Kowalsky, to go along with the prospective buyer, to try to get an order, and to offer a good price to keep the buyer from going to one of the other two suppliers, one in the United States, the other in France. But Euromac, which is listed in British corporate records as an importer of food, canceled the order last April soon after a story appeared in The Washington Post, quoting Israeli officials as saying that Iraq had started a program to build nuclear warheads. **********Two months later, however, Euromac renewed the inquiry and Mr. Supnick, a man with long experience in undercover detective work, was assigned to the case to try to figure out who was the real user of the product, and to get incriminating evidence. **********In September 1989, Mr. Supnick and Mr. Kowalsky went to London, where they met with Mr. Daghir, director of Euromac; Jeanine Speckman, Euromac's export manager, and two Iraqi engineers who identified themselves as representatives of Al Qaqaa, a rocket research arm of the Iraqi Ministry of Industry and Military Industrialization. **********The Iraqis said the capacitors were for laser research and applications.

When told by the Americans that the capacitor specifications were military, the Iraqis changed their story, saying they were for aerospace purposes. **********Dissimulation Is Urged **********A purchase order for $10,500 was signed at that time. The next day, Miss Speckman telephoned the Americans, suggesting they misdescribe the items as components of computer-room air conditioning units. The order was paid for with two money wires from the Iraqi Embassy in London. **********A few days after the London meeting, the Milan daily Corriere della Sera reported that the Italian office of Euromac, which stands for European Manufacturer Center, was an Iraqi front to acquire military equipment, including components for cluster bombs. The newspaper said Italian secret service investigators had linked the firm to a scandal in which a subsidiary of Ferranti, the British military manufacturer, had received credits from the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavora to finance Iraqi arms purchases. **********There followed months of confusing instructions from Euromac in Britain on how to ship the capacitors. At first, Mr. Daghir wanted them sent directly to Baghdad, the Iraqi capital. Mr. Supnick refused. Efforts failed to trick the Iraqis into coming to San Diego to inspect and claim the capacitors. **********Ultimately it was agreed that the order would be sent through Britain at the direction of Euromac and Mr. Daghir. Ealier this month, the Iraqis sent the ''end user certificate'' required for exports by the Customs Service. It was issued, falsely, in the name of the University of Technology in Baghdad, which said the capacitors were to be used for a carbon-dioxide laser system at the university's school of applied science. **********American and British Customs officials agreed that after the order arrived in Britain and was claimed by the Iraqis, a shipment of inoperable capacitors would be substituted by British agents. That was done and the arrests were made Wednesday in London."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/03/world/upheaval-in-the-east-soviet-union-moscow-s-maverick-with-a-purpose.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1990-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 953, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Upheaval in the East: Soviet Union;   Moscow's Maverick With a Purpose", "print_headline": "Upheaval in the East: Soviet Union;   Moscow's Maverick With a Purpose", "body_text": " **********Boris N. Yeltsin, the virtuoso in the evolving Communist art of campaigning against Communism, is in the thick of it again with a bold election stratagem to craft a shadow presidency for himself, the better to challenge the nation's President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. **********Mr. Yeltsin, the former Moscow party chief who has become a leader of the Soviet Parliament's opposition, has been roaming the troubled heart of this nation, the Russian republic, campaigning for near-certain victory on Sunday as a candidate for the republic's parliament. **********He hopes to use this as a springboard to be chosen as republic president and chief executive of what he intends to turn into a showcase alternative to Mr. Gorbachev's foundering plan of national renewal. **********''This is a chance to form a core of legislators with a better, far different, more progressive outlook directed at the deeper life of Russia,'' said the ubiquitous politician, who has been pioneering a Western political touch, using his much-sought coattail power to travel around the republic and be photographed with like-minded candidates for their campaign pamphlets. **********Best-Known Candidate **********Delighted, he slaps his palm to symbolize the insurgents' collective handbill and pantomimes pasting the challenge squarely on a campaign wall, beaming as if at the Kremlin wall: Yeltsin redux. **********''I am undergoing personal perestroika,'' he declared with impish ebullience, appropriating Mr. Gorbachev's patented buzzword for change to describe his chesslike move at jumping from Moscow, where is currently a deputy in the national parliament, and challenging Mr. Gorbachev obliquely from the grass-roots. **********Mr. Yeltsin is perhaps the best-known candidate in the elections on Sunday, when the most populous republics, Russia, Byelorussia and the Ukraine, vote for local officeholders and members of republic parliaments. **********Mr. Yeltsin's choice is impressive, for Russia contains three-quarters of the land and almost half the population of the Soviet Union. It also includes more than a fair share of popular unrest over the failed economy and national anxiety over sagging morale. **********A New Flashpoint **********And his timing seems impeccable, for the change of Soviet politics begun by Mr. Gorbachev is fast coming to focus on a struggle for power between the traditional fortress, the central Government, and the separate republics epitomized by Russia, newly awakening to promises of some autonomy. **********Mr. Gorbachev himself has provided a new flashpoint for this issue by demanding the emergency creation of a popularly elected national presidency with greatly increased executive powers, a role tailored to his strategy of shifting his seat of power from the party to the Government. **********Mr. Gorbachev hurriedly moved the measure establishing this proposed presidency through the Supreme Soviet standing legislature this week. But the plan is being denounced by opposition critics, led by Mr. Yeltsin, as a betrayal of perestroika's promise of balanced self-government. **********''We must make Russia and all the republics more independent and at the same time give the center government a good push to become more progressive,'' said Mr. Yeltsin, an avid politician who garnered daredevil fame in 1987 by being cast from the ruling Politburo for criticizing the party establishment, a role he has since honed into an open challenge of his one-time mentor, Mr. Gorbachev. **********'Critical Mass Is Growing' **********''The critical mass is growing,'' said Mr. Yeltsin, who started his move from his old power base in Sverdlovsk, at the nation's working backbone in the Urals, where he first rose from factory worker to party prodigy. **********His strategy is to bring enough insurgents into the Russian parliament to stop the central party's anti-Yeltsin campaign there and guarantee his success in the deputies' election of one of their members as republic president. **********''It's not that I need a higher post,'' protested Mr. Yeltsin, looking delighted after a day at his current job as the unofficial opposition leader in the National Congress of Peoples Deputies. **********It was a day in which Mr. Gorbachev could not resist criticizing his chief antagonist by name for suggesting that some of the nation's many scattered, dispirited Russians, increasingly criticized in other ethnic republics, might want to come home to Mother Russia to create progressive new cities. **********'He Is Getting Very Nervous' **********''So far Mr. Gorbachev cannot easily pronounce the word 'opposition,' '' Mr. Yeltsin said of the Soviet leader's thin-skinned performance in pushing the presidency bill to initial passage. In that confrontation, Mr. Gorbachev dismissed the minority opposition as ''demagogues'' for having questioned his devotion to power sharing. **********''He is getting very nervous,'' said Mr. Yeltsin, who feels that Mr. Gorbachev's pride is getting in the way of democratization. ''I can read between the lines.'' **********The outlook is that Mr. Gorbachev will win approval of his enhanced presidency by mid-March, although Mr. Yeltsin is among those who argue that the alarmed dissenters in the 2,250-member national congress might prove large enough to stop Mr. Gorbachev short of the 1,500 votes he needs. **********If the Soviet leader prevails as usual, Mr. Yeltsin sounds hardly at a strategic loss. He is pointing to the ''last chance'' roundup for the Communist Party to reform itself and renounce its power monopoly in June at the critical party congress. **********And should that fall short? ''Then the party splits,'' said Mr. Yeltsin with a calmness resembling the sweet anticipation of a man who expects to be a kind of president in waiting by then."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/26/business/turning-marinas-into-the-holiday-inns-of-the-water.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Bergsman", "pub_date": "1990-08-26", "snippet": "LEAD: Say goodbye to the 40-slips-and-a-bait-shop days, the time when mom-and-pop marinas contributed a modicum of service to enhance, but not disturb, tranquillity at the water's edge.", "word_count": 1719, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Turning Marinas Into the Holiday Inns of the Water.", "print_headline": "Turning Marinas Into the Holiday Inns of the Water.", "body_text": " **********LEAD: Say goodbye to the 40-slips-and-a-bait-shop days, the time when mom-and-pop marinas contributed a modicum of service to enhance, but not disturb, tranquillity at the water's edge. **********Say goodbye to the 40-slips-and-a-bait-shop days, the time when mom-and-pop marinas contributed a modicum of service to enhance, but not disturb, tranquillity at the water's edge. **********Today marinas are a growth industry, with chains offering not only the predictable places to tie up but also burgers and swimming pools and, amazingly, the occasional tennis court. **********''We've changed marinas from boat garages into resort-oriented type facilities,'' said Charles Collett, president of Nautical Properties Inc. in Georgetown, Md. ''We believe the marina should be a place for people to enjoy, not just a place to keep the boat.'' **********The marina universe is limited, of course. Douglass Norvell, a professor at Western Illinois University in Macomb, Ill., who has written a number of books on the industry, estimates that there are only about 8,000 marinas in the United States. Full-scale operations with 200 or more slips number about 3,000. Subtracting municipal, resort and boat-dealer marinas, there are just 1,000. California-based Westrec Properties Inc., the industry giant, has just 17 marinas (actually 16 with 1 under construction) with capacity for 7,479 boats. **********The industry also faces formidable opposition in the form of environmental interests, fund-raising problems and some heavy skepticism about whether it can ever really be big business. And with the downturn in real estate, particularly in the Northeast and Southwest, the timing does not seem propitious. **********The hunger for marina properties, by saltwater or fresh, started sharpening in earnest in the late 1980's, as Westrec went on a buying spree and prices industrywide skyrocketed. **********The No. 2 company, Marineland, in New York City, boasts 15 marinas and ''dockominiums'' - the slips are on long-term leases. (No. 3 is Brewer Yacht Yards, of Mamaroneck, N.Y., with 11 marinas. Nautical Properties, with 7 marinas and a 1,311-boat capacity is No. 4.) It all adds up to a phenomenon that Neil Ross, president of the International Marina Institute, a nonprofit research and information clearing house, likens to the experience of the lodging industry in the 1950's. That was when lodging shifted from independently owned roadside cabins and courts to motels, like the Howard Johnson and Holiday Inn chains. **********The difference, Mr. Ross says, is that, just as lodging in the 50's could tap an almost unlimited supply of cheap land, so the marina industry, a fledgling, could do as it wished with marshes and swamps, then considered nuisance areas good for little save breeding mosquitoes. But now, those same marshes, swamps and coastal lands are fiercely defended by the government and all sorts of environmental groups. **********The result is that, to expand, marinas are tending toward acquisition, not development. ''You have to buy a chain; you can't build it,'' said Jerold Miles, a Westrec founder. ''New sites are extremely difficult to find. The environmental concerns will delay the project for years and years.'' **********None of this serves to dampen the enthusiasm of such marina visionaries as Bruce Blomgren of Boca Raton, Fla. Mr. Blomgren's Brandy Group has managed more than 25 marinas and waterfront properties over the past 13 years, but his real enthusiasm is poured into efforts to develop his own chain of marinas. **********In 1988, he formed the National Marinas Limited Partnership to raise $30 million for the purchase of marina properties. He only came up with $2 million. Mr. Blomgren blames not the concept, but the marketing; and it didn't help that that his partners had been associated with the scandal-plagued Southmark Corporation of Texas. **********Earlier this year, Mr. Blomgren appeared to have found a safer financial harbor. In January, he formed a partnership with the New York-based LCP Group with ambitious plans to raise up to $30 million and have 20 marinas operating in three years. With the Middle East crisis creating havoc in the financial markets, that plan may prove to be overly optimistic, but Mr. Blomgren's enthusiasm is not likely to disappear. **********Closest to Mr. Blomgren's vision of a great regional marina chain is Nautical Properties, with all seven of its marinas in the Chesapeake Bay area. The marinas have been standardized and loaded up with amenities like swimming pools, tennis courts and picnic pavilions. **********Mr. Collett of Nautical says that if the financing's there, he too wants to expand, acquiring additional properties around Chesapeake Bay, perhaps a project in Cape May, N.J., and eventually, down the coast to Florida. **********''Through the latter part of the 80's, I worked hard to beef up my corporate staff, so we have a team to support our individual marinas,'' Mr. Collett said. ''We've developed our own proprietary software so that we now have one centralized accounting office and I can control the cash flow at every one of my facilities.'' The marina industry, he says, is heading toward regional chains. How do you properly price a marina? Professor Norvell suggests a simple formula: Take the marina's net profit (averaged over a few years), multiply it by 10 and that's a fair price. **********As to what actually happens, Professor Norvell did a statistical analysis a few years ago of 66 Florida marinas that were for sale. Each acre of land was worth $200,000 and each boat slip, whether in the water or dry storage, was worth $9,000, he concluded. The marina permit was worth $1 million. **********For some companies buying marinas, the industry appears to be a logical extension of existing business. Aspen Wind, of Denver, Colo., a boat seller, last year raised about a half-million dollars in a public offering. It wasn't much, but it was enough to plunk down as a downpayment for a $3.1 million marina in Jacksonville, Fla. ''With our boat sales, it seemed like a natural fit,'' says David Nommensen, Aspen's chief executive. ''The economy has basically very little effect on whether or not a person uses his boat. The economy will obviously affect boat sales.'' It's a little harder to divine the rationale of Armada Group Inc. based in Amarillo, Tex., which does oil and gas syndications. It is attempting to raise $3 million to develop a marina on the south shore of Lake Superior and to acquire two marinas in eastern Oklahoma. **********''We are here to build a company,'' explains Larry Heimsoth, Armada's president, who was introduced to marinas by one of his partners. ''We want to become a marina company.'' **********Notable among the skeptics in all the big-business talk is Mr. Miles, an industry veteran who left Westrec to manage Seven Crown Resorts' seven marinas in California and Nevada. He also has a separate company that manages a marina in Arizona. **********''People all of a sudden got the impression marinas were an area where you could make a killing overnight,'' he said. ''They are finding that is not the case.'' **********His perception is that marinas have become just another real estate investment. ''People are buying on the bigger-fool theory,'' he observed. ''It takes a big fool to buy, but a bigger fool will come along and buy it from him.'' **********Others agree. ''A few years ago marinas were listed for sale at a price you couldn't possibly justify to an investor, but there were a lot of investors anyway,'' said Ronald Stroud, a marina consultant in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ''Now the economy has turned and we have a lot of marinas for sale, but very few investors.'' As is the case with other inflated real estate, prices are coming down. **********Mr. Miles, despite his long commitment to the industry, has begun to doubt whether it's possible to build large chains. ''You can build uniformity from a standpoint of accounting. You can adopt uniform logos, but there is a major difference between a 1,500-slip marina in Atlanta and a 50-slip marina on the waterfront in Houston. Westrec will grow and eventually it may have 40 marinas, but the proposition that there are going to be very many others is not likely.'' Mr. Miles gets a lot of support from Professor Norvell.  Some companies will do well running two or three marinas, he says, but to make it go national there are two big problems: limited supply and the difference in markets. **********''The marina customer who owns a houseboat on Lake Lanier in Georgia and a marina customer that is a charter captain in Key West are two different people,'' said Professor Norvell. ''They don't even speak the same language.'' **********WHAT MAKES A CHAIN? **********The first major move in the formation of a marina chain came from Westrec Properties Inc. in Glendale, Calif. **********The company is an offshoot of Public Storage Inc., an operator of mini-warehouses that. As Peter Nelson, Westrec's chief financial officer, explains, Public Storage was looking for other properties. What it wanted was an industry with low operating costs relative to revenues. **********At first, Mr. Nelson said, Westrec viewed marinas as a simple real estate play. From 1987 to 1989, it raised $88 million from public and private sources for investment. Then it decided to commit to the long term. **********''All of our properties have restaurants, hotels and stores,'' Mr. Nelson said. ''We are really looking at all the revenue generators and trying to make them work and not just rely on boat storage, which is the easy part.'' **********Westrec has ended up with 17 marinas in California, Arizona and Washington. **********Its diversity sets it at odds with some other major marina promoters, including Bruce Blomgren, head of the Brandy Group in Boca Raton, Fla. **********''You can't create a chain unless you have some geographic logic to it,'' Mr. Blomgren says. ''One in Sacramento, one in Dallas and one in Atlanta is a little tough to relate to.'' **********Nevertheless, Westrec is currently scrutinizing properties on both coasts. **********Marketing methods also differ. Mr. Blomgren's plans rest on a sort of ''Holiday Inn concept, which is to give the user a brand name to go after.'' He has no patience with Westrec's ''loose connection of marinas.'' He would stress common advertising, common reservations and a user card that would be good for discounts throughout the chain. **********Mr. Blomgren said the Brandy Group concept is: ''We buy it and it becomes a Brandy marina.'' **********Westrec, by contrast, is taking an approach like that of the Best Western motel chain - each marina retains its distinctive name and the Westrec brand stays discretely in the background."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/26/business/market-place-the-justin-battle-a-waiting-game.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1990-12-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 920, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Justin Battle: A Waiting Game", "print_headline": "MARKET PLACE; The Justin Battle: A Waiting Game", "body_text": " **********A COUPLE of years ago, the battle for Justin Industries would not have seemed very odd. Now it seems extraordinary. **********Justin, based in Fort Worth, is a small conglomerate with its biggest interests in boots and bricks. It is run by John Justin, a 73-year-old former mayor of Fort Worth who has no desire to sell. **********Mr. Justin is busy fighting a tender offer to buy most of the company's shares at $18 each, well above any price at which Justin has traded. The offer came from a group led by two 32-year-old men, one of them a former aide to Asher B. Edelman, the corporate investor and chairman of the Datapoint Corporation. For much of the financing, they are relying on a commitment from Paine Webber Inc. to sell bonds. **********Before the \"junk bond\" market collapsed, such deals were common. But the conventional wisdom now is that they cannot be done, a belief that Mr. Justin has emphasized in letters to shareholders. **********Barry S. Rosenstein, the former aide to Mr. Edelman, conceded that the takeover market had changed and that he feels a bit lonely. \"We're the only financial tender out there now,\" he said in an interview. \"I feel like a dinosaur.\" But he said he was confident that financing could be completed. **********In fact, the tender offer, which has been pending since September, is little more than a sideshow. The real battle is likely to come at a shareholders meeting. Perhaps that will be in March, when the 1991 meeting is scheduled to be held. But it could be earlier, since a court may yet order a repeat of the 1990 meeting. **********Last week, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that Justin had violated securities laws in failing to disclose before the 1990meeting that it had changed its bylaws to make it all but impossible for shareholders to throw out directors between annual meetings. That action, taken in November 1989 as the takeover effort was getting under way, was not disclosed until August. After a flurry of negative publicity, the board reversed its decision in September. Mr. Justin said that the failure to disclose was simply a \"technical violation\" of little importance. **********But the judges did not order a new meeting; they only told a lower court judge to consider that issue. When the company announced that the court did not order the meeting, the shares promptly fell to as low as $12. But they recovered after the insurgents emphasized that the court was explicit in saying securities laws had been broken. On Monday, the shares closed unchanged, at $13.25 each, in over-the-counter trading. **********Mr. Rosenstein's ally in the takeover attempt is Perry H. Sutherland, whose family controls the privately held Sutherland Lumber Southwest Inc., a Midwest retailer. The two men have acquired an 11.9 percent stake in Justin, just over one million shares, at an average price of more than $14. Mr. Rosenstein said they had spent another $2 million arranging financing and paying various fees, including legal fees. **********While bank financing for most of the purchase seems secure, Paine Webber's \"highly confident\" letter for subordinated debt gives the firm the option to walk away for a variety of reasons, including \"market conditions.\" But Mr. Rosenstein said that the deal would not be highly leveraged and emphasized that it did not rely on selling major assets of Justin. He said he was confident the money could be raised when needed. **********Mr. Justin dismissed the $18 price as unreasonably low. \"It is less than 1.5 times book value, and this company will sell for more than that,\" he forecast. He said that the Acme Brick business was doing well as the Texas economy started to revive, and that the boot business, based on the Justin, Nocona and Tony Lama brands, was \"very good.\" In the first nine months of the year, Justin reported profits of $4.4 million, or 49 cents a share, on revenues of $208 million. **********The Tony Lama business was bought by Justin after the first approach from Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Rosenstein, and was denounced by them as a \"scorched earth\" acquisition that had forced them to lower the price they could pay. But Mr. Justin said it was working out well, in part because Tony Lama no longer offers unreasonable credit terms that had \"destabilized\" the industry. **********The tender offer is unlikely to go anywhere soon, if only because Mr. Justin, his board and his managers control 23 percent of the company, while an employee ownership plan holds 16 percent. That makes it almost impossible for the raiders to assemble the two-thirds of the shares they need to complete the deal. **********But at an annual meeting, the group would only need a majority of the shares voting to replace the board, and Mr. Rosenstein said that goal is possible, although far from assured. **********Anyway, he said, he and Mr. Sutherland are long-term investors who are prepared to wait and fight the battle with Mr. Justin over and over. \"He can win 9 of 10 shareholder votes, and we win when we win that one,\" he said. \"We've said to John, 'We've got 40 years on you. We can wait.' \" **********That wait, warned Mr. Justin, could be a long one. Although Mr. Rosenstein described Mr. Justin as being \"in failing health,\" Mr. Justin said he was in \"as good health as can be\" and had no intention of retiring."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/03/business/lotus-sues-2-on-copyright-violation.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "1990-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 671, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lotus Sues 2 On Copyright Violation", "print_headline": "Lotus Sues 2 On Copyright Violation", "body_text": " **********Acting swiftly to capitalize on last week's Federal court ruling giving copyright protection to the set of computer commands used in its popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet program, the Lotus Development Corporation sued two California software companies yesterday, accusing them of copyright infringement. **********In his ruling last week, Judge Robert E.

In the column, Mr. Heseltine spelled out ways that the Government could modify one of Mrs. Thatcher's most unpopular measures, the per capita community charge on local government services known as the poll tax. The tax, which is set at the same rate for dukes and dustmen by local government councils, was generally viewed as the cause of the Government's poor showing in the recent vote. **********Mr. Heseltine said he accepted the idea that everybody should pay a fair share of the costs of paving the streets and collecting the garbage, but argued that the tax should be modified so that the rich paid more than the poor. **********Pressed on Thursday night on a television broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation, Mr. Heseltine backed off from an open challenge. ''I think Mrs. Thatcher will lead the party into the next election,'' he said. ''I think the Conservatives will win it. That is my position.'' **********That view is held more firmly at 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's office. One official there said that public opinion polls, which had shown the opposition Labor Party leading by more than 20 percent in recent months, had begun to register a shift in support to the Conservatives in April. **********People close to Mrs. Thatcher said that she dismissed the opposition from Mr. Marlow and Mr. Porter as insignificant. A former minister suggested that her view was incorrect and that an open move to challenge her could be expected this summer, or by the autumn at the latest. **********Mrs. Thatcher does not have to call an election until mid-1992, and her close aides say that she will wait for inflation and 15 percent interest rates to decline before she puts her fate to the country. Others speculate that her husband, Denis, now 75 years old, might prevail on her to bow out. **********Both Conservative and Labor members of Parliament agree that public anger over the poll tax is fiercer than any discontent they have seen since Mrs. Thatcher first took office in 1979. **********''The pressure to do something about it will continue,'' one Conservative legislator said. ''I've got to worry about keeping my own seat in the next election, not just getting her re-elected.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/13/business/the-executive-computer-where-the-libraries-are-leading-the-way.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Lewis", "pub_date": "1990-05-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1192, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Executive Computer;   Where the Libraries Are Leading the Way", "print_headline": "The Executive Computer;   Where the Libraries Are Leading the Way", "body_text": " **********Companies that are trying to figure out how they will manage the flow of information in the 1990's and beyond might begin their research with a trip to the library - not to take out a book but to study the ways in which libraries are preparing for the 21st century. In the vanguard of information technology, today's librarians are as likely to be experts in work stations, networking, communications protocols, electronic imaging and fiber optics as they are in books and manuscripts. The information technologies and techniques now being explored by libraries are likely to serve as models for businesses in the years to come. **********Information, rather than oil or steel, is likely to become the most precious commercial resource, and the company that can gather, evaluate and synthesize information ahead of its rivals will have a competitive advantage. Technology will also enable workers to collaborate on projects regardless of their physical locations, so the ability to exhange information on data networks is crucial. Libraries have addressed these issues for years. **********''With their mission of organizing information and serving users, libraries are an ideal platform for broad-based technology development and implementation,'' said Lloyd G. Waterhouse, vice president for academic information systems at the International Business Machines Corporation. And Richard M. Helms, I.B.M.'s chief architect for image systems management added, ''Librarians are working with standards ahead of everyone else.'' **********As those standards evolve, industry will be able to take advantage of them in a broad range of areas in information management. The libraries themselves are evolving, too, as computers, mass data storage and information networks erase the physical requirements of storing documents. Whether corporate or public, tomorrow's library will not necessarily be a place to go, some librarians said, but rather a focal point for a variety of services. Such ''libraries without walls'' are beginning to appear in schools and businesses, and the silent, musty stacks are giving way to high-technology centers, available to personal computers everywhere, that offer data, graphics, animated illustrations, video clips, recorded voices and compact-disk quality music. **********In nontechnical terms, ''libraries are getting funky,'' said D. Kaye Gapen, dean of the library system at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, echoing an observation made by one of my 10-year-old friends. **********Ms. Gapen is chairman of the steering committee of Informa, a group of academic, corporate, government and public librarians that assembled in Austin, Tex., earlier this month for a conference sponsored by I.B.M. The purpose of the conference was to give the librarians access to the expertise of I.B.M. managers. The conference also provided an opportunity for librarians to tell the company of their strategic needs. While the conference focused on I.B.M. technology, many librarians said they, like their counterparts in the corporate world, must deal with multiple, incompatible systems of hardware and software. The librarians also said they were often called upon to develop seamless computer systems linking many different departments, some of which might have set up their own information centers. **********''Our interests are the same,'' Ms. Gapen said of the academic libraries and the business world. ''They are able to move ahead in some areas because they have more dollars and because their applications are smaller. On the other hand, there is more momentum in the universities.'' She said the University of Wisconsin library system, with five million volumes distributed in 14 libraries, was planning to spend $50 million to $70 million on information systems in the next few years. **********Much of that investment will go into areas of interest to businesses. A major contribution, for example, will be in the definition of standards. Libraries are leading the way in creating the tools that will be used for information access in the years ahead, and businesses will benefit as they copy those standards within their own organizations. **********One area of particular interest is imaging, the general term for making electronic copies of physical documents. Just as some libraries have tens of thousands of older books printed on acidic paper that are now discolored and crumbling to dust, many companies have endless crates and filing cabinets filled with old documents. And just as some industries are buried each day by incoming paper forms and documents, some libraries are running out of room. Paper documents take up valuable space; they are virtually impossible to search with accuracy or speed, and yet they contain information that some day may turn out to be important. **********The problem is a familiar one to executives. Kathleen Wiegner, in a recent issue of Forbes magazine, recounted the story of the movie producer Sam Goldwyn, whose files were overtaking his office. ''Get rid of all this,'' Mr. Goldwyn ordered his secretary. ''I can't,'' she replied. ''Some of those are important papers.'' Mr. Goldwyn answered: ''All right, then. Make a copy of everything before you throw it out.'' **********Libraries cannot throw everything out, of course. To preserve old books and periodicals, libraries for years have transferred images to microfilm or microfiche. That solves the space problem. But those microfilm copies become so brittle and scratched from repeated use that some are unreadable, some librarians said. Another drawback of microfilm is that one needs a specialized machine to use it. Displaying the images on a computer screen would make them available to anyone who has access to a PC. In business, that's practically everyone. **********Libraries are under tremendous pressure to come up with a solution. At the University of Wisconsin, ''20 percent of the two million volumes in our main library are so embrittled that they will be endangered by their next handling,'' Ms. Gapen said. In other words, the books could fall apart the next time someone opens them. But until imaging standards are set that will guarantee that the images will be read by future technologies, libraries are reluctant to commit the vast resources the project will require. **********Optical technology is appealing; entire filing cabinets or shelves of books can be captured on a single compact disk. Because the disks are never physically touched, the image will never degrade. But before such tools can be widely used, standards must be developed in the software used to search and retrieve these images. Another advantage of electronic imaging is that, when coupled with data networks, it will make library resources available far beyond the library's immediate geographic area. Architects, for instance, could study plans in other cities, and in the business world, branch offices would be able to gain access to information regardless of where it physically resides."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/04/business/briefs-588890.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 3, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********LEAD: Common Stock"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/03/business/company-news-united-pan-am-route-transfer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 144, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "United-Pan Am Route Transfer", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; United-Pan Am Route Transfer", "body_text": " **********United Airlines and Pan American World Airways have asked Federal regulators to approve by Dec. 31 United's proposed purchase of most of Pan Am's trans-Atlantic routes.

Most of the restaurants, all part of the Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken or Wendy's chains, said they did not think they could attract acceptable workers at the new sub-minimum wage. **********They also expressed concern that paying some young employees less than others would be demoralizing and disruptive -- a criticism that leaders of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations have often leveled at the concept of two-tier pay scales. **********The behavior of the companies is in sharp contrast to the importance President Bush attached to the sub-minimum wage. When Congress passed a bill last year that raised the minimum wage to $3.80 on April 1, 1990, and $4.25 next April 1, Mr. Bush threatened a veto unless a sub-minimum wage was provided for teen-agers. Congress agreed to include that provision for three years. **********The President contended that companies would resist hiring and training disadvantaged teen-agers unless they were allowed to pay less than the new minimum for the first six months of the new worker's employment.  A White House spokesman, Stephen Hart, declined to comment today on the survey, which studied the 167 restaurants in Texas, where many fast-food outlets have historically paid young workers no more than Federal law requires. Fast-food companies had been among the supporters of the separate wage scale for teen-agers.  A Social Role **********Lawrence F. Katz, a Harvard Univerity labor economist, and Alan B. Krueger of Princeton University, the co-authors of the survey, said the response of the fast-food restaurants suggested that the minimum wage played a social role beyond the supply-and-demand laws of economics. The Federal minimum wage has come to be accepted by most employers and employees as a sort of guide to the least that should be paid for the most menial jobs, they added. **********Officials at the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said they knew of no other study that had attempted to measure the use of the new sub-minimum wage. Indeed, future studies might turn up more use of the sub-minimum wage. But the bureau's wage and employment data tend to confirm the survey's findings. **********Month after month, for example, bureau data show that about 2 percent of the nation's employed workers earn less than the minimum wage, including 6 percent of the 16-to-19-year-old wage group, the one most affected by the sub-minimum wage. This 2 percent receives less than the legal minimum because of loopholes in the law or violations of it. And since April 1, the percentage has not risen. **********The bureau's unemployment data also fails to turn up evidence bearing out the Administration's concern that joblessness would rise among teen-agers without the sub-minimum wage to offset the April 1 rise in the minimum to $3.80 an hour, from $3.35. **********Although few employers appear to have resorted to the sub-minimum wage, the teen-age unemployment rate remained unchanged until late summer. Bureau officials and most private economists attribute the increase not to wage levels, but to the downturn in the national economy.  No Unusual Changes Reported **********Mr. Katz and Mr. Krueger, who presented their survey at the annual conference of the American Economic Association, which ended here today, found that the fast-food outlets they surveyed did not report unusual changes in employment levels and hours worked after the new minimum wage went into effect. **********Nor did they report cutbacks in fringe benefits, although a majority of the employees at fast-food restaurants work part-time and do not qualify for health insurance and other benefits. **********Still, some economists argue that the April 1 increase in the minimum wage put relatively little pressure on employer costs because the minimum had remained at the old level, $3.35 an hour, since 1981, and during that unusually long period many companies found themselves moving their wage scales above the minimum. In this view, the minimum might begin to hurt employers when it rises to $4.25 an hour on April 1. That might prompt more companies to resort to the sub-minimum, which will rise at that time to $3.80 an hour, some economists say.  Little Training Required **********Finally, most people earning only the minimum wage are in retail trades, with a heavy concentration among fast-food outlets. The jobs they occupy usually require only a few days of training to master. The sub-minimum wage provision, on the other hand, allows an employer to pay a teen-ager $3.35 to $3.80 an hour for the first three months on the job, even without offering training. To extend this special pay level pay for an additional three months, training must be involved. **********\"The fact there is very little use of the sub-minimum means that employers are not chomping at the bit to train young people and being prevented from doing so by the minimum wage,\" Mr. Krueger said. **********Sixty of the 167 outlets surveyed had been paying the old minimum of $3.35 an hour and they reported jumping to $3.80 an hour on April 1. Most of the rest had been paying above the old minimum to teen-agers and they generally increased their wages by enough to keep their pay above the new minimum.  Upward Shift for Thousands **********The hourly wages of thousands of people earning just above the minimum shift upward when the minimum does. The Texas survey found this phenomenon and other studies, in the past, have also reported it. **********Mr. Katz and Mr. Krueger selected Texas because it is one of the 25 states that does not have a minimum wage law that could override the national minimum. **********The new sub-minimum wage scale replaces one that had been in existence since 1961 but was limited to full-time students who worked part-time. Studies showed that the only employers to use that wage were universities and movie-theater chains."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/11/world/israeli-camping-store-offers-tips-from-afar.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Brinkley", "pub_date": "1990-01-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 740, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israeli Camping Store Offers Tips From Afar", "print_headline": "Israeli Camping Store Offers Tips From Afar", "body_text": " **********At first glance, it looks like an ordinary camping store stocked with waterproof flashlights, down-filled sleeping bags and 12 brands of bug spray.

South American travelers, it says, should come ''Sundays at 4.'' **********Inside, a lecture is under way. Avi Lugassi, who has just returned from a trip in which he backpacked in India and Nepal, is offering advice to about two dozen young men and women sitting on the floor under the hiking-boot display. All of them are about 21 or 22 years old, meaning they have just been released from the army. **********As Mr. Lugassi talks about the importance of taking water purifiers and diarrhea pills - ''If you ever have to go into a Nepalese pharmacy, you'll understand why,'' he said - many of the young people look through loose-leaf notebooks holding thousands of handwritten letters from other young Israeli adventurers who have written back to the store with bits of travel advice. **********Looking over it all, the owner, Yuval Limon, 33, said ''A system like this could only work in Israel.'' **********Each year, more than 60,000 young Israelis pass through Mr. Limon's store. They listen to lectures and look through the notebooks, preparing for the trip to far reaches of the third world that has come to be a unique national ritual for Israeli youths just out of the army. **********Virtually all young people enter the army as soon as they enter high school and often come out several years later changed men and women. **********''All of us have to be in the army, and when we come out it has been very rough,'' Mr. Limon said. Many 19-year-olds are thrown into the occupied territories, fighting the Palestinian uprising, or into Southern Lebanon, where they find themselves in gun battles with Palestinian guerrillas. **********''You see blood, sometimes death,'' Mr. Limon said. ''When you get out, you have to get away.'' **********Mr. Limon suggests that many Israelis are not immediately driven by ambition into jobs since the socialist structure of this state makes incomes and living standards comparatively uniform. **********Instead of immediately jumping onto the professional ladder, tens of thousands of Israelis strap on backpacks and set off for India, Asia, South America or other places where travel is cheap. **********As a result, it is not at all uncommon to hike through a tiny Burmese village, for example, and find a restaurant menu written in Hebrew. And travelers to such places often report that the residents tell them they believe Israel must be the world's second largest nation, given the unusually high number of visitors. Only Germans seem to visit the third world more. **********Letters With Travel Advice **********Those remote places are seldom mentioned in formal travel guides. That is why Mr. Limon started what he calls the institute in his store. Israel's young travelers, thousands of them a year, are compiling an ever-evolving, Hebrew record for other young Israelis of the world's least-frequented travel spots. **********Before leaving, they spend hours in the store reading the letters and getting valuable advice. In the Burmese capital, one letter says, ''The driver in carriage No. 40 speaks good English.'' In the United States, says another, ''Be sure to join the American Automobile Association so you can get their travel 'Triptiks.' '' **********''The knowledge in these notebooks you could never find anyplace else,'' Mr. Limon said. Clearly, the store's services are not a purely altruistic enterprise. Although the lectures are free, and there is no charge for consulting the letters, many of the young people end up buying their camping gear from Mr. Limon's store, too. **********''We like to give people the keys,'' Mr. Limon said. ''In Israel, we are living something like the Vietnam War all the time. If you live in Israel, you've just got to get away sometime. You've got to get out and take a big breath.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/11/world/shiite-leader-said-to-back-moves-to-free-hostages.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-03-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 388, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shiite Leader Said to Back Moves to Free Hostages", "print_headline": "Shiite Leader Said to Back Moves to Free Hostages", "body_text": " **********A key Lebanese Shiite Muslim leader said in remarks published today that he was ''encouraging elements'' that may lead to the release of Westerners taken hostage in Lebanon. **********Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual leader of the pro-Iran Party of God, had been asked by the Beirut newspaper Al Liwa if he thought the hostages would be released in 1990. **********''We believe there are encouraging elements regarding readiness to deal with the issue,'' he responded. **********On Feb. 23, after returning from a trip to Iran, Sheik Fadlallah had called for ''realistic and humanitarian means to free the hostages.''

But Mr. Seidman left open the possibility that he might stay longer. **********''President Bush did not speed up my decision,'' he said. ''I have been saying for several months that I planned to leave once the R.T.C. is up and running,'' but he added that he would decide when that time is. **********Until the so-called June 30 project is completed, he said, ''I will not think about what I am going to do.'' **********Praise From Panel Members **********In Mr. Seidman's appearance before the House panel, which has in the past received him warmly, the tone was somber. **********''One of the bright spots in this whole mess has been Mr. Seidman,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat from Brooklyn. ''The Administration should be on its hand and knees begging you to stay.'' **********Mr. Seidman cautioned the lawmakers against expecting quick results from the savings and loan rescue, saying that even a year from now the end will not be in sight. **********''Don't be impatient,'' he told lawmakers with a hint of nostalgia. ''This is a long, hard job. It isn't going to be accomplished anytime soon.'' **********Warning on Interest Rates **********Mr. Seidman pointed to a recent rise in interest rates as a double threat. **********First, the increased borrowings by the Treasury that are needed to finance the rescue push up interest rates, putting pressure on consumers and the economy. Then, higher interest rates generally translate into lower real estate values, which increases the bailout's cost to the taxpayer. **********''The real pain of what is taking place, on everything from increased Government borrowing to the effect on real estate markets, is still being felt,'' Mr. Seidman said. ''I think it is very important that no one expect by this time next year we'll all feel great.'' **********As he has in the past, Mr. Seidman stressed that the losses in the savings and loan industry, which are increasing at a rate of $28 million a day, will not be stemmed until all the real estate acquired by Resolution Trust has been sold to the private sector. **********Price Cutting Is Planned **********To speed up asset sales, the agency has significantly liberalized its sales guidelines to allow considerable markdowns on property that is not selling well. **********He reiterated that the bailout was almost certain to cost more than the Bush Administration has predicted. He took exception, however, to the estimates by Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher, who last month said the cost of the bailout, plus interest expenses on the borrowings, could be as much as $500 billion during a 30-year period. **********''It's like buying a $100,000 house and saying that it really is $300,000 because you are taking out a mortgage on it,'' Mr. Seidman said. **********At the hearing, lawmakers lavished praise on the F.D.I.C. chairman, gave cautious support to Mr. Taylor and asked Mr. Seidman what advice he had for Mr. Taylor. **********''The first thing I'd say is take a hard look before accepting the job,'' he said.

But Tibet is remote and isolated and by denying most foreigners permission to go there - and by maintaining martial law for more than a year in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa - China appears to have restored an uneasy peace as well as maintained a mostly successful news blackout about events in Tibet.

The most adventurous increasingly rely on information technology to reshape themselves. They buy into the idea that network technologies will let them become lean and mean so they can do more work with fewer people. **********Unfortunately, the network to organizational hell is wired with good intentions. Many companies are learning the hard way that their networks are designed in ways that virtually guarantee the waste of money and time. **********We need to build tools, technologies and network environments that encourage productive relationships, not just productive individuals. Our design inspirations should be collaborative relationships like the Wright Brothers, Watson and Crick, who discovered the double helix shape of DNA, and Hewlett and Packard, the electronics pioneers. These collaborators succeeded not just because they were smart and dedicated but because they built and used their own collaborative tools -- models and prototypes. Unfortunately, most networks are designed with the goal of exchanging mail and messages rather than creating shared space where people can collaborate. **********It is the difference between infrastructure and architecture. Infrastructure means you have a resource; architecture means you have a design purpose. Today's networks are more like information pipes or data highways than places that people would want to live in every day of their working lives. No one doubts that the physical layout of an office plays a role in shaping how people interact. That's equally true for network architectures.

People can see and shape the flow of the meeting before their eyes. Similarly, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, a subsidiary of General Motors, has enjoyed great success with its Capture Lab in Ann Arbor, Mich. **********The difficult questions have little to do with technology and everything to do with how organizations choose to define themselves. The technology becomes a medium of organizational design. Organizations and the people who work in them would be a lot better off if they spent a little more time and thought about what really matters to them. Certainly, information matters. Quality relationships -- relationships that generate innovations and ideas -- matter more. **********Great collaborations have transformed the arts, sciences and business.

The company's European acquisitions in the last decade have made it the largest insurer in Europe, but it has not made any inroads into the American market. **********''This deal sort of completes the strategic global presence that Allianz has been seeking,'' said Dennis S. Hersch, a partner with Davis, Polk & Wardwell who worked on the agreement. **********The deal, which is subject to approval by Fund American shareholders as well as a number of state insurance commissioners, would also benefit the shareholders of the company, whose stock has recently been at levels close to what it was when the company went public in 1985. **********'A Little Victory' **********Referring to shareholders, John J. Byrne, the chairman of Fund American, said: ''My owners have been very patient.'' He added: ''This is a matter of great pleasure to hand those patient owners a little victory.'' **********After the complex deal is completed, Allianz, based in Munich, will acquire only the insurance operations of Fireman's Fund. After receiving the $3.3 billion, Fund American will pay Fireman's Fund, now owned by Allianz, $2.2 billion in cash for part of its investment portfolio, as well as for the mortgage company and other long-term investments. **********People who helped structure the deal said that the buyback of those assets was the result of discomfort on the part of Allianz with the equity holdings, as well as a lack of familiarity with the mortgage business. **********''Germans are risk-averse investors,'' one person involved in the agreement said. ''The portfolio consists of a large quantity of common stocks, and the German philosophy is to invest in debt securities.'' **********As a result of the transaction, Allianz will be able to use the cash to redirect the investment strategy of its new subsidiary. **********Win Some, Lose Some **********But the equities are of substantial value. As of May 31, which was chosen as the date to judge the value of the portfolio, the company held about $1.45 billion in common stocks and other securities. But company officials said a large percentage of those securities were in energy-related companies that experienced a rapid run-up in share price yesterday as a result of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. **********''Well, you win some, you lose some,'' Mr. Byrne, 57, said of the increase in the portfolio's value. **********As part of the deal, Fund American will also pay $434 million to repurchase the 300,000 shares of preferred stock held by Infint S.A., a Luxembourg corporation. **********The American Express Company, which once owned Fireman's Fund, will not sell the 342 million preferred shares it holds in Fund American as part of the deal, a spokesman for American Express said. **********The deal will leave Fund American with hundreds of millions of dollars in cash. Company officials said that after the acquisition is completed, Fund American planned either to buy back its shares, or to distribute cash to its shareholders in an amount estimated to exceed $800 million. **********After the distribution is completed, Fund American said that it expects to liquidate its remaining assets over three to five years. The top management of Fireman's Fund will continue to work with the insurer after the deal is completed. **********A Lengthy History **********The history of yesterday's agreement, which is expected to close in January, is lengthy. The management of Fireman's Fund, American Express and Allianz first held conversations about a possible purchase of the insurer by Allianz six years ago when American Express owned the company. Those talks, however, fell apart. **********Despite the public offering, American Express remained close with Fund American. James D.

Nintendo game cartridges, which sell for $23 to $45 each, are some of the best-selling items in the toy business. Such leading retailers as Toys ''R'' Us and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. once carried unsanctioned games for Nintendo, but the company's lawyers successfully persuaded them to withdraw the products before filing a lawsuit. **********Nintendo, based in Redmond, Wash., had more than 80 percent of the $3.4 billion video-game business last year. **********The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington made the decision on March 7, but it was disclosed yesterday. The court voided a preliminary injunction stopping Nintendo from suing retailers for patent infringement when they carried unsanctioned games. **********The injunction stems from a lawsuit charging Nintendo with monopolistic practices. It was filed in December 1988 by the Atari Games Corporation, an arcade-game developer in Milpitas, Calif. In February 1989, Atari Games persuaded a Federal court in San Francisco to grant the injunction. **********Nintendo had developed a security system consisting of a ''master'' computer chip in the Nintendo game deck and a ''slave'' chip in the game cartridge inserted into the deck. Without both, the game cannot be played. But Atari Games developed a way to circumvent the Nintendo system, making possible the development of unsanctioned games. **********In its decision, the appeals court said that patents, like Nintendo's on its video games, were presumed to be valid and that the San Francisco court had erred in granting the injunction to Atari Games. **********The Atari Games lawsuit is scheduled for trial in the spring of 1991. Although Atari Games has not yet decided whether to appeal the appeals court ruling, it hinted at more litigation. Dennis Wood, the company's senior vice president, said the lifting of the injunction also allowed Atari Games to sue retailers carrying cartridges that infringed its own patents. **********Atari Games, a private company, and the Atari Corporation, a publicly traded home-computer maker based in Sunnyvale, Calif., are successor companies to Atari Inc., the maker of video games in the early 1980's.

Indeed, they argued, Mr. de Klerk should not be allowed to come at all until he had made what they termed substantive progress toward ending apartheid. **********'It's Not Too Late' **********''It is a slap on the face,'' said Mendi Msimang, the African National Congress representative to Britain, who spoke at a news conference today giving the agenda for the Mandela visit. ''It is not too late for the Administration to take corrective measures.'' **********The Rev. Jesse Jackson pointed out that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d visited Mr. de Klerk in Cape Town in March despite Mr. Mandela's request that he not go.

''There are still troops in the townships. The fundamental laws of apartheid are still on the books. The invitation is not justifiable by any means.'' **********Sandra Hill, the head of a coalition of anti-apartheid groups in Washington, said today that the groups would stage protests and try to rally support to force the White House to cancel the visit of Mr. de Klerk. **********Administration officials, who said the order of the trips had been decided simply by available dates and not by a desire to promote one leader over the other, said there was no chance of Mr. de Klerk's visit being canceled. President Bush decided on Feb. 1 to invite both men to the White House, as a way to encourage Mr. de Klerk to release Mr. Mandela from prison. **********An Attempt to Spur Talks **********After Mr. Mandela was released, the President extended the invitations, hoping to spur the talks between the two men to give political rights to South Africa's disfranchised black majority. **********''The protests of the A.N.C. and others compels us to discuss whether we should change the sequence of the visits,'' an Administration official said. ''But nothing has been set in concrete, and the dates might be switched for both.

Jean-Bertrand Aristide has maintained strict public silence, gathering advice from his closest confidants as he awaits final election results that could be as far as a week away. **********While they await details of the 37-year-old priest's plans for governing, however, there is an emerging consensus among Haitian and foreign political analysts here on the challenges that the politically inexperienced Roman Catholic priest will soon face. **********First and foremost, many feel, will be asserting his control on an army that has proven stubbornly resistant to change as it clung to power for most of the nearly five years since the dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled the country in the face of a popular uprising early in 1986. **********Although the army exhibited strict neutrality during the election and has pledged to stay out of politics in the future, Father Aristide must quickly make good on his central campaign promise of \"justice\" by arresting several longtime leaders of the Tontons Macoute, the Duvalier family's feared militia of red-kerchiefed enforcers.  'First Thing He Has to Do' **********\"The first thing he has to do is arrest some of these people and bring them to trial,\" a Haitian political scientist who spoke on the condition of anonymity said. \"If he doesn't succeed in doing that, then he has really failed. And this is something he will have to do in the first week, not in the first 100 days.\" **********Father Aristide, who had long been a boldly outspoken enemy of the Duvalier dictatorships and the system of repression that followed the deposed rulers, entered the presidential race only after the return from exile and attempted candidacy of Roger Lafontant, a widely feared former Interior Minister under the deposed dictatorship. The current provisional Government of President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot never executed a warrant for Mr. Lafontant's arrest on charges of treason. **********\"The Duvalierists ruled this country twice as long as the Nazis ruled Germany,\" a foreign diplomat said, explaining the failure of the military to arrest Mr. Lafontant and other Tontons Macoute. \"It is not easy for the army to bring itself to confrontation with them. There is a whole complex web of ties, from money spent here and there to long, compromised histories together that discourage them from acting.\" **********If the army command should balk at Father Aristide's order to arrest leading Duvalierist figures, the new President would be faced with his first serious crisis. **********A possible response would be to call the people into the streets to rout the Duvalierists. This violent purging first occurred after the fall of the Duvaliers, and was repeated after an attack on Father Aristide's congregation in 1988 in which 13 worshipers were killed.  Risk of Alienating U.S. **********Diplomats say, however, that a strategy akin to officially encouraged lynching would quickly bring international condemnation and end any fragile honeymoon that the President-elect may have won with the Haitian elite. It would also risk alienating foreign donors, including the United States. **********Father Aristide -- with what many feel is strong support among enlisted men, who share the same background of poverty as his most ardent followers, and a grudging respect for the group of mid-level officers who oversaw the election process -- might simply retire the senior officers who are products of Duvalierism. **********While diplomats here are not encouraging such a restructuring of the 7,000-man army, they say that as long as the rule of law is upheld and human rights are respected, the vocal disapproval of the United States and other major foreign partners of military coups makes a senior officer-led action against Father Aristide unlikely anytime soon. **********If arresting villains from past Governments provides a quick and relatively inexpensive way to sustain the enthusiasm in economic matters of those who elected him, experts say Father Aristide's task of bringing tangible improvements will be much slower.  Public Services Collapsing **********Since the departure of Jean-Claude Duvalier in 1986, Haiti's official economy has barely grown, and public services, never robust, have all but collapsed, giving way to widespread decay and corruption. **********\"Nobody here is paying any taxes,\" said Leopold Berlanger Jr., president of a Haitian development institute. \"Before they can do anything else, the Government is going to need some income.\" **********Fther Aristide's official campaign documents advocate a mixture of cooperative-style reorganization of the peasantry, streamlining but not privatization of state-owned corporations, with an emphasis on eliminating featherbedding and graft, and protection for important industries. **********Because of his commitment to protectionism, many analysts say a growing number of influential Haitian industrialists and entrepreneurs are willing to give the new leader a chance. **********\"Most of the industrialists have already been reassured, except for those who will never agree with us,\" said George Anglade, a Haitian geographer at the University of Quebec who has rallied to the new leader's inner circle. \"They know that it is time to stop the crony-capitalism, start paying taxes and make a break with the kind of business that depends on who you know.\" **********Even before any tax-collection effort can bear fruit, however, the new Government will be confronted with the problem of paying monthly petroleum bills of about $8 million. To avoid disruptions of supplies during the runup to Sunday's elections, the United States and other countries covered the costs of importing oil with low-interest loans and cash donations.  Currency May be Devalued **********To come up with the necessary hard currency, several Western diplomats said, the new Government will face the unpopular task of devaluing the local currency, the gourde, which has long been pegged to the dollar at a rate of five to one, or finding some other way to make consumers pay the real cost of imported oil. **********In agriculture, a centerpiece of campaign statements, Mr. Anglade, one of Father Aristide's closest advisers, said a major focus would be reorganization of the country's 7,500 rural communal gardens, which he said will be consolidated and made more productive through state financial assistance and extension services. **********State-owned land will also be distributed to peasants under the age of 35, and agricultural industries will be created or moved to rural areas to brake the flight of the population to the capital. The rural restructuring, which Mr. Anglade said would be \"non-coercive,\" will also allow the new Government to gather masses of peasants for a major literacy drive. **********Western diplomats and Haitian analysts, while granting that the President-elect has strong popular support, say that almost no amount of domestic self-help by itself can create a modern economy capable of ending Haiti's poverty. This goal, they say, will require greater assistance from the outside and closer integration with the international economy. **********\"If he does not have a liberal economic policy, he won't be able to produce the results his constituents want so badly,\" a Western diplomat who is not an American said. \"Without international support, the whole thing will fall like a leaf from a tree.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/19/world/jiucun-journal-in-a-chinese-desert-once-barren-lives-bloom.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1090, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jiucun Journal;   In a Chinese Desert, Once-Barren Lives Bloom", "print_headline": "Jiucun Journal;   In a Chinese Desert, Once-Barren Lives Bloom", "body_text": " **********The soil is sandy in this unpretentious little village on the edge of the desert. The 40 homes are made of mud and have plastic windows, but they are buttressed by hope: a yearning by the peasants who come here that the village will mark an escape from the poverty that has been the lot of their families for scores of generations. **********Everyone here is a newcomer, a pioneer trying to forge a new life and wring crops from what is now desert. The migrants come from the impoverished hill country 200 miles south of here, where many people live in caves and lack enough to eat. The settlers are part of an ambitious Government program to resettle 210,000 poor peasants on land reclaimed from the desert with the help of Yellow River irrigation projects. **********''Of course it was sad to leave my old village,'' Chen Wenxue, a wiry 25-year-old man, said as he showed off the plain mud hut into which he moved a year ago with his wife and infant child. ''Even though it wasn't a good place, and it was poor, it was still home. But this is better for the child.'' **********A Better House Is Next **********A short walk way, the family of Yu Liujin is planting a vegetable garden and planning how to spend the money from this year's harvest. Should they save for a bicycle, a television, or a better house? It is a novel problem for a family that used to spend all its money to survive, but Mr. Yu, 34 years old, decides that the priority is to build a fancier house with plaster walls and a concrete floor. **********''After some others came here and found a good life, I made up my mind to move as well,'' said Mr. Yu, who arrived a few months ago with his wife and four children. (The last baby was unauthorized, but officials judged him so poor that instead of fining him they settled for sterilizing his wife.) ''I decided that our lives could be improved,'' he said. ''For now it's not much better here. But give us a few years, and things will get better.'' **********This faith that life will improve is nurtured by the experience of those who moved earlier to this valley about 25 miles southwest of Yinchuan, the capital of the Ningxia autonomous region in northwestern China. Some 160,000 people have been resettled in six years and 50,000 more are scheduled to move before the project is completed in 1992. **********Projects to relocate peasants from places of endemic poverty are under way in other parts of China, but this is one of the most ambitious. About 5 percent of Ningxia's population will be relocated. **********Yet migration to escape poverty is a Chinese tradition; most of today's migrants are descendents of peasants who fled war and turmoil in Shaanxi Province in central China in the 19th century. **********The resettlement programs may also be a test case for the removal of vast numbers of people if the Government goes ahead with a proposal to build a huge dam on the Yangtze River. Depending on the height of the dam, known as the Three Gorges Project, 200,000 to 1.4 million people would have to be resettled from low-lying farmland. **********A Hard Life at First **********In Ningxia, the new settlers initially face a hard life, but they are buoyed by the experience of those who came earlier - people like 23-year-old Ma Xiangmei, who came with her husband in 1985. **********The couple decided to migrate after hunger forced them to sell their wedding presents: one wristwatch and one bicycle. They packed their belongings in a pair of small orange overnight suitcases and climbed onto a truck that could fit not only nine destitute families but all their goods. **********''When we first came I wasn't used to it and I longed for my hometown,'' Miss Ma said as she tended the garden in front of her home. ''But now I like it and it's much more prosperous here. I won't go back.'' **********The couple's life is still hard, but now they have a bicycle as well as a watch each. They have even splurged on a black and white television set, which sits opposite the kang, the traditional Chinese platform bed that is heated by a fire beneath in winter. They can lie on the kang, lean back against the wallpaper (old copies of People's Daily), and feel that they are part of the modern world. **********Almost All Do Better **********Almost all of those who came in the early years seem have improved their lot. Ma Chunming, a muscular 29-year-old peasant, and his wife, Yu Ailan, 28, earned only about $50 a year in their old village and they say it was often a struggle to afford food and clothing. They still have not raised the money for a television set, but they have replaced their mud hut with a three-room house that has glass windows, a cement floor and plaster walls. **********Mr. Ma and Miss Yu moved in 1984, at the beginning of the resettlement program, and they acknowledge that at first they had doubts. At that time, many peasants in the poor areas refused to move. **********''They lived in the mountains and had closed minds,'' said Cao Zhesheng, a Ningxia official who has helped oversee the resettlement. ''They didn't know anything about the outside world. And they knew about dry farming, not about cultivating irrigated land.'' **********Now word has filtered back to the hometowns that the settlers have prospered and resistance to migration has turned into a waiting list to join the program. **********''At first, I was very sad to leave my parents and my ancestral home,'' Mr. Ma recalled. ''The old place was spectacularly beautiful with trees and grass, and it was tough to get used to the sand and the climate here. But then we saw that here it is much easier to make a living.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/11/world/21-south-africans-are-released-under-political-prisoner-amnesty.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1990-10-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 544, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "21 South Africans Are Released Under Political-Prisoner Amnesty", "print_headline": "21 South Africans Are Released Under Political-Prisoner Amnesty", "body_text": " **********The Government released 21 political prisoners today, and the African National Congress, while welcoming the move, responded by insisting that all political prisoners still behind bars be released immediately. **********The release of the captives was a consequence of President F. W. de Klerk's announcement on Monday that an indemnity against prosecution would be extended to political exiles and prisoners. **********At their first formal meeting in Cape Town from May 2 to 4, the Government and the Congress established a joint working group to define political crimes and work out conditions for an amnesty of those prisoners and exiles accused of committing them. The amnesty, which the African National Congress has set as a condition for its participation in negotiations on the country's future, was discussed in greater detail at a second round of talks in Pretoria on Aug. 6. **********Although the details have yet to be disclosed, the two sides are believed to have agreed upon a phased amnesty, beginning with cases of purely political offenses like treason and continuing later to cases involving violent crimes like murder. **********Political Trials to Continue **********Mr. de Klerk declared a cut off date effective on Oct. 8, the day of his announcement, after which offenses would not be covered. He also said the amnesty would not be automatic, meaning that prisoners or exiles would have to apply and that those facing trial for political crimes would have to go through the judicial system. **********The African National Congress said all political prisoners qualified for release under Mr. de Klerk's announcement and that all political trials should be halted. **********''What is the logic of determining a cutoff date and in the same breath pursuing legal processes or continuing to punish those whose only crime is their opposition to the criminal system of apartheid,'' the Congress said in a statement. **********The African National Congress estimated the number of political prisoners in South Africa at 3,500. **********Estimates of Political Prisoners **********It was not clear what the Congress is basing its estimate on. The Human Rights Commission, a body created nearly two years ago to monitor human rights from the perspective of the anti-apartheid movement, says it has counted less than 1,600 political prisoners in South African jails. It has speculated that others it does not know about could push the total as high as 3,000. **********One of those released today, Titus Hendricks, who spent four years in the maximum-security prison at Robben Island, said at a news conference in Cape Town that 200 ''comrades'' were still left on Robben Island. **********Fifteen of those released today came from Robben Island, traveling on a ferry across a half dozen miles of chilly Atlantic waters to Cape Town.

The financial bind felt these days by Mr. Campeau was underlined earlier this month when he was forced to surrender about $100 million of his stock to the National Bank of Canada. He had to hand over the shares on Jan. 4, when he could not make payments on loans made to a pair of his investment companies. His Campeau shares had been put up as collateral on the bank loans. **********Chateau May Be for Sale **********In recent days, it has been rumored in Toronto that Mr. Campeau's mock 18th-century French chateau has been put up for sale. Yet with his far-flung real estate holdings and the investment companies he controls, his personal wealth remains difficult to measure, analysts say. **********Mr. Campeau is a classic outsider who flouted Canadian business and social conventions, and the view on Bay Street, Toronto's financial community, toward his fall is already apparent. Sympathy is scarce. **********''The attitude on Bay Street is that he went down to the United States and vastly overpaid for what he bought,'' said Porter Davis, an American who is an investor on the Toronto Stock Exchange. ''Now that it's caught up with him, I'd say that a lot of people up here couldn't be happier.'' **********Even before the recent troubles, Mr. Campeau's role in the affairs of his company had been drastically reduced. On Thursday, Mr. Campeau's fellow board members voted to remove him as chairman of the American operations. **********Elusive Figure in Recent Months **********In recent months, as Campeau's American retailing subsidiaries, Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores, have teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, Mr. Campeau has been an elusive figure. Company insiders were quoted in Canadian newspapers as saying that Mr. Campeau had played little part in the marathon board discussions in recent days, where the future of the company was being weighed. In the board room, one insider said, there was ''a tacit acceptance'' that Mr. Campeau was no longer a major force at the company he founded. **********For Mr. Campeau, it has been a precipitous fall from the heady days of March 1988, when his $6.6 billion takeover of Federated, following the $3.6 billion takeover of Allied in October 1986, created an impressive department store empire in the United States. Back then, he was on magazine covers in both nations, held packed news conferences and was at glittering parties that drew some of America's best-known names in business, fashion and entertainment. **********Some of the most lavish parties were held in the Campeaus' homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and in Toronto's rustic Bridle Path district, where Mr. Campeau and his German-born wife, Ilse, are said to have spent more than $5 million on a layout that includes a marble staircase, an Olympic-size indoor pool and a paneled library. **********Takeover Blocked in 1980 **********Mr. Campeau has had a longstanding feud with the Toronto business establishment. In 1980, it closed ranks to block his attempted takeover of the Royal Trust Company, one of Canada's largest finance houses. **********Mr. Campeau complained that he had been frozen out by Toronto's English-speaking banking and business elite because he is a French Canadian, and because he lacked the connections forged in expensive private schools and sporting clubs. After suffering what members of his family subsequently described as a nervous breakdown, Mr. Campeau returned to the fray determined to silence his Toronto detractors by plunging into the big leagues of American business. **********One of the more sympathetic verdicts on Mr. Campeau was offered by Peter Newman, a Canadian author. Writing in Maclean's magazine last fall, Mr. Newman said Mr. Campeau's had been ''the classic tragedy of a gutsy entrepreneur reaching beyond his means to grasp the social legitimacy that had always eluded him.'' Mr. Campeau, Mr. Newman said, chose ''to mortgage his soul to prove to Canada's elite just how big a deal he could pull off.'' In Canadian business, Mr. Newman concluded, ''he will not be missed.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/28/business/oil-company-profits-drop.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 283, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Oil Company Profits Drop", "print_headline": "Oil Company Profits Drop", "body_text": " **********Despite a rise in revenues, the profitability of the 20 largest United States oil companies fell in the first half of the year, the American Petroleum Institute said on Sunday. **********But the companies' prospects are likely to improve sharply in the second half because of the 50 percent rise in crude oil prices since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. **********The A.P.I., a trade group, said that profits as a percentage of stockholder equity fell to 13.2 percent in the first half, from 15.8 percent in the period last year.

In fact, a recently published report, ''Leadership for a Changing World - The Future Role of Graduate Management Education,'' discusses some of the steps business school deans and business leaders consider necessary. **********John Rosenblum, the dean of the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration at the University of Virginia and a co-chairman of the academic commission that prepared the report, spoke about some of the more provocative ideas in an interview last week. **********One of the big concerns among the deans is how the already crowded M.B.A. curriculum will deal with a host of newly emerging topics, including ethics, the environment and international business. **********As one answer, Dr. Rosenblum and others have been discussing changes in the traditional two-year M.B.A. program, with many criticizing the European idea of an intensive 11-month program and the 15-month program offered at some American graduate schools. Dr. Rosenblum said there are some creative alternatives. **********''A few of us on the commission discussed a year program right after college, a second year about six years later in a person's career, followed by a two-month program in another six years,'' he said. ''I think the idea is worth considering. It would help free ourselves from the paradigm, or box, of the traditional two-year M.B.A. program.'' **********Such a plan would allow students to gain experience, while giving experienced managers an opportunity to continue their formal educations. ''Managers need to constantly reinvent themselves,'' Dr. Rosenblum said. **********Another concern has been that some business school professors spend too much time on research that is not helpful to business. In its report, the commission stressed that business schools had tended to concentrate on ''elegant, abstract models'' that seek to unify world economic systems rather than help students understand ''the messy, concrete reality of international business.'' **********The commission, while stressing the importance of ''effective scholarship,'' urged that professors acquire more business knowledge to ''relate their scholarship to problems facing business leaders.'' The report also noted that some knowledge and skills ''may be best provided by faculty with managerial experience.'' **********Dr. Rosenblum agreed wholeheartedly with that last point and said he had added experienced corporate managers to his faculty - not just as adjunct professors but as full players. **********''Faculty are enriched by diversity,'' he added. **********One of those managers is Thomas C. MacAvoy, 62 years old, a former president of Corning Inc., the upstate New York glassware company. **********''He is a chaired professor who teaches a course called 'Innovation and Technological Management,' '' Dr. Rosenblum said. ''And he has collaborated in the design of our new course in leadership, which will be given this fall for the first time.'' **********Another is Robert J. Sack, 56, who was a partner for 25 years in the former accounting firm of Touche Ross, which is now Deloitte Touche, and was also chief accountant for the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********''He has come here to teach international financial reporting and also a course on communicating corporate value,'' Dr. Rosenblum said. ''In both cases they are the kind of professionals that would fit well as members of the tenured faculty.'' **********Dr. Rosenblum also said that many graduate business schools should find niches. **********He applauded Rollins College's Roy E. Crummer Graduate School of Business, where the dean, Martin Schatz, hires only older, experienced professors with Ph.D.'s. **********Dr. Rosenblum noted that Rollins stressed teaching and course development over research. **********The campus at Winter Park, Fla., obviously also has an attraction for many older professors at a time when business school professors are in short supply. **********''The difference between a teaching faculty and a research faculty is in what the faculty publishes, rather than if the faculty publishes.'' Dr. Schatz said. ''We encourage our people to publish material that improves the teaching process. Unlike many other schools, we value the publication of textbooks.'' **********Dr. Rosenblum called this a powerful niche strategy. ''I think we should celebrate differences among graduate schools of business,'' he added. ''More schools need a self-identity. We hope that this booklet will be a catalyst to more creative thinking like this.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/10/world/hong-kong-to-try-5-beijing-foes-charge-illegal-use-of-megaphones.html": {"writer_name": "Sheryl Wudunn", "pub_date": "1990-07-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 790, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hong Kong to Try 5 Beijing Foes; Charge: Illegal Use of Megaphones", "print_headline": "Hong Kong to Try 5 Beijing Foes; Charge: Illegal Use of Megaphones", "body_text": " **********In a few days, the British Government will put on trial five prominent pro-democracy campaigners accused of using hand-held megaphones without a permit at demonstrations here.

Chinese officials criticized the protests. **********Since the crackdown in Beijing in June 1989, Hong Kong democracy protesters - students, scholars and professionals - have become much more active in the territory. Small demonstrations take place regularly. **********'Pressure From the Chinese' **********''I think it faced pressure from the Chinese,'' Mr. Fung said of the British Government about his prosecution and conviction. ''It wants to suppress the political activities of the democracy activists in Hong Kong.'' **********A spokeswoman at the attorney general's office would not comment on the cases. Still, Hong Kong officials deny that they are trying to suppress democracy, but say that they must preserve stability in the territory, and that the territory must live with the reality that it has a powerful northern neighbor, whom it will not help to offend. **********In May, leaders of Hong Kong's democracy movement were making plans to commemorate the first anniversary on June 4 of the suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing. Nearly 100,000 people took to the streets to commemorate that day. **********Two of the defendents, Albert C. Y.

The law banning megaphones without a permit was among them. **********The Government has proposed a two-year freeze on the bill, after it is adopted so inconsistent laws can be revised to conform with the Bill of Rights.

Fung, who is leading the defense in the megaphone case.

Typically participants can change their investment mix in December, and the right choice now can make a considerable difference at retirement time. **********\"Many small companies no longer offer pension plans,\" said Charles H. Salisbury Jr., managing director of T. Rowe Price Associates, the Baltimore-based investment-management and mutual fund organization. \"They do offer defined-contribution plans\" in which the employee chooses how much is to be set aside in tax-deferred retirement accounts, he added. **********Data from the Social Security Administration show that the percentage of privately employed workers covered by employer-financed pension plans seems to have peaked. The portion rose from about 25 percent in the early 1950's to 50 percent in 1979, but fell back to 46 percent in 1988. **********To the employee this is a two-edged sword. It can mean that many are without the benefit of professional pension managers, although often the options include professionally managed mutual funds. The positive aspect is that it can also mean greater long-term rewards for those who are disciplined about putting money into the plans and taking time and effort in managing their accounts. **********The most popular investment choice for employees' funds is a guaranteed investment contract issued by an insurance company or a similar contract issued by a bank. These contracts earn a guaranteed rate of interest, generally a bit higher than short-term money market instruments. Some 60 to 75 percent of employees' own money is in guaranteed investment contracts, retirement experts say. **********Other popular investment choices include: short-term Treasury or money-market funds, employer stock, Government bonds or other fixed-income securities, balanced mutual funds and equity funds. In the majority of 401(k) plans employers match employee contributions to some extent, mostly in the company's stock. **********Donald R. Levy, a lawyer and consultant on retirement and benefit plans for Maxwell Macmillan, cited a number of reasons that employees choose guaranteed investment contracts. \"Basically, the employee wants to be sure not to lose his or her own capital,\" he said. **********Nor is this employee conservatism wrong in Mr. Levy's opinion. \"I would favor G.I.C.'s over bond funds because bonds can fluctuate in value.\" he said. \"Employees should consider putting a goodpart in G.I.C.'s -- they're a good investment -- and for balance, consider equities and bonds.\" How much to put in each will vary. **********The first consideration, Mr. Levy said, is what the employer is putting in. Other considerations include the investment mix of any other retirement accounts that the person and his or her spouse have and their age and risk tolerance. **********Mr. Salisbury argues that younger employees in particular should \"accept more volatility in the earlier years to build up more savings.\" **********\"A 28-year-old or a 30-year-old should not have most of their money in guaranteed investment contracts,\" he said, adding, \"Buy stocks now when they are cheap.\" During eight postwar crises including the Korean War, President Kennedy's confrontation with U.S. Steel, President Nixon's resignation and the 1987 crash, he noted, stock prices tumbled, but in each case within six months to a year they recovered substantially, in many cases more than making up what they lost. And over the long term, equities have outperformed other investments. **********As people get older, they can shift more money into fixed income, he said, recommending 10 percent in fixed income for every decade of age. **********One way people can make their own determinations of how much to set aside and how to invest it is with a retirement planning kit that T. Rowe Price offers free to those who request it by calling 1-800-638-5660. It includes a workbook developed with Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm, with worksheets, and booklets on strategy and mutual funds. **********Another source of advice is the Price Waterhouse Retirement Planning Adviser, recently published by Pocket Books at $5.50. George E. L. Barbee, executive director of personal financial services for Price Waterhouse, advises people to make the maximum contribution possible to 401(k) plans both this year and next -- that's $7,979 this year -- \"especially if there's a match.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/07/business/move-by-savings-agency.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 150, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Move by Savings Agency", "print_headline": "Move by Savings Agency", "body_text": " **********The Government agency charged with selling failed savings and loan associations has adopted a policy requiring its employees to maintain a log of all telephone inquiries made by or on behalf of public officials.

Gelb, the agency's director, was offered the option of eliminating the programs of the Voice of America for one day a week in all of the 43 languages in which it broadcasts as a means of dealing with a shortage of more than $1 million in the operating budget. **********The director chose to keep the Voice of America on the air seven days a week and to make up the deficiency by trimming other U.S.I.A. programs, perhaps in the cultural exchange area. The gap resulted from interim appropriations legislation approved by Congress a few weeks ago. **********The cuts are occurring as a debate gets under way over the Government's broadcasting operations, a corollary in some respects to the national debate over what is to become of this country's defense establishment. **********Already, the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe have begun emphasizing their roles in helping the countries of the former Soviet bloc to ''build democracy.'' The radio service executives hope this will convince Congress of their continuing value in the era after the cold war. **********An Unsurmountable Problem **********Directly at issue in the debate are the Voice of America, which broadcasts globally, and Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, which broadcast from Munich to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Eventually, the cultural exchange and information programs of the U.S.I.A. could also become subject to questions about whether they belong elsewhere in the bureaucratic scene, Government officials said. **********The Munich stations confront one unsurmountable problem. Created at the height of the cold war and clandestinely financed by the Central Intelligence Agency, their mission was mainly to provide alternative sources of news and commentary for listeners in countries controlled by Communist governments - and those governments have for the most part vanished. **********The two stations currently broadcast in 23 languages, although not in English. After the C.I.A. financing was disclosed in the early 1970's, the stations' budgets were directly appropriated by the Government. **********The Voice of America, on the other hand, was founded in 1942. While for decades it also delivered cold war messages, including to audiences in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, its mandate remained global. **********H. Stanton Burnett, a counselor of the United States Information Agency during the Reagan Administration, recalled that the agency ''used the cold war to sell its budget,'' leading him to surmise that it will now have ''a harder time selling the larger package.'' **********Competition Intensifies **********The debate comes when the longstanding competition between the two broadcasting operations for Government funds is intensifying. **********An interagency group working under the National Security Council has been evaluating the Munich-based stations as well as the Voice of America. Its review will be given this summer to a bipartisan commission that will be formed to make recommendations on the future structuring of the Government's broadcasting services. **********Those recommendations will probably figure in hearings early next year in the House and Senate that could lead to Congressional proposals or legislation on changes in American broadcasting and perhaps deal with the future of the United States Information Agency as well. Some on Capitol Hill, including aides of Senator Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, think other institutions should take over the agency's functions. **********As in the past, there is some interest in Congress in combining the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty into an independent public institution like the British Broadcasting Corporation. Mr. Gelb, the U.S.I.A. director, acknowledged in an interview that this is ''a possibility that has been discussed.'' **********Last month, the radio debate was sharpened when the Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, which is appointed by the President, issued a report urging ''planning now for the termination of Radio Free Europe's language services'' and eventual ''transfer of assets as appropriate to the Voice of America.'' **********That proposal was assailed by Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., chairman of the Board for International Broadcasting, which oversees the Munich-based stations. Mr. Forbes accused the commission of having a ''less than objective perspective'' and said that its recommendation ''must be questioned in the light of the commission's close relationship with U.S.I.A.'' **********In his response to the presidential panel, Mr. Forbes was careful to distinguish between Radio Free Europe, which is perceived as vulnerable, and Radio Liberty, which broadcasts exclusively to the Soviet Union and whose continued usefulness is not being questioned at this time. **********Speaking of Radio Free Europe's East European service, which claims virtually saturation listenership in five countries, Mr. Forbes asserted that it was ''premature to call for an end of R.F.E. broadcasts,'' describing them as ''a valuable trademark that must be preserved.'' **********Battle Lines Are Drawn **********But within the stations themselves the battle lines have already been drawn. **********A middle-level Government official bitterly compared the two operations to a thoroughbred and an underfed workhorse. The well-nourished thoroughbred is Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty, which has broadcast to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union since the early 1950's. The workhorse is the Voice of America, which broadcasts globally in 43 languages, including English. **********''Both horses are sick,'' the official said, ''but the prize horse has a terminal disease'' because the cold war for which it was bred has ended. **********The official said that Voice of America, although it broadcasts in almost twice as many languages as the Munich stations, has a current operations budget of under $171 million compared with $190 million for Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty. Next year's budget foresees $2 million less for Voice of America but no change for the Munich stations. **********''We are bleeding to death,'' said Robert T. Coonrod, Voice of America's deputy director, said. **********Budget constraints have meant that in Africa the Voice's network of part-time correspondents is drying up and in Warsaw funds stretch only for irrregular staffing of the Voice's bureau.

The ever-changing numbers directly influence the wholesale price he pays for oil and, in turn, what he ends up charging his customers. He doesn't like what he sees on his screen and his customers don't like what they see on their bills. **********In the last three and half months, Mr. Allegretti, president of the Bayside Fuel Oil Corporation in Brooklyn, has seen heating oil prices for residential customers soar to about $1.40 a gallon, following crude oil's rise to nearly $40 a barrel from $23. In the last few days, crude has come down to about $30 a barrel, and heating oil contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange are now about 86 cents a gallon.  Northeast Concentration **********The prices have been swinging back and forth because oil traders, like traders at the other futures and stock exchanges, have been basing many of their buy and sell decisions on news and rumors about Middle East tensions. **********Mr. Allegretti, 55 years old, has been following the markets long enough to know they respond to all kinds of forces, real and imagined. But he and other deliverers say they cannot help but feel exasperation at the unusual degree of market instability ever since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. **********Adding to their frustration, they say, is that heating oil stocks are plentiful and the weather in the Northeast has been unusually mild for most the heating season so far. Those factors normally would have prevailed to keep prices more stable and relatively low. **********Oil burners are used to circulate hot water or steam to heat 15 percent of the homes in the United States, but 44 percent of those in the Northeast, according to the Commerce Department. **********\"All the people that sell me oil price their prices on the Merc,\" Mr. Allegretti said in his roomy split-level office overlooking Gravesend Bay in Bensonhurst. \"But I think it's too speculative. It's the tail leading the dog.\" **********As a result, even before winter sets in, dealers like Mr. Allegretti are feeling the wrath of consumers who remember paying less than $1 a gallon for most of last winter. **********\"They're angry as could be at us,\" Mr. Allegretti said. \"I don't know if people are going to be able to swallow these price increases.\" **********Home heating oil deliverers who were feeling unjustly persecuted for the rising prices probably had \"a legitimate beef\" after the initial surge in August and September, said Chris Dyson, research director of Buyers Up, a Washington-based consumer organization. But recently, when the wholesale price fell, retail prices hardly dropped at all, he said, suggesting that some deliverers had kept prices higher than necessary. **********The dealers' price for heating oil in the Northeast fell 10 cents a gallon during the week of Oct. 23, he said, while the price they charged customers dropped only a penny. **********Mr. Allegretti said that when the wholesale prices were at their highest about six weeks ago, his profits actually decreased. He said that to give his customers a break he did not mark up his selling price as much as he might have, thus shrinking his profit margin. For example, when he was buying oil at $1.04 a gallon, he sold it at $1.35; yesterday, when he bought it at 84 cents he sold it at $1.30. On the day of the invasion of Kuwait he was paying 60 cents a gallon and selling it for 99 cents. **********The prices of home heating oil contracts on the Merc fell steeply for several days in mid-October, to 76 cents a gallon from a high of about $1.06. Then they picked again, although they have been falling this week to close at 84 cents yesterday for the December contract.   Role of Fantasy and Rumor **********Industry analysts say that if fighting starts in the Middle East, the prices will soar. \"People are sophisticated enough to know that the Iraqi-Kuwait situation is the cause,\" said Robert Greenes, a director of the Metropolitan Energy Council, a trade organization that promotes the use of oil heat in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. **********\"But human nature allows them to manifest their anger at the one guy they see,\" he said, \"like the oil deliverer or the guy who runs the service station. They can't yell at the Exxons of the world, or the Saudis.\" **********He also said that heating oil deliverers were being unfairly blamed even when \"the earlier price rise prompted by the Mideast crisis was based on fantasy and rumor\" on the Merc. **********The dealers say they have little choice but to pay the refineries whatever prices result from Merc trading or risk being caught short of supplies. And they say that to stay in business they must pass the higher prices on to their customers. **********The more-than-adequate supply of heating oil now is in contrast to the situation last winter, when a record cold snap in December caused some shortages and briefly sent the price up to $1.60 a gallon. Heating-oil refineries have been operating at maximum capacity, partly in reaction to the dip in stocks last winter, and partly to build up new stocks as a safeguard against shortages that might be caused if the supply of crude oil from the Persian Gulf is cut.  Shortage Called Unlikely **********Mr. Allegretti, whose family has owned Bayside since 1933, generally buys and sells oil only as he and his customers need it. That means his company can be caught with little to sell if there is a nationwide shortage. He rarely sets fixed delivery prices for a full heating season, so his prices can fluctuate as much as the Merc, something his customers do not appreciate when the only direction of prices seems to be up. **********With 25,000 retail customers on Long Island and in the five boroughs of New York, and 125 smaller oil delivery companies as wholesale customers, Bayside is one of the largest suppliers in the metropolitan area. **********Most of the oil that fills Mr. Allegretti's 90 delivery trucks comes from the New Jersey refineries of large oil companies like Exxon, Gulf and Amoco. The oil gets to Bensonhurst by boat and truck. **********Phillip R. Chisholm, executive vice president of the Petroleum Marketers Association of America, a Washington-based industry group, said that because of the high output now the industry was unlikely to face winter shortages even under the worst circumstances -- a brutally cold winter, coupled with all-out war in the Middle East. **********Many consumers seem to be filling their tanks now instead of waiting for colder weather, hoping to beat further price increases."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/07/world/german-greens-still-fighting-each-other-review-election-debacle.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1990-12-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 907, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "German Greens, Still Fighting Each Other, Review Election Debacle", "print_headline": "German Greens, Still Fighting Each Other, Review Election Debacle", "body_text": " **********The moderates accused the radicals of living by \"rejection.\" The radicals attacked moderates as \"undertakers,\" and for good measure blasted a newly arrived eastern German member as a \"reactionary.\" Petra Kelly blasted them all as \"mullahs of the party factions who have coagulated in dogmatism.\" **********Beaten, battered and possibly destroyed by their drubbing in Sunday's election, the Greens were still at it, as if determined to go out with the same defiance, irreverence and chaos with which they first invaded the corridors of mainstream politics a decade ago. **********Meeting in the environmentally sound conference room they had built in the Parliament building eight years ago, the 46 departing western German Green members of Parliament seemed agreed on only one point: that if the movement did survive, it could not avoid the schism that has all but paralyzed the Greens in recent years. **********\"The election result showed that the anti-party party project has failed,\" declared Wolfgang Ullmann, a pastor from Berlin who arrived in Bonn with the small group of eastern German Greens and civic-movement leaders to whom the mantle of left-wing protest now passes.  Only 3.9 Percent of Vote **********In Sunday's election, the western German Greens mustered only 3.9 percent of the vote, less than the 5 percent needed to secure a seat in Parliament and far below the 8.3 percent they won in 1987. That meant that all 46 western German members of Parliament, and their staff of about 260, would have to vacate their parliamentary offices and lose much of their income this month. **********The western Greens might have retained some seats if they had united before the elections with the eastern German Greens, since their combined vote would have nudged them over the 5 percent barrier. But because they were opposed in principle to the \"colonialization\" of the east, the Greens had postponed uniting their parties until after the election. **********The eastern German coalition of Greens and civic movements -- the remnants of New Forum and the other movements that arose during the 1989 uprisings -- won 6.1 percent of the vote in the east, enough, under the special rules for this election, to claim eight seats in Parliament. **********Whether the election really was the death knell of the Greens will become clear only at their next party congress in the spring, and before that they face elections in Hesse state on Jan. 20. But the election defeat seemed to sever the last fragile links between the bitterly divided factions in the movement.  'Realos' vs. 'Fundis' **********Leaders of the pragmatic \"realo\" wing, led by Joschke Fischer, declared that only by engaging in active politics could the movement recover. \"You cannot keep ignoring the laws of political physics and reduce yourself to non-representation,\" he declared as he proposed changes to move the Greens to a more established leadership. **********From the radical \"fundi\" wing, whose members believed in keeping the Greens as a voice of radical opposition and permanent resistance, Jutta Ditfurth fired back that if the party went the way of conventional politics, she and her comrades would quit. **********\"If they come through with what they just proposed, then it's over, the Greens are dead,\" she declared to reporters outside the hall where Mr. Fischer had just finished a news conference. \"This is really a news conference of undertakers.\" **********Ms. Ditfurth rejected the notion that it was the public infighting that had damaged the movement. On the contrary, she declared, it was the realos' efforts to squelch debate that put people off. \"The public loved the fights, against NATO, for social change,\" she said. \"These were good fights. They raised consciousness.\" **********Somewhere between the two, Miss Kelly, 42 years old and a founder of the movement, declared that the party had committed suicide through its internal struggles. \"Each side keeps telling the other to go home, but when they leave the roof caves in,\" she said. \"In the end the voters never learned about the good things we were still doing, because all the media tuned into was the fight.\"  Bickering Over Reunification **********To outside commentators, the bickering that hurt the most came over German unity. Radical Greens rejected unity outright; others, including Miss Kelly, criticized it but accepted it; others supported it. In the end the party emerged without a position on the most fateful issue of the campaign. **********At the same time, the Greens' original cause, the environment, became a standard plank of the mainstream parties, especially in the campaign of Oskar Lafontaine, the Social Democratic candidate. **********Ultimately the bickering and the loss of strong issues were less direct causes of the Greens' loss than symptoms of the movement's middle age, of its doomed efforts to perpetuate the heady resistance of the 1960's. **********\"We need a radical rejuvenation of our party,\" Mr. Fischer said. \"The youth was our source of life. When we lost that, we lost the elections. The generation of the 1960's is now into parenthood and even grandparenthood.\"  Deputies Were Rotated **********Ever seeking to combat institutionalization, the Greens experimented with constant rotation of parliamentary deputies, with fuzzy lines of command and an antipathy to party discipline. The best known of the Greens faded into the background because of the mandatory rotation. **********The bulk of the party's losses were defections: 600,000 voters switched to the Social Democrats, 140,000 to the Christian Democrats.

Preventing Problems **********\"This is not so much a meeting to solve problems as to prevent them,\" said a Mexican official involved in preparations for the visit. \"We believe we have better relations with this Administration than with any other in years, and we don't want to lose the chance to keep things going forward.\" **********Preliminary discussions toward a Mexican-American free-trade agreement have been under way since the two Governments formally accepted the idea during a visit by Mr. Salinas to Washington in June. **********Since then, however, the environment for direct negotiations has been sharply affected by a series of international developments, ranging from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to the stalemate of the Uruguay Round of international trade talks in Geneva. **********Among the major outstanding issues in the talks is the degree to which any free-trade agreement would cover Mexico's large oil sector, which Mr. Salinas has repeatedly said must be excluded from negotiation. American interest in that issue has grown with the potential for conflict in the Persian Gulf, but senior aides to Mr. Salinas asserted again last week that he would not accept oil as part of the trade package. **********Other concerns, officials said, include efforts in both countries to allay domestic opposition to the pact, which must overcome sharp differences in everything from wages to environmental restrictions.

Both are strong advocates of foreign ownership of Czechoslovak companies to make them efficient and competitive in world markets. **********Party at the Guggenheim **********The two officials were guests in New York last night at a party at the Guggenheim Museum given by Salomon Brothers and at a private dinner at the home of William Luers, president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a former United States Ambassador to Czechoslovakia. **********The dinner guest list included E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Anthony Solomon, the bank's former president and now an investment banker; Robert Hormats, an investment banker at Goldman, Sachs & Company, and Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economist who is advising the Czechoslovak Government. **********Rather than rely on foreign loans to modernize industry - loans that might result in a burdensome foreign debt -the Havel team would encourage foreign companies to put businesses in Czechoslovakia and also to purchase some major state-owned manufacturing operations. Josef Tosovsky, president of the State Bank of Czechoslovakia, said yesterday in Washington that President Havel is not seeking credits or loans during his visit to the United States. **********Legislation Planned **********The Havel Government is drafting legislation that would permit foreign ownership and make other changes favorable to foreign investment. Under current law, a foreign company can be only a minority partner in a joint venture. **********But anticipating that the necessary legislation will soon be adopted by Parliament, some big American companies are negotiating with state-owned Czechoslovak operations, particularly those manufacturers with products that could be exported to Western Europe, according to people involved in the discussions. **********The General Electric Company, for example, is holding talks with the Skoda Engineering Works, a manufacturer of power equipment and other machinery, in competition against Siemens A.G. The Chrysler Corporation has held talks with a separate Skoda company, the manufacturer of autos. One competitor is Mazda.

Bankers say they can often earn more from specialized transactions such as interest rate swaps than from direct loans. **********As the largest bank in the country, with the largest portfolio of real estate loans, Citibank has not avoided the losses from bad real estate loans that have hit many American banks over the last 18 months. In its annual report, Citibank said it expects the level of bad loans that are not currently paying interest to continue rising in 1990. **********Opportunity to Expand **********Already well known in real estate circles as buyers of prestigious office buildings, from Rockefeller Center in New York to the Arco Plaza in Los Angeles, Japanese bankers say they see an opportunity to expand their business and are busy hiring American experts in construction lending. **********Included among the new projects they are financing are buildings in Jersey City for Merrill Lynch & Company; an office tower next to Carnegie Hall in Manhattan, and the Park Hyatt Hotel in Santa Monica, Calif. **********''There is a real war going on for market share of first-class construction projects between foreign and domestic banks,'' said David Schulman, a real estate analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. ''The domestic banks have to decide if they want to fight for the large, high-visibility projects.'' **********Japanese bank executives recognize that real estate markets are slumping in many parts of the country. But looking ahead to better times, they want to become better established in real estate lending, particularly for new construction, because it can be much more profitable than other areas of bank lending. **********And to earn the greatest profits in the few good projects available, Japanese bankers want to take roles as lead banks, rather than continuing to be junior partners of American and other foreign banks. Executives at American and European banks and real estate developers say Japanese bankers will probably succeed. **********American bankers facing the stiffer competition from Japanese and other foreign banks say they are handicapped by fear of criticism from Federal bank regulators. Tougher standards by Federal bank examiners on real estate loans forced the Bank of New England Corporation to announce a $1.1 billion loss for 1989. **********And other banks around the country have pulled back from real estate lending until they know more about the new standards and there are more signs of stability in real estate prices. These new standards do not apply to branches of Japanese and other foreign banks, greatly improving their ability to attract developers' business. **********'Alternative Sources' **********Robert F. Upton, a vice president at the New York branch of the Mitsui Bank, said that the contraction of the savings and loan industry was also favoring expansion by Japanese bankers. **********''Developers who once worked with savings and loans who are no longer in business will now have to look for alternative sources of credit,'' said Mr. Upton, who joined the bank last October. Japanese banks are already active in making mortgage loans, he said, and are now hiring technical experts who can handle construction lending as well. **********Haruhiko Watanabe, vice president in the New York branch of the Fuji Bank, said that the Japanese bank could remain active in real estate financing during the slump because it was a conservative lender during the building boom of the 1980's and avoided the losses now hurting many American banks. ''Even though the market is bad, we think there can be good projects,'' he said. **********As Japanese banks gained experience, Mr. Watanabe said, they have received many loan requests from developers who were attracted by the lower interest rates available from Japanese banks. **********Henry Elghanayan, owner of the Rockrose Development Corporation, developer of a 60-story office building next to Carnegie Hall on 57th Street in mid-Manhattan, said that Fuji Bank's interest rate on a $125 million construction loan was a percentage point lower than that offered by American banks. ''And Fuji took the entire loan without it being conditioned on their being able to find other participants,'' he added. ''That's something U.S. banks don't do.'' **********For many years, American banks have welcomed the Japanese as junior members of the lending groups needed to finance large office buildings. Such sharing is likely to continue, bankers said, even though Japanese banks are now competing for the more profitable role of lead bank. **********Lower Rates for Juniors **********All junior members of lending groups for construction loans, not just Japanese banks, normally find themselves ''scalped,'' collecting a lower interest rate on their loan than the full rate charged to the borrower. The difference, typically five-hundredths to 25-hundredths of a percentage point, is pocketed by the lead bank. In addition, the lead banker usually keeps half or more of the loan commitment fee, which can equal about 1 percent of the total loan. **********Although the lead bank has more responsibilities and expenses, such as studying the feasibility of the project and monitoring construction so that money is not paid out faster than needed, the extra payments make the role of lead banker more profitable and very desirable. **********''As long as we were going to be involved and exposed to the risk of loss, we decided to do the business as a lead bank, in a way that gives us control over our destiny,'' said Yasuhisa Fujita, deputy general manager at the New York branch of the Tokai Bank Ltd. ''Japanese banks have been regarded as merely funds providers,'' Mr. Fujita said, ''but with the proper people, we can establish ourselves as professionals who can handle all aspects of the business.'' **********Mr. Fujita said Tokai planned to increase its American commercial real estate lending, including construction loans, by three or four times this year, but he declined to identify a dollar goal. **********Americans Hired **********To guide the expansion, the Japanese bank last year hired Kevin J. Mulvaney and Bruce F. Evans, two Americans with construction-lending experience at other banks. Among Tokai's early construction-lending efforts was co-managing with the Bank of Montreal a $180 million loan for an office building at 101 Hudson Street in Jersey City, where Merrill Lynch will move much of its back-office operations. **********Stephen W. Laver, a principal at the Trammel Crow Group, a real estate development firm, said Japanese lenders were involved to some degree in almost every Trammel Crow project. Rather than merely joining lending groups managed by others, he said, ''the Japanese banks are increasingly developing a direct-lending ability.'' **********One aspect where Japanese banks can be especially effective, he said, is in attracting money from other Japanese investors who want to own or make long-term investments in American buildings. Japanese regional banks, about three dozen of which have American offices, have money to invest but do not have the personnel to originate their own loans. They are prime candidates to participate in loans managed by larger banks like Tokai, Mr. Fujita said. **********Reputation for Price-Cutting **********In an effort to improve profitablity - an area where Japanese banks lag far behind competitors from other parts of the world - some Japanese bankers are trying to shed the image as price-cutters. **********''Profits in construction lending are already shrinking due to price competition, and we do not aim to aggravate that situation by competing for new deals on price,'' said Mr. Mulvaney of the Tokai Bank. ''Our pricing plan is to be the equal of American banks. We would rather do half as many deals if it meant the profit margins would be twice as high.'' **********As Japanese bankers push for more business, real estate experts are wondering if the Japanese can avoid the losses incurred by some savings and loan associations that reached for the profits of construction lending but ended up making too many bad loans. **********Japanese bankers vow that they will be cautious. But the real estate market has been treacherous, even for the most experienced American banks. **********''The near-term outlook for real estate is not positive,'' the Real Estate Research Corporation said in the 1990 edition of Emerging Trends in Real Estate. With domestic banks and insurance companies awash in bad loans, it said, ''increasingly active foreign banks might look at the carcasses before they try to pick up the slack.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/25/business/credit-markets-us-securities-narrowly-mixed.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1990-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 717, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  U.S. Securities Narrowly Mixed", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS;   U.S. Securities Narrowly Mixed", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury notes and bonds were narrowly mixed in a turbulent session yesterday, despite reports suggesting the economy is gathering strength and that inflation remains a real worry. **********The 6.7 percent rise in durable goods orders for March was much stronger than economists had projected.

W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela agreed today to reschedule formal talks between the Government and the African National Congress on a political settlement on South Africa's future. **********The talks, originally planned for April 11, were canceled by the African National Congress last week, after the police fired on anti-apartheid demonstrators. **********After three hours of unexpectedly amiable talks this evening at Tuynhuys, the President's office here, Mr. de Klerk told reporters that he and Mr. Mandela had settled on a new date, which he said would be announced ''fairly soon.'' **********'Cordial Nature' of Meeting **********Mr. Mandela said the date would be made public after it was cleared with the executive committee of the African National Congress, which remains in exile in Zambia. **********''The cordial nature of the discussions and the concessions that had been made by both sides gave us the impression that we are correct in sitting down with the Government,'' Mr. Mandela said at a news conference later. **********The breakthrough in the meeting occurred after President de Klerk promised an investigation of the police shooting of black protesters in Sebokeng, a township in the southern Transvaal, on March 26. **********De Klerk Orders Inquest **********At least 11 people were killed in the ensuing violence and more than 400 were wounded, many by shotgun pellets fired by the police. In protest, the African National Congress said last Saturday that it was pulling out of the April 11 talks. The two sides had been scheduled to discuss obstacles to the organization's formal participation in negotiations that Mr. de Klerk wants to hold on a new constitution that would extend political rights to the country's black majority. **********Some critics of the African National Congress suggested that it was stalling for time because it was unprepared to talk to the Government. Mr. Mandela reiterated tonight that the talks were suspended because of what he called ''the massacre of innocent and defenseless people in Sebokeng.'' **********President de Klerk said he had directed that an inquest into the deaths be carried out by a judge. He also said his Cabinet would discuss at its next meeting the appointment of a judicial commission of inquiry. **********''I have already given instructions for an in-depth investigation of what happened there,'' Mr. de Klerk told reporters after his meeting with Mr. Mandela and three other representatives of the African National Congress. **********Hopes for Talks With Pretoria **********Mr. de Klerk carefully avoided conceding that the police had been guilty of any brutality. ''They are there to protect life and property,'' he said. **********Mr. Mandela declined to appear with President de Klerk to talk to reporters after their meeting. But he said the ''cordial and pleasant atmosphere'' had resulted in a productive meeting. Mr. de Klerk, speaking separately, described their talks as not only ''very frank'' but also ''very fruitful.'' **********The meeting was the first between Mr. de Klerk and Mr. Mandela since the latter was freed after 27 1/2 years in prison. The two leaders met in December and in February, on the eve of Mr. Mandela's release. **********Tonight Mr. Mandela sounded more favorably disposed toward Mr. de Klerk than he had in his two months of freedom. He said his group was under the impression that the Government would address not only the incident in Sebokeng but also the broader issue of the surging factional violence afflicting the country, which he blamed on the deprivations of apartheid. **********Mr. Mandela said he was now hopeful that the full meeting scheduled between the Government and the African National Congress would be productive as well. Before it will enter negotiations, his organization is demanding that the Government declare an unconditional amnesty for exiles and political prisoners, including those accused of common crimes, lift the national state of emergency and end political trials. **********Mr. de Klerk also said the African National Congress's continuing endorsement of armed struggle would be one of the issues the Government would raise in the larger talks. **********Call for 'Credible Leaders' **********Mr. Mandela said he hoped that the government inquiry into the shootings in Sebokeng would also include blacks ''regarded as credible leaders'' by the community, a usual reference to those supporting the African National Congress and its allies. **********Earlier today, President de Klerk, who is trying to attract as many black leaders as possible to join the negotiations he has proposed, was to have met the leaders of the six self-governing ethnic homelands. But the only ones to appear were the Zulu leader, Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi and Cedric Mopedi, the leader of Kwa Kwa. Chief Buthelezi said he came in his capacity as head of the Zulu political organization, Inkatha, and not as the chief minister of Kwa Zulu, the Zulu homeland. **********The homelands, which Pretoria created to reduce the number of blacks living around urban areas reserved for whites, have been widely regarded as artificial entities and their leaders as puppets. **********South Africa's homeland policy suffered a further setback today when a military coup toppled the government of Venda, one of four other homelands declared independent by Pretoria. Transkei and Ciskei are now run by military governments following coups there.

The employer offered a range of investment choices and employees could be as aggressive - or as conservative - as they wished. **********These plans allow employees to set aside a portion of their pre-tax salary. The 1990 legal limit is $7,979, although employers often impose lower limits. Employers typically match a portion of the contribution, from 25 cents on the dollar up to a full dollar. Earnings on the money grow tax deferred. **********A July survey of 313 employers by Foster Higgins found that 88 percent allow employees to choose among investment options. And improving a plan has typically meant more options, Mr. Ternoey said. ''The idea has been that choice is good,'' he said. ''What we've found is that if you don't spend time explaining investment concepts, more choice is of no use and can even be misleading.'' **********In fact, surveys show that a large percentage of 401 (k) money goes into the most conservative option - guaranteed investment contracts,or G.I.C.'s, which promise a specific rate of return. ''People invest for themselves in 401 (k) plans much more conservatively than their employers invest pension plan money,'' said Barbara J. Pope, director of personal financial services for Price Waterhouse in Chicago. **********Conservative investing doesn't vary much by industry, either. Christine Seltz, partner at Hewitt Associates, benefits consultants based in Lincolnshire, Ill., points out that ''If you look at a group of what we think of as high flyers, like investment bankers, they have the same pattern. The bulk of the money is going into G.I.C.'s.'' **********Keeping your money safe for retirement is an important goal, to be sure. But, these consultants point out, if you don't achieve a decent return on your money, you won't have enough. ''We haven't given employees a good enough idea of what they will need for retirement,'' said Marvin H. Greene, a consultant with Towers Perrin, New York-based benefits consultants. **********A couple of simple strategies can improve the 401 (k) performance, these consultants say. ''We're not talking about turning people into M.B.A.'s and Wall Street wizards,'' Mr. Ternoey said. ''If you just take some basic investment concepts and let them operate, you'll end up with a better account balance.'' **********Put some of your money into stock, these experts say, by investing either in an equity mutual fund or your company's stock. ''When you're looking at a long-time horizon - 15, 20, 30 years - a portion has to be in equities because over the long haul, that's where you'll get the best return,'' Ms. Pope said. And a difference of just 1.5 percentage points compounded over a working lifetime can make a huge difference, said Mr. Greene. **********Mr. Ternoey pointed out that 401 (k) plans provide an ideal opportunity to make use of an investment technique called dollar cost averaging because the money you contribute is deducted from each paycheck. Dollar cost averaging is a method of buying stock or mutual fund shares by investing the same amount of money on a regular schedule regardless of the market price. **********Your dollars buy more shares when the price is down, fewer when it's up. Studies show that investors who use this strategy pay less per share over time than those who make their investments in a lump sum. **********You should also diversify, and you should check the performance of your investments regularly. For example, Mr. Ternoey has just two options with his 401 (k) plan: a stock mutual fund into which he puts 75 percent of his money and a guaranteed investment contract, 25 percent. **********He also checks periodically to see if the two investments are still in balance. If the stock market is soaring, the portion in stocks might grow to 80 or 85 percent. Then he moves some back into the G.I.C. ''It's a passive way to buy low and sell high,'' he said. And he forces himself to rebalance his fund at regular intervals. ''As much as my guts tell me I want to do one thing, I've got my rule and I stick with it,'' he said. **********Another simple strategy is to hedge by putting your current investments into one account and directing new money to a different account, he said. For example, if you are nervous about the outlook for the stock market, you may want to move some of your accumulated money out of the stock fund to preserve gains. However, it makes sense to direct new money into the stock fund. ''If you really think the market's going to go down, why don't you hedge your bets by putting your money from the next few payroll deductions into the market?'' he said. ''If it does go down, you'll be buying at the bottom. If you're wrong, you haven't fully committed yourself one way or another.'' **********WHAT EMPLOYERS OFFER **********Nearly nine out of 10 employers allow employees to choose among investment options for their contributions to 401 (k) plans, according to a new survey by A. Foster Higgins & Company. **********The survey found that 59 percent allow employees to choose where all of their 401 (k) retirement money will go while 29 percent allow an investment choice only for some of the money. **********Of those employers who provide a choice, 26 percent provide two options; 39 percent give three options; 18 percent, fouroptions and 17 percent, five or more options, according to Foster Higgins. **********The most common option is a guaranteed investment contract, an insurance company product that offers a guaranteed return, and a similar product offered by banks. These products are offered by 88 percent of those surveyed. The survey found that 83 percent offer stock mutual funds; 42 percent, company stock, and 26 percent, a money market fund."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/03/business/dow-slumps-34.66-points-but-oils-soar.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1990-08-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 874, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Slumps 34.66 Points, But Oils Soar", "print_headline": "Dow Slumps 34.66 Points, But Oils Soar", "body_text": " **********Inflation fears touched off by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait pushed most stock prices lower yesterday, including airlines and other users of petroleum products, but sent oil and oil-service stocks sharply higher. **********The Dow Jones industrial average, which had sunk as much as 52 points around 11:30, closed at 2,864.60, down 34.66, or 1.2 percent.

The regulatory review has already put the GTE Corporation in an awkward position and may now create problems for the Southwestern Bell Corporation, which is part of a consortium that won the Mexican Government's auction on Dec. 7. **********Grupo Carso of Mexico, France Telecom and Southwestern Bell paid $1.7 billion on Dec. 20 to buy a controlling 20.4 percent stake in Telmex, which includes 51 percent of the votes in the company. **********France Telecom filed a brief statement with the F.C.C. during its two public comment periods in the fall saying that it was reducing the fees it collects in France for completing international calls, but Southwestern Bell filed no documents. Ronald W. Hall, a company spokesman, said that would change. **********\"We will protect our interests,\" he said. \"Now that we're certain we have it, we'll be much more interested in participating.\" **********Royce S. Caldwell, a group president at Southwestern Bell, said in an interview after the Telmex auction that the buyers intended to reduce international fees somewhat over the next few years anyway. **********Telmex's main source of profits lies in charging American long-distance companies for receiving more calls from the United States than it sends. Last year, these fees totaled $534 million for Telmex, or nearly a quarter of its revenues of $2.2 billion. Telmex collected more of these fees fromAmerican carriers than did any four other foreign telephone monopolies combined. **********The actual cost of handling incoming international calls is minimal because of technological changes. For example, operators are not needed for most international calls, but the fees include them. The F.C.C. proposed new rules for the fees last summer, in an effort to halve the price to consumers within three years, and it is asking foreign telephone companies to reduce fees voluntarily. **********James S. Kahan, Southwestern Bell's managing director of corporate development, told a recent meeting with Wall Street analysts that his company was counting on Telmex's fees from American long-distance carriers as a source of dollar-denominated revenues to protect it against changes in the exchange rate between the peso and the dollar. **********The F.C.C.'s interest in reducing these rates could put Southwestern Bell in the awkward position of deciding whether to defend the interests of its American customers, who would benefit from lower prices for international calls, or those of its Mexican customers, who are currently subsidized by profits from the international fees. Mr. Hall said that if the fees were entirely eliminated, which isunlikely, Telmex could raise local telephone rates an average of $100 a year, or about $8.30 a month, a move that would be unpopular in Mexico. **********Southwestern Bell was aware of the F.C.C.'s deliberations before it bid, said Patricia Diaz Dennis, a Washington lawyer and former F.C.C. commissioner who is advising Southwestern Bell in the deal. **********Telmex reached an agreement last year with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company to reduce its fees by a third by 1999, which might lessen pressure from regulators, Mrs. Dennis said. But she added that the commission was likely to examine payments to Telmex anyway, given their size. **********Two groups of Latin American countries have filed documents with the F.C.C. opposing the proposed rule changes. They contend the changes would make it harder to turn their state-owned telephone companies over to the private sector, if there was a threat that the companies' international fee revenues would shrink soon. **********GTE has sided with them for different reasons. It owns the Compania Dominicana de Telefonos, better known as Codetel, which has a near monopoly on local telephone service in the Dominican Republic. GTE has filed two documents with the F.C.C. objecting to reductions in international rates, and earlier this month its officials began lobbying the commission personally, F.C.C. records show. **********The company contends in its filings that if the commission does act, countries receiving American foreign aid and buying large quantities of American-made telephone switching equipment should receive waivers. **********GTE makes telecommunications equipment in a joint venture with A.T.& T. And Codetel collected $75.3 million last year in international calling fees from American long-distance carriers, up from $8.2 million 10 years earlier.

He estimated that sales of carved ivory in Hong Kong stores, which mostly are made to tourists, were down by at least half. **********The ban on international trading in elephant ivory, agreed to by more than 90 countries in October, came into force in January. **********Many African and Western governments, backed by international conservation groups, pushed for the ban as a way of preserving the African elephant. In the last decade it is estimated that rampant poaching in eastern and central Africa has reduced the elephant population from about 1.3 million to about 750,000. During that time the price of ivory soared. **********An official of the African Wildlife Foundation, which along with the World Wide Fund for Nature lobbied heavily for the ban, said Mr. Bradley Martin's findings showed that the ban was working. ''It's having a much greater effect in a shorter period of time than anyone expected,'' said the official, Mark Stanley Price, director of the African Wildlife Foundation office in Nairobi. Dr. Bradley Martin said the demand from tourists for ivory had not vanished. ''Europeans and Americans are still buying ivory, but small pieces,'' he said. These are easier to hide in pockets or luggage than the bigger items, he said. **********The ivory ban is to be reviewed in two years and there was hope in the carving industry that it would then be repealed, Mr. Bradley-Martin said. **********In Beijing and Canton, site of another large carving factory, the ivory carvers are being asked to stay home but are being compensated with 75 percent of their salaries by the factories, he said. At the Daxin factory in Canton, the second largest after Beijing, only one worker remains of the 400 who were there in June last year. **********In Japan, the largest consumer of ivory, Mr. Bradley Martin said the price of ivory tusks had risen because the country had agreed to abide by the international trade ban. About 100 tons of raw ivory were left in Japan at the time of the ban, about the amount that the country uses in one year. But Mr. Bradley Martin said Japan, unlike other countries, did not have a history of receiving smuggled ivory and it seemed unlikely that illegal African elephant ivory would find a market there. **********In two African countries where elephant poaching has been most severe, Kenya and Tanzania, poaching has declined since the ban. Stepped up anti-poaching efforts and a less certain market for new tusks in the wake of the ban seem to have curbed the slaughter, experts said. **********But two months ago, Richard E. Leakey, the director of Kenya's wildlife service, said 57 elephants had been killed in Tsavo National Park since January. He said 12 tons of tusks, many of them from freshly killed animals, had been intercepted in Kenya and Tanzania. **********He attributed this to Britain's decision to allow Hong Kong to sell a 670-ton stockpile of ivory, the biggest in the world. ''I don't think it is any coincidence, particularly when the people arrested said under interrogation that the ivory would be sent to Hong Kong for sale,'' Dr. Leakey said. **********Conservationists take heart, however, from the poor prices that poachers are getting for ivory within Africa.

Smith, chairman of the Security Pacific Corporation in Los Angeles, said that \"if there is change in deposit insurance, it is important that it be done with a great deal of caution, and over time.\" **********A key aspect of deposit insurance for large banks is the extent to which Federal insurance protects deposits above the ceiling of $100,000 per account.

This is particularly unfortunate, officials said, since Israel and the United States share a common interest in undermining President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, in preventing any linkage between the gulf crisis and the Arab-Israel conflict and in keeping the United Nations Security Council out of Arab-Israeli diplomacy. **********American Jewish organizations have been far from unanimous in supporting Israel's decision to spurn the United Nations mission.

In the 17 trading days between Aug. 1, the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait, and last Friday, the Securities Exchange of Thailand index lost 39.1 percent of its value, falling from 1,142.63 to 695.81, its lowest level since Oct. 31, 1989. **********The move was almost enough to stop the pile drivers that are forming the foundations of the condominiums and office buildings that are supposed to service Bangkok's boom. The biggest concern during the market's tumble, economists say, was that the real estate sector might collapse, leading to a larger loss of confidence. The sector is already regarded as a little too hot and speculative for anyone's good. **********The Government became so worried that it decided to intervene. It established a $195 million mutual fund, to which all brokers had to contribute, to buy shares and provide liquidity to the market. If necessary, officials said, the sum could be doubled. **********The fund, called Ruam Pattana II (''Joint Development II''), has a five-year maturity, and is modeled after Ruam Pattana I, set up after the stock market collapse of October 1987. The first fund was one-fifth the size, but seemed to help, prompting a rapid recovery of the market. **********Fund II seemed to help this time, too. The S.E.T. index, as it is called, made gains of some 60 points a day early this week, and there was a general easing of concern. On Thursday the index closed at 839.80.  Nevertheless, some economists contend that the Government intervened too quickly. ''I think the fund created an artificial bottom faster than necessary,'' said Chesada Loha-unchit, managing director of Tara Siam Business Information Ltd., a leading Thai research institute. ''The bottom was very near, but a lot of people with confidence in the market didn't want to buy before the bottom. I think the authorities were too nervous.'' **********Mr. Chesada, like most economists here, forecasts that the rise in oil prices will curb the growth of Thailand's economy, but says that Thailand is better positioned to adjust than it was during the last oil shock, in 1979. It is also probably better off than many of its neighbors, who depend more directly on exports to the United States, which seems to be veering into recession. **********But no one knows if there will be a war, or what the price of oil is going to be next year. Narongchai Akrasanee, vice president of the Thailand Development Research Institute, the country's leading institute, said he expected that if oil prices average about $25 a barrel, Thailand's growth in 1991 will slow to 5 percent or 6 percent from an initial forecast of 9.3 percent, while inflation will reach 7.5 percent, instead of 6 percent. **********Mark Greenwood, managing director of Asia Equity Thailand Ltd., said that with oil at $30 a barrel, inflation would be near 10 percent and growth would be cut to 6 percent. At $25 a barrel, he said both growth and inflation would be about 8 percent. **********The main worry, he said, is inflation in real estate, ''which has a lot of froth.'' But compared to 1979, he said, when imported crude oil filled 80 percent of Thailand's energy needs, the figure today, after natural gas development, is 40 percent, representing only 9 percent of total imports. **********Mr. Chesada agreed, saying that 1979 found a weak Government here with a large budget deficit and the baht tied to the dollar. Today, with a budget in the black and a floating baht, he said, Thailand has much more room to use fiscal policy. If there is a recession and a drop in exports, he said, the Government could put money into badly needed infrastructure projects - telephones and building mass transit to ease the paralyzing traffic, which happen to be most businessmen's biggest complaints. **********Thailand also has a new Finance Minister, Virabongsa Ramangura, who when appointed Monday was in Vientiane, Laos, finishing a contract to advise the Laotian Government. In the face of rising oil prices, he said, he would concentrate on more austerity in Government spending and perhaps, finally, a tax overhaul. A nonpartisan technocrat and economic adviser to former Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda, Mr. Ramangura said he was known as an ''austerity economist.'' **********Almost more important, Mr. Virabongsa is regarded as a far less stubborn and difficult man than his flamboyant predecessor, Pramual Sabhavasu, a party regular in Chart Thai, the leading party in the ruling coalition.

An endorsement from I.B.M., however, would significantly increase the chances that Go's technology will become the standard for computers that use a pen or stylus as their main input rather than a keyboard. **********Data entered into a computer using either a pen or stylus would be redisplayed as computer-generated characters and could then be stored as text or serve as commands to operate the computer. Such systems would make it easier for first-time users to operate computers. **********Competition Mounting **********The Go machine, for which no release date has been set, already faces heavy competition from much larger companies. Canon Electronics and the Sony Corporation have recently introduced portable computers for the Japanese market that recognize handwritten Japanese characters. **********Last September, the Grid Systems Corporation, a unit of the Tandy Corporation, introduced the Gridpad, a 4.5-pound portable computer that can read printed handwriting and is compatible with the MS-DOS software operating system used in I.B.M. and compatible personal computers. The Gridpad sells for $2,370, plus $425 for a memory card. **********Go's computer is said to be more sophisticated than these machines, and Go executives have hinted that it will not use MS-DOS, which was developed for disk-based computers, but will use its own system and solid-state memory. A new software company, Slate, founded by Dan Bricklin, the creator of Visicalc, is believed to be developing application programs specifically for the Go computer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/30/world/confrontation-gulf-japan-promises-grants-food-but-lack-arms-aid-nettles-us.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Weisman", "pub_date": "1990-08-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1206, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Japan Promises Grants and Food, But Lack of Arms Aid Nettles U.S.", "print_headline": "CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;   Japan Promises Grants and Food, But Lack of Arms Aid Nettles U.S.", "body_text": " **********Japan unveiled a long-awaited program on Wednesday night to help finance the international effort against Iraq, but the package drew unusual criticism from American officials for the absence of direct tangible aid to the military buildup in the Persian Gulf. **********The package includes an unspecified amount of loans and grants to Egypt, Turkey and Jordan, the dispatching of 100 medical specialists to the region, and a pledge to supply refrigeration equipment, water and other goods to help soldiers cope with the desert heat. **********Officials said the aid program might ultimately amount to billions of dollars, but that any estimate would be vague because Tokyo plans long negotiations on the terms of loans and grants and the specific projects to be financed. **********The Finance Ministry said last week that Japan would provide financial aid to countries hit hard by a loss in revenue because of the gulf crisis. But this week it stipulated that such help would be granted only in coordination with other countries and the International Monetary Fund, which is already pressing Egypt to adopt difficult austerity measures. **********These requirements would almost certainly delay the aid and limit the amount of money available, offering little immediate relief to countries that are short of cash because of the cutoff in Middle Eastern oil or the loss of remittances from nationals working in oilfields there. **********Tokyo also pledged Wednesday night to transport food, water and medical supplies to the gulf on Japanese civilian aircraft and ships, and to pay for military equipment to be flown there on planes and ships chartered from other nations. **********Today, Japanese officials said the cost of chartering ships and planes and shipping medical and other supplies to the Middle East would be about $1 billion. **********Constitution Bans Force **********Despite public pressure from Washington to do more than simply underwrite the military efforts undertaken by others, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said it would violate Japan's Constitution for the country to transport any military personnel or equipment to a region of potential combat. **********''There are things we can do and cannot do,'' the Prime Minister said, adding that the package ''represents the maximum extent we can go.'' **********Japan's Constitution, written by the United States after World War II, renounces ''the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes.'' It has long been cited by Tokyo as a barrier to action, even in using military aircraft to aid earthquake victims in Armenia in 1988. **********Mr. Kaifu, who looked grim and fatigued at his news conference Wednesday night, seemed to be more concerned with Japanese opposition to his package as too radical than with American concerns that it is too modest. He appealed to the Japanese to abandon their aloof approach to world political crises. **********''If Japan's response is delayed and the world gets the impression that Japan does nothing for peace in the region, when its own important national interest is at stake, Japan's future will be lost,'' the Prime Minister declared. **********There was no official comment from the United States immediately after Mr. Kaifu announced the package. But American officials made it clear earlier in the day that they were ''very unhappy,'' as one put it, with the omission of an indirect or direct Japanese military role. **********''If you look at the situation in the Middle East, we judge it to be basically a military situation,'' said an American official, his voice edged with sarcasm. ''There's a limited number of Girl Scout cookies that can be used there.'' **********In another unusual move, the United States Ambassador, Michael H. Armacost, told Japanese editorial writers on Tuesday evening that Americans were feeling ''impatience, bewilderment and exasperation'' with Japan's delays in announcing its plans in the gulf, a spokesman for the American Embassy said. **********He said Mr. Armacost expressed concern that Japanese assistance would be ''so circumscribed as to hinder its operational usefulness and thus its political value.'' The Ambassador has made it clear that he does not agree that the Constitution prevents further action. **********U.S. Wants Minesweepers **********Among the steps urged by Mr. Armacost and other officials is the use of Japanese minesweepers to patrol waters in the gulf. They also have asked that Japanese ships normally used for transporting automobiles to the United States be commandeered to send tanks and other equipment to the Middle East. **********Aides to Mr. Armacost, who only last week were praising Japan for its swift expression of support in the days after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, had a different tone on Wednesday, saying that Tokyo's inaction would stir resentment in Congress that Japan is not putting itself at risk like other nations. **********Some also warned that Japan's response might set back Tokyo's quest for a seat on the United Nations Security Council. **********Taizo Watanabe, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said he could not say whether the aid to Turkey, Egypt and Jordan would be ''in the millions or billions'' of dollars. He said the assistance would likely be in the form of low-cost loans or grants for projects to be identified later. **********Project loans, however, are not what the countries of the Middle East need right now, many experts say. These countries are suffering rather from a loss of cash flow amounting to billions of dollars. Mr. Watanabe said it was his understanding that Japan would not be meeting the Middle Eastern country's ''cash needs.'' **********Officials and experts said there were several reasons for Japan's failure to come forward with a bolder package. Among them is the Japanese people's reluctance to violate the spirit or letter of a Constitution that has taken on an almost sanctified status. **********Some Japanese officials are said to fear that a greater military role for Japan would alarm Asian neighbors that remain wary about the country's intentions 45 years after the end of World War II. Others say that the Japanese oppose giving more authority to the military, whom they blame for the disaster of World War II. **********The Foreign Ministry and Mr. Kaifu himself have been described by officials in the last few weeks as the most eager for Japan to step up its role in the Middle East crisis. But wider measures were opposed by other ministries and by political rivals of Mr. Kaifu, who do not like to see him succeed or improve his image. **********Mr. Watanabe said on Wednesday night that as a practical matter, Japan would be prevented from transporting combat-related personnel or equipment on commercial aircraft because the employees of shipping and aircraft companies have made it clear they would refuse to carry such cargo into a war zone. **********Japan Air Lines is said to be worried about several of its employees being held hostage by Iraq."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/26/world/standoff-in-the-gulf-a-curtain-falls-on-bob-hope-s-show.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1990-12-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 854, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Curtain Falls on Bob Hope's Show", "print_headline": "STANDOFF IN THE GULF; A Curtain Falls on Bob Hope's Show", "body_text": " **********The Pentagon announced today that it was restricting news coverage of, of all things, the Bob Hope Christmas shows for American troops here.

'They've Got a Problem' **********Such strict reporting rules had not been extended to other nonmilitary events. The comedian Steve Martin visited Saudi Arabia this year to meet with troops and although he did not stage a formal show a few reporters were allowed to attend some of his encounters with soldiers. **********At his news conference here today, Mr. Hope, who has been appearing at Christmas shows for American troops overseas since 1941, said he was surprised to learn that news organizations, including the military newspaper Stars & Stripes, were being banned from the shows here. **********But he insisted that he understood the Pentagon's restrictions, which he said were intended to avoid offending Muslim religious leaders in Saudi Arabia. **********\"They've got a problem,\" he said. \"Because the King is running the place, they have their religion and their beliefs and you have to kind of abide by it.

I don't mean once. We were briefed on that about three times. I can understand their concern over here because they have another religion.\" **********Mr. Hope said that a more serious restriction was that on performances by women -- Saudi women must be veiled in public -- and that as a result he was forced to leave a number of women out of the show in Saudi Arabia, including the performers Ann Jillian, Marie Osmond and the Pointer Sisters. **********\"When I got to the plane, they said, 'There will be no girls,' \" he said. \"It's a religious thing.\" An Exception Is Made **********The exception, he said, was his wife, Dolores, who was allowed to appear Christmas Eve to sing \"White Christmas\" to the troops. \"They let Dolores in, which is damn nice,\" Mr. Hope said. **********The other women in the show will rejoin the troupe this week in Bahrain, which places far fewer restrictions on entertainment. **********Mr. Hope and his troupe will be performing for American troops now serving on Navy ships anchored in Bahrain. **********Mr. Hope said today that he made a European tour in May and vowed that it would be his last overseas tour. \"I said this definitely is my final trip, this is my final tour,\" he said. **********\"But then up popped madman,\" he said, referring to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. \"I finally said, We have to go again.\" He added: \"The feeling of the entire country is the same.

The Office of the United States Trade Representative has been campaigning for years to have Asian markets opened to American cigarettes, and barriers in Thailand are the latest to be broken after those of South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. **********The push to enter the Asian markets has caused concern among health advocates who fear that many people who do not smoke now may begin when American cigarettes backed by strong marketing tactics are available. The ban on advertising was seen as a victory in part for their side. **********Full Council to Vote **********The panel that made the ruling was set up by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, to resolve disputes. Its report is to be put to a vote by the full GATT Council on Nov. 7 and is expected to be ratified. **********While the report said Thailand must open its borders to foreign cigarettes, it also took the unusual step of raising the issue of health in saying that Thailand's ban on cigarette advertising was appropriate. **********In pressing these trade questions, the Bush Administration has raised a hornet's nest of criticism because it pits two of the nation's missions against one another. While the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Surgeon General have spoken angrily about ''selling death'' at home, department officials say they have been asked to be quiet about whether the United States should be selling the same products abroad. **********Surgeon General Is Quiet **********''For me to talk about it would be almost disrespectful of my party,'' said Surgeon General Antonia Novello in a news conference last week. **********The trade representative's office, for its part, said there were health issues involved, but as long as cigarettes were legal both in the United States and in Thailand, American cigarettes should not be kept out of Thailand. **********Timothy O'Leary, a spokesman for the trade office, said: ''The evidence is overwhelming that tobacco products are harmful. Countries have a sovereign right to protect the health of their citizens against it. But what the Government of Thailand has done is create a monopoly under which they alone sell cigarettes. It is simply discriminatory.'' **********'Best We Could Hope For' **********Public health advocates said the decision, made in Geneva on Sept. 21 and kept confidential, ''is the best we could hope for,'' said John L. Bloom, manager of international issues at the Advocacy Institute, a nonprofit health advocacy group in Washington. **********Dr. Greg N. Connolly, director of the office on smoking and health in the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, said he thought the agreement was a victory for Thailand in some ways. **********The United States had sought not only to open the country, but to knock down taxes and tariffs on imported cigarettes that are on the books in Thailand but unused. The GATT panel said the taxes and tariffs were appropriate as long as they were comparable to taxes on other, similar domestic goods. **********Reasoning for Ban **********In addition, while the American Government has succeeded in other countries in getting American ads permitted, the GATT panel in this case said that since cigarettes were hazardous, Thailand was justified in trying to control their use so long as those attempts cover both national and foreign products. **********''All the tools of advertising and marketing needed to enter the market have been denied,'' Dr. Connolly said. ''Just raising the issue the way they have has also created in Thailand a smoking and health movement years before its time.'' **********The United States Cigarette Export Association estimates that the Thai market, once open, could produce $150 million in sales for United States companies. Bootlegged American cigarettes already have a share of the Thai market estimated to be 5 percent. **********The trade representative's office is now considering what retaliatory action will be taken against Thailand if that market does not open soon. **********Retaliatory Tariff **********A first measure may come even before Thailand has a chance to negotiate the issue. The trade office on Oct. 15 may publish a list of Thai products against which the Government will levy a retaliatory tariff of up to 100 percent if needed. The publication of a list of potential targets of retaliation is considered extremely serious by the Thais, because companies using or selling those products may elect to stop using them from uncertainty about their future price and supply. **********Among the exports likely to be on the list are jewelry, canned tuna, tobacco, coffee, rubber, sugar, canned pineapple and baby corn, which account for $350 million to $500 million a year in trade. **********Mr. O'Leary at the trade office said no decision had been made on whether to publish the list. **********In addition to the Government's complaint before GATT, cigarette manufacturers have asked the trade representative to take action to force the Thai Government to allow advertising and wide distribution of their cigarettes. A spokesman for the trade office said it had made no decision yet on whether to try to force Thailand, separate from the GATT action, to end its ban on cigarette ads. The United States can retaliate separately on those issues. **********Canada's Beer Barrier **********GENEVA, Oct. 3 (Reuters) - The United States complained in world trade talks today that Canada was discriminating against beer imports from America, despite a two-and-a-half-year-old ruling to end unfair marketing practices. **********The deputy United States trade representative, Rufus Yerxa, told a panel for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that Canadian provincial marketing boards used discriminatory listing practices and restrictions on points of sale and marked up the prices of imported beer above reasonable estimates of distribution costs. **********Canadian Ambassador John Weekes said a petition submitted by a United States brewery contained many errors of fact, and he denied that provincial listing practices discriminated against imported beers. **********He said Canada had asked the United States for details of their specific concerns but that Washington had not replied."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/14/world/tunisian-leader-begins-visit-to-washington.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 497, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tunisian Leader Begins Visit to Washington", "print_headline": "Tunisian Leader Begins Visit to Washington", "body_text": " **********The President of Tunisia will begin a three-day visit to Washington on Monday with two pivotal issues on his agenda: the immigration of Soviet Jews to Israel, and the Western outcry about Iraq's manufacture and deployment of long-range missiles, chemical weapons and other advanced military technology. **********In an interview before his departure, the President, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, said that Arab nations were not opposed to the settlement of Soviet Jews in Israel but that they strongly opposed their resettlement in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem. **********Mr. Ben Ali, whose country is a firm Western ally with close ties to France and the United States, said he would also try to explain to President Bush on Tuesday, when the two men are to meet, that Iraq's pursuit of modern weapons technology was a legitimate defensive policy. **********Most Arab countries have rallied behind Iraq in the face of severe attacks on its new arms policy by Western news agencies, Western governments and Israel.

''Our fight goes on.'' **********The rebels, known as contras, said they were convinced that President Daniel Ortega Saavedra would lose the election on Sunday to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's coalition but that he would refuse to surrender power. **********''We're sons of God and so are the Sandinistas, but while they have the Communist poison in them, we can't have confidence in them,'' said Zorro. **********Stronghold in Jungle **********He and other contras interviewed in this area, a longtime rebel stronghold in the jungle-crowned mountains above Jinotega, vowed to continue their decade-old war until the leftist Sandinistas are driven from power, democracy is established and ''repression ended.'' **********''We'll fight until there's a legitimate government and full human rights,'' said Centella, the commander of the 176 rebels of the Third Company of the Pedro Joaquin Gonzalez Battalion. ''We're sure, almost positive, that if Violeta wins, the Sandinistas won't give up power.'' **********The 800-strong battalion, like others in Nicaragua's sparsely populated northern tier, has spent the last six months infiltrating from Honduran base camps and building up its civilian support network along the country's volcanic spine. **********In the process, the contras, who started as a proxy unit for the United States in its efforts to overthrow the Sandinista Government, seem on the verge of becoming a self-sustaining guerrilla army. Bit by bit, the rebels are beginning to live off the land and off their support among anti-Government peasants. Paradoxically, that is largely a result of the cutoff of United States military aid two years ago. **********Survival Could Be Fatal Flaw **********The rebels' survival could become a fatal flaw in the Central American peace negotiations. Although the region's five Presidents agreed at a series of summit meetings to disband the rebel army in return for presidential elections here, they never consulted the contras. The rebels, who view themselves as freedom fighters and the guarantors of Nicaraguan democracy, have refused to abide by the accords and lay down their arms. **********''I won't abandon the fight until I see the end - a democratic Nicaragua,'' Fernando, calling himself a seven-year veteran of the war, said during an interview on Thursday. **********The contras' cause, in the view of many outsiders, has rarely appeared so futile. For years the rebels relied almost entirely on their Honduran bases for sanctuary and on Washington for money and military supplies. But those twin pillars could crumble at any moment under the regional peace accords. **********The rebels acknowledge a lack of a large-scale network for obtaining arms, ammunition and other military supplies, and they refer to their guns as ''presents from Papa Bush.'' **********Morale Extremely High **********But an overnight visit with 90 rebels near La Reforma, a hilltop hamlet 100 miles north of the capital, found morale extremely high. The contras were healthy, well fed and well equipped, even though they carried only light weapons like AK-47 automatic assault rifles. **********Many of the rebels were wearing boots captured from the Sandinistas. Byron, a 20-year-old squad commander, said the battalion had seized more ammunition in the last six months than it had used. He said it had recovered 200 AK-47 assault rifles, 20 RPG-7 light rockets and 30 machine guns. **********The insurgents clearly have the support of much of the local population, most of whom made it clear they plan to vote for the opposition coalition, known as UNO. A small boy ran up to one patrol resting near a farmhouse to warn it that a Sandinista detachment was approaching. The rebels discovered it was a false alarm. **********The intelligence system, while less than foolproof, remains highly effective, providing detailed information on Sandinista troop movements. The Nicaraguan Army, several civilians said, rarely enters the area with fewer than 100 soldiers and almost never without setting off the contras' silent alarm system. **********Handouts From Civilians **********Although a group of rebels was caught in an ambush during dinner last month, the rebels were quickly informed this morning when a Sandinista company moved into the hills. The contras were cautious, but seemed confident even when separated from the army by as little as two miles. **********Several contras said they had not left Nicaragua in more than a year. They added that they had no money left and that they survived entirely on handouts from civilian supporters in their zone. **********The peasants often shared what little they had. One family welcomed them with a heaping bowl of steaming beans, a four-inch stack of tortillas and pots of sweetened coffee. **********''The population wants our presence,'' Zorro said. ''If we're not here, they know that Daniel Ortega and his friends are going to mess with the people.'' **********While many civilians were clearly committed to the rebels, the contras also received support because they for the moment had the might. When the army passes through, one civilian noted, it also is given food. ''We're in a war zone,'' said one farmer.

But away from the newsmakers, in hotel rooms outfitted with conference tables, Eastern Europe's emerging free market economies were quietly being shaped. **********The Eastern Europeans themselves might still be arguing about the pace of transition from central planning to free markets. But for the I.M.F. and the World Bank, the issue is settled: It should be done quickly, with the promise of loans as pressure to speed up the process. **********''If someone comes to us and says, 'We want to do it gradually,' we go a long way to talk them out of a gradual approach,'' said Eugenio F. Lari, the World Bank's European chief. **********Last fall, when Eastern Europe threw off Communism en masse, he wasn't so sure of himself. ''We had a fleeting temptation to sit back and see how the transition worked, and then make loans,'' he said. ''But that would have made us irrelevant.'' **********The Poles and the Hungarians have been big borrowers this year, although the Hungarians have had misgivings about the quick-transition strategy. Their worry was that unemployment, say, would become unbearably high if all price ceilings were removed overnight or state companies were sold too rapidly. But the Hungarians are coming around, Mr. Lari said.

The Gorbachev Government, up for I.M.F.-World Bank membership, sent five officials - and found themselves upstaged by a rival Soviet delegation. **********The Gorbachev people presented themselves as quiet agnostics on the transition issue, since the Soviet Parliament has not yet decided whether the transition should be a slow process, as Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov advocates, or a speedy one, in accord with the ''500 Day Plan'' of Stanislav S. Shatalin. The 12 unofficial delegates came to sell the Shatalin plan. **********George Soros, a Wall Street financier, paid the air fares and hotel expenses of the Shatalin group. And the delegates - six helped to write the 600-page plan - had sessions with anyone whose good opinion of the Shatalin ideas might carry weight with the Soviet Parliament. **********The roster included prominent American economists and Congressmen, European central bank chieftains and corporate executives. An Izvestia reporter traveled with the members of the team and sent back dispatches on their salesmanship. **********''We seek understanding, and if there is understanding, there will be support,'' said Grigory Yavlinsky, the 37-year-old Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Republic, a leader of the group. English translations of the 600-page plan were also passed out. **********Mr. Yavlinsky's English was weak, and when he got stuck during an interview, Mr. Soros pitched in with the Shatalin plan's virtues and intricacies. Mr. Soros grew up in Hungary, made a fortune on Wall Street in the 1980's and now supports foundations he established in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to promote rapid transition to free markets. **********Rising Cost of Loans **********With considerable fanfare, I.M.F. officials promised more loans to help offset the cost of higher oil prices. But not much was said about their rising cost for the borrower - usually a poor underdeveloped nation. **********The I.M.F. has roughly $10 billion outstanding in short-term credits carrying an interest rate of 9.7 percent a year. The average floating rate in recent years has been 7.5 percent. **********The problem is, the I.M.F. is essentially a glorified credit union, and too many of its borrowers today are behind on repayment. What the institution has traditionally done is raise the money it lends at, say, 7.5 percent by borrowing, largely from member nations, at 6.5 percent, and pocketing the percentage point difference to cover administrative expenses. **********Now, however, nine borrowing nations are $4 billion in arrears on repayment, depriving the I.M.F. of interest income to cover costs. The temporary solution has been to increase the interest rate spread, partly at the borrower's expense -just when interest rates around the world are rising anyway. **********Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F.'s managing director, suggested this week that the major lenders - the United States, West Germany, Japan and other industrial nations - provide special subsidies for third world borrowers, or some other relief. **********''There was not a lot of sympathy for his suggestions among the major nations,'' said Ernesto Hernandez-Cata, an I.M.F. senior adviser."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/15/world/lebanon-war-spurs-new-emigration.html": {"writer_name": "Ihsan Hijazi", "pub_date": "1990-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 843, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lebanon War Spurs New Emigration", "print_headline": "Lebanon War Spurs New Emigration", "body_text": " **********The outbreak of large-scale fighting between rival Lebanese Christian factions 12 weeks ago has prompted major new migrations of refugees, both out of the country and inside it. **********A report issued by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry at the beginning of this month said 100,000 Lebanese, primarily Christians, have left the country since the latest fighting began.

When it is fully operational, viewers will compete for prizes against other viewers, with scores tallied at the end of the show and compared, although not on the air. **********One California company already has a system in use in about 400 bars in which customers compete for prizes by predicting, as one example, what plays the quarterback will call in a televised football game. Under an agreement with National Football League Properties announced recently, the system is expected to be in homes nationwide by next year. Another company is developing a program in which a vote by viewers would determine the outcome of a mystery show. **********All this is known as interactive television, and it can transform viewing from a passive experience into one in which people are actively involved. **********''You've just created a whole additional dimension to television,'' said Thomas S. Rogers, president of NBC Cable and head of business development for the network. **********But many skeptics think such television programming will not catch on. Some argue that the typical ''couch potato'' does not want to interact with a television. **********''Most of the time, what the individual wants to do is sit back and relax,'' said Russell Neuman, who studies audience response to new video technologies at the Media Lab of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. **********The new services are being developed and tested in various cities by a handful of small companies. But major television companies and advertisers are closely watching the developments. **********One company, Interactive Network Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., has attracted financial backing from NBC; United Artists Entertainment; A. C. Nielsen; Ameritech, the Bell System company serving the Midwest, and Le Groupe Videotron, a large Canadian cable television company. **********The technology of another company, New York-based ACTV Inc., is being evaluated for its advertising potential by McCann-Erickson, the advertising agency, with financing provided by General Motors, Coca-Cola and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. **********The skeptics have history on their side. Two-way television, as it was once called, was tried in the early 1980's, most notably in the Qube cable television systems in Columbus, Ohio, and other cities, owned by Warner Amex Cable, a joint venture of Warner Communications Inc. and the American Express Company. By touching buttons on a keypad, viewers could play along with game shows, order merchandise and answer polls, although the poll results were considered unscientific. **********But Qube failed because its programming was judged not compelling and its prices were considered too high. Today, some executives and analysts think the new systems have a better chance of succeeding for a number of reasons. **********For one, Qube used expensive technology in which viewers' choices were sent back to the studio through the two-way cable that distributed the programs to homes. The new services use more inexpensive telephone lines to relay signals from the home back to the studio, either through a modem that conveys computer data or by having the viewer push the buttons of a Touch-Tone phone. A computerized device in the home that receives instructions from the studio can also respond to viewers' choices without having to send signals back to the studio. **********Moreover, years of exposure to video games and computers mean that consumers now are ''more acclimated to interactivity,'' said Michael Mascioni of Alexander & Associates, a consulting firm in New York. **********The Simple Approach **********So far, the only interactivity that appears to be developing into a successful business is the simplest approach, requiring no special equipment in homes. That involves allowing viewers to order merchandise on shopping networks by calling an ''800'' telephone number or to respond to questions on television by calling a ''900'' number, for which the caller is charged from 50 cents to $3. **********ABC's ''Monday Night Football,'' for instance, allowed viewers to select plays. MTV, the music video network, has used the 900 numbers for numerous contests. **********Another form of interactivity allows viewers to request programs. One such is the Video Jukebox Network, which is now offered on cable or low-power local television stations in 94 locations reaching seven million households. Viewers can call a 900 number, for a charge of $2 to $3, and request that a particular music video be shown. Everyone watching the channel sees the video. **********Andrew H. Orgel, the president of Miami-based Video Jukebox Network Inc, said the ability of the program to attract callers, even in cities with MTV, shows that ''individuals will pay to control their televisions, even if services are available free.'' **********The Real Promise **********But the real promise of interactivity, some people in the industry say, is the ability to provide services that would allow users to interact with a program, rather than just choose a particular program. **********ACTV has a system now being sold to cable television customers in Montreal and recently tested in Springfield, Mass., that allows viewers to pick among four video channels showing different views of the same event. **********In watching a sports event, for instance, viewers can choose their own camera angle. A program about the rock star Peter Gabriel allows viewers to focus on a particular musician. Viewers watching an exercise program can select the exercises tailored for their age group or a particular part of the body. **********The drawback of ACTV is that it requires four channels to transmit, and many cable television systems do not have the channels to spare. **********Controlling the Outcome **********Even more sophisticated systems would let viewers control the outcome of a drama. Laser Arts Interactive, a Los Angeles company, is developing a program called ''Sherlock Phones'' in which viewers, registering their choices by phone, would by consensus determine which course the detective should follow. The program would progress by showing the film clip that matched the audience's preference. **********Some experts think letting viewers choose the outcome of programs would rob shows of their emotional impact. ''It flies in the face of at least 2,000 years of dramatic experience,'' said Robert Kubey, assistant professor of communication at Rutgers University. **********Several other companies have developed systems that allow viewers to play along with professional sports events or quiz shows. **********A system in bars in which viewers can guess what plays the quarterback will call next is sold by NTN Communications Inc., Carlsbad, Calif. Customers' responses are entered through computer terminals around the bar that communicate with a central scoreboard, which displays each individual's score and communicates by telephone to a central computer to determine national winners. **********NTN as well as Interactive Network and Interactive Systems of Beaverton, Ore., are developing similar systems for the home. Last Tuesday, NTN, Interactive Network and National Football League Properties Inc. announced an agreement to make NTN's ''QB1'' game available to home TV viewers. The system will cost $400 to $500 for the control unit, with a subscription fee of about $15 a month. It is expected to be available in Northern California this year and across the country next year. **********Big League Baseball **********Interactive Network has signed an agreement with Major League Baseball allowing it to show a regularly scheduled game and permit home viewers to compete for prizes by predicting what each batter will do. **********Radio signals broadcast with the games control operation of a home terminal, which keeps track of the user's score. After the game, viewers wanting to compete for prizes would transmit the results from their terminal over a telephone line to a central computer, which would compare the results. **********Interactive Network is testing its service in Sacramento and hopes to begin commercial service in a few California cities this fall. **********But some experts say consumers might not be willing to pay the $400 that Interactive Network is planning to charge for its terminal, plus the monthly subscription fee of $15 or so. **********Mattel's Failed Product **********Mattel Inc. has tried selling a terminal developed by Interactive Systems that allowed viewers to play along with ''Wheel of Fortune.'' About 200,000 terminals were sold at a price of about $70 before the product was discontinued, said Jack Galmiche, president of Interactive Systems. He said his company was now developing a terminal that would be used with many programs, not just one, and that he hoped to rent it to consumers for a few dollars a month. **********Gary Arlen, editor of Interactivity Report, a newsletter in Bethesda, Md., said the fact that each competing company had its own technology that required a separate terminal was another barrier to success of these services. **********Still another important factor will be how well such services can attract and serve advertising. The potential is there to allow viewers watching a commercial to press a button on their terminals to get more information on a product or have a discount coupon printed out instantaneously, giving advertisers valuable knowledge about who wants their products. **********''What we're looking for,'' said Martin Nisenholtz, president of the Interactive Marketing Group, a division of Ogilvy & Mather, ''is some measure of increased efficiency, some sense that the advertiser is buying a more targeted audience than if he just blasted his message out there.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/30/business/patents-protecting-spacecraft-from-debris-in-orbit.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1990-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 283, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents;   Protecting Spacecraft From Debris in Orbit", "print_headline": "Patents;   Protecting Spacecraft From Debris in Orbit", "body_text": " **********Engineers at the General Research Corporation, a scientific consulting firm in Vienna, Va., obtained a patent this week for what amounts to a garbage collector in space.

The crowd kept up its protest until the store's management came out to negotiate. **********\"They acted without talking to us,\" said Michihisa Ando, who owns a small camera store a few blocks away. \"That is why we got so mad.\" **********Throughout Japan, battles over hours, floor space and other matters are beginning. They involve large stores, maverick mid-size stores like Summit and the traditional family-owned businesses that have long dominated retailing in Japan. The instigator of this turmoil is the United States. **********Washington has long complained of Japanese barriers to trade, and after years of resistance, Japan agreed earlier this year to drastically weaken the power of small shopowners to keep bigger competitors out. That has radically improved the economics of opening large stores here.  Outcome is Unclear **********But it is not clear whether large stores, once they open, will sell many more imported goods than small shops, or whether they will help drive down the cost of consumer goods, thereby increasing consumption, the premises that underlay America's demands for change. For one thing, with a few exceptions like Toys \"R\" Us and Tower Records, the big retailers now rushing into previously off-limits neighborhoods are largely owned by Japanese, not Americans. **********The agreement to foster competition was a important concession Japan made after Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and President Bush, in talks in Palm Springs, Calif., last spring, broke the deadlock in trade negotiations between the countries. **********The countries held negotiations with the unwieldy name of the Structural Impediments Initiative, signifying that the Governments were trying to resolve underlying conflicts in how the national cultures and economies work. In the talks, Japan agreed, among other things, to toughen its antitrust enforcement and loosen the relationships among Japanese companies that exclude outside suppliers. The United States vowed to cut its budget deficit, increase savings, and improve education in hopes of making its economy more competitive. **********Without question Japan's antiquated and inefficient retailing system, in which wholesalers sometimes send a truck to deliver five boxes of detergent and the abacus still reigns supreme, is an area in which one can starkly see the results of America's endless trade talks with Japan. **********Already, there are groundbreakings all over the country for shopping malls and large stores. **********\"I think we are beginning to prevail,\" a Japanese partner of Toys \"R\" Us said the other day, after a meeting in the Tokyo suburb of Chiba, where plans for a giant toy store were described to a sullen but largely uncomplaining group of local merchants. \"I think they are coming to see the big stores as inevitable, maybe even beneficial in some neighborhoods.\" **********Beneficial is not how Ryusuke Shinoyama, who heads the association of shopowners in Nakano, would describe the changes. \"It is certain that the number of large-scale retailers will be increased,\" Mr. Shinoyama said at a gathering of shopowners at a sushi shop in their neighborhood. \"But it is also certain that Japanese local society will be destroyed. You already see it happening.\" **********With the supermarket and the smaller shops all staying open until 7 P.M. an uneasy truce now prevails in Nakano, whose business district, like those of most Tokyo neighborhoods, is centered on the Japan Railways station. Most shopowners are older people who rebuilt the neighborhood after it was flattened by American bombs near the end of World War II. They sweep the streets in front of their stores, and greet weary returning workers with cries of \"okaeri nasai,\" roughly \"welcome home.\" **********And most of them play by Japanese retailing's unwritten rules: no big sales promotions that lead to price wars, no negative advertising, and limited introductions of products, which might disrupt the \"orderliness\" of neighborhood markets. **********Then came Summit Stores Inc., a mid-size supermarket chain. It is owned by the Sumitomo Corporation, a subsidiary of the huge corporate group that includes the Sumitomo Bank and manufacturing companies. **********\"We knew right away that it would be big trouble, and there was opposition immediately,\" said Mr. Ando, who has already seen much of his camera business drawn away by big stores in Shinjuku, a giant Tokyo shopping center a few stops away on the train. **********The shopkeepers took advantage of the law that American negotiators finally succeeded in modifying earlier this year: the Large-Scale Retail Store Law, which requires neighborhood approval for any store larger than 600 square yards. The 1.3 million owners of small stores form the bedrock of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and they feared little retribution, until American complaints gave Government bureaucrats and large department stores the excuse they were waiting for. **********Though Japan's complex distribution system is often blamed for the inefficiencies of the retail market here, and the resulting high prices, manufacturers themselves play a significant role. The high prices Japanese pay at home in effect subsidize the competitive prices Japanese manufacturers offer elsewhere. **********Japanese consumers rarely complain about the prices they pay for Japanese-made goods. But they vote with their travel budgets. Many Japanese return from vacations and business trips with Japanese-made goods that they bought for perhaps a third less overseas. **********Summit wanted to open in Nakano in 1981 or 1982, but the negotiations dragged on until 1987. To reach agreement, the company offered numerous concessions. It reduced its floor space. It agreed to close 48 days a year, rather than its original plan of 29. It agreed to shut each night at 6 P.M. **********\"Still, the influence was greater than we thought,\" said Mr. Shinoyama, the head of the Nakano shopowners' group. Within three years of Summit's opening, seven or eight nearby stores, most selling meat and vegetables, closed or rented their locations to other retailers, he added.  The American Goals **********Still, what remains unclear is whether all this change is achieving the goal the United States had in mind: lower prices, increased consumption and a narrowed trade gap. **********Masafumi Jimbo, the manager of the Summit store, said he had made space available for imported products, like Levi's jeans. \"We have definitely been told that we are to promote the sales of imports,\" he added, as his assistants entered stock data on a computer network. That, in turn, may force the local shopkeepers to stock imported goods as well. **********The pressure to allow in imports has been so strong that efforts to slow stores like Toys \"R\" Us are faltering. The toy chain has announced plans to open more than 100 stores in Japan, starting with four next year. Its partner is perhaps the most successful retailer in Japan, the licensee for McDonald's restaurants, which owns prime retail sites and holds a major stake in Toys \"R\" Us Japan. **********For a while, after owners of toy stores in Nigata Prefecture, an important farming belt, mounted repeated protests, it looked as though the toy chain faced years of negotiation.

He defined this as meaning that Moscow should break with the United States and other Western powers, and with the United Nations Security Council, in their demands for an immediate and unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. **********As for President Bush, Mr. Hussein, who has previously called Mr. Bush ''a liar'' and compared him to Hitler, adopted a somewhat softer line and said that the American leader should abandon his effort to force Iraq from Kuwait for the sake of his own prestige and that of the United States. **********While offering no hint that he was prepared to bow before the pressures mounting against him, Mr. Hussein acknowledged in the message that the outcome of the Helsinki meeting could be portentous - for Iraq and the world. The close attention that Baghdad is giving the summit meeting was underscored by the newscast precceding Mr. Hussein's message, which included interviews with Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait. Several of the soldiers denounced the idea of Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev joining to impose a settlement in the gulf crisis. **********After opening the message with the standard Muslim greeting to the two leaders, ''peace be upon you,'' Mr. Hussein said that they were ''in a position to decide whatever relates to the future of good or evil for humanity.'' **********He also spoke of the responsibility of Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev ''to save our region the evil of war, and the ensuing evils,'' and appealed to God to infuse ''the light of faith into your hard hearts so that they will see the paths of righteousness.'' **********In this, and in many other passages of the message, the Iraqi leader presented himself as a faithful believer and, in his confrontation with the West, as the champion of the world's Muslims. The posture contrasts with Baghdad's harsh suppression of Muslim leaders earlier during Mr. Hussein's 12-year tenure as the ruler of Iraq. **********The message also included hints of the shrewd, mocking figure who rose from a motorcycle-borne gunman in the streets of Baghdad to become one of the most powerful and feared leaders in the modern Arab history. **********At one point, he referred to Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev as ''masters of the White House and the Kremlin,'' a blunt, even crude break with normal diplomatic usage for communications between heads of state. **********'Backward and Corrupt Rulers' **********The message also spoke of ''the backward and corrupt rulers'' of oil-producing Kuwait and accused them of having ''conspired'' against Iraq, apparently by refusing economic and territorial demands from Baghdad in the period before the invasion. **********But as much as anything, the message appeared to be a fresh effort by Mr. Hussein to foment trouble for the majority of Arab leaders who have aligned themselves with the United States and other nations in condemning Iraq. Again, he accused the United States of defiling Muslim holy places in Saudi Arabia by sending troops. **********He spoke of those who would ''try to trespass in God's house and in the prophet Mohammed's tomb,'' declaring, ''Whatever cover those trespassers may come under, whatever their justifications are, God will not forgive them.'' **********Before the message was broadcast, Baghdad television announced a new decree by Mr. Hussein intended to increase Iraq's food production in the face of the United Nations economic sanctions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/19/world/upheaval-in-the-east-moscow-a-year-later-rutted-streets-and-despair.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1990-02-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1216, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Moscow a Year Later: Rutted Streets and Despair", "print_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;   Moscow a Year Later: Rutted Streets and Despair", "body_text": " **********A few impressions of Moscow after an absence of a year: **********The rutted streets and cluttered courtyards of the city center speak of a marked deterioration in the economy, in just a year. Russian friends speak of empty shelves in the stores, which seem about as empty as they were a year ago, and say the reason for this is that nobody sees much point in working hard anymore. **********And there is a sense of despair about the process of change that was not evident a year ago. **********Echoing several other intellectuals, a friend who works on the staff of the Central Committee of the Communist Party said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev waited too long to try to push through serious economic changes. Now it may be too late. New Executive Powers Diplomats and Russians agree that the Communist Party, whose Central Committee voted last week to give up its constitutional guarantee of the leading role prescribed for it by every Soviet political leader since Lenin, had long ago lost the authority or the ability to put the country's affairs in order. **********It will not collapse suddenly like the Communist parties of East Germany and Czechoslovakia, they say, not in Russia at least, but the parties of the ethnic Muslim republics along the country's southern border are beginning to collapse in a way that looks, from a distance, remarkably like the way the ones in Eastern Europe fell apart. **********''Perestroika,'' which has brought a new openness and freedom of debate, seems to have gone seriously wrong as a policy of pulling the country out of economic decline, and Mr. Gorbachev told the elected legislature this week that it was in a critical stage. **********Now, too late, some believe, he is asking for sweeping new executive powers. The legislature, several deputies say, talks and talks, just as freely and openly as the House of Commons or the United States Senate does, but unlike them it gets little done. The country needs a strong executive, Mr. Gorbachev told them, because an elected president ought to replace the Communist Party Politburo, which in a democracy should not have such executive powers anyway. **********Not Yet a Democracy **********''A rule-of-law state has no room for dictatorship by any class, and even less so for the power of a management bureaucracy,'' said the party's draft platform that the Central Committee approved last week. But it only recognized a state of affairs that already exists. The party is no longer ''the'' party. **********But neither is the Soviet Union, yet, a democracy. ''We don't have a tradition of democracy in this country,'' said the writer Anatoly N. Rybakov, one of the earliest beneficiaries of Mr. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost. ''People don't understand that in a democracy, you can lose elections, and when you lose, you have to submit to the rule of the majority until your turn comes again.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev has not yet proceeded to serious economic revision. The legislature is still debating whether and how to introduce private property. **********But the only kind of private enterprise ordinary people can see around them, they do not like much: private farmers charging 15 rubles a kilogram for hothouse tomatoes, and mafia-like joint-venture businessmen who rent Zil limousines and dine in private restaurants that accept Western currency only, imitating the mores and privileges of the now discredited party elite. **********''People in Russia are used to having nothing,'' said Anatoly S. Pankov, a journalist from Siberia. A Central Committee official said, ''The ideal of social justice here is that everybody should have nothing not that entrepreneurs should prosper and spread the wealth.'' **********Mood of Gloom and Anxiety **********The party's draft platform puts it this way: ''We have approached a point when the previous system of economic management and government is not operating to a considerable extent, while new mechanisms have not yet started to work at full capacity.'' **********In plain Russian, to many people, that means that Mr. Gorbachev has wrecked the old system, with its assurances of social and economic stability at the price of intellectual freedom, and given them a half-baked new one that does not work but leaves them free to take to the streets to protest. **********And so the mood among the ordinary people in Moscow, unlike the mood in Prague or even East Berlin these days, is not one of eager anticipation of new freedoms but one of gloom and anxiety. **********''I hear a million people could be on the streets on Feb. 25,'' a Communist functionary said of a rumored demonstration, though that seemed like just one more rumor. But it seemed credible because several hundred thousand people did take to the streets on Feb. 4, as the Central Committee was gathering for its session, to tell their leaders that they were not happy with the way things were going. **********Concessions on Arms Control **********Small wonder, with all of that going on, that Mr. Gorbachev is making concession after concession in arms control, and even seeming to agree to the idea of German unification in a country that still remembers, painfully, the 20 million dead it suffered at the hands of the Nazis in World War II. **********''He has to find some way to sell that to the people at home that doesn't make it sound like a capitulation,'' a Western diplomat said. A Russian journalist friend thought that would be difficult. ''A lot of people think he's wrecked our internal stability, now he's taking away our external security belt,'' he said. ''And maybe they'll decide pretty soon that they don't want him anymore.'' **********Perhaps. The only thing that is certain in Moscow these days is that everything is uncertain. **********2,000 NATIONALISTS PROTEST **********MOSCOW, Feb. 18 (AP) - About 2,000 Russian nationalists staged a rally today to complain about President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, the warming of relations with the United States and the growing nationalism in non-Russian republics. **********The protesters gathered in deep snow near the Soviet television's 1,600-foot-tall transmission tower also heard speakers accuse Mr. Gorbachev of being power-hungry and plunging the Soviet Union into poverty and misery. **********The harshest attack on Mr. Gorbachev came from Boris Unko of the United Front of Workers of Russia, a group fighting Gorbachev's market-oriented economic reforms and unhappy about the nationalism in non-Russian republics. **********Among the evils wrought by Mr. Gorbachev's reforms, Mr. Unko said, were rock music, ''modernism and pornography,'' ''insults'' to heroes of the Bolshevik Revolution and World War II and others ''who built socialist society.'' He said Mr. Gorbachev had sold out to the elite and forgotten about the working class. **********He said Mr. Gorbachev is trying to become a dictator, adding that the Soviet leader should have known his reforms would bring more harm than good. **********Mr. Unko said: ''Any grandmother could have predicted the consequences of such a course. But you keep different company, the elite, property-holders. You make friends with President-murderer Bush, also a fighter for democracy who spilled blood in much-suffering Panama.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/15/business/mortgage-rates-mixed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 102, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mortgage Rates Mixed", "print_headline": "Mortgage Rates Mixed", "body_text": " **********Fixed-rate mortgages averaged 10.22 percent last week, up from 10.08 percent the previous week, according to a national survey released on Friday by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.

Perceptions have long existed that the Tokyo stock market favors powerful companies and politicians, with individual investors paying for the abuses. **********Mr. Kotani and another speculator, Shuichi Yamamoto, the former head of a construction company, were reported to have sold about six million shares at the peak of the purported scheme, and used the profits to repay a personal debt to the Kokusai Kogyo Company, an aerial surveying and property company that Mr. Kotani had taken over in a hostile raid several years ago. **********Mr. Kotani and Mr. Yamamoto were arrested last month, and many questions have arisen as to whether the Government would indict them and then investigate what news reports had said were their connections to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Two months ago, four former senior executives of Kokusai Kogyo were arrested on charges that they had used inside information during Mr. Kotani's hostile takeover to reap about $10 million in illicit profits. **********Aides' Roles Detailed **********Newspaper reports then carried detailed accounts of how aides to several leading politicans, including former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, profited during the Kokusai Kogyo takeover with Mr. Kotani's help.

Reports circulated last month that a dozen or more Japanese securities companies had been caught unfairly compensating some of their large corporate customers for market losses. **********According to leaks in the Japanese press, tax authorities had uncovered bogus securities transactions used to repay the customers for more than $100 million in losses in recent years, largely from the stock market crash in October 1987. **********Reports Are Denied **********Two of the firms implicated, Daiwa Securities and the Yamaichi Securities Company, initially denied the reports. Yamaichi later agreed to pay a penalty of 3.2 billion yen, or about $21.5 million, and the brokerage reiterated that it had not intentionally covered customer losses. **********In addition, a leading bank, the Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, admitted that it had arranged along with Yamaichi to compensate some customers for stock-trading losses, an illegal practice. **********The reports added to long-held suspicions that Japanese brokerages routinely guaranteed their big institutional customers a minimum return on stock trades - something not available to individual investors. **********The brokers were reported to have sold securities to the big customers at below-market prices, and then repurchased them later at much higher prices. Such riskless stock deals are also illegal in the United States and have brought prison sentences to some of those caught up in the American insider trading scandal, including Ivan F. Boesky, the former Wall Street arbitrager. **********A number of securities industry officials were struck by the fact that the case was uncovered by the tax authorities, not the Finance Ministry's securities bureau, which has the primary responsibility for policing the markets. **********Tighter Trading Laws **********Japan tightened its insider trading laws just a year ago, but it has made only one other arrest for such illegal trading or stock manipulation. **********The Recruit scandal, which burst into the headlines early last year and brought down a prime minister, involved a wealthy entrepreneur who passed out unlisted shares in a real estate company he controlled just before it went public."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/15/business/company-news-bank-in-brooklyn-sets-fall-opening.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 157, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Bank in Brooklyn Sets Fall Opening", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Bank in Brooklyn Sets Fall Opening", "body_text": " **********The Community Capital Bank, Brooklyn, said yesterday that it had met its goal of raising $6 million of shareholder capital, and it planned to open for business in November.

Trump to make a payment on a ''junk bond'' issue at midnight tomorrow, a group of banks is preparing a $20 million bridge loan as it presses to win final approval for a larger loan package to rescue the developer, bankers involved in the talks said yesterday. **********They also said the terms on the larger loan would include stringent restrictions on Mr. Trump's personal and business finances. **********As of yesterday evening, one foreign bank continued to oppose the package, bankers said. Another raised new objections to the plan over the weekend, they said. **********Missed Payments **********On June 15, Mr. Trump failed to make a $43 million payment on the bonds that were issued to build his Trump's Castle casino in Atlantic City, and a $30 million payment on a loan from the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. The larger loan package would provide Mr. Trump $65 million to make his payment to bondholders and would defer interest and principal payments on about $850 million in other bank loans for as long as five years. **********Before the 30-day bridge loan can be made, an agreement on the $65 million loan must be obtained from all banks that own chunks of nearly $2 billion in loans to the developer. The short-term credit is needed because the paperwork for the $65 million package cannot be completed by the deadline. **********The bridge loan, which would be supplemented by cash and bonds provided by the developer, would be replaced once documentation on the broader loan package is made final. **********The collateral on the $20 million bridge loan would be an array of Mr. Trump's personal property, including his interest in the Trump Tower retail complex and another New York condominium building, Trump Parc, as well as residential condominiums he owns in both, his private airplane and some stores in Trump Plaza. **********Among the restrictions the banks have outlined in the loan agreement is that Mr. Trump's monthly charitable contributions not exceed $100,000, and that his personal and household expenses not exceed $450,000 a month for the rest of the year, $375,000 a month in 1991 and $300,000 a month in 1992. **********In addition, the loan package requires Mr. Trump to adhere to a clear business plan with month-by-month cash flow projections and item-by-item disbursements. It also stipulates that a chief financial officer and a system of accounting controls be put in place in the Trump Organization by Sept. 30. The developer must also replace the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen with the firm of Kenneth Leventhal & Company. **********Also under the terms, the operating income of several of Mr. Trump's assets, including the Plaza Hotel, the Trump Shuttle airline, Trump Tower and a 76-acre inactive railyard that Mr. Trump owns on the West Side of Manhattan, would not be given to the Trump Organization but would provide payments for the loans attached to them. **********People involved in the talks said two large obstacles remained between Mr. Trump and the bankers. The first is Dresdner Bank A.G., a German bank that holds a $15 million share of a $75 million loan that the Chase Manhattan Bank made against the Trump Tower. Dresdner is the last holdout in that loan syndicate, in which there are also three Japanese banks, and although bankers from Chase and representatives of the Trump Organization had tried to win over the German bank on Saturday, it still refuses to approve the loan package, those involved said. **********These bankers said the big New York banks, particularly Chase, would put a great deal of pressure on Dresdner today to go along with the new loan package. Dresdner's top officers are being pulled into the negotiations. **********''They are bringing in the heavy artillery of senior management at this point,'' one banker said. ''It has gotten to the level of chairman, vice chairman and president of these banks.'' **********French Bank Balks **********A second problem emerged over the weekend when Societe Generale, a large French bank, began reneging on its decision to approve the package. Societe Generale, a member of the bank syndicate that has a $200 million loan to Mr. Trump on the Manhattan railyard, is balking at the deal because it does not want Mr. Trump to defer principal and interest payments on the loan. **********Representatives of all the major New York banks involved in the talks have said those banks will not purchase the loans of smaller banks, or buy them out of the deal, as the Dresdner Bank is said to want, and would allow Mr. Trump to default tomorrow on the bonds if approval is not received from all members of the various loan syndicates. **********Reluctance by Foreign Lenders **********Over the last two weeks, several foreign banks involved in loan syndicates led by Mr. Trump's biggest lenders - Citibank, Bankers Trust, Chase Manhattan Bank, and Manufacturers Hanover - were said to have balked at the new deal and later given their approval. **********Several Japanese banks in the Chase syndicates have tentatively agreed to the terms of the loan package and are expected to get final approval from their Tokyo offices this morning, bankers said. **********If Mr. Trump does not make the $43 million payment to Trump's Castle bondholders by midnight tomorrow, he will have defaulted on the bonds. As a consequence, he would probably lose control of that casino, one of three he owns in Atlantic City. Such a default could also lead to defaults on some of the developer's other loan agreements. His casino licenses could be in jeopardy and the developer might be forced to seek bankruptcy protection. **********Trump Sells Dutch Shipyard **********AMSTERDAM, June 24 (Reuters) - Donald J. Trump has sold the Dutch shipyard that was building his $210 million yacht only two months after he bought it.

Gorbachev still had to deal with considerable economic problems and political uncertainty when he returned to the Soviet Union. **********Some said that Mr. Gorbachev had been bolstered by his conversations with President Bush, but a more prevalent view was that he remained a man in trouble. A conservative Italian newspaper, Il Tempo, compared him to Richard M. Nixon, who attended a summit meeting in Moscow 16 years ago just before he was brought down by the Watergate scandals. **********''He is going home with the feeling of having earned more time,'' the newspaper said. ''Nixon, hounded by Watergate, had only a few more months. How many will Gorbachev have?'' **********'Only a Stage' **********Possibly because today was a national holiday in many European countries, official reaction to the summit talks was slender. Furthermore, press commentaries suggested there was a budding sense that a gathering of this sort, while still closely watched in Europe and reported in detail, had lost some luster and no longer meant as much as it did when the dominance of the United States and the Soviet Union was unassailable. **********''It marks a stage, but only a stage, in a drama which now has many actors,'' The Financial Times said in an editorial. **********The most clearly favorable comments came from the two Germanys, whose leaders repeated assertions made on Sunday that the Bush-Gorbachev summit conference had improved conditions for the unification of their countries despite continued Soviet misgivings about a united Germany's joining NATO. **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said the meeting showed that reunification ''can be solved in a timely fashion,'' including the delicate issue of German membership in the Atlantic alliance. Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, in a separate statement, called the Washington talks ''a great success'' that showed that American-Soviet relations had taken ''a qualitative leap upward.'' **********Two Germanys Heartened **********For his part, Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere of East Germany declared that agreements reached on economic cooperation and on nuclear and chemical disarmament meant that the superpowers had begun to define security in ways that went beyond military terms. **********Essentially, the Germans focused on the aspects of the summit conference that pleased them, and they were particularly heartened by expressions of support for the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe as a strong forum for East-West cooperation. The conference is a 35-nation group that deals with military security, economic cooperation and human rights, and West German leaders view it as providing a broad European framework for future relations. **********In Britain, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the BBC World Service on Sunday night that she was still a ''great fan'' of Mr. Gorbachev, who, she said, had looked at old-style Communism and ''had the courage and vision to say it is not working.'' **********But Mrs. Thatcher, who is to meet with the Soviet leader in Moscow this week, was uncompromising in insisting again that a united Germany must be a full member of NATO. Britain, she made clear, would not accept any proposal to have Germany join the alliance's political structure but remain outside its military framework. **********'The Seed of Compromise' **********There were no public pronouncements on the summit talks from the leaders of France and Italy, and in both countries press reaction tended to be favorable but restrained. **********Corriere della Sera, one of Italy's most respected newspapers, said the superpowers had ''sown the seed of compromise'' in creating a new European order. ''The American President has recognized the legitimacy of Soviet security requirements, and ruled out that a triumphant West would expel the Soviet Union from the executive suite of European destiny,'' the paper said. ''The Soviet President has promised to not put a stick in the wheel of German unification, and above all has confirmed the stabilizing effect of the United States military presence in the Old Continent.'' **********But in Paris, Le Monde chided Mr. Bush for making ''serious concessions, in part in disarmament negotiations but even more concerning little Lithuania.'' This was apparently a reference to the President's surprise decision to sign a trade agreement with Mr. Gorbachev even though the Soviet Union continues its economic embargo against the Baltic republic, which declared independence in March."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/23/business/market-place-the-big-selloff-in-o-t-c-stocks.html": {"writer_name": "Anise Wallace", "pub_date": "1990-08-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 951, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place;   The Big Selloff In O-T-C Stocks", "print_headline": "Market Place;   The Big Selloff In O-T-C Stocks", "body_text": " **********THE 400-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average since mid-July has captured headlines, but the real carnage is taking place in the over-the-counter market. Investors describe the activity of recent weeks as the worst since the October 1987 crash. **********''It's a liquidity crisis that has led to a bloodbath,'' said Harvey P. Eisen, president of Sun America Asset Management, a New York investment firm. **********Unlike the crash in 1987, when the over-the-counter market was virtually paralyzed for several weeks after the Oct. 19 plunge, this decline has been relentless for several weeks. ''In 1987, it was over in a day,'' said Alan Radlo, portfolio manager of the $622 million Fidelity OTC Fund. ''This is going on and on and on. It's brutal.'' **********Yesterday, the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks fell 4.84 points, to 374.84. That is the lowest level for the Nasdaq index since Dec. 15, 1988. Tuesday's activity was even worse. The index lost 8.91 points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 379.68. And 554 of the more than 5,000 Nasdaq stocks hit new 52-week lows, more than any one-day session since Oct. 28, 1987. Also on Tuesday, over-the-counter trading volume jumped to 166.4 million, up from 115.5 million on Monday. It was still relatively heavy yesterday, at 146.1 million shares. **********Since July 16, when the Dow peaked at 2,999.75, the Nasdaq index is down 20.2 percent, the Dow is down 14.7 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down 14.2 percent. And for the year, the Nasdaq index is down 16.5 percent, compared with a 5.5 percent decline in the Dow. The decline in the Value Line index, with more than 3,000 stocks, is even greater, down 19 percent. ''There is a panic mentality when you talk to people,'' said Richard A. Freeman, senior vice president of Shearson Asset Management, who invests $165 million in over-the-counter stocks for three mutual funds. ''It's close to a capitulation.'' **********As often happens in nervous selloffs, the stocks of many of the market's best-performing companies have been hit the hardest. Portfolio managers at mutual funds who are jittery about the crisis in the Middle East and the fear of a recession are desperately trying to raise cash because they worry that their shareholders will start redeeming their shares. As a result, these fund managers are selling stocks of the largest, most liquid companies that had run up the most earlier in the year. **********Stocks of companies like Intel, Nike and Lin Broadcasting have dropped quite sharply as worrried investors continue to sell. The stock of Nike, for example, has dropped from $91.875 in mid-July to $62. Yesterday, it fell $5.375. Intel has dropped to $32.125 from $52 over the period; yesterday it slipped 12.5 cents. And Lin Broadcasting to $54.125 from $74; yesterday it lost $2.875. **********Investors complain that this recent market decline has been aggravated by poor trading volume. ''When you have less liquidity in a market, moves are much more violent,'' Mr. Freeman said. **********Wall Street dealers may be trading large blocks of the well-known companies like Nike and Intel, but when investors want to buy or sell shares of smaller companies, like Duty Free and Fifth Third Bank, they will often trade only 500 or 1,000 shares at a time. ''The liquidity factor has become nonexistent,'' said Mr. Radlo of Fidelity. In the October 1987 selloff, sellers complained that many dealers in the over-the-counter market did not pick up telephones. ''They're answering the phones this time, but are they making markets?'' Mr. Radlo said. He said Fidelity was beginning to use a trading system that bypasses over-the-counter brokers and buys and sells directly with other institutional investors. ''It's getting very frustrating trying to do business,'' he added. **********Indeed, since 1987 many dealers in listed securities and over-the-counter stocks have pulled back from making markets. Because they are unwilling to risk their capital in turbulent markets, prices of all securities have become more volatile. ''The business of making markets and providing liquidity is not very profitable for broker dealers,'' said Laszlo Birinyi, founder of Birinyi Associates, a New York securities research firm. **********For their part, dealers say such complaints are common in market declines. And they argue that it is unrealistic to expect them to stand up during turbulent periods. The over-the-counter market is now dominated by institutional investors, they say, and portfolio managers at mutual funds and bank trust departments often act in unison, trying to sell the same stock at the same time without the balancing force of individual investors. **********''They're all getting the same news on the same machine at the same time,'' said Myron J. Schuster, managing director and head of institutional trading at Ernst & Company, a New York broker. ''How can you have liquidity?'' Tuesday's selloff in the over-the-counter market was one of the worst since mid-July, traders said, and no one is willing to predict when it might end. ''We're still in the midst of it,'' Mr. Schuster said. As a result of the bargains created by the selling, some portfolio managers, including Mr. Radlo at Fidelity, have been cautiously buying stocks like the State Street Bank and Trust Company and Nike, but they are not spending all of their cash. ''Why should I fight the tape?'' he said. ''You can't get out of the way of this.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/13/business/the-media-business-advertising-is-it-a-film-is-it-an-ad-harder-to-tell.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1990-03-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 647, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;   Is It a Film?

In an essay that will be included in the forthcoming book ''Seeing Through Movies,'' Mr. Miller argues forcefully that American cinema has been corrupted by the goals and methods of advertising. **********Mr. Miller, known for his explorations of American television for The New Republic and other publications, looks at contemporary films and everywhere sees product placements, happy endings and anti-realism that are drawn from and promote the same disposable culture extolled by advertising. **********''Conceived and sold as 'product,' just like the many products that it sells, the movie passes right through you, leaving nothing in you but a vague, angry craving for another one,'' writes Mr. Miller, a 40-year-old associate professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. **********A shorter version of the essay, entitled ''Hollywood: The Ad,'' will be published as the cover article in the April issue of The Atlantic magazine. The book, which was edited by Mr. Miller, is scheduled to be published in June by Pantheon. **********Using as a reference point the idiosyncratic visions of the films of the 1970's, Mr. Miller attempts to show that the change in Hollywood has been dramatic and recent. Older films like ''The Godfather II'' or ''Chinatown'' had themes that however dark were informed by realistic relationships between people and their society. But today's films, typified by ''Top Gun'' and ''Ferris Bueller's Day Off,'' are uplifting versions of an impossible America where opposites always attract, good guys always win, and the environment is filled with fantastic action, cathartic violence, brilliant colors and a limited handful of brand names. **********To a large extent, Mr. Miller contends, the sole purpose of this ''deliberately anti-realistic'' cinematic construction is to market products whose manufacturers pay to feature them in films. As such, new movies are little different from commercials, for their purpose ''is to enhance the product by meticulously placing it within the sort of idealized display that occurs nowhere in real life.'' **********In an interview, Mr. Miller affirmed his belief that the change in American cinema dates to the acquisition of the big studios by global marketing conglomerates. ''Cinema,'' he said, ''is no longer supervised by businessmen who have a powerful affection for and knowledge of the craft of making movies. The crisis relates to excessive control by forces that are anti-esthetic and are interested only in an immediate hit.'' **********Evidence certainly exists to indicate that a blatant marketing imperative is driving much current American movie-making. Advertising Age recently reported, for example, that the Walt Disney Company's Buena Vista Pictures unit sent large consumer-products companies letters soliciting product placements for a new movie entitled ''Mr. Destiny.'' For $20,000, the companies could have a product seen in the film; for $40,000 an actor would mention the product, and for $60,000 an actor would actually use it. **********Worse than product placements, Mr. Miller said, was the twisting and turning of all current movies to conclude on happy notes. He pointed out that at least three of the five nominees for best picture this year -''Glory,'' ''Born on the Fourth of July'' and ''Field of Dreams'' - include climactic moments of what he called ''gratuitous applause,'' aimed at dissipating any lingering bittersweetness. **********''I worry about a country whose citizens can't tolerate the slightest bit of darkness,'' Mr. Miller said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/07/business/the-media-business-discount-warehouses-get-a-new-best-seller-books.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Cohen", "pub_date": "1990-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1242, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Discount Warehouses Get A New Best Seller: Books", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;   Discount Warehouses Get A New Best Seller: Books", "body_text": " **********Beside rows of deck chairs and fluorescent shorts, the books are piled on metal skids in a warehouse big enough to be an aircraft hangar.

''I never read the books, but they are such a good deal that I buy them,'' said Dennis O'Connell, a businessman. **********In his cart, next to some rubber piping, he has Dennis Clifford's ''Plan Your Estate,'' priced at $10.99, against a list price of $17.95, and Judith Ferguson's ''The Step by Step Cookbook,'' costing $12.49, compared with a list price of $39.95. **********Such bargains are drawing a growing number of people to membership-only discount warehouses, including this Price Club in Nesconset. There are now more than 280 such warehouses in the United States, more than four times the number there were five years ago. And with their explosive expansion, the warehouses are selling more and more books - to the point where, on selected titles, they may now sell as many or more as the big Waldenbooks and B. Dalton book chains. **********Analysts say the warehouses - led by Price, and including Sam's, Costco and Pace - now sell at least $350 million in books a year. That is much less than the approximately $2.4 billion sold by the two big chains, but it has grown sharply in recent years and is concentrated on a relatively small number of titles. **********As a result, publishing analysts believe the American book market is changing again. Dominated during the 1980's by the rapid growth of the chains and their challenge to traditional book stores, it is now characterized by the chains' attempts to adjust to new competition, in which the warehouses are prominent and surviving independent stores stronger. **********Referring to the warehouses, Bruce Harris, director of trade publishing for Random House, said, ''They are getting to the point where, on a few selected titles, they are able to clear quantities in a league with the chain buyers.'' **********Tom Hayworth, vice president of Advance Marketing Services, a San Diego-based wholesaler specializing in selling books to the warehouses, estimated that annual warehouse book sales had grown ''at least tenfold in the last five years.'' **********''It is mind-boggling the volume of books you can move in one of these places,'' he said. **********Typically, the warehouses are vast expanses exceeding 100,000 square feet, selling everything from pretzels to books. **********By operating on a no-frills, high-volume, low-inventory basis, they are able to offer something close to the 50 percent discount generally given to wholesalers by book publishers. **********With a range of 150 to 250 books, they do not yet stock sufficient titles or exist in enough locations to pose a direct threat to the chains, analysts say. They also have membership requirements, although these are loose enough to allow Price Club alone to have more than 5.6 million members, most of whom pay a $25 annual fee. **********Moreover, many customers appear to be impulse buyers who would not otherwise purchase books. Publishers are pleased because they believe the warehouses are adding to the overall book market, which continues to grow steadily, rather than taking customers from other stores. **********Pressure on the Chains **********Still, by slashing prices on books by authors like Robert Ludlum and Danielle Steel far below the discounts offered by chains, the warehouses are challenging B. Dalton and Waldenbooks in their core best-seller business and prodding them to adopt a wider range of titles. **********For example, Price Club sells Mr. Ludlum's latest best seller, ''The Bourne Ultimatum'' at $12.29, a 44 percent discount from Random House's list price of $21.95. Philip Roth's ''Deception,'' published by Simon & Schuster, is discounted 42 percent, to $10.99, and Rosamunde Pilcher's ''September,'' published by St. Martin's Press, is 42 percent cheaper, at $13.29. **********In general, discounts on books sold at stores owned by B. Dalton and Waldenbooks vary from 15 percent to 35 percent. For example, Ms. Pilcher's book is being sold for $17.42 at Waldenbooks and $19.50 at B. Dalton. At Barnes & Noble, which is owned by B. Dalton, the price is $16.07. Independent bookstores generally sell at the full list price. **********''Warehouses like Price are pummeling the best sellers and taking some of our sales,'' said Harry Hoffman, chief executive of Waldenbooks. ''So we are having to take a wider range of books. **********'Best Seller Sales Are Flat' **********''Our sales growth now is primarily in our backlist,'' he said, ''where sales in the first four months of 1990 were 25 percent above the same period of 1989. Best seller sales are flat.'' **********Gary Del Vecchio, president of B. Dalton's Doubleday Book Stores, also said increased sales of backlist books were compensating for falling sales of big-name authors. B. Dalton has begun its first campaign to promote little-known or first-time authors. **********Publishers are increasingly aware of the potential of the warehouses to sell large quantities of books. Both Little, Brown & Company and Random House said Price Club was among their top 10 clients. For Mr. Ludlum's latest book, more than 150,000 copies have already been sold through various warehouses, or about 20 percent of total sales up to now, publishers said. **********Price, with total sales of all merchandise exceeding $5 billion at its 47 North American warehouses, is the largest of the warehouse groups. It is followed by Sam's, with more than 125 smaller warehouses; Costco, with about 60, and Pace, with about 40. **********Sharp Growth in Sales **********Typically, publishers sell large quantities of selected books to Advance Marketing, which distributes them to Price Club and other warehouses. The company now provides books to more than 280 warehouse clubs, compared with just 63 in 1985. Its sales have risen to $155 million last year from $24 million in 1985. **********Although many books sold in warehouses are by big-name authors, there are other titles as well. ''We search our backlist for things that might appeal to the warehouses,'' said Mr. Harris of Random House. **********Robert E. Price, president of Price Club, said his company bought many of its books from Advance Marketing, but some were bought directly from the publishers. **********Mr. Price declined to detail book sales, but said they had risen in line with the company's overall performance. Price's revenues have grown sharply in recent years, from $1.8 billion in 1985 to $5.03 billion last year. **********''The chains are our competitors,'' he said. ''Everybody out there is.'' **********But for Jill Keller, a gym teacher shopping at Price Club, there is no competition. ''This is cheaper than the chains, and this where I buy my books'' she said. And she tossed ''The Official Baseball Card Price Guide'' into her cart, alongside giant packs of Minute Maid and bagels."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/07/world/mandela-hardens-line-on-white-rights.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1990-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 722, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mandela Hardens Line on White Rights", "print_headline": "Mandela Hardens Line on White Rights", "body_text": " **********Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader, told supporters today that he would urge President F. W. de Klerk to abandon his insistence on guarantees for South Africa's white minority before the Government and the congress next held talks on the nation's future. **********''At a time when we want to move away from all forms of racialism, we do not want discussions which have started so well to be determined by any solution which is based on race,'' Mr. Mandela said. ''And I'm going to ask de Klerk that he must not bring this issue to any conference between the A.N.C. and the Government.'' **********Mr. Mandela addressed a crowd of nearly 40,000 African National Congress supporters at a soccer stadium.

They seemed eager to send a message that the success of the talks last week did not mean that the congress had compromised its principles. **********It was unclear whether Mr. Mandela was announcing new conditions for the African National Congress's participation in talks with the Government or was merely trying to reassure supporters that the organization had not retreated on its longstanding demand for a one person, one vote system, which would introduce rule by the black majority in South Africa. **********But his comments today seemed the toughest that Mr. Mandela has made in public on the Government's concern for protection of the white minority since his release from prison three months ago. **********Talks Could Be Undermined **********If Mr. Mandela presses his objection to minority guarantees, as he promised today, it could affect the resumption of the talks. The Government's willingness to negotiate is predicated on a belief that guarantees must be built into any new constitution to insure that whites, about 5 million in a population estimated at 37 million, will not be dominated by blacks. Mr. de Klerk promised this in asking whites to support his vision of evolutionary change. **********Mr. Mandela said he would meet with President de Klerk before the next round of talks. ''And one of the things I am going to urge upon him is to abandon the concept of group rights - minority rights - without any reservation,'' he said. **********''The fact that Mr. de Klerk is determined to bring this concept to the negotiating table means that white South Africa does not yet trust us,'' Mr. Mandela said. The African National Congress has contended that there will be sufficient guarantees for individuals in a unitary, democratic and nonracial South Africa. **********Botha Unhappy, Too **********Mr. de Klerk encountered criticism from another direction in a report that former President P. W. Botha refused to renew his membership in the National Party, to which he belonged for more than 50 years, because of the direction it has taken under Mr. de Klerk. **********The Afrikaans-language newspaper Rapport today said Mr. Botha objected not just to the President's policies but to the inclusion of Mr. Slovo, who has been living in Zambia, in the African National Congress's delegation last week. **********President Botha quit as party leader two weeks after suffering a stroke in January 1989. But he hung on as President, despite pressure on him to retire, until he was forced out last August by his own Cabinet. **********The former President, who was bitter about his ouster, met recently with Ferdi Hartzenberg, deputy leader of the opposition Conservative Party.

American officials say the Secretary General told the Vice President then that he would issue a report if any member nation asked for it. The United States followed up Mr. Quayle's request with a letter asking for a report. **********On Wednesday, however, the Secretary General wrote back to the United States representative, Thomas R. Pickering, saying he would submit a report on Cuba's human rights record only if the Human Rights Commission formally instructed him to do so at its coming session. **********U.S. Cites 1989 Resolution **********The Bush Administration takes the view that the Secretary General is already empowered to make the report under an ambiguously worded resolution approved at last year's meeting. **********This asked him to discuss with the Cuban authorities the commission's 1988 investigation into Cuba's human rights record, including assertions that witnesses were intimidated. It then says, ''These contacts and their results will be taken up by the Secretary General in an appropriate manner.'' American officials argue that a report to the Human Rights Commission constitutes ''an appropriate manner'' of following up on the contacts if requested by a member nation. **********The Secretary General has already been asked to report to this year's commission meeting on human rights violations in China, using information ''provided by the Government of China and by other reliable sources.'' **********Such a report on Cuba, diplomats say, would enable the Bush Administration to focus the commission's attention on the human rights situation there in a way that may otherwise be difficult to do.

In order to have peace in Cambodia, we need to make peace with the Khmer Rouge. We must persuade the Khmer Rouge to join us inside the Supreme Council.'' **********Pressure Off Western Nations **********But if the Prince and Mr. Son Sann do what they have now promised to do -form a Supreme National Council with Mr. Hun Sen even without the participation of the Khmer Rouge - it will enable the United Nations this fall to give Cambodia's seat there to the council, thereby further legitimizing Mr. Hun Sen and isolating the Khmer Rouge. **********It would also take some of the pressure off the Bush Administration and other Western governments that have been increasingly criticized for indirectly supporting the Khmer Rouge by their support for the Prince and Mr. Son Sann. **********Cambodia's seat is currently held by the Sihanouk coalition, which includes the Khmer Rouge, who were driven out of power when the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in 1978. Under the Khmer Rouge, more than a million Cambodians were killed or died of starvation and disease during a brutal campaign of restructuring. **********But as the Prince implied tonight, such an pact is likely to do little to end the war in Cambodia, the brunt of which is carried by the Khmer Rouge, and may intensify the fighting. **********If they are cut out of any settlement, they will have little incentive to stop fighting, and Asian and European diplomats make clear that no country will agree to put international peacekeeping troops into Cambodia as long as the Khmer Rouge have not agreed in principle, at least, to lay down their arms. **********Talks Turn Sour **********Japanese officials started the two days of talks confidently, working from a draft text that the Thai Defense Minister, Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, had gotten all four factions to sign. **********Japanese officials spoke of the meeting as a first venture into regional peacemaking since the end of World War II, and as a diplomatic exercise more commensurate with Japan's standing as a world economic power. **********But what was envisaged as two days of negotiation between Mr. Hun Sen and Prince Sihanouk as the two leaders of rival sides quickly turned sour. The Khmer Rouge, scheduled to attend as part of the Prince's delegation, boycotted the first meeting on Monday, which adjourned after 25 minutes. **********The bipartite negotiations never resumed. Although General Chavalit and Japanese officials shuttled among the factions, they spent most of their time in conversation with the Khmer Rouge and the Sihanouk side. Officials with Mr. Hun Sen said there was little for them to do but wait. **********Japanese 'Very Annoyed' **********A joint Hun Sen-Sihanouk news conference turned into separate ones, and then it was announced that Mr. Hun Sen would not speak this evening after all. Throughout, Japanese officials tried to keep smiles on their faces, although one official said the Japanese were ''very annoyed'' with the Cambodians, the Khmer Rouge in particular. **********In the end, what Prince Sihanouk and Mr. Hun Sen signed tonight was a communique little different from the one that the four factions initialed last month. **********But the real importance of the meeting here is likely to be the growing isolation of the Khmer Rouge within a diplomatic process that is accelerating, and that is treating Mr. Hun Sen with much more respect than before."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/14/business/briefs-348990.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 305, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** Associates Corp. of North America, a unit of the Ford Motor Co., is offering 9.20 percent senior notes due 1993 at 100 through Kidder, Peabody & Co.

Many experts here think that the decision effectively means that Nippon and its unions have prevailed, and the move may be derailed forever. **********Like the divestment of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in the United States through the mid-1980's, the Nippon breakup was seen as a way to create competition in one of the world's most intricate and heavily used telephone networks. **********Saved by a Price Plunge **********But in the end, Government officials say, Nippon was saved not by arguments over the wisdom of a split but by the political atmosphere created by the remarkable plunge of its share prices. The free fall began a year and a half ago in the midst of the stock-and-influence peddling scandal centering on the Recruit Company. Even after the scandal faded, the stock continued to fall. **********''We have avoided the worst case, the nightmare,'' a senior official of Nippon said on Friday, after the Government made its announcement. **********For Japanese investors, Nippon is the ultimate blue-chip stock, and from the time the company was offered to the public in 1986, affluent Japanese scrambled to get a share or two. That was all most people could afford. The offering price was 1,197,000 yen, or about $7,575 a share at current exchange rates. **********At one point in 1987, the share price soared to 3,180,000 yen - more than $20,000 a share. To many Japanese, it seemed like the company, capitalized at a higher value than any other in the world, could only go up. The telecommunications business was booming, and the land that Nippon owns for its local telephone offices is undervalued on the company's balance sheets by billions of dollars. **********But Nippon was quickly enmeshed in the Recruit scandal, and its stock fell after its chairman, Hisashi Shinto, was arrested. He is on trial now. More recently, the decline has been accelerated by a Government report advocating that the company's domestic long-distance service be spun off into a separate company. Nippon stock has plummeted to little more than $7,000 a share, well below the initial offering price. **********Perhaps the most anxious shareholder is the Japanese Ministry of Finance. The Government owns 66.8 percent of the company. Last year, as the price fell, it had to postpone a public offering of additional shares that was expected to relieve Japan's budget deficit and pay for a range of programs. In recent days, Ministry of Finance officials made no secret of their growing displeasure. **********At the same time, Haruo Yamaguchi, the chief executive of Nippon, stepped up his campaign to convince Government officials, journalists, shareholders and the company's workers that a breakup would be disastrous. **********''It would be a very negative thing,'' Mr. Yamaguchi said two weeks ago during a lunch with a small group of foreign correspondents. ''We would have to raise our rates, and the network itself would suffer, much like in the United States.'' **********Three Telephone Networks **********A breakup would have left Japan with three telephone networks. Already, international telephone service is handled by another former government monopoly, KDD, which has watched its business dwindle as low-cost competitiors have begun to win an unexpectedly large number of customers. **********Under the breakup plan, Nippon would have been left with only local calling. Since it has been heavily subsidizing local service with its long-distance revenues, local rates would surely have risen. **********The other camp in the bitter Government dispute was the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, which had strongly advocated a breakup. It said local-calling service could have turned profitable if the company became more efficient. **********But the Ministry of Finance argued that the company's stock might not recover for years, and in the end it won the support of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/25/business/company-news-airlines-announce-plan-to-cooperate.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 178, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Airlines Announce Plan to Cooperate", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Airlines Announce Plan to Cooperate", "body_text": " **********USAir and Air France announced a joint marketing program for coordination of schedules, marketing and joint facilities.

While people using the ferry now have to pass through the business district to get to the harbor, those usingthe tunnel will bypass the town center. **********\"I think Folkestone will lose out,\" said Ron Barnett, manager of the London-Paris Hotel near the harbor. \"The tunnel comes straight out onto the motorway, and people coming out of the tunnel are already going to be on their way out of Folkestone.\" **********Nevertheless, some business officials said, Folkestone has profited from the tunnel construction. **********\"Two and a half years ago we had 30 empty stores on High Street,\" said Victor H.

For the decentralization effort at Taco Bell, the company charged $5.5 million against pretax earnings to cover the expenses of adding office space and arranging relocations. The charges totaled $17.8 million, or $13.2 million after taxes. **********Pepsico's annual results also included reorganization charges, plus a special gain. **********For the year, the company's earnings grew by 18.2 percent, to $901.4 million, or $3.40 a share, from $762.2 million, or $2.90 a share.

And in a weak economy, consumers are being extra careful about spending. But once the bankruptcies are history and the economy is robust again, America's retailers will still be in trouble. The problem is that the public is rattling around in too many stores - with too much shopping space. **********This space glut is widely acknowledged among retailers. Ira Silver, chief economist of J. C. Penney Company, holds a typical view. ''To be successful in this situation, you have to be a really good merchant,'' he said. ''But if everyone somehow got to be a really good merchant, there would still be a shakeout because we are a nation with too much store space for the number of buyers.'' **********That is hard on retailers, but a bonanza for consumers in two respects. With so much space in which to offer all sorts of merchandise, the price discounting that became widespread last year, particularly in clothing, is likely to continue. Secondly, to make themselves immune to the oversupply of store space, some big retailers are trying to be more sensitive to the needs of shoppers. **********Thus, Penney found itself selling general merchandise - refrigerators, auto parts, consumer electronics, gardening equipment, clothing - in big shopping malls that in the 1980's developed an overabundance of this type of store. ''We switched to high-quality apparel, a market segment that was not over-stored in our shopping centers,'' Mr. Silver said. **********Similarly, Nordstrom Inc., the big West Coast clothing store chain that is expanding in the East, has drawn customers by smothering them with smiling sales people. ''You have to focus on something, and our focus is customer service,'' said John Goesling, Nordstrom's chief financial officer. **********But the overcapacity produces plenty of stress. There are constant store closings and job losses, mostly among smaller operations. ''It does terrible things to people's careers,'' said Alice McCord of the National Retail Merchants Association. **********Even retail workers who keep their jobs feel the strain. Nordstrom, for instance, has been accused by the State of Washington of systematically failing to pay sales people for some work. The company is said to have required employees to work some hours without punching in their time cards. Mr. Goesling did not comment on the charges. But he says that Nordstrom ''expects a lot from our people and is not a place for everyone to work.'' **********If overcapacity is disruptive, measuring the extent of it is complicated. Commerce Department data indicate that retail sales space has been increasing at a faster rate than sales revenue and that space in the nation's shopping malls - the main area of expansion - has grown by 20 percent since 1986. But shopper traffic through the malls has risen by less than 10 percent, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. **********The glut is, however, uneven. The Sun Belt states are very over-stored, while those around the Great Lakes have escaped the problem. What is more, store construction rises in tandem with housing construction rather than higher sales revenue, according to George Christie, chief economist at the F. W. Dodge Division of McGraw-Hill, which compiles construction data. If people buy more, that simply allows nearby retailers to make greater use of existing space. **********Mr. Christie says that from 1970 until 1985, retail floor space grew invariably by 200 million square feet for every one million new single-family houses. And then in 1985, store construction jumped to 250 million square feet for every million new houses and stayed at this ratio through last year, although construction has slowed in recent months. ''We might get back to a normal ratio this year or next,'' Mr. Christie said. **********Why the overbuilding? Two factors were cash-rich pension funds seeking profitable investments and savings and loan associations no longer required to lend only for housing. They decided that shopping malls would pay off, and many of the bigger ones have. But the thousands of ''strip centers'' of half-a-dozen small stores are suffering from high turnover and vacancy rates. **********The overbuilding coincided with other trends that reduced the supply of shoppers. The baby boomers do not shop as much as they did when they were mostly under 30. Working women are not big shoppers either. And many families buy from catalogues rather than stores. **********Clearly, this is a hard period for retailers, and it seems likely to last until floor space gets back into line with demand - perhaps by 1993, Mr. Christie said. Retailers, in effect, are now paying the price for the exuberant building boom of the 1980's."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/30/world/as-mandela-stumps-for-sanctions-south-africa-debates-them.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1990-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1240, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "As Mandela Stumps for Sanctions, South Africa Debates Them", "print_headline": "As Mandela Stumps for Sanctions, South Africa Debates Them", "body_text": " **********Nelson Mandela's plea for Western countries to maintain economic sanctions against South Africa has galvanized the debate over their effectiveness in hastening the end of apartheid. **********It is increasingly apparent that the cumulative damage of sanctions will be difficult for a post-apartheid government to correct. But many whites here say that sanctions have outlived their intended purpose - to shock the Government into change - and that their economic impact has been overrated. **********Many South African blacks, on the other hand, value such measures as symbols of international support for their struggle, though the sanctions hurt their incomes more than those of their white employers. **********Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, a liberal white who quit Parliament to promote more direct dialogue between whites and blacks, described the debate on sanctions as ''a quagmire of confusion, half-truths, platitudes, provocation and deception.'' **********''It is also riddled with laudable intentions frustrated by reality,'' said Mr. Slabbert, speaking last week in Port Elizabeth. He added that the argument would endure, ''if only because of its ability to generate more heat than light.'' **********Opponents Are Derided **********Some blacks who question the efficacy of sanctions, like the Zulu leader, Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, have been vilified as collaborators. **********''It is automatically assumed,'' Ismail Lagardien wrote in The Sowetan, the largest black newspaper, ''that if someone is opposed to economic sanctions against South Africa, this person is in favor of apartheid, white domination and capitalism. On the other hand, the person who supports the call for sanctions is seen as sound of mind and character, and most definitely part of the liberation struggle.'' **********The white minority Government fueled the argument by initially dismissing the effect of sanctions, even while it enacted a law declaring it a crime to publicly advocate the curbs. **********''They would not make it illegal if it didn't hurt,'' said Max Sisulu, chief economist for the African National Congress. **********More recently, officials have conceded that sanctions restricted growth and limited access to foreign loans. Because of sanctions, Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said, ''we lost a few yards in the 100-meter race.'' **********Shrinking of Economy **********A study released in May by the Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington said sanctions had cost South Africa between $15 billion and $27 billion. It estimated that the bation's economy is 20 percent to 35 percent smaller today than it would have been without restrictions on investment capital and the need to produce costly substitutions of imports. But the study also found South Africa much less vulnerable to sanctions than it was 10 or 20 years ago. **********South Africa's acquired ability to live with sanctions has become conspicuous in its foreign trade, which accounts for at least 55 percent of the gross domestic product. The latest trade figures suggest that South Africa will run a surplus of $2 billion this year. Moreover, the nation has found other markets and investors to replace those lost from the United States. **********The Trade and Industry Minister, Kent Durr, reported in Parliament last week that foreign companies planned to invest billions of dollars in South Africa in the next six months, with nearly $1.7 billion going into the country's automobile industry. Mr. Durr did not say where the money would come from, but West Germany and Japan have filled the vacuum left by departing auto makers from the United States. **********In a meeting with foreign journalists in February, Chris Stals, the governor of the South African Reserve Bank, observed that economic sanctions fell into three categories - trade boycotts, disinvestment and the withdrawal of loans. Only the last had been devastating, Mr. Stals said. **********After foreign banks called in loans in 1985, $12 billion flowed out of the country. But some Western economists attributed this not to sanctions but to a loss of investor confidence created by unrest in the black townships, Flow of Rands Prevented ''Since 1985, we've had to run the economy on a cash basis,'' Mr. du Plessis told foreign journalists. ''It's the equivalent of a household trying to raise its standard of living without access to a banking facility.'' **********But when Western companies stopped doing business in South Africa, Mr. Stals said no factories were closed and little money was lost because the South African rand was kept inside the country, with only the right to use it bought and sold abroad as the so-called ''financial rand.'' **********''In terms of the balance of payments, disinvestment had little effect,'' he said. **********Mr. Stals noted that some South African corporations profited from disinvestment by buying foreign subsidiaries at low prices. ''It led to a bigger concentration of economic power into the hands of the few conglomerates,'' he said. **********Where disinvestment has hurt is in disrupting access to new technology and investment from former parent companies. **********'Hurts Apartheid More' **********Some proponents of sanctions now concede that the besieged economy's inability to create any new jobs has left more blacks unemployed, but say the price must be paid. **********''Yes, we recognize that sanctions hurt the blacks, but it hurts apartheid more,'' Max Sisulu said. **********A survey of 1,400 blacks released by the Chamber of Mines a year ago found that 82 percent opposed sanctions. **********Sanctions remain significant in bolstering the morale of those who confront apartheid daily, but they also figure in the domestic political maneuvering that is preceding the negotations proposed by President F. W. de Klerk on the country's future. By influencing the schedule for the lifting of sanctions, the African National Congress has a weapon to wield against the Government and black rivals like Chief Buthelezi. **********Mr. Mandela, the African National Congress leader whose world tour has been aimed in part at preserving sanctions, has said removing them too soon could make the Government complacent about the gradual pace of change. **********Effect on the Future **********But in his recent visit to Western Europe, Mr. de Klerk spread a message that sanctions were unnecessary since he was busy dismantling apartheid. He and his supporters contend that repealing the curbs would give him tangible evidence to prove to nervous whites that dismantling apartheid can benefit them, too. **********Whatever the future of sanctions, their stunting of economic opportunity and employment seems bound to plague a post-apartheid South Africa. **********''The whole idea of sanctions was to signal to South Africans the displeasure of the U.S. Congress over political events in this country,'' said Prof. Carl F. Noffke, director of the Institute of American Studies at Rand Afrikaans University. ''But you can't continue with that signal unless you want to destroy a country.'' **********Mr. Mandela has proposed large-scale foreign investment to rebuild the economy, once apartheid is ended. But Mr. Stals said investment funds withdrawn by banks from South Africa would probably end up in Eastern Europe. **********Mr. Slabbert, speaking in Port Elizabeth last week, said: ''The most dangerous illusion created by the sanctions debate is that when de Klerk and Mandela agree to end the call for sanctions, untold millions of investment capital will pour into South Africa. Nothing of the sort will happen.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/24/business/savings-failures-expected-to-soar-the-treasury-says.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1990-05-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1563, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SAVINGS FAILURES EXPECTED TO SOAR, THE TREASURY SAYS", "print_headline": "SAVINGS FAILURES EXPECTED TO SOAR, THE TREASURY SAYS", "body_text": " **********The Administration told Congress today that more than 1,000 savings and loan associations - 40 percent of the industry - might eventually have to be seized by the Government, twice the number it had initially projected. **********Blaming rising interest rates and sizable areas of weakness in the nation's real estate markets, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told the Senate Banking Committee that based on the new projection the $73 billion that Congress appropriated for the bailout last year would have to be raised at least to $89 billion, and perhaps to as high as $130 billion. **********''It is now clear that the amounts projected and authorized will fall short of what is required,'' Mr. Brady said. **********A Shift in Position **********Mr. Brady's testimony represented an extraordinary admission by the Administration, which for more than a year has insisted that there was no compelling reason to change its estimates of the cost of the biggest financial debacle in the nation's history, even though private analysts were warning that the Treasury's original numbers were woefully inadequate. **********''Reality has arrived and we should be thankful for it,'' said Bert Ely, a financial consultant based in Alexandria, Va. ''The Treasury has put realistic numbers on the table.'' **********But the figures Mr. Brady gave today represent only a portion of the overall cost of the cleanup. They do not include the cost of the deals struck in 1988 for the sale of more than 200 institutions before the bailout law was passed. And, citing the same economic factors, a top regulator admitted today that those costs are also rising. [Page D20.]  The new estimates also do not include the huge amounts of interest the taxpayers will have to pay to finance the bailout. **********When those are added in, the total cost of the bailout to the taxpayer and the industry could easily exceed $250 billion over the next 10 years, and approach $500 billion over 30 years. Last month, the General Accounting Office said the cost of the bailout including interest would range from $325 billion to $500 billion. **********Mr. Brady said his agency did not include the interest costs because such costs are not included in accounting for Government programs. ''It would be like saying that the $30 billion Kennedy space program actually cost $92 billion,'' he said. **********Today's estimates were arrived at differently from the $61 billion that Administration officials estimated on Tuesday would be added to next fiscal year's budget deficit because of the bailout. **********Getting the Bad News Out **********Some experts were surprised that the Treasury was willing to paint such a grim picture. ''I think the word must have come down that Brady get the bad news out once and for all and not run the risk that as 1992 approaches they have to change their numbers again,'' said one industry expert who asked not to be identified. **********The clear message from Mr. Brady and the Administration was that Congress would need to appropriate large sums of additional money to guarantee that insured depositors not lose any money. Mr. Brady said he would support either an open-ended appropriation or a set figure, whichever the Congress wanted. But he warned that since the cost of the bailout is a moving target, a specific figure might prove to be inadequate and Congress might find it would have to take up the issue again. **********The savings and loan industry ran into deep troubles in the mid-1980's as the result of slack regulation at the Federal and state levels and highly speculative investments in real estate by savings and loan entrepreneurs whose lending practices bordered on the fraudulent. **********The debacle created billions of dollars of losses for depositors. The Government, which is obligated to cover losses on insured deposits, is now making good on those guarantees. Mr. Brady stressed today that management and stockholders were not being bailed out but that depositors were being rescued. **********Bailout Officials Attend **********Mr. Brady testified as chairman of the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency created last year to oversee the bailout. He appeared with the four other board members: Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman; Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and two members from the private sector, Robert C. Larson, a real estate specialist, and Philip C. Jackson, a former Federal Reserve official. **********The new estimates also come at a time of delicate budget negotiations between the White House and Congress. The Administration has said that the soaring cost of the bailout has been a driving force behind its desire to get a budget agreement. **********Mr. Brady said the biggest contributors to the rise in costs have been higher interest rates and the weak real estate markets. Both factors are sending more savings units into insolvency and making it harder to find buyers for either their assets or their branch offices. **********''Thrifts are just not as attractive a franchise relative to banks as they once were,'' Mr. Brady said. **********Accounting for the Deficit **********One issue that Mr. Brady and others will have to solve is how, on a budgetary basis, the Government should treat the high costs of the cleanup, as well as the large volumes of interim financing, often referred to as working capital, the trust corporation needs. The issue is what portion of the costs to count as part of the Federal deficit. **********Mr. Brady said he would support keeping the working capital off budget, and thus not counted in the deficit, since it is used to pay off depositors after an institution is seized. Once the Government liquidates the assets of an institution, often in a later fiscal period, it recovers large amounts of the money that it borrowed to pay the depositors. Such transactions produce swings that tend to skew the budget picture. **********Mr. Brady did say that the Government should count as part of the deficit any payments to depositors that are not ultimately covered by the sale of assets. But he said he would leave to the budget negotiators the issue of whether the bailout costs should be used in calculating whether the deficit is meeting the budget targets of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law. **********The latest numbers are likely to confuse the public, since industry experts, academics, regulators, members of Congress and the General Accounting Office have issued sharply varying projections. **********Projections by Category **********The projections have basically fallen into three categories. **********One measures the problem in terms of what it would cost today to cover the losses of depositors' money, ''As if you could write a check and solve the entire problem right now,'' a senior Treasury official said. **********Last year, the Treasury said that $50 billion would be enough for the Resolution Trust Corporation to handle failures between August 1989 and August 1992, and another $23 billion would cover failures after that. It has now expanded that estimate so that in the most optimistic case the cost would be $89 billion, and in the worst case, if real estate prices continue to be depressed, it would cost $130 billion. **********Other projections, including those of the Office of Management and Budget, have calculated how much the bailout would cost, including interest on borrowings over the next 10 and 30 years. Last year, the 10-year cost was put at $159 billion, while the 30-year cost was estimated to be more than $250 billion. **********But Mr. Greenspan said today that the numbers projected by the Treasury implied even higher overall costs than the $320 billion to $500 billion in the G.A.O.'s most recent projections. **********Perhaps the most graphic illustration of the huge upward adjustment by the Treasury was its projection that in the worst case as many as 1,037 savings and loan institutions with $530 billion in assets might have to be seized before the Resolution Trust Corporation completes its work in August 1996. **********But Mr. Greenspan did not seem overly concerned about the higher figures. He said he did not expect that the extra borrowing implied by the higher cost estimates would have much of an effect on credit markets. **********''In and of itself, it should not affect interest rates,'' he said. **********Survivors and Casualties **********A new calculation by the Office of Thrift Supervision divides the savings industry into four categories of comparative health. **********One group covers 1,267 well-capitalized and profitable institutions, with assets of $399 billion. A second group comprises 621 institutions, with $327 billion in assets, that are expected to meet the new capital requirements. Few if any of these are expected to fail. **********A third group comprises 315 savings associations, with assets of $152 billion that are troubled by poor earnings and low capital levels. The fourth group covers 299 institutions, with $193 billion in assets, and they are expected to fail. **********In the worse-case projection, all the institutions in the last two groups would fail."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/02/business/layoffs-set-at-morgan-stanley.html": {"writer_name": "Leslie Wayne", "pub_date": "1990-11-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 682, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Layoffs Set At Morgan Stanley", "print_headline": "Layoffs Set At Morgan Stanley", "body_text": " **********Morgan Stanley & Company said yesterday that it would eliminate 50 investment banking jobs, or 6 percent of the 800-member division. It is expected that this round of cuts will be followed by investment banking layoffs at other Wall Street firms. **********Similar layoffs have taken place at Paine Webber Inc. and Shearson Lehman. But Morgan Stanley's are significant because of the firm's reputation. It is considered a corporate finance powerhouse and its investment bankers are generally viewed as the elite of Wall Street and were instrumental in arranging some of the biggest deals of the 1980's. **********Investment banking is considered one of the most prestigious and profitable lines of business on Wall Street, and while the securities industry has been swept by layoffs in other areas, this is the first time a brokerage firm of Morgan Stanley's caliber has cut investment bankers.  'No Clear Precedent' **********A spokesman for Morgan Stanley said the cuts would come from all four investment banking areas: corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, capital markets and real estate. He said those being let go range from junior analysts to \"quite senior people,\" although the spokesman declined to indentify the employees involved. **********\"These layoffs are a reflection of the firm's feelings about the business outlook in the intermediate-term future,\" said the spokesman, who spoke on the condition he would not be identified. He added that there was \"no clear precedent\" for the layoffs and that \"nothing quite like this has happened before.\" **********The layoffs come at a time when Morgan's overall earnings have been holding up. But its investment banking revenues have fallen steadily throughout the year. For instance, in the second quarter, investment banking fees dropped by 30 percent from the period a year earlier, and were down 8 percent in the third quarter from the 1989 quarter. **********\"The true earnings of the firm have held up relatively well this year,\" the spokesman said. \"But you've certainly seen the statistics on merger activity so far this year, and the outlook for that is uncertain at best.\"'   'Not Surprising' **********Michael Goldstein, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said the layoffs reflected \"the basically weak business environment.\" **********\"This is not suprising,\" he added. \"I've been expecting the entire Street's investment banking capacity to contract because investment banking revenues have been at their lowest level since 1984 and a lot of jobs were added since then.\" **********But investment banking, which generally involves raising capital for American companies and arranging financing for mergers and buyouts, has been hard hit by the economic downturn as well as the stagnation of the \"junk bond\" market. American corporations are not raising money to expand and the number of mergers and buyouts has fallen sharply since their heyday in the 1980's. **********The Morgan spokesman said the layoffs would have no effect on fourth-quarter earnings and that no charge would be taken. By the end of the year, he said, he expected that the investment banking department would number about 750, and he added that no further investment banking layoffs were planned.  Expansion Abroad **********The firm has about 7,100 employees, up from 6,600 at the beginning of the year. But the expansion has taken place in Morgan Stanley offices overseas, primarily in London, Tokyo and Hong Kong, and not in New York. **********Morgan is not planning any major structural changes as a result of the layoffs, but the spokesman said the firm would merge its capital markets, debt and equity operations. **********Since the 1987 market crash, employment in the securities business has fallen by 50,000, to 210,000. But most of the cutbacks have resulted from the collapse of several firms, most notably E. F. Hutton & Company and Drexel Burnham Lambert. **********At the same time, profits in the industry have been battered. The double-digit profits of the early 1980's have shrunk to an average of 4 percent since 1987, according to the Securities Industry Association. Pretax return on equity, which averaged 50 percent in the 1980's, has fallen to an average of 7 percent since the market crash, the association reports."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/04/business/all-about-exercise-machines-the-fitness-boom-ends-up-at-home.html": {"writer_name": "Barry Schiffman", "pub_date": "1990-11-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1694, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "All About/Exercise Machines; The Fitness Boom Ends Up at Home", "print_headline": "All About/Exercise Machines; The Fitness Boom Ends Up at Home", "body_text": " **********THE Marines still do their pull-ups.Heavyweights jump rope.  But these days more and more ordinary Americans are trying to get in shape with elaborate and expensive home exercise equipment. Last year, they spent $1.73 billion, triple what they spent in 1980. **********Exercise machines are the latest in the fitness boom, suitable for an aging, family-minded generation. **********Richard Miller, owner of Cutler Owens, the Gym Source, says his New York store began as a full-line sporting goods retailer that catered to runners and tennis players in the 1970's. He started selling exercise equipment in 1981 and gradually eliminated everything else, concentrating on higher-end products.  \"I figured the ultimate would be in the home,\" he said. \"People were in the health clubs, they got married and had kids, and they are staying at home.\" **********In National Sporting Goods Association consumer surveys, retail sales of home fitness equipment grew 22 percent in 1988 and 19 percent in 1989. The equipment accounts for about 15 percent of sporting goods sales, more than any other category except hunting. The products range from a bottom-of-the-line exercise bicycle, for less than $100, to computerized treadmills for more than $3,000. **********Some in the industry wonder if the growth can continue. How many people will keep sweating in the privacy of their homes? they ask. And if more machines end up in closets, will fewer new ones be sold? A Fickle Business **********Matching Trends Is a Key to Success **********Exercise equipment fads can be fleeting. Rowing machines were the rage several years ago; now, sales are slow. Treadmills and stair machines are popular, but for how long? Several companies are bringing out weight machines, for those less interested in endurance than in strength. **********Manufacturers have learned that buyers can be quick to rebel when they don't get results, said Wayne Sales, merchandise manager for sporting goods at K Mart. In the mid-1980's, he said, sales stagnated. \"We saw a lot of equipment that was gimmicky.\" Since then, he added, \"There has been a resurgence of basic, fundamental equipment.\" **********Pamela Miller, fitness editor at Sportstyle, a trade magazine, says consumers who are fickle about equipment usually retain their dedication to good health. When they become discouraged with one machine, they try another, she said. But others in the industry fear that the boom will end as buyers consign their machines to the closet. **********Manufacturers always stand ready to provide new products. Those companies that keep up with the trends lead the industry. Most are privately held, keeping even their sales figures to themselves. But Sportstyle reports that Diversified Products of Opelika, Ala., was the industry leader last year with sales of $220 million, up 22 percent. Weslo Inc., of Logan, Utah, and its sister company, Proform Fitness Products Inc., are growing even faster, with a 94 percent gain, to $204 million, last year. **********These companies prosper by offering a range of products at all prices.  They rely heavily on giant retail chains like Sears, Roebuck & Company and the K Mart Corporation, which account for an increasing share of industry sales. After the leaders, about three dozen smaller companies tend to be more specialized. **********The largest of the more specialized companies is Nordic Track, of Chaska, Minn., a unit of the publicly held CML Group Inc. Its machines mimic the action of cross-country skiing, allowing skiers to train without snow and lame runners to pile up their mileage without torturing their knees. Nordic has relied exclusively on mail order, but it is about to open its first retail outlet, in Washington. Nordic's revenues have risen from $14 million in 1986, when CML took over, to $85 million for the fiscal year that ended in July. **********Not every exercise equipment company can keep up with the industry's pace. Last year, Escalade Inc., of Evansville, Ind., a maker of recreational products and office equipment, acquired 55 percent of Marcy Fitness Products, a financially troubled manufacturer of weight benches and related goods. John Wilson, secretary-treasurer of Escalade, explained that Marcy had tried to expand too quickly and failed to control expenses. Although the takeover kept Marcy in business, the company's sales failed to pick up, and the financial drain has left the parent concern in the red. Threats to Sales **********Flimsy Equipment, Bored Customers **********For many home athletes, buying fancy machines is much less taxing than using them. Do most buyers keep on rowing, running, skiing or lifting long enough to generate more sales? \"That is the proverbial question,\" said Bill Smith, vice president of marketing for Diversified Products. \"Interest does tend to wane.\" But in a survey, he found that equipment use was surprisingly high, with more than half of all buyers remaining consistent users of the products. **********Nordic Track attempted to telephone 1,209 buyers who had owned its machines for five years. Of the 207 reached, 69 percent said they were still using the equipment, averaging three and a half workouts a week of 25 minutes each. **********Some say that boredom and flimsy low-priced machines threaten the industry's success. Steve Onder, general manager of the Sports Training Institute in Manhattan, a personal training and physical therapy center, said the most popular, lower-priced equipment \"doesn't support a long-term training program.\" A cheap treadmill does not have a motor capable of turning the belt fast enough for jogging, he said. **********Sebastian Di Casoli, director of marketing services for the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, says some buyers give up when they find the machines cannot exercise for them. \"A lot of people do it to relieve guilty feelings about their weight,\" he said. \"It does get boring and many machines end up in the closet.\" **********Some makers have found innovative ways of fending off boredom. The Precor 9.4sp treadmill, list price $4,500, can be set for 48 exercise programs in miles, 48 in kilometers, or programs of the owner's choosing. The Walking Center in Beverly Hills, Calif., has another way to make its dozen treadmills -- priced at $2,500 to $3,000, or $95 a month to use them in the showroom -- more inviting. Each is hooked up to a television with an earphone. The Outlook **********A Recession Might Even Help Sales **********Makers of exercise equipment insist that their sales will remain firm even as the nation's economy sags. In troubled times, consumers usually back away from major purchases. But exercise equipment is so new that few long-term records exist. \"Leisure-time goods do fairly well in a recession, but exercise equipment might be different,\" Mr. Di Casoli said. \"There is no data. On top of that, the items that are growing are the more expensive ones like treadmills and stair machines.\" **********Gary Stevenson, a founder and the chief operating officer of Weslo, says workout machine sales will increase as many families find they offer an economical way to sweat out a recession. \"People will drop vacations,\" he said. \"They will also tend to stop paying for health clubs, weight-loss centers. There is early evidence they will buy equipment for the home.\" **********Even the Middle East crisis may help, some say. As John Walsh, the exercise equipment buyer for Sears, said, \"Usually when times get tough, people will stay at home and more equipment will be sold. We saw this in the gasoline crises of the 1970's.\" **********Fitness industry executives say they also have demographics on their side. As the population ages, the demand for equipment can only increase, they say. Industry statistics show that 35- to 65-year-olds are the biggest buyers. They are usually secure in their occupation, have more money than the elderly or young, and are more resistant to a recession. **********For all their marketing and innovations, many makers of fitness equipment say their best sales device might be the mirror. As Phyllis Nwransky, public relations manager at the Weider Health and Fitness Corporation, put it, \"If we don't do something, we get fat and lazy and we look funny.\" A MUSCULAR MANUFACTURER **********FOR some entrepreneurs, helping others build muscles seemed like a good way to build wealth. Weslo Inc., one of the fastest-growing manufacturers of exercise equipment, entered the business to balance seasonal sales of wood stoves. **********In 1977, Scott Watterson and Gary Stevenson, students at Utah State University, after two years as Mormon missionaries in the Far East, began importing kitchenware and marble products to pay for their educations. Two years later, they added a third partner, Blaine Hancey Jr., to jump on a trend. In the midst of an energy crisis, their company bought the rights to Fire King wood stoves and developed a network of retailers, mostly in the West. **********Then the partners looked for something to sell in the spring and summer. They settled on trampolines. That business brought them to sporting goods trade shows. There, Mr. Stevenson says, \"We recognized that Americans were looking for a way to stay well.\" **********They began importing simple exercise cycles and then started making treadmills in Logan, Utah, where the company is based. They expanded to a full line of equipment, including elaborate home gyms. Weslo makes 70 to 80 percent of its products in Logan and the rest in Taiwan now. **********Weslo bought the rights to the Proform name in 1987, after Nike, the sneaker maker, abandoned exercise equipment. Weslo itself was bought in 1988 by the the Weider Health and Fitness Corporation, a maker of weights and food supplements and publisher of several fitness magazines. The company was founded by Joe Weider, a bodybuilder who helped train Arnold Schwarzenegger. **********Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Watterson, still in charge, continue to demonstrate agility as well as strength. Weslo has cultivated the big department stores so well that earlier this year, it was cited by Sears, Roebuck merchandise buyers for products that made outstanding contributions to the stores' sales. **********And Weslo is always updating its equipment. Its treadmills now offer computerized monitors for pulse, calorie consumption and equivalent distance. \"You need something motivational,\" Mr. Stevenson said. \" Feedback makes the task less mundane.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/10/business/time-unit-and-7-days-in-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Deirdre Carmody", "pub_date": "1990-05-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 327, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Time Unit and 7 Days in Deal", "print_headline": "Time Unit and 7 Days in Deal", "body_text": " **********Entertainment Weekly, the magazine begun in February by the Time Inc.

Hyatt Legal Services' Home Lawyer and WillMaker 4.0 can help with legal matters, while Make Your Paycheck Last helps people keep their spending within their income. **********All three programs are inexpensive, as software goes, easy to use and will speed up tasks that would take much more time using books, pencils, paper and calculators. But users of the legal programs should be ever mindful of what programmers call GIGO, for garbage in, garbage out. When in doubt about a point of law, it is best to consult a lawyer, not to take a stab at it and produce a legal-sounding document that could lead to trouble. **********WillMaker 4.0 for I.B.M. and compatible personal computers is available from retailers or directly from Nolo of Berkeley, Calif., (1-800-992-6656, or 1-800-445-6656 in California) for $55.95, which is 20 percent off the list price of $69.95. The Macintosh version will be out in August. **********To write a will, the user answers a series of questions on the computer screen, consulting the thorough reference manual that comes with the program if necessary. When the interview is finished, the program prints out a will. It can produce wills for either single or married people that are valid in all states except Louisiana. Among the features of WillMaker 4.0 are the abilities to make up to 28 specific bequests, set up trusts for minor beneficiaries in accord with the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act and transfer data to a word-processing file for custom formatting and printing. **********Hyatt Legal Services Home Lawyer, which lists at $99 and is widely available for $69, is based on the master documents of Hyatt Legal Services, the nation's largest general-practice law firm.

The original version of Home Lawyer was introduced in the spring in Egghead Discount Software stores, and an upgrade was released this month to many software stores. **********Home Lawyer also relies on an on-screen interview to put together and print out a variety of legal documents: wills (although with fewer specific bequests than WillMaker and a less detailed interview), various powers of attorney, revocation of power of attorney, residential lease, promissory note, bill of sale for motor vehicle, general bill of sale, employment agreement, independent contractor agreement and special letters for offer of employment, demand of money owed, bad check notice, defective product complaint and request for credit report. **********Three primary reasons for wills are to appoint an executor, to name guardians for minor children and to make specific bequests that would not be covered under a state's intestacy laws - for example, a book or painting that has sentimental value, money or jewelry to someone who would otherwise receive nothing or a bequest to a religious institution or charity. Each program will enable users to do these things, and in a test of each it was possible to load the program into the computer and produce a will in less than an hour. **********Each program advises people whose estates exceed $600,000 to go to a lawyer for estate planning, because estate taxes can be whittled down by using gifts and trusts. People whose personal situations are complex - say a partner in a business or someone who has been divorced and has children by the previous marriage - are also likely to need expert advice. **********Even those who find the will portion of Home Lawyer inadequate may find the program pays for itself by producing letters or documents in a minute or two. **********Steven Potash, president of Overdrive Systems, said, ''Our purpose is to save people a lot of time and expense.''

Sporn, a spokesman for Petroleos de Venezuela, the state oil company. **********From the neutral vantage point of a London office, Kim Fuad, an editor for the Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, described the fields here as ''a tremendous windfall for Venezuela.'' **********Up to 15 Billion Barrels **********''These finds are very big - 10 to 15 billion barrels,'' said Mr. Fuad, a Venezuela expert. ''That's more than half of United States proven reserves.'' **********Indirectly, the fields also represent a boon for the United States, which receives two-thirds of Venezuela's oil exports. United States oil production has been dropping in recent years, and during the 1990's imports are expected to increase by about 50 percent from their current level of 8.5 million barrels a day. **********With the threat of war enveloping the Middle East, Government officials here have started touting Venezuela - four days by oil tanker from the United States - as a ''friendly, safe source.'' **********''Here in the region, we potentially have the oil to meet any crisis,'' Carlos Andres Perez, the nation's President, said in an interview in Caracas recently. ''The United States can trust, always depend on, Venezuela as a safe supplier.'' **********Working Around the Clock **********To meet the expected increased demand, geologists and laborers are working around the clock on a crash program to increase production in 15 months to 500,000 barrels a day, from 300,000 barrels today. **********During the next 10 years, the production program is expected to change the mix of oil drilled in Venezuela, the Western Hemisphere's largest oil exporter. **********Venezuela has historically produced low-value high-sulfur heavy crude from the nation's western region. Today, about 70 percent of Venezuela's oil comes from this region, largely from around Lake Maracaibo. **********But with new discoveries around here, 70 percent of Venezuela's proven reserves are now in the east, with light and medium crude oil predominating. **********''The future of Venezuela's oil industry is going to be in the east,'' Mr. Sporn predicted, surveying a landscape where oil rigs broke a baking-hot monotony of cattle ranches and cornfields. **********An Important Difference **********By 1995, Venezuela's production is expected to be evenly split between heavy crude and the higher-value light and medium crude oils. For a country that last year relied on oil exports for 76 percent of its income, the difference is important: in recent months, higher-quality oil has sold for as much as $8 a barrel more than lower-quality oil. **********A quirk of history is helping the Venezuelans to put the fields into production quickly. Thanks to a legacy of 70 years of oil production here, oil pipelines and tank farms are already in place. **********The old wells started to run dry in the late 1960's, leading to two decades of economic stagnation in this state, Monagas, and in the neighboring state of Anzoategui. But in the late 1980's, new technology allowed the Venezuelan companies operating here, Lagaven and Corpoven, to pierce the old well threshold of 5,000 feet and to reach depths of 20,000 feet. **********High-resolution seismic surveys, aerogravimetric surveys, steam injection and three-dimensional computer models were among the new technologies that allowed Venezuelans to map out new, deeper fields here in the late 1980's. **********Although deep drilling is more expensive, the payoff has been greater. On the average, the deep wells here produce 7,000 barrels a day. By contrast, the average well in Venezuela produces 120 barrels a day. **********Today, the main obstacle to rapidly increasing production is a worldwide shortage of drilling rigs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/07/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-on-patrol-in-the-desert-marines-fight-boredom.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "1990-09-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 823, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Confrontation in the Gulf;   On Patrol in the Desert, Marines Fight Boredom", "print_headline": "Confrontation in the Gulf;   On Patrol in the Desert, Marines Fight Boredom", "body_text": " **********The water, produced from a desalting plant, has a strong chlorine aftertaste.

Kearney Inc., a Chicago consulting firm. \"Now they ask, 'Who is the best in the world?' \" **********Companies that have gone outside their industry to pick up tips often can document terrific savings. A couple of years ago, Motorola Inc.'s finance department began applying electronic data-transfer and other techniques it picked up from the First National Bank of Chicago's check clearing operations to its own operations for closing its books each month. Result: It took Motorola 8,000 fewer person-hours to audit the 1989 books than it did to audit those of 1986, despite a sales increase of more than 50 percent. **********\"Because we weren't dealing with a competitor, the information flow was free and easy,\" said William B. Smith Jr., vice president and senior quality assurance manager of Motorola's communications sector. **********INDEED, executives bent on benchmarking report that, as long as there are no proprietary secrets involved, companies are quite proud to show off their systems. **********L. L. Bean Inc., the catalog distribution company, has played host to myriad companies looking for tips on how to spruce up their distribution or warehousing operations. And when Bean decided it wanted to benchmark its succession planning and management development systems against companies with good human resources reputations, it visited Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, International Business Machines and Disney. A team of Bean managers recently returned from London, where they studied Marks & Spencer's inventory management systems. **********\"We're happy to share our information on distribution, and we've found that companies are happy to share information on the areas they're best at,\" said Austin H. Farrar, Bean's vice president of human resources. **********The information flows particularly freely when companies benchmark against their own customers. When American Express wanted to learn about self-directed work teams, it went to the General Electric Company. It sought guidance from Motorola on training. \"They're customers of ours and we're customers of theirs, and that makes it easier to exchange information,\" said James M. Li, chief quality and credit officer for American Express travel-related services.  THEN THERE'S SELF-CONTEMPLATION **********Before a company can compare itself to anyone else, it must take a long, hard look at its own operations. The Xerox Corporation has discovered that such self-scrutiny can be valuable in itself. **********One Xerox operation wanted to make its physical facilities more attractive to customers. Before looking at other companies' showrooms and reception areas, the benchmarking team checked out their own. **********To the team's horror, they discovered a junked car in the parking lot -- a car that had probably been giving a look of seediness to the place for some time. \"No one had ever noticed it, because no one had ever really bothered to look,\" said John E. Kelsch, Xerox's director of quality. **********Another Xerox operation realized that its state-of-the-art computer system for processing customers' orders was hidden away in the back office. \"They reorganized their office and put their computers where they could be spotted,\" Mr. Kelsch said. \"They say customers seem very impressed.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/11/business/time-warner-said-to-plan-venture.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 259, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Time Warner Said to Plan Venture", "print_headline": "Time Warner Said to Plan Venture", "body_text": " **********Time Warner Inc., the media, entertainment and publishing giant, is preparing to start a chain of some 100 entertainment stores in regional shopping centers on the order of the successful Disney Stores, retail and financial executives in New York said yesterday. **********Like the 50 Disney Stores, which sell merchandise using the famous Disney cartoon characters, the Time Warner stores are expected to sell toys, clothes, pictures and similar goods aimed at children with Bugs Bunny and other characters from the company's Looney Tunes cartoons. **********Retail sources said that Peter Starrett, who has been the president of the Lamston Plymouth stores owned by the Tribeca Company, New York, had been selected by Time Warner to head the new entertainment chain. **********Comment on the project could not be obtained from Time Warner's offices in Burbank, Calif.

Jiral, a Texas oil man, and five other Americans piled into two cars at 4 A.M. Wednesday and headed south out of Baghdad across the scorching desert, bound for the Iraqi-Jordanian border. **********''The airport was closed, and we didn't know when it would be open, so we decided to take a drive,'' Mr. Jiral said in a powerful understatement as he downed a frosty can of beer in a high-rise hotel here this afternoon. **********Mr. Jiral, who represents a Houston oilfield construction company, spent most of today on the telephone trying to arrange for transportation from the Jordanian border to here for a colleague in Iraq. He was unaware that with American troops landing in Saudi Arabia, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq was taking steps to prevent most other foreigners from leaving the country. **********With the air-conditioning turned up high and the color television flickering, Mr. Jiral said he had hardly noticed the 120-degree temperature in the deserts. **********''When you're from Texas,'' he said with a soft drawl, ''you don't notice a little heat.'' **********Hitching the Last 200 Miles **********Nearly running out of fuel a few miles short of the only gasoline station on the more than 600-mile-long ribbon of desolate highway, abandoning one of the cars because of blown-out tires and finally having to hitch a ride for the last 200 miles or so had been nothing much either, he said. **********The tall, graying Texan, who has worked in construction and oil field projects abroad for 25 years, said he never strongly considered himself in serious danger. **********But among the handful of Americans who made the dash across the desert on Wednesday, Mr. Jiral was the exception. United States officials estimate that 500 Americans have been stranded in Iraq, and 3,000 more in the tiny Persian Gulf state of Kuwait since last week, when the Iraqi Army invaded and took over Kuwait Precisely how many Americans made it out of Iraq is not clear. **********With telephone and telex lines cut since the invasion, increased signs of war preparations in Baghdad and shortwave radio news reports bringing updates of efforts by world powers to isolate President Hussein, ''it became clear that time was running out, that the window was closing,'' said John Norman, a banking consultant from Raleigh, N.C. He arrived here late Wednesday night, shortly after Mr. Jiral and his friends. **********Threat of Hostage-Taking **********''The concept of the potentiality of being a hostage was certainly there,'' said Pat Schenning of Alexandria, Va., another consultant who had been working with Mr. Norman to modernize Iraq's banking system. **********Mr. Schenning said he and three other banking consultants had planned to wait until Friday to see if the airport reopened, then make a run for it. **********The Americans and other foreigners had been grouped in several hotels according to nationality. At first some were told not to leave the hotels. But most were able to walk the streets as they liked. They say they were treated cordially, never threatened, never wanting for comfortable lodgings and food. Many relaxed in the hotel pools. **********But the group of consultants moved up their plans when they heard that American troops were on the way. **********Briefing From U.S. Diplomat **********Mr. Jiral listened to the senior American diplomat in Baghdad, Joseph Wilson, the charge d'affaires, as he told a group of Americans Tuesday night that Washington advised that they evacuate. But Mr. Jiral added that he could not say whether the borders were open and could not help with transportation. **********Mr. Wilson had been briefing the Americans daily, Mr. Jiral said, keeping them up to date on discussions with the Iraqi Government on how and when they might depart. Now, Mr. Jiral understood, the diplomat was saying he could offer no way out. **********''I gave it my best shot,'' Mr. Jiral and some other Americans quoted Mr. Wilson as saying in the briefing Tuesday night. **********That was it for Mr. Jiral. ''I said right then, I'm leaving tomorrow,'' the Texan said. **********Mr. Jiral and the other businessmen were traveling on visas that provided for automatic departure permission under normal times, and immigration officers at the border simply stamped their passports and waved them through. But Mr. Jiral said holders of resident visas were required to get specific permission to leave Iraq. **********No New Exit Visas **********No one was issuing exit visas this week in Iraq, and Mr. Jiral said many acquaintances were unwilling to take the long trip across the border only to be turned back. Others with visas like Mr. Jiral's, he said, decided that driving to the border was too risky. **********Frank Zurawel, a soft-drink machinery technician from Dix Hills, L.I., who was in Iraq repairing a broken 7-Up machine, said that at one point he was told by Government officials that he could not leave Baghdad because ''I wouldn't be able to get past the checkpoints.'' **********He finally threw in with Mr.Jiral, and they came across no checkpoints until they reached the border. **********''As a gentleman said to me, you cover as many bases as you can, and after that you tense your stomach and get on with it,'' Mr. Norman said.

Millions of people were wounded or driven from their homes. **********Iranian officials said secret and direct talks were held between the two nations over the last few weeks. **********They added that they viewed the Iraqi concessions as a direct result of the economic and military pressures on Baghdad after the invasion of Kuwait, including trade sanctions decreed by the United Nations Security Council, naval interdictions by American and other warships and a buildup of an multi-national force in Saudi Arabia. **********The Iraqi leader's conciliatory gesture to Teheran was announced over Iraqi radio and television. It promised the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from about 700 square miles of Iranian territory. It also called for the exchange of nearly 100,000 prisoners of war and an equal division of the Shatt al Arab estuary. **********Iraq Canceled Waterway Pact **********When the war broke out in 1980, Mr. Hussein canceled a 1975 agreement between the two countries to divide the waterway, which is Iraq's only outlet to the Persian Gulf. **********Since then, Iraq had insisted that it would ''never'' allow Iran sovereignty over any part of the waterway. Iraq also insisted that it would not allow an exchange of prisoners nor pull back from Iranian territory until Iran had conceded this point. **********The Iraqi leader said today that his troops would begin to withdraw from Iran on Friday and might start releasing prisoners of war even before reciprocal action by Iran. **********Iranian officials said the first high-level contact between the two countries started in April with a letter from President Hussein to President Rafsanjani. It was followed by several unannounced meetings and one public meeting between foreign ministers in Geneva in July. **********Shortly after that, Iran and Iraq cooperated in pressing other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise oil prices, just before the invasion of Kuwait. **********These events seemed to confirm suggestions by many Persian Gulf experts that the two countries have many common interests in areas like oil policy and opposition to the United States military presence in the gulf area. **********It was not clear whether Iran would be willing to take the kind of actions that could alleviate the growing international pressure on Iraq. Given the long border between Iran and Iraq, the worldwide embargo against Iraq could be thwarted if Teheran allowed its territory to become a transit route for Iraqi imports. **********The announcement by Iraq underlined Baghdad's eagerness to ease the pressure on its frontier with Iran so it could concentrate strength in response to the military buildup in Saudi Arabia. **********In announcing his offer today, President Hussein noted the Islamic heritage of both nations, even though his secular Baathist Government has harshly repressed the Islamic fundamentalist movement, Al Dawa al-Islamiya, which was allied with Iran, and executed scores of the movement's leaders. **********'Dear Brother' **********In his letter to President Rafsanjani, the Iraqi leader referred to the Iranian as ''Dear Brother.'' The letter said, in part: ''Everything has become clear and everthing you wanted and concentrated upon has been realized.'' **********The tone was a sharp change in Baghdad's attitude toward the Iranian Government. Over the last decade, the Iraqi press and broadcasting have repeatedly described the Iranian leaders, including Mr. Rafsanjani, as ''princes of darkness,'' ''Persian inferiors'' and ''imposters.'' **********In his message, President Hussein said he was looking forward to a peace treaty between the countries ''from an honorable position toward a new life in which cooperation prevails under the shadow of Islamic principles.'' **********In a move related to the gulf crisis, foreign embassies in Kuwait were ordered today to move to Baghdad. All Kuwaitis who served in the diplomatic service and their families have been taken to Baghdad and jailed. **********Many of the newest refugees from Kuwait in Saudi Arabia say the situation in Kuwait is deteriorating and that food is scarce. Nine Britons who arrived in Bahrain last night said that shooting was heard every night as Kuwaitis continued to wage hit-and-run raids on Iraqi positions. **********One of Syria's three vice presidents was reported today to be on his way to Teheran for consultations with the Iranian leadership. Syria, long a rival of Iraq, will probably try to persuade Teheran not to ease its pressure on Iraq. **********In the Iranian capital, Morteza Sarmadi, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, seemed pleased with the Iraqi offer to settle all remaining disputes, stressing that it represented significant concessions to Iran. **********Iran Hails Iraqi Offer **********TEHERAN, Iran, Aug. 15 (Reuters) - Iran hailed Iraq's acceptance of its terms for peace as the biggest victory since the 1979 Islamic revolution. **********It predicted a new era of ''lasting and just peace'' with Iraq after President Hussein announced that he was ready to accept a 1975 border treaty that he had renounced in 1980."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/26/business/earthly-risks-of-business-in-space.html": {"writer_name": "John Cushman", "pub_date": "1990-08-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1932, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Earthly Risks of Business in Space", "print_headline": "Earthly Risks of Business in Space", "body_text": " **********When the founders of Space Services Inc. built a rocket and named it the Conestoga, they had in mind an image of dogged determination in the face of daunting risk. They never intended their pioneering enterprise to be facing that risk in the financial desert just short of the next watering hole. **********But after spending 10 years and some $19 million seeking a profitable niche launching small satellites high into space for government and commercial customers, Space Services does seem to be swooping very low, or, indeed, about to crash. **********The story of the company's dramatic attempts to survive contain a number of important lessons for commercializing and exploring space in the decades to come. **********Space Services' major corporate investor has abandoned the venture. Its main individual investor has exhausted his resources. The company has almost no tangible assets, and its 26 employees have all been furloughed. New investors are needed, and quickly, but the search for them is not going well. **********Ironically, the company's crisis comes at the very moment when a strong market for launching small satellites is beginning to emerge. Analysts say a billion-dollar business has finally begun to coalesce and small satellites are, or will soon be, providing key data in a variety of fields - like television, cellular-phone communication, scientific research and to navigation for ships, planes or even trucks and taxis. **********The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Air Force both have competitions under way to purchase launching services from commercial enterprises for satellites weighing less than half a ton. And analysts say the market for small satellite launchings by private companies is about to blossom. **********For Space Services, the new business is arriving in the nick of abort-launch time, if not too late. Space Services recently delivered NASA nearly 500 pounds of documents detailing its bid to provide between 7 and 10 launchings on the Conestoga rocket, starting in 1992. This contract will be worth perhaps $100 million to the winning company. But on Friday, Space Services was unable to meet a contract deadline for the Air Force. **********Some of the Space Services employees are still coming to work, though without pay, to prepare a bid for yet another NASA contract. **********''It is day to day, hour to hour,'' said Donald K. (Deke) Slayton, the somewhat grizzled former astronaut who runs Space Services, from its modest headquarters suite on the outskirts of Houston. **********Before the 1980's, NASA handled all American satellite launchings, with rockets built for it by outside contractors. The satellite's owner, whether it was the Pentagon or a commercial concern, would pay NASA for the launching service. **********But the space agency gradually relinquished that role; private launching companies became even more important after the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986. **********There have been nine successful launchings handled by private American companies under license, and a total of 35 scheduled, including one by Space Services and several by Orbital Sciences, its main competitor in small-rocket launchings. **********The lion's share of the private launchings are handled by three makers of large rockets for heavy satellites: the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the General Dynamics Corporation and the Martin Marietta Corporation. But it was the tiny, unknown Space Services that established a number of crucial precedents for the industry. **********In 1982, Space Services became the first company to launch a satellite spending nothing but private funds; the payload was a test dummy, but it went into orbit. In 1985, Space Services was the first company to obtain a United States Government license to provide commercial launch services. In 1989, it was the first to conduct a licensed launch under contract, with two scientific payloads on suborbital flights. **********''Unfortunately, there is a saying in the venture-capital industry that pioneers end up with arrows in their backs,'' said David O. Wicks Jr., a Houston investor who is not involved in the company but specializes in the space industry. **********Ten years ago a handful of investors, led by a soft-spoken real estate developer named David Hanna, bet that a small enterprise could find a place in carrying small satellites into space. Mr. Hanna and his associates put a modest fortune, now totaling $12 million, into a company they called Space Services Inc. Mr. Hanna, the biggest investor, is chairman. Outer space was a new frontier, he believed, but big business and big government would only succeed in messing things up there. **********The Federal government appeared to endorse Mr. Hanna's philosophy, setting forth policies supporting it - like the decision, made after the Challenger explosion, that no more commercial satellites would be launched from NASA's shuttles. Nonetheless, business was slow to develop. **********Then the company got a new infusion of cash from Development Ventures Inc. of Houston. Since 1986, DVI has invested about $7 million, and it now owns 7 percent of the shares outright and owns warrants for another 75 percent, giving it effective control of the company. **********But Space Services never made a profit, and DVI has decided against any further investment. **********''We just reached the limits of how much we could invest in this kind of company,'' said Dan Bulla of Houston Industries. ''We still think there is a market there. We sincerely hope they can make it.'' **********Executives of Space Services are bitter about DVI's decision. They compare the venture capital group to a gambler who plays a slot machine only to leave the casino while the wheels are spill spinning. **********Space Services, they point out, spent about $1 million preparing its bid for the NASA contract that is now about to be awarded - a project that is expected to be worth perhaps 100 times that million in revenues to the winner. It will be impossible for Space Services to win that contract unless it can prove itself financially sound, which means finding a new investor. But that search is not easy. ''The typical venture capitalists are looking at their own formula,'' said Mr. Slayton. ''They are looking for fast paybacks and high multiples. And so far, there is nothing in space showing them that. Everything in space requires patient money.'' **********A Commerce Department study of five other companies seeking to become established in commercial space ventures found that all have faced the same financial obstacle - finding a strategic investor with enough money and patience - with varying degrees of success. **********The investment limits of venture capitalists are usually modest compared with the immense capital needs that typify the aerospace industry, the study found. They ''like to see the opportunity in a business plan to make five times their investment in three to five years,'' the study concluded. ''These are severe challenges for space-related projects.'' **********Both Mr. Hanna and Mr. Slayton, who has not invested in the company, say they want a new investor to buy out DVI's share in the company, but they have been unable to determine from DVI how much it would ask. **********There have been hard times before. The company's first attempted launching, in 1981, was a total failure. Mr. Slayton, who at the time was still working at NASA, says it was ''strictly a hobby shop type of thing.'' Their big mistake was using liquid fuel instead of more reliable solid rocket fuel. ''They blew the damn thing up,'' Mr. Slayton said. **********Undaunted, the company hired Mr. Slayton when he retired from NASA to try a second launch. Built from off-the-shelf parts supplied by Morton Thiokol and other aerospace companies, the first Conestoga rocket was launched successfully in 1982 from Matagorda Island in the Gulf of Mexico. **********The company had proved several things. It could raise enough private money to pay for a launch. It could manage a team of subcontractors. It could, eventually, obtain needed government approval - no minor accomplishment. **********The company did have its struggles with the Federal bureaucracy, but the difficulties eventually accomplished something else very important. **********According to people in the Government and the aerospace industry, Space Services demonstrated that the cumbersome process of getting approvals for launchings was standing in the way of an entire industry's development. As a result, the Government has now set up a much simpler licensing process at the new space office of the Department of Transportation. **********What Space Services had not yet demonstrated was that anybody wanted its services. There were fitful efforts to win contracts for launching earth-sensing satellites, navigation and so forth. There was one esoteric agreement in which the company would shoot cremated remains into orbit for funeral homes. **********Finally, last year, the company won a substantial, if modest commercial contract for a university consortium. Scientists successfully conducted more than 140 brief experiments in the weightlessness of the brief gravity-free flight. The contract was completed ahead of schedule within budget for a fixed price. **********A second launch for the consortium, operated by the University of Alabama, failed, however, when a gyroscope malfunctioned in flight. The payload was ejected in flight and parachuted safely back to earth. Space Services relaunched that payload successfully in May and plans to conduct a fourth launch. **********More than 30 other companies, universities or other institutions have now entered the field. Each has its technical strengths and weaknesses, and each must operate within its own peculiar financial straits. Whether they succeed remains a question. **********But if they do, it will be Space Services that blazed their trail, as surely as the wagon trains left wheel ruts for others to follow a century and a half ago. **********THE SMALL-SATELLITE MARKET **********Electronics companies find that more and more power can be put into small 1,000-pound satellites. As a result, 36 corporations, universities and other organizations are now working on small-satellite projects. **********Peter J. Armitage, a vice president of Space Services, says a market of between 30 and 60 orbital launches exists for small payloads over the next five years, and as many as 100 suborbital launches per year. **********Richard Scott, Washington representative of Motorola, said: ''You add all those up and you wind up with $1 billion of business that was not here a year ago.'' Motorola plans to shoot up a constellation of 77 satellites for worldwide cellular telephone communications by the mid-90's. **********Among the competitors is the Orbital Sciences Corporation.

Barro of Harvard University and Xavier Sala i Martin of Yale University, is that high interest rates are not bad for the economy. The even better news, say the two economists, is that the size of the Federal deficit doesn't matter. **********Two surprising conclusions. According to conventional wisdom, high rates limit growth, slow investment, put a brake on economic activity and can lead to a recession. Today's high rates have already led to protests by home builders, who have seen sales fall, and to rumors of a rift between the Bush Administration and the Federal Reserve over interest-rate policy. **********The conventional wisdom also says that when the Federal Government borrows to finance the deficit or bail out savings and loan institutions, it competes for scarce capital in the domestic markets and drives rates up. **********But if Professors Barro and Sala i Martin are right, the conventional wisdom is wrong. **********Professors Barro and Sala i Martin have constructed an ingenious model that uses economic and financial data from the 10 major industrialized countries going back as far as 1952. The model simulates the effect of business activity on interest rates, adjusted for inflation, through a series of elaborate equations. The two economists constructed a world index of interest rates for the 10 countries they studied. With their model, they say they can forecast future real interest rates, which are defined as nominal rates less inflation. **********The first conclusion from their continuing research, presented as a working paper, is that ''high real rates of interest reflect increased rather than diminished business opportunities,'' Professor Barro said. The conventional wisdom is that high rates slow business activity by making it more expensive to invest. **********Their second finding is that American rates are strongly influenced by business conditions in the other countries surveyed and not just by domestic factors like the savings rate and Government borrowing. Interest rates in the United States seem especially sensitive to what is going on in the world's stock markets. **********As the two scholars see things, the chain of logic runs as follows: good business conditions lead to higher stock market prices as investors looking for profit opportunities eagerly bid up stocks. And those higher prices suck in money from the rest of the economy. Interest rates go up as the demand for funds increases. **********And the process goes on beyond national borders. Opportunities in one country influence rates in the next. ''Rising stock markets abroad mean rising interest rates in the United States,'' Professor Barro said. ''We were quite excited when we found this out.'' The two economists forecast an average interest rate of 5.5 percent, adjusted for inflation, in most of the industrialized world this year, falling to 4.7 percent by mid-decade as growth slows. **********While Professors Barro and Sala i Martin generally see rising rates as a vigorous competition for investment funds and thus a sign of health, they concede that at some point high interest rates can choke off investment and lead to a recession. But that happens, Professor Barro said, ''when interest rates go up as a result of tight monetary policy.'' During the 1982 recession, for example, rates climbed ''because the Fed kept money tight.'' **********The two professors put little faith in low interest rates as a spur to growth. They say this should be clear from looking at recent events. In the 1970's, interest rates were very low because they were reflective of sluggish economic activity, a low stock market and little investment opportunity, they say. When rates picked up, later in the decade, it was because business activity also picked up. **********What these findings mean for policy makers is that it would be a mistake to conclude that rising rates are bad for growth. **********''Today's average real interest rate for the 10 countries we studied is the highest we have seen since the 1920's,'' Professor Barro said. But these high rates have been accompanied by a ''significant rise in investment in the 10 countries we studied, to levels not seen since the late 1960's. That's very bullish for growth.'' **********The model has been criticized because it is still only a preliminary effort and because it ''overstates how much economists really know about what moves interest rates,'' said Robert E. Lucas Jr., a professor of economics at the University of Chicago. ''Everyone knows that sometimes the stock and bond markets move in the same direction and that there appears to be a link,'' he said. ''But sometimes they don't.'' Professor Barro concedes that his efforts are still preliminary, but contends that the model has advanced economists' understanding of what moves rates. ''I'm going out on a limb, but I think we have found predictors of future rates,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/24/business/earnings-profits-fall-at-salomon-and-at-morgan-stanley.html": {"writer_name": "Leslie Wayne", "pub_date": "1990-10-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 762, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Profits Fall at Salomon And at Morgan Stanley", "print_headline": "EARNINGS; Profits Fall at Salomon And at Morgan Stanley", "body_text": " **********Third-quarter earnings fell at Salomon Inc. and at the Morgan Stanley Group.

At Morgan Stanley, a volatile trading environment helped offset a decline in investment banking and underwriting activity. **********Alex. Brown Inc., the holding company for the Baltimore brokerage firm Alex. Brown & Sons Inc., reported a loss for the quarter, in part because of losses on securities in its inventory, including a $2 million loss on shares in a company that it had underwritten. **********In more detail, the company reports follow. Salomon Inc. **********Salomon Inc. reported a 55.4 percent drop in net earnings, to $79 million, or 55 cents a share, compared with $177 million, or $1.28 a share, a year earlier. Revenues fell 1.9 percent, to $2.57 billion from $2.62 billion. **********This year's net includes a one-time pretax charge of $200 million for a restructuring of the company's Philipp Brothers commodities unit. Excluding this charge, Salomon earnings would have risen to $201 million, or $1.62 a share. **********Salomon's earnings were aided by what the company termed an \"exceptional\" third-quarter performance in its oil trading and refining business. Pretax earnings in this division were $369 million, up from $56 million in the 1989 third quarter. **********\"Their oil business was operating on all eight cylinders,\" said Dean Eberling, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers. \"What was most important for them was the volatility of the oil markets and the rapid rise in oil prices, especially in August.\" **********During this period, oil prices rose to a high of $40 a barrel, before falling to the current level of $28 a barrel. As a result of the sharp decline in oil prices over the last several days, analysts anticipate that the fourth-quarter earnings from this activity will not equal the strong third-quarter showing. **********Earnings in the company's securities segment, hurt by a fall-off in investment banking revenues and by reduced securities trading, were lower than they were in either the 1989 third quarter or the first two quarters of 1990. Pretax earnings from securities operations were $56 million, down from $231 million in the 1989 third quarter, $218 million in the 1990 first quarter and $211 million in the 1990 second quarter.  Morgan Stanley **********Market volatility -- this time in securities trading -- helped offset a slowdown in merchant banking and securities underwriting at Morgan Stanley. The company reported a 28.9 percent slide in net income, to $71.9 million, or $1.82 a share, from $101.1 million, or $2.54 a share, in the third quarter of 1989. Revenues rose 1 percent, to $588 million from $582.4 million. **********The company reported increased trading revenues, to $245 million, from $188 million in the 1989 third quarter. High volatility in the bond, equity and foreign currency markets enabled the firm the make trading profits. **********\"Their trading results were quite impressive, especially in fixed income and non-U.S.-dollar securities,\" said James Hanbury, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Company. \"But they've been affected by a slowdown in merchant banking and investment banking activities, and their trading business was good enough to offset some of that, but not all of it.\" **********Investment banking revenues slipped to $176 million, from $192 million for the 1989 third quarter. **********\"Morgan Stanley's performance in the third quarter reflects an absence of merchant banking investment revenues as well as a decline in investment banking activity,\" the company said in a prepared statement. \"Revenues from global sales and trading of fixed income products were significantly higher, while our financial results also benefited from strong performances in foreign exchange, commodities and equity trading.\" Alex. Brown **********Alex. Brown reported a loss of $3.1 million in the third quarter, in contrast to earnings of $6.3 million, or 38 cents a share, in the 1989 third quarter. Revenues fell 27.1 percent, to $58 million from $79.6 million. **********Donald B. Hebb Jr., the firm's president, said there had been a slowdown in the pace of the securities business because of \"concerns about war in the Middle East and a recession at home.\" **********The firm was particularly hurt by several losses in securities held in inventory. Among these was a $2 million loss from its holding of shares in In-Store Advertising Inc., a company that Alex. Brown & Sons had previously underwritten.

Is the Camden issue, as its defenders say, an ingenious innovation that can help hard-pressed communities ease their debt-service costs? Or is it, as some critics charge, a deal that creeps so close to the edge of Federal tax rules that it will bring a backlash of new regulations from Washington? **********The legal debate comes down to this: How much interest income is the Camden authority permitted to earn on the revenues that it will free up as a result of having refinanced its pre-existing debt? **********Just as homeowners may take advantage of lower interest rates to refinance their mortgages and cut their monthly payments, the authority is trying to reduce its debt service costs by selling $115.8 million in new bonds, called the 1990A Series, and setting the money aside to pay debt service on older, more expensive bonds sold in 1987. (In addition, it has raised $121.7 million in 1990B Series bonds to replace some short-term notes, a straightforward transaction of little interest to bond lawyers.) There is no dispute over how much interest the authority can earn on the money it is setting aside to service its earlier debt. Washington has stringent rules to prevent municipalities from reaping arbitrage profits by raising money at low tax-exempt rates and investing it at higher rates. Under these anti-arbitrage rules, an agency that sells 7 percent municipal bonds today cannot earn more than 7 percent interest on those escrowed funds. Doing otherwise could endanger the bonds' tax-exempt status. **********But in the Camden issue, designed by investment bankers at Butcher & Singer in Philadelphia and First Fidelity Bank in Newark the authority has sold zero-coupon bonds that require no debt service at all until 1998. (Zero-coupon bonds pay no annual interest, but are sold at prices substantially below their face value, so that the investor profits from the difference between the purchase price and the final maturity value.) As required, the authority will invest the 1990A Series proceeds in an escrow account - let's call it Account A - with a yield matching that on the newly sold bonds. It will use that fund to pay the debt service on the old 1987 bonds for the next seven years. **********But - and this is the ''but'' that worries some lawyers - the authority also plans to deposit all the general sewer-system revenues it otherwise would have spent to pay debt service on the 1987 bonds into a new investment fund - call it Account B. And the money in Account B is invested at a yield higher than that on the 1990A bonds. **********Come 1997, the first date on which the old 1987 bonds can be redeemed, the authority has the option of using Account B to pay off those bonds or to build part of its still-incomplete sewer system. Is the arrangement a good one? George Tuttle, the First Fidelity investment banker who worked with Butcher & Singer on the deal, defends it as ''an efficient structure that saves the authority $9 million. The way you handle the tax issues is to make sure you have the highest quality legal advice, and that's what we did.'' **********But the normally polite bond counsel community, the lawyers who review municipal bonds to insure that they qualify as tax-exempt investments, is deeply divided on the question. ''We have put in enough controls to satisfy us and, I think, to satisfy others,'' said Matthew Lewin, a partner at Chapman & Cutler, in Chicago, which has reviewed and approved the Camden structure. ''But, yes, there are a significant number who would not share our opinion.'' **********Underwriters at a few large Wall Street firms report privately that their own bond lawyers have doubts about the approach, , which Mr. Lewin attributed to their unfamiliarity with the specifics of the deal. **********The complex refinancing approach and the exclusive reliance on zero-coupon bonds make the Camden issue ''the kind of deal that investment bankers will put into their files for future reference,'' said Kurt van Kuller, a managing director of Lebenthal & Company in New York. But his own impressions? ''Well, frankly,'' he said, ''it seems very squirrely to me.'' **********In his view, the authority's Account B bears a strong resemblance to invested sinking funds, a once-popular bond financing technique that fell into disuse when the Federal rules against excess arbitrage were strengthened in 1978. **********''The lawyer says that this does not have the 'excess arbitrage' features of invested sinking funds,'' said Mr. van Kuller. ''But if I were a large institutional investor, I'd have a legal staff on retainer working with me to check into these issues. . . . and that's expensive.'' **********But the real cost of this financial innovation goes far beyond legal fees, warned Sam Katz, the co-chief executive at Public Financial Management in Philadelphia, a large public finance advisory firm. ''We're entering a period when the Congress and the Internal Revenue Service seem inclined to correct some of the public finance problems caused by their past overzealousness,'' Mr. Katz said. ''When people push the envelope to the very limit, it portrays our industry as one that is unprepared to live within the rules.'' And that, he said, ultimately could saddle all public borrowers with new rules that would make it more cumbersome and expensive for everyone to finance essential public projects. **********Despite these worries, the Camden deal has come to market at a time when zero-coupon bonds are both extremely scarce and increasingly popular among people planning for retirement, say, or college tuition bills. **********But Mr. van Kuller said he would not be surprised if, given the questions surrounding the structure, the price on the bonds dropped a bit to produce a higher yield for buyers. ''The market doesn't always solve these problems,'' he said. ''But it always adjusts to them.'' **********DESPITE CORPORATE PROGRESS, A STOCK STILL SLEEPS **********The stock market, jittery about the ''junk bond'' market and all the companies that borrow there, paid little attention last week when the Kroger Company announced that it had ended 1989 with less debt and lower interest rates. Kroger's stock closed the week up just a few cents, at $13.50. **********At that price, the stock looks like a bargain to some analysts. Charles E. Cerankosky of Prescott Ball & Turben in Cleveland notes that the company's improved financial prospects are already reflected in the prices of its junk bonds. ''Obviously the bond market sees an excellent investment here,'' he said. **********Edward Comeau, a food industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Company, said the stock's problem is probably rooted in the market's current intolerance for debt. Given that mood, and tighter food industry margins this year, he is not recommending the shares right now. But, he said, patient investors could find that the shares have ''good upside potential.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/03/world/iraqi-invasion-invading-iraqis-seize-kuwait-its-oil-us-condemns-attack-urges.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1950, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Iraqi Invasion;   INVADING IRAQIS SEIZE KUWAIT AND ITS OIL; U.S. CONDEMNS ATTACK, URGES UNITED ACTION", "print_headline": "The Iraqi Invasion;   INVADING IRAQIS SEIZE KUWAIT AND ITS OIL; U.S. CONDEMNS ATTACK, URGES UNITED ACTION", "body_text": " **********Iraqi troops stormed into the desert sheikdom of Kuwait today, seizing control of its capital city and its rich oilfields, driving its ruler into exile, plunging the strategic Persian Gulf region into crisis and sending tremors of anxiety around the world. **********President Bush condemned the invasion as ''naked aggression'' and sought to enlist world leaders in collective action against Iraq. **********Faced with a dire threat from the truculent Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, to a region containing much of the world's oil reserves and with world financial markets in turmoil, Mr. Bush banned nearly all imports from Iraq and froze the nation's assets in the United States. At a news conference in Woody Creek, Colo., the President and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain raised the possibility of economic or even military action by the United Nations. **********Iraq Suspends Payments **********In response, Iraq, which had been accusing Kuwait for weeks of stealing its oil and violating production limits set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, suspended debt payments to the United States. Western experts asserted that Iraq had been motivated by a financial squeeze that only more oil dollars could ease and by ambitions for regional dominance. **********Although oil prices rose sharply today, analysts noted that world inventories are unusually high, and they saw no immediate threat to supplies. **********Witnesses in Kuwait said that hundreds of people were killed or wounded today as Iraqi ground forces, led by columns of tanks, surged into the desert emirate at the head of the gulf. Other troops came by air. **********For Mr. Bush, the invasion posed manifold problems: the difficulty of direct military action despite the huge commitment of money and resources to the gulf in recent years; fear of another surge in oil prices, which could hurt economic growth and rekindle inflation; the potential disruption of the fragile budget negotiations between the White House and the Congress, in which a gasoline tax has been considered, and possible damage to the Republican Party in elections this fall. **********Reuters reported that the Kuwaiti forces continued to resist tonight in at least one area of the capital, at the main military barracks. Earlier reports spoke of explosions and gunfire echoing around the steel-and-glass skyscrapers of the city center in fierce fighting at dawn. But the Iraqi Army, the most powerful in the Arab world, vastly outnumbered the Kuwaiti forces, and 12 hours after the invasion began the Iraqis were reported in control of the airport, central bank and all key government buildings. **********The State Department reported that Iraqi troops had taken six American oilfield workers into custody near the Kuwait-Iraq border. Officials said their whereabouts were unknown. **********The President said he could not confirm that Americans had been seized, but that if it were true, ''it would affect me in a very dramatic way because I view as a fundamental responsibility of my Presidency protecting American citizens.'' **********Mr. Bush said this morning that American military intervention was not under active consideration, but Lieut. Gen. Howard Graves of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, traveling in Mongolia with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, said the United States was considering ''political, military or economic moves'' against Iraq. And after flying west to meet Mrs. Thatcher and deliver a speech at the Aspen Institute, the President said, ''We're not ruling any options in but we're not ruling any options out.'' **********Warships Head Toward Gulf **********An American naval task force, headed by the carrier Independence with 60 fighters and bombers, sailed from the Indian Ocean toward the mouth of the Persian Gulf in a show of strength. The Kuwaiti Ambassador in Washington, a close relative of the Emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who is now in Saudi Arabia, pleaded for immediate American military intervention. **********At the United Nations, the Security Council issued a unanimous call for an Iraqi withdrawal despite Iraqi assertions, brushed aside by virtually all nations, that Baghdad had been asked to send troops into Kuwait by rebel elements there and that Iraqi forces would be withdrawn from Kuwait within a few weeks. **********Mrs. Thatcher called Mr. Hussein's behavior ''intolerable'' and said that ''a collective and effective will of the nations belonging to the U.N.'' was needed. **********United States and British officials referred to Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, which permits the Security Council to use economic sanctions or military action against any nation that threatens the peace. **********Such action was always difficult to take during the cold war because it was very rare to find all five permanent members of the Security Council in agreement on any major dispute. **********Soviet Shipments Suspended **********But the Soviet Union, a principal arms supplier to Iraq, immediately suspended its military shipments to that country, and the United States and the Soviet Union planned a joint statement on Friday after Mr. Baker arrives in Moscow. He hurriedly changed his travel plans after receiving news of the invasion. **********Still there seemed to be little practical action that anyone could take in the days immediately ahead to reverse the Iraqi conquest. If Baghdad absorbs Kuwait or sets up a compliant government there, the oil reserves under Iraqi control will be doubled to about 195 billion barrels, making it second only to Saudi Arabia, which has 255 billion barrels. **********The invasion appeared to have the potential to shift not only the economic but also the military and political balance in the region. **********Moving swiftly today to endorse the President's actions against Iraq, the House voted 416 to 0 to impose trade sanctions and to cut off Export-Import Bank credits. **********The Senate unanimously approved a resolution calling for multilateral actions ''involving air, sea and land forces'' under the United Nations charter to restore international peace and security to the region. **********Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called Mr. Hussein ''the Hitler of the Middle East'' and criticized Mr. Bush for not having moved earlier to forestall an invasion. Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, an influential member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, complained that there had been ''a kind of inertia'' to American policy toward Iraq in recent weeks. **********Fears Over Saudi Arabia **********Several lawmakers suggested that Mr. Hussein might now be emboldened to move into neighboring Saudi Arabia. Senator David Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, who was briefed by the Central Intelligence Agency this morning, noted that the primary Saudi oilfields are only 250 miles from Kuwait, with no terrain ''that would impede a rapid movement of forces'' by Iraq. **********''We have to understand that our national interests are very much at stake,'' Mr. Boren said. ''I think it would be wrong to underestimate the ultimate aims of Saddam Hussein. He really hopes in the long run to put Iraq on a par with the kind of power he sees the Western powers as having.'' **********Judith Kipper, a Middle East specialist at the Brookings Institution, described the conflict in Kuwait as ''a war of resources.'' **********''This is the first post-cold-war crisis in the economically dependent world,'' she said. ''With the end of the East-West game, small countries can act with impunity to rearrange the neighborhood. Iraq is a superpower in its own area, but they need cash to service their debt and rebuild their oil industry. He gets cash from oil; oil prices are going up. Plus, they have historic claims to Kuwait, which Saddam Hussein has chosen to act upon.'' **********Gary Sick, a Middle East expert in the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations who now teaches at Columbia University, said that condemnations by nations around the world would have ''no effect at all.'' **********''Saddam Hussein obviously expected that when he did it,'' Mr. Sick said. ''He can't be surprised by the reaction, and he obviously discounted that in advance. Some tangible steps will have to be taken if in fact Saddam Hussein is to be persuaded that this didn't work out to his benefit.'' **********Washington Is Galvanized **********The news of the invasion galvanized Washington on Wednesday night and this morning. **********Mr. Bush was told of the invasion at 9 P.M. on Wednesday in the residential quarters of the White House, officials said, and was awakened from time to time during the night for briefings by his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft. He signed his orders on Iraqi assets and trade at 5 A.M., they said. **********At 8 this morning, the President met at length with his senior advisers, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Colin L. Powell. **********Michael J. Boskin, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, said that if oil prices rose 25 percent, and he seemed to consider this plausible, it would have ''some deleterious effect on our economy.'' **********Such a rise in prices would slow growth slightly, he said, but not enough to produce a recession. Growth, though meager, is still running at slightly more than 1 percent. **********Later the Department of Energy said the turmoil in the Middle East posed ''no immediate threat'' to American supplies of petroleum products. It estimated that in January to May of this year, Iraq supplied 8 percent of United States oil imports, about 3.6 percent of total United States demand. For Kuwait, the department said, the comparable figures were much smaller -just over 1 percent and less than one-half of 1 percent. **********The Energy Secretary, James D. Watkins, said that crude oil stocks in the United States stood at near-record levels and that world inventories were also unusually high at the moment. This country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a statement by the department said, could offset the amount of oil the United States has been importing from both Iraq and Kuwait - about 730,000 barrels a day - for more than 800 days. **********Crude Oil Prices Rise **********Still, crude oil prices shot up to more than $23 a barrel, and some economists said that gasoline prices would rise by at least a nickel a gallon within a week. **********Recalling the Arab oil embargo of the 1970's that forced millions of Americans to wait in long lines, analysts noted that the United States is more dependent on Middle East oil now than it was then. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents United States oil companies, spoke recently of a ''potentially ominous'' trend that has brought oil imports to nearly half of total American consumption. **********Mediation Efforts Collapse **********Arab mediation efforts to head off the crisis broke down Wednesday with the collapse of talks between Iran and Kuwait in the Saudi Arabian port of Jidda on the Red Sea. Mr. Bush said tonight, after talking by phone with a number of Arab leaders, that he was hopeful of a new regional initiative, but there were no reports of concrete plans to bring the two sides together. **********Only a few hours after the collapse of the talks, Iraqi armor, led by more than 350 main battle tanks, began racing across the 80-odd miles of desert that separate Kuwait City, a modern enclave on the gulf, from the frontier. It took the Iraqi forces, using weapons supplied largely by the Soviet Union, France and China, little time to overwhelm the Kuwaiti defenders."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/07/business/a-craze-may-outsprint-its-creator.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1208, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Craze May Outsprint Its Creator", "print_headline": "A Craze May Outsprint Its Creator", "body_text": " **********Rollerblade Inc., a tiny company based near Minneapolis that brought out a roller skate with a single row of wheels, has spawned a sport called blading that in the last three years has become something of a national craze. **********But holding onto the industry lead may be more difficult than pioneering the in-line roller skate, illustrating the hazards of developing a product that is so easy to copy. **********Rollerblade, which introduced the first in-line skate in 1980, has an estimated 66 percent of a market that is expected to top $50 million this year - almost as big as the conventional roller skate business. But growing competition and Rollerblade's recent inability to supply a surge in demand may undermine its lead. Since 1986, eight companies have come out with in-line skates, including established roller- and ice-skate makers like Roller Derby, Bauer and Riedell. **********Although they generally cost twice as much as conventional roller skates, in-line skates - which range in price from $79 for regular models to $399 for a racing skate - are popular because they are faster than conventional models and provide skaters with a better aerobic workout, requiring the use of more muscles. And they are also more difficult to master. **********Rollerblade gave competitors an opening into the market early this year, when it kept some store owners waiting as long as several months for shipments because it was unable to fill demand. ''Six months ago, the competition did not exist, and the name Rollerblade was like magic,'' said Lee Cole, owner of Skates on Haight, a San Francisco-based retailer of skating equipment. ''But not anymore.'' **********John Sundet, Rollerblade's president, says the company has remedied the problem and is now only four weeks behind in deliveries. It has installed a new computer system to help track inventories and has added a third shift, doubling its work force to 140 people at its assembly plant in Eden Prairie, Minn., a Minneapolis suburb where it also has its headquarters. The plant now operates around the clock, producing 3,000 to 4,000 skates a day. **********Mr. Sundet estimates that Rollerblade can sell 400,000 pairs of skates by the end of the year, up from 140,000 last year. Since it is privately held, Rollerblade does not release sales figures. But Randy Geise of Geise Design Associates, a marketing research firm in Minneapolis, estimates that its sales were about $15 million last year and expects them to reach about $35 million this year. **********The company was founded in 1980 by Scott Olson, a 20-year-old hockey player with the Winnipeg Jets' farm teams in the Midwest. He envisioned a roller skate with the action of an ice skate that hockey players and skiers could use to train off-season. He found an 18th-century design for a model that he planned to re-create with modern materials. **********Left to Languish **********But after he discovered a similar in-line skate already on the market, he bought the patent from the manufacturer, the Chicago Roller Skate Company, which had let the product languish. He and his brother Brennan perfected the design, using a plastic-molded ski-type boot atop a blade of polyurethane wheels. In 1980, they started selling the skates door-to-door to sporting goods stores, and to athletes and Scott's teammates. **********Sales were just a trickle. ''We went knocking on doors, and people were laughing in our faces,'' said Brennan, who is now 27 years old and the director of research and development at Rollerblade. **********Short on money, Mr. Olson was forced to sell 94 percent of the company in 1984 for an undisclosed price to Robert Naegele Jr., a Minneapolis advertising entrepreneur who owns a billboard company. **********A Power Struggle **********Mr. Olson resigned as president in December 1985 in what he characterizes as a power struggle with his new boss. ''Bob Naegele came in originally to help fund the company, and then he took control of it,'' said Mr. Olson, 31, who has since introduced a competing skate called Switchit that accommodates either wheels or an ice-skating blade. **********After the president brought in by Mr. Naegele resigned in 1987, Mr. Sundet, chief financial officer of the company since 1986, became president. A former director of finance at the Tonka Corporation, he set out to broaden the company's reach. **********''Our main buyers were hockey players, who were 95 percent male and between 18 and 25 years old,'' he said. ''We changed to the mainstream and targeted 18- to 35-year-old males and females. That is when our sales improved.'' **********But as sales picked up in 1987 so did the competition. First Team Sports Inc., also in Minneapolis, started manufacturing its Ultra-wheels brand skates in April 1986, bringing out the first line for children. The patent expired in 1985. **********Much Competition **********David Soderquist, president of First Team Sports and a former sales representative for Rollerblade, said he expects to sell 225,000 pairs of skates this year. **********The Roller Derby Skate Corporation in Litchfield, Ill., a manufacturer of standard roller skates since 1936, produces a skate that appeals to skaters who are accustomed to the toe-stopper design of conventional roller skates. Most in-line skates have a rubber stopper on the heel. **********The ice skate manufacturer Bauer, a subsidiary of Canstar Sports U.S.A., entered the market this year with a skate, which has a boot of leather rather than plastic. **********On the defensive, Rollerblade has taken legal action against several competitors. It sued First Team Sports and its two founders, both former Rollerblade employees, for misappropriating trade secrets and copying the company's sales promotions. First Team paid Rollerblade $10,000 in an out-of-court settlement. **********Rollerblade has also sued Bauer and Mr. Olson's Innovative Sport Systems Inc. for using brand names that resemble its own. **********Celebrity Promotions **********The competitive battle is also heating up outside the courtroom, with a rush by companies to sign up celebrity promoters. First Team Sports recently signed Wayne Gretzky, the Los Angeles Kings hockey star, and his wife, Janet Jones Gretzky, to a four-year contract to promote its skate. **********And competitors are moving into new retail markets like discount chains and department stores. Rollerblade recently expanded into Macy's and Nordstrom. **********All manufacturers are also trying to develop a skate that is lighter, safer and more comfortable. **********''We have been pioneers and continue to maintan an edge,'' Mr. Sundet said. ''You only get one shot at pioneering a new sport, and that's exciting.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/11/business/patents-getting-the-smoke-out-of-a-building-on-fire.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1990-08-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 199, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents;   Getting the Smoke Out Of a Building on Fire", "print_headline": "Patents;   Getting the Smoke Out Of a Building on Fire", "body_text": " **********A retired engineer who supervised much of the design and construction of San Francisco's subway system during the 1970's has drawn on that experience to invent an emergency ventilation system to remove smoke from burning buildings. **********The system, invented by Wilmot McCutchen of Orinda, Calif., works like a giant vacuum cleaner.

Had the Campeau divisions missed the payments, their remaining suppliers would have cut off shipments and could have forced the companies to file for bankruptcy protection. **********Cash From Holiday Sales **********The decision to pay the bills with cash raised during the recent holiday season followed an apparent change of heart by some of Campeau's largest banks and creditors. They had previously opposed such payments, saying they would prefer that Campeau preserve its cash, file for bankruptcy and begin a reorganization of the company. **********But yesterday some creditors said they had decided the suppliers should be paid because the department stores, which are the collateral for the banks' loans, need merchandise if they are to remain valuable assets. **********''The key is restoring stability to the situation, so that the trade is confident enough to continue shipping merchandise,'' said an executive at one of the banks that hold Campeau's debt. He said the creditors wanted customers to ''go back to thinking about the merchandise rather than reading the business news.'' **********Sought an Extension **********Earlier this week, Campeau executives had asked suppliers for an extension on the $100 million in payments due yesterday. While it was not clear how all the suppliers had responded, a number of them said publicly that they had rejected the request. **********Executives at some large fashion houses said they were pleasantly surprised when Campeau notified them that they would be paid. But some said they were convinced the stores would still file for bankruptcy protection in the next several days. [Page D8.]  The day's developments revived the hopes of some participants in the negotiations between Campeau and its banks that the company might be able to struggle through without resorting to a bankruptcy court. **********As a practical matter all the parties to the recent discussions have been preparing for a bankruptcy filing at any moment. **********People involved in determining the company's fate said Campeau had arranged for a $300 million line of credit with Chemical Bank that would be used if the company entered bankruptcy. That money could be used to pay the most pressing bills, enabling the company to keep operating. **********Arranging such a commitment is often one of a company's final steps before entering bankruptcy. **********Campeau faces another deadline on Monday, when Allied and Federated must assure a syndicate of American and Japanese banks led by Citibank that they are solvent. If they do not, the loans could be declared in default, which would force Campeau to file for bankruptcy protection. **********A banker at one member of the Citibank syndicate said the banks had been urging Campeau to announce a plan describing how it would deal with its crushing debt load of more than $7 billion. **********Campeau incurred those obligations to buy Federated, for $6.6 billion in 1988, and Allied, for which it paid $3.6 billion in 1986. Federated alone is facing interest payments of more than $100 million by February, and it has acknowledged that it is likely to face cash shortages in the next two weeks. **********Facing the Monday deadline, Campeau's directors met yesterday for a third straight day in Toronto, where the company has its headquarters. No details of the talks were disclosed, and another meeting was scheduled for today. **********''It remains a very fluid situation,'' said a lawyer who is being kept apprised of the Toronto meeting. ''What everyone is waiting for is a sign of who is taking charge of the situation. The lenders, in particular, want a sense that someone is home.'' **********Struggle on the Board **********The three largest shareholders of Campeau, all of which have seats on the company's 12-man board, are the company's founder and chairman, Robert Campeau; the National Bank of Canada, which last week received 29 percent of the company's stock after Mr. Campeau defaulted on a loan, and the three Reichmann brothers, whose family controls one of the world's largest real estate empires, Olympia & York Development Ltd. **********No clear signal has been given to the company's creditors, employees, customers or Wall Street about which group, if any, is dominating the board's deliberations. But it is widely perceived that Mr. Campeau is no longer in control. **********Late in the afternoon Campeau said its chief financial officer, Russell S. Davis, had resigned. **********Mr. Davis, 54 years old, had been Mr. Campeau's financial adviser since the acquisition of Federated in the spring of 1988. He had been at Federated since 1984 and is highly regarded in the retailing industry. **********The company gave no details about why he had left and Mr. Davis was said not to be in his office. Campeau immediately named Chance Bahadur, an executive of the Marriott Corporation, as executive vice president and chief financial officer. **********News From Headquarters **********The news that payments were being made to suppliers came from the Cincinnati headquarters of Federated and Allied. Those two Campeau divisions also own Burdines and Maas/Jordan Marsh in Florida; The Bon Marche in Seattle; Rich's/Goldsmith's in Atlanta; Lazarus in Cincinnati, and Stern's in New Jersey. **********Callers to the Cincinnati headquarters heard a tape recording that said, ''The company's only comment is that it is processing checks in the normal course of business.'' **********Some suppliers are paid by the electronic transfer of money to their bank accounts from the retailer's banks. Others are paid by checks. **********Many suppliers expressed nervousness that they might not receive their checks before a bankruptcy filing or that the checks would not clear before such a time. If the checks did not clear, suppliers' payments could be delayed until bankruptcy proceedings were under way. **********Should the stores file for bankruptcy protection, they would remain open. But what merchandise they would have available in coming weeks would depend on what arrangements they could make with suppliers. **********Special Financing **********The $300 million line of credit from Chemical Bank is known as a debtor-in-possession financing. It is a critical element of any Chapter 11 proceeding and is a relatively low-risk loan for the lender. **********The loan would be backed by assets of the company; if those fail to cover a default, the lender would have a priority in a bankruptcy proceeding. **********The statute protecting a lender of such financing is intended to encourage credit to assure the short-term viability of the company in bankruptcy. But it has also proved to be highly lucrative to lenders, and Chemical has become a leader in making such loans. **********Typically, the lender charges a special fee that is negotiable on top of ordinary interest and the bank's expenses. In addition, such lenders also get a commitment fee for any amount of the credit line that goes unused."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/12/world/mandela-is-reported-ailing-and-is-hospitalized-in-kenya.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mandela Is Reported Ailing And Is Hospitalized in Kenya", "print_headline": "Mandela Is Reported Ailing And Is Hospitalized in Kenya", "body_text": " **********Nelson Mandela, reportedly suffering from pneumonia, arrived in Nairobi today and was said to have been admitted to a hospital. **********The anti-apartheid leader was diagnosed as having a slight case of pneumonia and was flown from Ethiopia for treatment, according to The Star newspaper of Johannesburg.

Under the Communist Government that was overthrown last autumn, Ermlitz and its neighbors were condemned to be bulldozed, adding to the open-face strip mines that mar the countryside that long ago was Aue, too. **********Environment Not an Issue **********Still, with the country's first free parliamentary elections only six days off, the ecological life or death of the villages is not an issue. To the disappointment of environmentalists, the people of this area, like those throughout this country of 16 million, seem transfixed by one issue: How soon can they become as prosperous as West Germany? **********''Our system of values has totally collapsed,'' said Andreas Rattunde, an elementary school teacher in the nearby town of Schkeuditz, one of a handful of local members of the new Green Party, whose chief concern is the environment. **********This region, dominated by the cities of Leipzig and Halle, is widely regarded as East Germany's environmental disaster area and one of the worst such areas of the entire Continent. Yet the Green Party and the Green League, another environmental grouping, have failed to find a following that would make their views count in the voting. **********In the Halle area lie the large chemical concerns of Leuna and Buna, each employing 20,000 to 30,000 workers. They and smaller enterprises have filled the air, soil and water of the region with so many toxic substances that medical statisticians have calculated the life expectancy of this densely populated region at five years less than the national average of 73. **********The Rev. Eduard Kindler, pastor of the medieval evangelical cathedral in Merseburg, quoted Ulrich Klose, a leader of the West German Social Democrats, as saying during an election speech in that stately town that by West German law the entire region would have to be evacuated as unlivable. **********Reminders of the Hazards **********Mr. Kindler said the exaggeration was only slight. But he agreed with most people interviewed during two days in this area that environmental concerns were not a major election issue. He said his parishioners were aware of the hazards by the prevalence of chronic irritations of the respiratory system and mucous membrane, as well as skin eruptions, and of pale children with runny noses. **********Parts of Merseburg, as well as other towns and villages, are permanently covered by a white chemical dust, and a sour smell fills people's nostrils. **********Public awareness has been heightened recently because the fall of the Government of Erich Honecker has removed the taboo that had forbidden any public discussion of the ecological blight and its effects on health. Virtually all of the two dozen or so parties and movements that are presenting candidates in Sunday's voting are paying at least lip service to the environment. **********But no ordinary voter addressed at random volunteered a belief that environmental problems were an issue. **********Mr. Kindler said it was not only the overwhelming weight of what he called ''the German question'' - the wish for speedy reunification - that made the environmentalists' campaign so ineffective. **********Fear That Jobs Will Vanish **********''The people are in a deep dilemma,'' he said. ''They know that Leuna and Buna are obsolete compared to West Germany's chemical industry. This region is terribly afraid that for economic reasons alone 50,000 jobs here are endangered. They don't like to think about the ecological problems that could also mean that their factories will be closed. **********''They are putting it out of mind like smokers do. They also know what cigarettes do to them, but push that knowledge aside.'' **********Mayor Gerhard Godicke of Ermlitz said the people here are simply thinking of how soon they, too, can drive about in West German cars instead of tiny vehicles of local production. Such material desires have pushed their worry about the survival of their villages temporarily out of mind. **********But Mr. Godicke is proud that he organized a successful citizens' environmental campaign. He took quick advantage of the political upheaval to organize, with the help of churchmen and ecologists, a protest march in January, unusual in this conservative region of compliant cattle, pig and sheep farmers joined in a state cooperative. Even older residents could not recall any such unofficial demonstration ever occurring here. **********As every village church bell pealed, many for the first time in decades because worshippers had years ago bowed to Communist pressure, about 1,200 people marched through the Auen to the mine headquarters at Rassnitz to confront its directors with their demands. **********A harassed manager said he had no authority to decide, but Mr. Godicke said shortly thereafter that informal word had reached him from district authorities that the villages would be removed from the lignite industry's jurisdiction. But they don't have it in writing. **********Mr. Godicke and five other mayors took their courage in their hands -''We would have never done this before,'' he said - and wrote a letter of protest to Prime Minster Hans Modrow, demanding official action to save the Auen. Proudly, the mayor showed phrases in which years of frustration under a dictatorial Government exploded into words of un-German assertiveness toward the highest authority. **********''We citizens are bitter and angry over these measures, which are contrary to sensible ecology, and the senseless destruction, delaying tactics, silence, ignorance and arrogance of the relevant enterprises and state organs,'' the mayors wrote. They have not received a reply. **********But Mr. Rattunde, the Green representative, was skeptical.

But television executives are questioning the analysis used by the Tennessee company to support its claim that the programming will reach consumers whom network television does not attract. **********Whittle said two weeks ago that it was developing an hourlong television news program aimed primarily at young mothers. The program would play continuously on a combination large-screen television and videodisk player to be installed in 20,000 physicians' waiting rooms. The program, called Special Reports Television, will change 24 times a year. Whittle says the program will reach 44 million people. **********Advertisers are being offered $5.5 million packages that will combine two 30-second commercials an hour on all 24 shows with a page of advertising in Whittle's three quarterly Special Reports magazines for doctors' offices. **********Whittle argues that its target audience - women between 25 and 54 years old, particularly those in their late 20's and early 30's with children - is barely touched by network television. The company says that the people who watch the most television account for 51 percent of all prime-time viewing but are not a desirable market for most consumer-products companies. Citing data from the Simmons Market Research Bureau, Whittle says that 63 percent of this group are unemployed and 52 percent have household incomes under $20,000. **********Whittle says 46 percent of the 38 million women with children in the United States are among the most infrequent television viewers.

Walter Thompson U.S.A., said it could turn out to be ''a form of television that can reach potential customers no one else can reach.'' **********Nevertheless, questions have arisen about Whittle's new project. **********The company is basing the marketing of its waiting-room network on what is known in television as a quintile analysis, in which a large market is divided into five groups, from the heaviest to the lightest viewers. Whittle says the networks draw primarily from the heaviest, but least desirable viewers, in quintiles one and two, instead of what it calls the more attractive, light viewers in quintiles four and five. **********But television executives say the fifth quintile is of little interest to marketers. Robert Niles, vice president of research at NBC, characterized that quintile as largely ''a downscale audience'' made up of ''second-shift workers, blue-collar and older people who go to bed early.'' **********Others question the lengths to which Whittle takes its quintile analysis. Willard Hadlock, the head of media services at the Leo Burnett advertising agency, said: ''Quintiles four and five are not necessarily the lightest viewers. In some cases, they're the heaviest viewers. When they're home with a baby, they watch a lot of TV.'' **********Furthermore, both network and agency executives say that network schedules can be tailored to reach the light viewers, and they question whether even pregnant women or young mothers go to their physicians often enough to give the advertising punch. **********''Effective advertising is a combination of reach and frequency,'' said David F. Poltrack, senior vice president of research at CBS. ''With Whittle's program, you don't get frequency. I don't know too many people who go to the doctor's more than once every two weeks.'' **********Mr. Poltrack compared Special Reports Television to airline advertising, which also reaches a selective, affluent audience, but too infrequently to represent a threat to network television. **********Mr. Sisk of J. Walter Thompson, nevertheless, called Whittle's television project ''another form of chipping away at the networks.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/21/world/aquino-defends-effort-to-save-quake-victims.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-07-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 212, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Aquino Defends Effort To Save Quake Victims", "print_headline": "Aquino Defends Effort To Save Quake Victims", "body_text": " **********President Corazon C.

Gorbachev about narrowing their differences on Germany, American and Soviet officials said today that the gaps between them on this critical issue still appeared to be wide. **********Indeed, Mr. Gorbachev used a meeting today with Congressional leaders at the Soviet Embassy to complain about the Administration's ''rather rigid position'' that ''a united Germany belong to NATO.'' **********Mr. Bush telephoned the West German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, first thing today to assure him that he did not diverge from his position that a unified Germany must remain a member of the NATO alliance. **********The discussion that took place on Thursday afternoon between the two Presidents on the German question appears to have been a combination of diplomacy and public posturing. On the diplomatic side, an Administration official said, the two men laid out their longstanding positions on the German question, with a new nuance here or there, but no surprises. **********Insistence on NATO Role **********That American position in short, the official said, is that Germany is going to be united, it is going to be in NATO, and the United States stands ready to make that fact as politically, economically and militarily acceptable to Moscow as possible. **********Mr. Gorbachev countered with what one American official described as ''an extremely peculiar'' performance on Germany. In an ''animated, confident and thrusting'' speaking style, the official said, Mr. Gorbachev gave ''an extraordinarily vague presentation - it was elaborate, convuluted and imprecise.'' **********Through the haze, officials said, he made clear that the Soviet people simply could not accept the idea that their enemy of World War II - a united Germany - and their enemy of the cold war - NATO - should now be joined in one alliance. Germany should be in both alliances, he said, which should eventually give way to some new pan-European security framework. **********At the close, however, Mr. Gorbachev asked aloud whether it ''shouldn't be the German people who decide whether or not they are in NATO.'' Mr. Bush, confident that the German people want to remain in the alliance, tried to press the Soviet leader on how they might establish this point, but he could not pin him down, officials said. **********Gorbachev Seemed Upbeat **********Public relations came into play when Mr. Gorbachev left the White House saying ''something emerged'' in their discussions on Germany, and appearing generally quite upbeat. He also said Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, would be holding ''in depth'' talks to work on details, giving rise to speculation that a breakthrough on Germany was imminent. **********Mr. Gorbachev's upbeat approach seemed consistent with Soviet efforts to avoid being depicted as the ''spoiler'' standing in the way of a smooth, speedy German unification and to emphasize that Moscow is the one spinning out new ideas for an idyllic Europe free of all military alliances. **********Mr. Bush, apparently not wanting to contradict Mr. Gorbachev at the very outset of the summit talks and intrigued by the Soviet leader's closing remark on letting the Germans decide, said he too was ''encouraged'' by their discussion. **********Nothing Fundamentally New **********As the day wore on, though, Administration officials, speaking not for attribution, began letting it be known that Mr. Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze were not planning any more talks on the German question and that nothing fundamentally new had really come up in the Bush-Gorbachev talks on this issue. **********Today, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, tried to get the two Presidents down from the tree they had climbed together by saying: ''I think the confusion just arose over the interpretation of what the word 'new' means, if you can believe that. We had some new - meaning different, is the way I would describe it - different formulations of our positions, but nothing was agreed to.'' **********Many Administration officials say they believe that if there is going to be any real movement by the Soviets on the German question, it might be foreshadowed in the private meetings between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev at Camp David on Saturday. But more likely, officials say, is that Mr. Gorbachev will not make any new move on Germany - an explosive domestic political issue for him - until after the Communist Party congress in early July. **********On Repackaging NATO **********President Bush's position, as laid out on Thursday, is that to make a unified Germany in NATO palatable to the Soviets, the United States, West Germany and the NATO allies have agreed to package it in this way: *********** After German unification, no NATO troops will be extended to the territory of what is now East Germany, so there will be no increased threat to Soviet forces. *********** The 300,000 to 400,000 Soviet troops now in East Germany will be able to remain there for a transitional period of a few years. *********** The West German Government will pay the estimated $180 million cost of maintaining the Soviet troops in East Germany for the transition period, and will also pay for the construction of new housing for them back in the Soviet Union. *********** NATO will begin revamping its force structure - downgrading readiness of certain units, scaling back its military training programs, developing multi-national fighting units, scraping plans to modernize its short-range nuclear missiles - to respond to the diminished threat from the East and to make NATO less threatening to Moscow. *********** As soon as the Soviets agree to conclude the current conventional forces treaty now being negotiated in Vienna - the treaty would sharply reduce Soviet and American troops, armor and artillery forces in Europe - the Germans, in conjunction with NATO, will be prepared to begin immediately discussing limitations on the size of a united Germany's armed forces. *********** The United States has offered to begin looking for ways to institutionalize the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to transform it into some sort of ''club'' that every nation in Europe could belong to, an official said. The Conference could be given a permanent secretariat, hold more frequent meetings and be given responsibilities for everything from crisis management to election monitoring. With the Soviet-led Warsaw pact disintegrating and NATO remaining intact, the idea is to use the Conference as a framework that could give the Soviets a sense of both belonging to and playing a leading role in a pan-European organization - but one that would be a compliment to NATO, not a substitute."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/06/business/company-news-court-clears-sale-of-amdura-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Court Clears Sale Of Amdura Unit", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Court Clears Sale Of Amdura Unit", "body_text": " **********The Amdura Corporation said the United States District Court had approved the sale of the assets of the company's Coast-to-Coast Stores subsidiary to the Servistar Corporation.

But under the agreement, Tele-Communications will now move the Fox affiliates it already carries to the lower end of the dial.

The ordinance affects property in the town's unincorporated areas that have multifamily zoning, a category that permits up to 10 units to the acre. **********Several communities in Westchester give developers higher densities in return for lower-cost units, but Greenburgh decided to take the different approach. **********''People are very concerned about traffic,'' said Edith Silberstein, the town's Commissioner of Planning, ''and neither did we want another level of government that would impose price constraints.'' **********Most new construction has been priced in the $300,000 to $500,000 range, town officials said. Now about 350 lower-cost units in addition to those at Pondside are expected to be built within three years. **********To qualify for affordable status, one-bedroom units cannot exceed 650 square feet, and two-bedroom units are limited to 750 square feet. These units can have only one bathroom. **********At Pondside, which is offering a mix of two- and three-bedroom town houses and apartments, the small-size units will be available in two four-story elevator buildings, each of which will have 48 apartments. **********The first apartment building, which will be ready for occupancy in November, offers 29 one-bedroom units ranging from 622 square feet to 650 square feet, with prices ranging from $138,500 up to $160,500. Prices for other apartments start at $162,000 for a 750-square-foot, one-bedroom unit and rise to $213,500 for a 1,092-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment. Ground-floor apartments all have private patios, a few units on upper floors have terraces, and many apartments have bay windows. **********The small one-bedroom units are being offered first to people who live or work in Greenburgh. Seven of the 12 purchasers who have bought apartments since pre-construction sales began in October have elected to buy the smaller units. **********The second building will offer 28 of the smaller apartments, but sales on those have not yet started. **********Prices for the town houses start at $249,500 for a two-bedroom, 1,956-square-foot unit, and the highest-priced unit, at $339,000, offers 2,758 square feet and a one-car garage. **********The 17.5-acre property, which is on Stadium Road and Route 100A near White Plains, could have been developed as an apartment-house complex. **********But adjoining single-family neighborhoods made the mix of town houses and apartments more appropriate, said Martin Ginsburg, who is developing the project with his brother Samuel. **********''We felt there is a need for both types of units, and our development concept was a self-contained, parklike community where people who want the convenience of an elevator building can also have amenities, and where people who prefer town house living can have it within walking distance of shopping and transportation,'' he said. **********The slope of the site gives town houses three living levels. Kitchens and living rooms, which lead out to rear decks, are on the street level; bedrooms are on the second floor, and walkout basements lead to private rear patios. Twelve of the 24 town houses in the first section have been sold since sales began in October. Models will open in June, and occupancy will start late in July. **********Two man-made ponds, each about half an acre, are centrally placed so that 40 percent of the units will have water views. The landscaping will have a Japanese theme, and also more formal areas to complement the Georgian-style architecture of the town houses and the apartment buildings. Do H. Chung & Partners of Stamford is the architect, and David Ferris Miller of Croton-on-Hudson is the landscape architect. **********Residences will be sold under a condominium form of ownership. But the 13.8 acres of common area, which includes a clubhouse, two tennis courts, an outdoor swimming pool and a half-mile jogging trail, will be owned and managed by a homeowners' association. **********The association will buy the property from the developers for $500,000, payable over 30 years at 10 percent interest.

But beyond the exotic looks and near race-car performance, the NSX represents a clear technical leap forward that could mean stronger sales for all Honda luxury cars. **********''The true significance of this car is the way it enhances Acura's high-performance image,'' said Christopher Cedergren of J. D. Power & Associates, an automotive-marketing consulting firm in Westlake Village, Calif. ''With the NSX, you can have a sexy, exotic performance car with the maintenance cost of a Honda Accord.'' **********The NSX, shown to reporters at a race track here this week, also symbolizes the Japanese auto industry's determination to place challengers into every marketing niche of the industry, no matter how small. **********In building the NSX, Honda extensively redesigned outside body parts and inside components to reduce size and weight. It also refined the engine technology to coax enormous power from six cylinders. **********The resulting car, due in American showrooms in two weeks, makes Honda the first Japanese auto maker to offer a vehicle that matches the lightning-fast performance characteristics of the super cars from Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche that cost $100,000 and more. **********Honda engineers say innovations introduced in the NSX will appear in other new models destined for the American market, starting with two new Acura sports luxury models that are to be introduced within nine months. **********To show off the NSX's handling and performance characteristics, Honda executives have been inviting automotive journalists and reviewers to race tracks around the country, including the Portland International Raceway, for test drives. Porsche and Ferrari models were provided for comparison. **********Extremely Glowing Reviews **********Suprisingly, the NSX's gears and clutch feel the same as those in regular Hondas. But the power and sound of the engine seem awesome to one accustomed to conventional cars. Just a few seconds after pressing the accelerator, the driver can see the speedometer closing on 110 miles an hour. Despite the high speed, there is little sense of danger or urgency, even in fairly sharp curves. **********NSX stands for ''new sports car experimental,'' as it was called internally while it was under development. The car has already been trumpeted on the covers of most car magazines and has received extremely glowing reviews, even by the standards of the sometimes boosterish automotive press. **********One important development in the car was the use of aluminum for NSX's body, rather than steel or plastic. Aluminum is 40 percent lighter than steel but also five or six times more expensive and very difficult to bend and weld because it tears easily. Honda engineers said that what they learned about special welding equipment, dies and aluminum alloys could result in more aluminum parts on future cars, especially if energy prices increase and fuel efficiency standards get stricter, requiring lighter-weight vehicles. **********Multivalve Technology **********The NSX's engine is placed in the middle of the car behind the two-seat passenger compartment, which is unusual but not new. The engine derives much of its uncanny power from the four valves on each of the six cylinders, rather than the more common two. The additional valves allow more air in and out of the combustion chambers where the fuel ignites, resulting in more power. **********This multivalve technology, found on most Japanese-made cars, normally requires a small sacrifice in power when the engine is operating at low speeds or starting to move from a standing stop. **********To overcome that effect, Honda developed special electromechanical valve controls that enable the NSX to accelerate from 0 to 60 miles an hour in less than six seconds, a rare feat. The Nissan Infiniti Q45 luxury sedan is the only other car available in the United States to offer similar technology. **********Relentless efforts to cut the size of components to make them fit in the compact NSX left a comparatively large amount of elbow and leg room for driver and passenger and good visibility in all directions - features not found in similar cars. **********Honda's Sales Goal **********If the three new Acura models are as successful as the current two, they will probably vault Honda well past the Chrysler Corporation as the nation's third-best selling car company, after the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company. **********''If this puts us ahead of Chrysler, then it does,'' said Thomas Elliott, executive vice president of Honda's American sales organization. ''Frankly, our goal is to sell a million cars a year'' within the next five years. **********Currently, Honda and Acura sell about 840,000 cars a year; the auto maker was selling 552,000 cars in 1985, before the Acura was introduced. Meanwhile, Chrysler, which once sold about a million cars a year, has seen its sales slide to a level just slightly higher than Honda's. **********By itself, the NSX will have only a marginal effect on the American car market. Honda hopes to sell 3,000, just a drop in the sea of 14 million to 15 million vehicles of all kinds sold annually. **********So far this year, Japanese car brands have captured a 28.4 percent share of the American market, up from 24.3 percent a year earlier. **********Psychological Effect **********But the greatest effect of Honda's new sports car could be psychological. Honda is hoping that attention to the NSX will spill over Acura's entirely redesigned Legend sedan, scheduled to make its debut this fall, as well as a second new Acura sedan, equipped with a five-cylinder engine, that will be smaller than the Legend but larger than the sporty Integra compact. **********The expanded array of Acura vehicles is primarily aimed at customers of sporty European luxury cars like some Mercedes-Benz and BMW models, at current Honda owners and at owners of Toyota's Lexus and Nissan's Infiniti brands. **********Honda, whose racing engines have dominated the Formula One car racing circuit for several years, began developing the Acura NSX five years ago. The concept meshed with the auto maker's overall American marketing strategy, which was to create a separate line of sports luxury vehicles in 1986. In its first year, Acura sold 52,869 cars; last year that number had grown to 142,061, surpassing BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/24/business/company-news-norton-resisting-acquisition-offers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 172, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Norton Resisting Acquisition Offers", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Norton Resisting Acquisition Offers", "body_text": " **********Despite the interest of outside parties in acquiring it, the Norton Company reiterated in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it would try to remain independent.

Interest rates went from 3.94 percent to 4.95 percent on three-month yen deposits in Europe and from 4.44 percent to 7.16 percent on the 10-year Government bond from the end of August to Oct. 16. By the end of November, rates had fallen back to about where they had been, after the Bank of Japan eased up following the crash. **********The third rate jump began in the middle of last month with three-month yen deposits at 6.5 percent and the 10-year bond at 5.37 percent. By Friday, three-month deposits had risen to 7 percent while the 10-year bond was at 6.4 percent. There have been stronger signs of inflation now than in 1987, although it may be subsiding a bit. Mr. Sargen again believes that the Bank of Japan has based its tightening move on rising land prices and the high stock prices in Tokyo. The bank's aim, he said, is to curb ''future inflation.'' In addition, the central bank is worried about the very weak yen, which was the problem in 1985. **********The unknown is how long it will take for this rate increase to unwind and how much damage will be done to stocks in the interim. **********Mr. Sargen said that the big difference between this episode and the one in 1987 is that there is not - at least now - international disagreement over policy, as there was among the United States, Japan and West Germany in the year of the crash. **********Still, Mr. Sargen said it could be April or later before the Bank of Japan sees enough reassuring numbers on inflation to cause it to let interest rates come down some. And the weak yen could even prompt another ratcheting up in interest rates. **********This means the pressure on the stock market could last much longer and the cumulative impact - both in Tokyo and abroad - could be significant. **********The Nikkei is now at 36,836.54, having posted a rise Friday for the first time in five trading days. While the Nikkei 225 is down 5.3 percent for the year, Friday's level still implies that investors expect the interest rate jump to unwind quickly, limiting damage to the stock market. But if interest rates remain at this level for some time, the risk is that the Nikkei could fall much more."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/22/business/international-report-the-bundesbank-s-partial-success.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1990-01-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1296, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  The Bundesbank's Partial Success", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL REPORT;   The Bundesbank's Partial Success", "body_text": " **********With its aggressive strategy to strengthen the mark, the Bundesbank of West Germany has shown again why it is considered the most skilled of the West's central banks and a primary player in the economic future of Europe. But not everything has gone according to plan. **********The mark now stands at its highest level against the dollar in almost two years, thanks to the Bundesbank's interest rate increases all last year, capped by a 1 percent rise in October, and the central bank's surprising dollar-selling two weeks ago, an action that helped send the dollar down by more than four pfennigs. On Friday, the dollar fell to 1.7105 marks, from 1.7150 marks the previous day. **********But the Bundesbank has failed so far in its central goal: strengthening the mark against other major European currencies. Even the Italian lira, which was devalued earlier this month, was down by less than 1 percent against the mark last week, and the French franc has appreciated. **********And the central bank's unexpected intervention the first week of the year may have backfired somewhat by being more disruptive than anticipated, analysts say. **********Keeping the Pressure **********Bundesbank officials have made it clear that they intend to keep the pressure on West Germany's European trading partners to devalue their currencies or to slow their economic growth by raising interest rates to maintain parity with the mark. Either move would help the West Germans shrink their record trade surplus with Europe. **********The Bundesbank could also still move to raise interest rates another notch if it concluded that this would be useful in a parallel effort to curb the wage increases that will come out of the crucial labor negotiations with metal workers next month. **********For the dollar, this strategy means even more downward pressure will be coming, against the mark and other European currencies. This could add to inflation in the United States, as imports become more expensive. And if the stronger mark, along with the promise of the economic opening of Eastern Europe, continues to divert foreign capital from the United States to West Germany and Europe, interest rates here could rise. **********'Uncooperative Policy' **********Some of the analysts contend the Bundesbank is being self-centered, refusing to account for the effect of its policy on the dollar, the United States, Japan and other economies, the European Monetary System or the goal of a single market in Europe. **********''From an international point of view, it is a very uncooperative policy,'' said David Morrison, the chief international economist at Goldman,Sachs & Company in London. ''The Bundesbank decided to do what they wanted to, and the rest could lump it.'' **********But other analysts are less worried. They contend that for now, the strategy is helping the United States, whose Treasury has favored a weaker dollar to help lower the American trade deficit by making imports more expensive and exports more competitive. Norbert Walter, the senior economist at Deutsche Bank A.G. in Frankfurt, said, ''I haven't seen much complaint about the Bundesbank moves.'' **********The Bundesbank strategy is no secret. The central bank's president, Karl Otto Pohl, and members of the Bundesbank board have said they want the mark to be stronger. **********Opening of Borders **********In this effort they have been helped by the opening of Eastern Europe, which has lured investment to West Germany and helped strengthen the currency. The Bundesbank also took advantage of the lowering of interest rates in the United States and the resulting downward pressure on the dollar. **********One reason for a stronger mark is the desire of West Germany to make its exports more expensive and thus reduce the trade surplus with its European trading partners. The surplus is growing annually and adding to global trade tensions. **********A second reason is the Bundesbank's anti-inflation fight. A stronger mark, in this case against the dollar, makes many of the countries' imports, which are priced in dollars, less expensive. **********And another reason is the critical labor talks ahead between industry and the 3.5 million metal workers represented by IG Metall. A new increase in interest rates would give a signal to industry that a generous contract will be more difficult to offset with profits because the economy will not be growing as fast. **********Realigning the System **********The Bundesbank contends that the best way to achieve its strategy is through realigning the European Monetary System, which could be forced by a strengthening mark. Such an adjustment would devalue the other currencies in the system, including the French franc. **********But the Bundesbank has been frustrated in this goal because its trading partners, especially France, and members of the West German Government do not want a realignment. The French Government has been willing to push up interest rates along with the West Germans, keeping the franc in line with the mark and slowing the French economy to maintain its anti-inflation policy. **********The West German Government does not like the idea of a realignment now because it could slow the movement toward monetary union and the fixed exchange rates that are possible after the economic unification of Europe begins in late 1992. **********''A realignment of the E.M.S. is not on the agenda because the major players do not want it,'' Mr. Pohl acknowledged recently. **********Higher Interest Rates **********The next best alternative is to maintain pressure by raising interest rates and keeping the mark strong. When countries like France then follow by raising their rates, their economies will be slowed. With slower growth, the West German surplus could be curbed because fewer exports will be bought abroad. **********The startling selling of dollars on Jan. 4 was also an effort to keep the mark strong by heading off the rapid appreciation of the dollar on Jan. 2 and 3 and by dampening the idea that the dollar would stage a January rally like it did in 1989. The dollar had risen to 1.7350 marks on Jan. 4, from 1.6910 marks at the end of last year. **********The intervention came as the dollar was around 1.73 marks, well within the range of 1.70 marks to 1.90 marks believed to be set by the Group of Seven, which includes the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. This intervention is what made the move to push the dollar lower so surprising and raised questions about whether the Group of Seven was setting a new lower range for the dollar. **********More Effect on Market **********John Lipsky, the director of international bond research at Salomon Brothers Inc. in London, said the Bundesbank probably was trying to make sure the market did not think it was acquiescing in a higher dollar, and therefore, a weaker mark. **********He said the bank's selling had much more effect on the market than intended because it coincided with large orders to sell dollars, which led to frenzied selling that pushed down the dollar to 1.6785 marks in late trading in New York on Jan 4, from 1.7224 marks on Jan. 3. **********The sharp fall caused confusion in the market and more volatility than the Bundesbank would have wanted. **********''When the Bundesbank intervened, people felt that it made sense,'' said one official who understands the bank's strategy. ''But you never know the reaction of the market. And, maybe if the Bundesbank had known how the market would react, the position might have been different.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/19/business/gm-to-begin-production-of-a-battery-powered-car.html": {"writer_name": "Doron Levin", "pub_date": "1990-04-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 616, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.M. to Begin Production Of a Battery-Powered Car", "print_headline": "G.M. to Begin Production Of a Battery-Powered Car", "body_text": " **********Responding to concerns about poor air quality, the General Motors Corporation announced today that it would proceed with commercial production of a battery-powered electric car for personal use. **********Despite the announcement, the project seemed to remain somewhat speculative.

Indeed, G.M. cited competitive reasons for declining to answer the most critical questions about when or where it would begin production of the car and what technology would be used. **********G.M. had displayed a battery-powered car called the Impact in January and said it would decide on the commercial feasibility of the vehicle within a few months. The Impact would be the basis for the car that G.M. said it would produce. **********Timely Announcement **********The announcement that the company planned to begin production was made by Roger B. Smith, the chairman of G.M., at the National Press Club in Washington. The announcement came less than a week before Earth Day and at a time when Congress is considering broad clean-air legislation that could force auto makers to put new pollution controls on their vehicles. **********A spokesman said later that the company had not established a definite date and place for the start of production. **********Mr. Smith said G.M.'s goal was to be ''the first automobile company since the early days of the auto industry to mass-produce an electric car'' that is safe, performs well and that consumers find appealing. **********''What that means is that the Impact is suitable for most urban drivers' daily activities,'' he added. **********G.M. has said the car will accelerate from standstill to 60 miles an hour in eight seconds and run for 125 miles before its battery needs recharging. The Big Three and some foreign auto makers have also been testing battery-powered vans. **********Support for Zero Emissions **********Mr. Smith said that public and governmental reaction to the Impact has been positive since G.M. began displaying a prototype at auto shows in Los Angeles, Chicago and Geneva. ''People are concerned about the range of the car, but they're also very much impressed by the fact that Impact produces zero emissions,'' he said. **********In the late 1970's, at the height of the energy crisis, G.M. said it would be building 100,000 battery-powered cars a year by 1984, a plan that was abandoned for lack of interest by the public, a company spokesman said. **********Mr. Smith said the technology had improved, ''so it's possible to do this with a fresh design.'' **********G.M. is seeking changes in Federal regulations to make production of the car more feasible, Mr. Smith said. Although he was not specific, he said that current safety standards were meant for the size and weight of internal combustion cars. **********G.M. will also lobby the Government for electric cars to be counted in the calculation of corporate average fuel economy, he said. **********The Battery Problem **********But the biggest question is about the vehicle's power source, its battery. Scientists who worked on the Impact prototype noted that it used conventional lead-acid batteries, which emit relatively little power and must be replaced each year at considerable expense. **********Noting that the battery ''is such an essential piece of the final picture,'' Mr. Smith said developing one for commercial production might require ''a broad-based development effort, one that involves not only the entire domestic auto industry and the Government, but the electric utility industry as well.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/18/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-india-hopes-its-red-cross-can-unload-ship.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-09-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 220, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  India Hopes Its Red Cross Can Unload Ship", "print_headline": "CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;   India Hopes Its Red Cross Can Unload Ship", "body_text": " **********As an Indian ship loaded with food headed across the Arabian Sea toward the Persian Gulf, Prime Minister V.

The mere mention of Beijing's biggest public plaza brings back horrific memories of the bloody student uprising that was staged there last year and then quashed by the Chinese Government. Relations between the United States and China have since chilled considerably, and Congress has sought to show its disapproval of the Communist Government's violent crackdown through various diplomatic sanctions. **********But American executives have not seemed as inclined to back off from China. I.B.M., Exxon and Mobil Oil are just three of the big American corporations with operations in China, and there are scores of trading companies that do business there. **********\"Obviously, we don't do business with a country if the United States has imposed a ban on trade, as with North Vietnam or Cuba,\" explained Arno Schallamach, senior vice president of the Commodities Trading International Corporation, an import-export company in Greenwich, Conn. \"But beyond that, the reality of the world of business is that the issue of politics never enters into discussions.\" **********So it was that on a recent stormy evening on Manhattan's West Side, dozens of American business men and women happily sipped cocktails and munched snacks in the lobby of the Chinese Consulate. They had gathered for a contract-signing ceremony marking the Chinese Government's recent $24 million purchase of fertilizer from Commodities Trading -- one of several functions that China is quietly holding in the coming weeks for its American partners as it completes a trade mission here for some $300 million worth of United States products. **********\"This is a way to get around the U.S. Government's policy of no high-level contact with China,\" noted Kathryn Wei, a Chinese-born American who is the chief executive of the Falcon Shipping Group, a shipping company in New York. \"This is a business reception; we don't want politics here.\" **********To many executives, a country's human rights record or political persuasion is virtually irrelevant in deciding whether to strike a deal. \"Businessmen are apolitical,\" said another partygoer, E. S. Finley, chief executive of the International Commodities Export Corporation of Purchase, N.Y. \"A businessman cannot tell the world how to act and so will discount any personal attitude he has. Of course, there is a limit. When a situation becomes so outrageous, as with Iraq, even a trading company would shy away from it even without an embargo.\" **********Of course, industrial companies run a greater risk of having their products boycotted when consumers disagree with their business practices and may act to stave off opposition even before it surfaces. Coca-Cola, for instance, was one of the early American enterprises to pull out of South Africa because of apartheid, leaving in 1986 before consumer activism peaked. \"The decision was a statement of our opposition to apartheid and of our support for the economic future of blacks,\" said a spokesman. **********At the Chinese Consulate, an enormous embroidered mural of the Chinese Temple of Heaven is the only noteworthy adornment in an otherwise drab setting. Located in a neighborhood known for its cheap, open-air parking lots, the building, at 12th Avenue and 42d Street, was formerly a Howard Johnson Motor Lodge. With linoleum floors, fluorescent lighting and mint-green walls, its reception area seems more fitting for a big-city bus station than a foreign legation. **********\"This building was bought in the 1970's, when President Nixon was friendly with the Chinese Government,\" Ms. Wei said. \"Now, the Chinese Government isn't allowed to buy any buildings in the U.S.; so they can't move to a nicer place.\" **********The style of entertainment at the consulate is similarly unimpressive, particularly compared with the distinguished affairs held for executives in the lavishly decorated European embassies across town. In keeping with the spartan atmosphere, cocktails were served in disposable cups at the reception. Hors d'oeuvres were eschewed in favor of an enormous buffet of Chinese dishes, all served on paper plates with plastic forks. **********But a utilitarian entertaining style belies the spending might of these Chinese hosts. \"The Chinese have been customers of ours for years,\" said Sameer Zahr, chief executive of Commodities Trading International. \"They are a great, great trading partner.\" Mr. Zahr, who had just signed the $24 million fertilizer contract with the Chinese, was sweating under the lights of the roving television cameras focused on him. Chinese cable television had sent a film crew to record the great event for later broadcast. **********As far as Mr. Zahr is concerned, Tiananmen Square was a non-event. \"We have never had any problems with the Chinese,\" he said firmly. \"They are extremely efficient and honorable. At the time of the student uprising, I had $10 million in exports yet to be shipped to the Chinese.\" Despite the disruption of the government, he said, China honored the entire order. **********Robert Lavinia, president of Phibro Refining Inc., an oil refining company, agreed. \"I've actually played basketball with some other people in Tiananmen Square since the trouble there,\" he said. **********A bigger problem for many of them is language. Although younger Chinese are increasingly fluent in English, the more senior, older executives and officials are not, so the simplest discussion can turn into a protracted interchange. Witness one American executive bidding goodbye to his Chinese partner.  \"Let's by all means stay in touch,\" said the American jovially. At his partner's uncomprehending look, he repeated loudly, \"In touch.

''At the same time, we're not sloughing this off. He has the capability to do these things.'' **********By invoking fears of an attack on Israel and projecting images of oilfields burning out of control to send oil prices soaring and plunging Western economies deeply into recession, the Iraqi leader was trying to make the costs of war sound so horrific as to discourage any attack against Baghdad, officials explained. **********'A Daily Diatribe' **********While the officials acknowledged the statements marked an escalation in Mr. Hussein's bellicose oratory, they took pains to note that the threats were conveyed within an established context of intimidating public displays and comments emanating from Baghdad. ''We get a daily diatribe from Saddam, and this is another one of them,'' said the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater. **********Iraq announced Sunday that Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz was canceling a visit to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly because the United States would not permit his Iraqi airliner to land. **********State Department officials said the Mr. Aziz could take a commercial flight to New York, but that no Iraqi government plane would be allowed to land while Baghdad held hostage the 1,000 Americans remaining in Iraq and occupied Kuwait. **********President Bush today reiterated the Administration's position against any negotiations with Baghdad until Iraq abided by the United Nations sanctions, and withdrew its forces from Kuwait. **********In doing so, Mr. Bush noted the lack of success that Arab leaders, including Jordan's King Hussein, have had in brokering a settlement. **********''Whoever else has stepped up to the plate, they have struck out because of this man's insistence on remaining in Kuwait,'' Mr. Bush told a group of leaders from the Arab-American community at the White House. **********Pressures on Jordan **********Earlier in the day, Mr. Fitzwater's comments about King Hussein were even more pointed. When asked about the king's call for the removal of American troops from Saudi Arabia, Mr. Fitzwater said that the Jordanian monarch ''has some difficult pressures on him, but nevertheless, we are disappointed in the conduct of that country at this point.'' **********When pressed by the Arab-American group to explain the objective of American involvement in the Gulf, President Bush said it was to thwart hostile aggression: ''Iraq is no model of democracy, nor was Kuwait. That isn't the question here. The question is international law and respect for one's neighbor.'' **********For Government officials and Middle East scholars who have been trying to weigh Mr. Hussein's real intentions, his increasingly threatening comments in recent days recalled the days just before the invasion of Kuwait, when the Iraqi leader's ominous rhetoric was discounted in Washington as well as European and Arab capitals. **********Although Iraqi forces are currently arrayed in a defensive posture along the Saudi border, military experts said an Iraqi rocket attack against Israel or Saudi oilfields would not require extensive preparation. **********Administration officials said they were discouraged that Mr. Hussein has so far shown no sign of seeking a way out of the crisis. If anything, they said, his dismemberment of Kuwait, including a decision enacted today to replace the Kuwaiti currency with the Iraqi dinar, suggested a commitment to remain as an occupying power. **********Today brought no change in the tone or substance of Mr. Hussein's warnings. **********''Kuwait is Iraqi and we won't give it up even if we fight over it for a thousand years,'' Baghdad radio quoted Mr. Hussein as saying today. **********Israeli Reaction **********JERUSALEM, Sept. 24 (Special to The New York Times) - Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir warned today that Israel stood ready to ''repay'' any attack by Iraq. **********Responding to the most bellicose statement yet from President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Israeli officials sought to keep the low profile requested by the United States.

The group, part of the coalition of extremist factions known as Islamic Holy War, said the killings on Sunday were meant to show opposition to Mideast peace efforts and to the tide of Soviet Jews entering Israel. **********The claim of responsibility was the second one in the attack. Just after the killings, a man saying he represented a previously unheard-of Egyptian group phoned an international news agency to take responsibility for the raid. The claim from the group, the Organization for the Defense of the Oppressed of Egypt's Prisons, met with skepticism. **********The assault sent tremors of rage and bewilderment across Egypt today, and raised questions about the country's ability to broker peace, to attract the tourism that brings in vital hard currency and to counter attacks on Israelis on the bus route to Cairo. **********Getaway Car Is Traced **********The state-owned Middle East News Agency quoted the Egyptian police today as saying a Palestinian believed to be one of the attackers was arrested. The agency said the suspect arrived in Egypt two weeks ago with other members of the attack squad, but it did not elaborate. **********An Interior Ministry spokesman who discussed the investigation said he was unable to confirm reports that the driver of the getaway car, said to be a Palestinian living in Egypt, had been arrested. **********The Egyptian police said today that they had traced the killers' getaway car to a rental company and had rounded up what an Interior Ministry spokesman said was hundreds of people for questioning. **********The faction of Islamic Holy War broadcast its claim over a Syrian radio station used by an organization that Western specialists have associated with some of the worst terrorist attacks of recent years, including the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988. **********Tonight, the radio station, used by Ahmed Jabril's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, General Command, broadcast a message said to have been recorded by one of the gunmen. It said: ''I say to the Zionists, Kill one of us and we will kill 1,000. We will follow you to the moon. You will not escape even if you go to the moon.'' **********Roadblocks and Searches **********The speaker, who was not identifed by name, spoke Arabic with a Palestinian accent. It was not clear when the recording was made. **********The Egyptian authorities ordered roadblocks and car searches in several parts of the country, and briefly detained three men carrying Saudi passports on suspicion of involvement in the raid. The men were freed after six hours of interrogation, the police said. **********By the account of Egyptian and Israeli officials, two masked gunmen driving a white car swerved in front of a bus carrying 31 Israeli tourists, many of them academics with their families, as it headed to Cairo from Rafa, on Egypt's border with the occupied Gaza Strip. The attackers told two Egyptians, a tour guide and the driver, to get off, then opened fire with automatic rifles and grenades, Israeli officials said, quoting accounts by survivors. **********Worried about the impact of the attack on diplomacy, Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid of Egypt called the killing ''an attempt to place obstacles before the peace process, which is proceeding with relative success.'' **********Many Israeli Tourists **********''Egypt is determined to pursue the path of peace because this is the only one that can lead to stability in the region,'' he said, echoing sentiments by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. **********Egypt is the only Arab country at peace with Israel and has been a venue for Israeli tourists since the Camp David peace treaty was signed in 1979. More than 100,000 Israelis visited Egypt last year, Israeli officials said, and israelis had come to regard Egypt as a safe destination despite the lack of security along bus routes. **********Tour operators in Egypt said today that they had not detected a panicky exodus by Israelis visiting Egypt or major cancellations of projected tours. But the attack left some Israelis feeling nervous and uneasy. ''We would all like to leave,'' an Israeli diplomat said. **********The police were reported to have mounted extra security in Maadi, the southern suburb where many Israeli and American diplomats live. **********Early today, the police said they had found the abandoned car used by the assailants in a village in the Nile Delta 12 miles north of Cairo. The car was traced to a rental company here whose personnel told police investigators that they rented it nine days ago to a man carrying a Jordanian passport, company officials said. **********Careful Planning Seen **********The officials, who declined to be identified, said the man who rented the car paid cash for a 10-day rental. They would not give his name. **********Western diplomats said the attack seemed marked by the kind of careful planning that has not been associated with Egyptian extremists since a group called Egypt's Revolution was broken up after attacks on Israeli and American officials in the mid-1980's. **********In Damascus, a radio station used by pro-Syrian Palestinian movements said the attack was ''a reply to the steps of capitulation being prepared.'' **********The radio station was apparently referring to the newest American effort to bring together the Foreign Ministers of Egypt and Israel for talks that would lead to Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where a Palestinian uprising has been under way for more than two years. **********'Countries of Death' **********The broadcast identified the assailants as the Al-Suri Martyr Unit, from what was called the Martyrdom Lovers' Battalion, associated with Islamic Jihad. The communique warned Soviet Jews planning to emigrate to Israel, ''The Islamic Jihad is waiting for you.'' The Jews were heading ''not for lands of milk and honey'' but for ''countries of death for invaders,'' the broadcast said. **********The Palestine Liberation Organization formally distanced itself from the assault.

He tipped the Americans and the British to Soviet agents who might otherwise have never been detected. In a job where longevity is rare, he was a grand old man, juggling two careers - globetrotting Soviet diplomat, American agent - for at least two decades. **********When Pravda, the Soviet Communist daily, reported last week that Donald F., ''one of the most important'' spies of recent years, had been captured and sentenced to death, an American official privately called it a major loss. **********Code Name Top Hat **********The official may be right. Although Pravda did not identify Donald F., a review of Soviet diplomatic records shows that he is a senior Soviet Army officer, Lieut. Gen. Dmitri Fedorovich Polyakov. That conclusion is confirmed by former American intelligence officials. **********General Polyakov, who served in the military from the 1950's to the 1980's, was known to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency by the code name Top Hat, the former officials said. **********According to Pentagon records, General Polyakov last served as a lieutenant general in the Soviet Army Air Defense Command. That is a top post in the force, charged with defending the Soviet Union against nuclear attack. **********Mystery and Suspicion **********But beyond agreeing that General Polyakov held what Pravda called ''a very important position,'' the report of the spy's downfall remains shrouded in a half-light of mystery and suspicion. Despite his decades of ostensibly faithful service to the Western cause, some American experts have never been satisfied that General Polyakov was not at heart an agent of deception for the Soviet Union. **********The Pravda account provides new grist for the debate. While much of the newspaper's report accurately tracks General Polyakov's diplomatic career, experts say, the article veers from the truth at enough points to leave analysts puzzled and skeptical. **********For example, the Dmitri F. Polyakov known to American officials was not recently captured and sentenced to death, but has been dead for several years. Experts who believe in General Polyakov's genuineness say he was apparently swept up and executed in a wave of arrests of American agents in the mid-1980's, shortly after a series of security lapses rocked the C.I.A.'s Moscow station. **********''A couple of years ago, for reasons that aren't clear to us, the Russians got a bunch of our guys and killed them,'' said a former official. ''The consensus of the community is that he was one of them.'' That conclusion was later confirmed by Government experts. **********Perhaps a Double Agent **********Others say General Polyakov has retired from espionage and could not have been caught in the act of sending messages to the C.I.A., as the Pravda account reported. **********Equally mysterious is why Pravda would admit that an American agent duped the K.G.B. at all. Some say it seeks to bolster the sagging career of a K.G.B. colonel, Aleksandr Dukhanin, who Pravda says captured General Polyakov. Colonel Dukhanin has been accused of bungling a corruption inquiry involving a Politburo member, Yegor K. Ligachev, who is a conservative critic of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. **********Others say the aim is to burnish the image of the K.G.B. at a time when other Communist secret police agencies, from Rumania's Securitate to East Germany's Stasi, are being disbanded. The article on Donald F., which also praises the K.G.B.'s attacks on internal corruption, is one of many recent reports that cast the agency in a favorable light. **********Still others contend that he was not an American spy at all, but a Soviet ''dangle'' whose 20-year mission was to spread false information and foul the trails left by other Soviet agents in the C.I.A. and F.B.I. In that view, General Polyakov either died peacefully or has retired with honors, and the Pravda report is but a final twist intended to convince the United States of his loyalty. **********Among those holding that view are Peter Wright, the former assistant director of British intelligence and author of the book ''Spycatcher,'' and Edward Jay Epstein, an American writer on intelligence issues, along with a legion of former C.I.A. officials who analyzed Top Hat and other Soviet ''moles'' of the 1960's. **********''I never believed he was genuine,'' said one of the former C.I.A. officials. The official, like others interviewed, declined to be identified. The former official said he reviewed Top Hat's credentials in the mid-1970's as part of an analysis of Soviet informers ordered by William E. Colby, the Director of Central Intelligence at the time. **********'The Guy Was Legit' **********General Polyakov's defenders are equally adamant. ''The guy was legit, absolutely,'' said an F.B.I. expert on the Soviet Union from the 1960's. ''There was never any controversy about it.'' **********Although Mr. Wright and others say the F.B.I. and C.I.A. decided in 1978 that Top Hat was a Soviet double agent, Government officials insist that he was genuine and that ''there has never been a legitimate debate'' about his loyalties. **********Legitimate or not, the debate has been never ending. The C.I.A.'s legendary spymaster of the 1960's, James Jesus Angleton, concluded early on that Top Hat and a second Soviet agent recruited at the United Nations, Fedora, were fakes. Their mission, he believed, was to discredit evidence provided by a Soviet defector, Anatoli Golitsin, that a Soviet spy had penetrated the C.I.A.'s highest levels. **********Mr. Angleton never found the spy, and the turmoil that his search caused led to his dismissal from the C.I.A. But the debate over Top Hat and Fedora did not end. His successors conducted a review that appeared to clear Top Hat, but concluded that Fedora was in fact a double agent for the K.G.B. **********Casey Reopens Debate **********In the early 1980's, President Reagan's Director of Central Intelligence, William J. Casey, reopened the debate. His own inquiry, mounted by a team of former agency officials, concluded somewhat weakly that ''the charge of being a plant could not be substantiated,'' a former C.I.A. official said. **********The public record, pieced together from books and the Pravda account, settles nothing. **********Diplomatic records show that General Polyakov served in the Soviet Mission to the United Nations in New York in 1956 and again from 1959 to 1962, when he was promoted to the rank of colonel. After a stint in Moscow, he was posted in 1966 at the Soviet Embassy in Burma, where he was the military attache. **********In the early 1970's, he moved to the Soviet Embassy in New Delhi and returned for a second tour in 1980, with the rank of major general, before returning again to Moscow. **********Classified Conversations **********The diplomatic cover masked at least two other secret lives. John Barron, an author and intelligence expert, wrote in 1974 that General Polyakov was a Soviet spy while at the United Nations. Former American officials say he was an agent for the military intelligence agency, G.R.U. **********Pravda reported that he first approached the F.B.I. in November 1961 and later met American agents several times at the ''Kamerun Hotel,'' apparently a reference to the old Cameron Hotel on West 86th Street. Pravda said the C.I.A., which assumed control of him in Burma, later communicated through personal ads in the classified advertising section of The New York Times, all addressed to ''MOODY-Donald F.'' Such an ad appeared in The Times for 10 consecutive days in May 1964. **********American officials of that era said General Polyakov seemed invaluable, providing names of Soviet spies, details of G.R.U. operations and political information on the Government in Moscow. **********''Back in those days, there weren't too many defectors, and he was the best the bureau had,'' an official said. ''It was pretty big stuff.'' Who Misled Whom? **********Mr. Wright said Top Hat provided the F.B.I. with copies of stolen British defense documents, leading to the arrest of a major Soviet spy, Frank Bossard, by the British secret service. **********But Mr. Wright dismissed the tip as a Soviet attempt to generate rifts in the British-American alliance, since the documents in question contained top United States defense secrets. **********Other authors, including Mr. Epstein, say Top Hat and Fedora gave the F.B.I and C.I.A. data suggesting that Soviet nuclear missiles were far less accurate than they actually were. The misleading data, fed to the United States through the 1970's, misled the Nixon and Carter Administrations into making seriously flawed agreements with Moscow on limiting nuclear weapons, those writers contend. **********But another C.I.A. official said that Mr. Casey's review of the evidence refuted those charges, and that ''the record was pretty good as far as the analysis and conclusions'' about Soviet nuclear abilities were concerned."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/16/world/shopping-across-the-russia-estonia-border.html": {"writer_name": "Henry Kamm", "pub_date": "1990-12-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 684, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shopping Across the Russia-Estonia Border", "print_headline": "Shopping Across the Russia-Estonia Border", "body_text": " **********The bridge across the Narva River, guarded by medieval fortresses built by Estonia on this bank and by the czars on the other, links this industrial town to its twin of Ivangorod and marks the border between Estonia and Russia. **********It is the bond also between this town of shortages and high prices and its far poorer Russian neighbor, where store shelves are virtually bare. **********A 37-year-old metalworker, his fur cap pulled deep over his face against a freezing rain outside, turned from the counter of Ivangorod's biggest food store with nothing but a chunk of margarine and a bag of colored candy in his shopping basket.

Other articles explore parts of the city like Koreatown and trendy Melrose Avenue. **********To attract impulse buyers, who see the magazine in supermarkets, nearly every issue features a glamorous celebrity on the cover. **********Paul Benjou, executive director of Gaynor/Group One Communications Inc., a media management firm based in New York, said he expected Los Angeles magazine to fortify its strong position in the next decade. **********''Even national publications are turning to local markets because that's where opportunities exist,'' he said. '' 'Micromarketing' is a buzzword cropping up that means taking the focus away from the national level and addressing the local level, where the action is. The fact is that local publications address local issues and events more definitively than do the nationals. That gives them an edge at least into the 90's.'' **********One danger of local magazine publishing, Mr. Kuhn said, is that success is dependent in part on the strength of the local economy. This year, he said, Metrocorp's Philadelphia and Boston magazines have suffered partly because economic growth in the two cities is stifled. **********The same malaise could strike Los Angeles, though Mr. Miller said his magazine had avoided bad years by broadening its focus. **********''We had a thriving real estate section through the first real estate boom in the 1970's,'' he said. ''When that dropped almost overnight by at least half, we had other areas to turn to like travel. At other times, we had department store advertising. We have always had fallback areas so we have been able to avoid a tremendous down year.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/21/world/upheaval-in-the-east-poland-warsaw-cabinet-asked-to-move-up-elections.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1990-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 821, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: Poland;   Warsaw Cabinet Asked To Move Up Elections", "print_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: Poland;   Warsaw Cabinet Asked To Move Up Elections", "body_text": " **********Although Poland is the first East European nation since the early postwar years to install a government not dominated by Communists, many Poles are pressing the Solidarity-led Government to hasten political change. **********With Poles convinced that Czechoslovakia has leapfrogged ahead of them in the movement toward democracy, pressures have grown to advance the date of local elections so that municipal governments no longer remain undemocratic fiefs controlled by Communist officials. **********''The people are very impatient,'' said Grazyna Staniszewska, a member of Parliament from the Solidarity union federation. ''People are worried that although there have been changes in Parliament and in the national leadership, there have not been enough changes where people have most day-to-day contact - that is, towns and villages.'' **********Responding to this pressure, Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki said in a major address on Thursday that local elections should be scheduled for late in April. Government officials had previously talked of holding the elections in June or early in the autumn. **********'Authentic Local Government' **********''The most urgent of all jobs right now is to create an authentic local government system,'' said the Prime Minister, whose Cabinet took office in September, ending four decades of unchallenged Communist rule. ''Until authentic local government has been installed, we will not be able to defeat the resistance that we are encountering in trying to put our reforms into practice.'' **********Mr. Mazowiecki expressed the concerns of many advocates of change that the Communist apparatus, the nomenklatura, remains an obstacle at the national and local levels to carrying out the Government's program. **********In an essay this week in the newspaper Rzeczpospolita, Bronislaw Geremek, leader of Solidarity's delegation in Parliament, wrote, ''Local elections may become a powerful weapon in breaking up the nomenklatura at all levels of power and in shaking up local cliques.'' **********Many Solidarity officials also believe that local elections will create a surge in grass-roots political activity, which they say can promote improvement in areas like housing and the environment. **********Timetable for Voting **********Mr. Geremek wrote, ''The moment has come when we need to accelerate change, to again speed up the course of history.'' He called for holding local elections in the first half of 1990 and for preparing a new constitution this year, rather than next year, as has been planned. **********Some members of the Communist Party see blatant politics behind Solidarity's call for local elections this spring. **********They say the Government wants to give voters an exhilarating dose of local democracy to take their minds off the pain caused by Poland's crash economic program. The program, which went into effect on Jan. 1, is aimed at fighting inflation and changing Poland into a market economy. Since its start, most price controls have been removed, subsidies to consumers and industry slashed, and income lost by the majority of Poles. **********Slawomir Wiatr, a Communist legislator, said, ''There is an old saying from Rome: 'If you don't have bread, you organize circuses.' This is not the last of the festivities we'll see to exploit people's emotions.'' **********Both Groups Apprehensive **********Communists concede that their party will do poorly in local voting. At a congress scheduled for next weekend, the Communists are expected to dissolve their party and reconstitute themselves into one or more social democratic parties. **********And Solidarity officials admit that that holding local elections in April could also be risky for their group because of the painful price increases and layoffs that have resulting from the Government's economic program. **********The Government got good news late Friday night when striking miners at the Niwka Modrzejow coal mine in Sosnowiec agreed to end a four-day walkout for higher pay. Four other Silesian mines had agreed earlier in the day to end their walkouts.These strikes, prompted by wage controls, were the worst labor unrest since Mr. Mazowiecki took office. **********Solidarity and Communist members of Parliament are convinced that, barring unforeseen obstacles, local balloting will in fact be held late in April or early in May. **********Future of Jaruzelski **********More quietly, there is talk about moving up the date for the next presidential election, which is scheduled for six years from now. ''It's not discussed out loud, but you can tell the feeling is growing,'' said Mr. Staniszewska of Solidarity. **********Such a move could be seen as an affront to President Wojciech Jarulzelski, the Communist general who acceded to the political changes that led to last year's Parliament elections and the Solidarity-led Cabinet. **********Many politicians say, however, that if General Jarulzelski is convinced that Poland is in a stable, healthy state, he would decide not to run rather than risk a political campaign."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/07/business/for-airlines-a-heated-push-into-the-pacific-rim.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Weiner", "pub_date": "1990-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2143, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "For Airlines, a Heated Push Into the Pacific Rim", "print_headline": "For Airlines, a Heated Push Into the Pacific Rim", "body_text": " **********A few years ago, Jerry Connelly, a fashion executive in New York who flies regularly to the Far East, booked his flights to cities like Hong Kong a just few days ahead of time. But no more. ''Now you need at least a week or two's notice,'' he said. ''Sometimes I can't even get a seat then.'' **********Mr. Connelly's frustration is a sign of the airline industry's Asian bonanza. Spurred by the blossoming economies and relaxed travel policies in countries like Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore, air travel to and from Asia is booming and airlines are clamoring to grab a chunk of the fastest-growing market in the world. ''United States carriers are gaga about the Asian market,'' said John Ash, managing director of Global Aviation, a consulting firm in Washington. ''Everybody wants a piece of it.'' But it won't come easily. Certain Asian countries like Japan do not have open-sky policies and therefore prohibit carriers from flying into their airports at will. And airports are already congested, especially in travel-crazed Japan. While new long-range jets could help alleviate overcrowding by bypassing current stopovers, production of these planes has been hamstrung by labor strikes. What is more, Asian airlines, with their lower labor costs and reputation for attentive service, are proving to be tough competitors. **********And rivalries in the Far East among American carriers are also expected to heat up. Until recently, Asia was the domain of two United States lines: Northwest Airlines and United Air Lines. But others, like American, Delta and Continental, have gained a toehold in the region in recent years. Northwest now commands only 42 percent, and United 29 percent, of the travel in the Pacific handled by American carriers. **********The newcomers, dividing the remaining 29 percent of that travel, are primed to expand. ''The American carriers are chafing at the bit, wishing they could fly from, say, Chicago to Tokyo,'' said Mary Hunt, editor of Business Traveler International. **********New Routes Ahead **********An agreement signed in November by the United States and Japan could enable more of them to establish routes into Tokyo, the gateway to the Pacific rim. **********Last Thursday, Washington formally opened bidding for six routes provided for under the accord, which could increase air service between the two nations by 30 percent. Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner called the pact ''the most dramatic expansion of air services to Japan since the original bilateral agreement was signed in 1952.'' **********But Northwest and United are the least likely of the American carriers to win rights to the new routes. To stimulate competition, the Transportation Department said it is more inclined to award those routes to carriers that currently have less of a Pacific presence. **********The two carriers still rely heavily on that traffic. Pacific flights now account for more than half of Northwest's revenues, and for 30 percent of United's. While United's domestic traffic has dropped slightly, its Pacific traffic soared nearly 24 percent over the last year. **********United made its big push into the Pacific in 1985 with its $750 million purchase of Pan American World Airways's extensive Pacific routes - one of the largest acquisitions of such a network in the industry and, in retrospect, one of the shrewdest. ''At least initially, there will be enough room for everybody,'' said Raymond Neidl, an analyst with Dillon, Reed. ''But the competition will begin to erode their market share.'' **********The Pacific routes are rich with business travelers and, until recently, relatively competition-free. In general, long flights are more profitable for airlines than short hops, since they do not require as many employees on the ground. And in the Pacific, airlines need not discount as many seats as they do on European flights. **********Indeed, keeping planes filled is hardly a problem. Traffic between North America and Asia is expected to grow at about 10 percent annually for at least the next decade, about twice as fast as the rate within the United States. And cargo traffic there is also on the rise. ''It's the growth market for the 1990's,'' said Kevin Murphy, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. **********The Japanese, riding a strong yen, are leading the boom. In 1986, 5.5 million Japanese traveled abroad. In 1989, it was 10 million. **********The Koreans and Taiwanese are also traveling more. Last year Korea relaxed age restrictions on travel for its citizens, who previously had to be 50 years or older to travel freely. The threshold age was lowered to 30 in 1987 and the restriction was lifted altogether last year. As a result, the number of Koreans traveling abroad is expected to double this year. Likewise, the number of Taiwanese travelers is expected to double to four million people by the decade's end. ''Suddenly there's a new lode of people who can afford air travel,'' said Michael Hewitt, secretary general of the Orient Airlines Association in Manila. **********The one Asian country where the airlines are not deploying more airplanes is mainland China. Since the Tiananmen Square uprising in May, Northwest has cut its flights from Osaka to Shanghai to one a week, from two. **********But the surge in travel has clogged the Pacific airways and even caused shortages of hotel rooms in certain cities like Bangkok. Load factors, or the percentage of seats filled, on Pacific routes now average 70 percent or better, compared with 64 percent in the United States. And Asia, as an archipelago, has no land-transportation alternatives linking its countries to offer relief. **********Clogged Airports **********The International Air Transport Association has flagged airports in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Bombay and Sydney as the region's most congested. ''The capacity of airports is being stretched to the limits,'' said Ken Chamberlain, executive vice president of the Pacific Asia Travel Association. ''Travel is an increasingly difficult experience.'' **********''Flights for the last year were chock-a-block,'' said Richard Chao, owner of Taiwan Travel, a travel agency in Taipei. ''The public isn't happy with the airline situation here. There isn't much flexibility.'' **********To relieve congestion, Hong Kong is building a new $5 billion airport to replace Kai Tak International, which, with its single runway surrounded by mountains, is dreaded by pilots and passengers. Meanwhile, Japan is building a new airport near Osaka on a man-made island - well clear of communities that have insisted on an 8:30 P.M. curfew at the current airport. **********But the biggest bottleneck in Asia is Tokyo's Narita Airport. With only one runway, it is already operating 40 percent over its capacity of 13 million passengers a year. An attempt to build more runways has run headlong into fierce opposition from local farmers and other landowners. **********Alternative Gateways **********Given this congestion, airlines are looking for alternatives gateways to the Pacific. Both United and Northwest, for instance, are developing Seoul as a ''mini hub'' for the region. **********And many carriers have placed orders for a new, extra-long-range jumbo jet, the Boeing 747-400, that could enable them to fly nonstop from the United States to Seoul or Bangkok with a full passenger load. United, for one, has 15 747-400's on order, all of which will be deployed on the Pacific routes. **********The trouble is, a backlog of orders and an eight-week strike at Boeing has stalled delivery of the jets to many airlines and forced them to delay their expansion plans. Japan Airlines has delayed its expansion until 1991 as it awaits delivery of 15 Boeing jumbo jets, a company spokesman said. **********Unlike the American and European air-travel markets, where battles are fought with super-saver fares and bonus mileage, the contest for the Pacific market is being waged with fine china and after-dinner drinks. Asian carriers like Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific have a reputation for pampering their passengers to extremes unheard of in the United States. ''There's no way a Western carrier can compete with an Asian one on service,'' said Mr. Starkman, the analyst. **********But American carriers are trying. At a cost of $45 million, United is revamping the business-class sections on its 747's and DC-10's, adding wider seats and more flight attendants. On occasion, it also dispatches an employee to fly on a rival's flight to report on the quality of service. ''These are among the best airlines in the world'' said William C. Speicher, senior vice president of Pacific marketing for United. ''Its tough competition. There's no doubt about it.'' **********Northwest, under its new owner, hotelier Alfred Checchi, is attempting to shift its image as a discount airline. It recently began an advertising campaign in America that reminds potential passengers that telephones are pink in Hong Kong and that one shouldn't slurp noodles in Taiwan. And the airline, which has been flying the Pacific routes for 42 years, now offers such ammenities as concierge service at the airport and in-flight ice cream sundaes. ''We could never do something like this between Minneapolis and Chicago,'' said Robert Gibbons, a company spokesman. ''When you have passengers for 8 to 14 hours, you can pamper them.'' **********The airlines are emphasizing service on their Asian flights because of the high percentage of business travelers, who generally pay more for their tickets and are most likely to bring repeat business. **********For instance, the 747's that Japan Air Line flies between New York and Tokyo are outfitted with 196 first-class and business-class seats and only 60 coach. Pacific flights are popular with business executives in part because some employers prohibit business-class travel across the Atlantic but permit it for the longer transPacific flights. **********In assimilating to Asian culture, American airlines have made some blunders. When United began its concierge service in Tokyo, it identified its employees by having them wear white carnations. In Japan, the color symbolizes death and mourning. United switched to red. **********And American carriers may not have bargained for such tough competition. Asian carriers bring more than their sparkling service. They bring impressive bankrolls. Japan Airlines, which was privatized in 1987, is investing $6.1 billion in new planes, maintenance facilities and computer reservation equipment. All Nippon Airlines, Japan's largest domestic airline, has begun to fly to Los Angeles and Washington, and is gearing up for a major expansion into the United States. **********To compete for American passengers looking to fly to the Far East, Asian carriers are also beginning to match the Americans' most potent marketing tool - frequent-flier programs. For instance, passengers on Philippine airlines can earn a free trip after racking up 30,000 miles - only three round trips to the United States. American carriers require more than double that travel for a free trip. **********To woo travel agents, the Asians pay a handsome 26 percent commission on flights to and from the Far East - a move that United and Northwest have followed. Travel agents earn about 10 percent on American business. **********Of course, American airlines still have one critical advantage with consumers: their strong domestic feeder systems. Foreign airlines are prohibitted from flying between two American cities. **********The coming battle for the Asian and American carriers is for control of the computer reservation systems being developed in the Far East. About two-thirds of the airline tickets sold for transPacific flights are purchased in Asia. But fewer travel agencies use computer reservations systems there than in the United States. The airlines that succeed in linking up with the new systems will go a long way toward determining the long-term survivors. ''The computer systems are up for grabs,'' Mr. Speicher said. ''There aren't real strong alliances in one camp or another.'' **********For now, thought, attention is focused on the new flights between Tokyo and America, which are scheduled to begin in October. The six new routes could mean 125 more flights a week. Virtually every major American carrier has applied for the right to fly one of the routes. Officials in cities like Houston, Denver, Phoenix and Miami have also aggressively lobbied Washington for airline service from their communities to Asia. **********Regardless of who wins the new routes, however, one thing is unlikely to change. In terms of air travel, the United States will continue to have a trade surplus with Japan. ''This is a wonderful aberration in the U.S. and Japan trade picture,'' said Jeffrey Shane the Transportation Department official who was the architect of the recent agreement with Japan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/30/business/currency-markets-dollar-rises-against-yen-and-mark.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1990-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 648, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dollar Rises Against Yen And Mark", "print_headline": "CURRENCY MARKETS; Dollar Rises Against Yen And Mark", "body_text": " **********The dollar surged yesterday, jumping more than 2 percent against the Japanese yen and more than 1 percent against the German mark. **********The rally, which pushed the dollar over the 1.50 level against the mark and 133 against the yen, is the first significant break upward for the dollar in months.

Big Drop for Yen **********The yen, which fell the most, is also hurt from concern about the Japanese economy and from the fear of a string of business failures after the Kyowa Company announced its bankruptcy filing this week. The yen has also fallen sharply against European currencies, including the mark, reflecting a negative feeling about the currency that is temporarily overshadowing the bearish sentiment for the dollar.

The penalties are the cornerstone of a $30 million sentencing agreement with the Justice Department, which also covered a number of disputes that have not led to criminal or civil charges. **********The three-year inquiry on the battlefield computer case, conducted by the Pentagon and the United States Attorney in Philadelphia, was one of many investigations of military contractors begun in the 1980's as the nation's weapons spending increased sharply. **********In February, the Northrop Corporation agreed to pay $17 million for falsifying test data on components of the Cruise missile and the Harrier jet. The largest military fraud settlement was reached in 1988, when the Sundstrand Corporation paid $115 million for overbilling the Government for military hardware. Sundstrand's billings included the cost of numerous executive perquisites, including country club dues and salaries for servants. **********Michael J. Rotko, the Acting United States Attorney in charge of the case, said the conviction and the sentence ''should send an important message to defense contractors that the United States will use all the weapons in its arsenal to protect the integrity of the defense procurement process.'' **********In an unusual feature, the G.E. agreement includes $11.7 million to settle several other Government complaints, which had not resulted in lawsuits. In those disputes, the Government argued that the company had padded 400 bids that affected 200 contracts it received and had engaged in other unlawful activities on a number of military and space-related contracts. **********''G.E. and the Government viewed this case as an opportunity to close the books on a number of other matters,'' said Catherine Votaw, an assistant United States attorney in Philadelphia. **********The battlefield computer case involved products that the company began producing for use in Army vehicles in 1983 under a $254 million contract. After a 14-week criminal trial, the company in February was convicted of defrauding the Government by not reporting a savings of $8 million it realized when subcontractors supplied components at prices that were lower than had been expected. The company faced a maximum fine of $71.9 million. **********Statement by the Judge **********The settlement included a promise by G.E. not to appeal its conviction or the sentence. In handing down the sentence as recommended by the Government in the settlement, United States District Judge Lowell Reed Jr. described it as ''fair, adequate, and in the best interest of the public.'' **********G.E. and the Government said in a joint statement that the sentencing agreement reflected the company's recent record of ''significant efforts'' to guarantee compliance with Government procurement laws and regulations. They told Judge Reed that his acceptance of the agreement would encourage other contractors to strengthen compliance programs. **********About 400 employees are now charged with overseeing compliance in the company's aerospace group, which is responsible for most of its military contracts, according to George Jamison, a company spokesman. The company has also adopted new disciplinary codes, stepped up outside auditing and expanded its training. Some 12,500 employees attended training programs in the last two years, Mr. Jamison said. **********Two Managers Convicted **********Two managers of the subsidiary, Gerald A. Leo and James Badolato, were convicted along with the company in the February trial. Mr. Rotko, the prosecutor, said that there had been evidence at the trial that the superiors of the two employees had ''looked the other way while fraud was committed.'' But no other G.E. employees were charged. **********Mr. Leo, a former purchasing manager who is 52 years old, was sentenced yesterday by Judge Reed to 10 months in prison and fined $15,000 for four counts of mail fraud and one count of trying to deceive Federal investigators. He plans to appeal, according to Seymour Toll, his attorney. **********Mr. Badolato, a former subcontracts manager who is 43, was convicted of misleading auditors and submitting false documents. He was sentenced to five months in prison and fined $10,000. Gregory Miller, his attorney, said Mr. Badolato also intends to appeal. **********Both men were suspended by G.E. in 1983 when the dispute began. **********''There are huge disputes about the facts in this case,'' Mr. Toll said yesterday.

Welch Jr., the company's chairman, when the settlement was announced and he could not be reached last night. **********The agreement was reported on the evening news broadcast on NBC, a network owned by G.E. **********The other disputes settled yesterday mainly involved longstanding bidding practices that the company voluntarily disclosed to the Government. In one of them, known as gross rate protection, the company padded its projected labor costs by sums equivalent to the cost of administrative expenses and other activities that it expected the Government would not be willing to pay for in a proposed contract. The settlement included triple compensation for the cost of such padding. **********The total $11.7 million compensation on the matters unrelated to the battlefield computer represented an adjustment of 1 percent in the value of the contracts involved, Mr. Jamison said. **********Ms. Votaw said that only one dispute remains between her office and the company - a disagreement over whether the company included illegal contingencies and reserves in a number of big contracts signed between 1982 and 1985. The two sides are continuing to discuss the matter. **********In addition to $10 million in criminal penalties and $6.1 million in civil fines, the portion of the settlement related to the battlefield computer included $2.2 million that the company agreed to pay as restitution for the overcharges. The company said that it had already paid $3.7 million in 1985 in a previous restitution agreement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/24/world/confrontation-gulf-last-planned-refugee-flight-iraq-arrives-us.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-09-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 134, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Last Planned Refugee Flight From Iraq Arrives in the U.S.", "print_headline": "CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;   Last Planned Refugee Flight From Iraq Arrives in the U.S.", "body_text": " **********A jet carrying 112 people from Iraqi-occupied Kuwait arrived in the United States today after a flight from Baghdad via London. **********The DC-10 landed at Raleigh-Durham airport.

Fear of Panic Buying **********In this day of economic separatism, the program is the most far-reaching experiment yet to protect one republic's stores from being stripped by panic buying, black-market speculators and visitors from other republics. **********Other republics and cities have increasingly sought to impose stability in their markets with various forms of protectionism. Rationing coupons for essential goods are common in much of the country. Many cities, including Moscow, have sharply restricted shopping by consumers who cannot prove that they are local residents. **********Estonia, a Baltic republic, has established customs posts on its borders to prevent outsiders from leaving with trunkloads of consumer items. **********The Ukraine's system, sprung on the public with little advance notice by the republic's government, works this way: On payday, every worker gets his usual salary in rubles, plus coupons showing a face value equivalent to 70 percent of his pay.  What Coupons Buy **********For most purchases of industrial goods, food and gasoline, a shopper must pay the price in rubles along with an equivalent amount in coupons. **********Rubles can be used without coupons for rent, bus fare, most services, medicine and basic food items that have not yet fallen into short supply in the Ukraine, including bread, milk and baby food. The policy also provides an elaborate procedure for consumers who want to use savings for major purchases like cars. **********The measure was drafted in secrecy and disclosed only a few days ago to prevent a buying panic. The Parliament of the republic declined to block the plan on Wednesday. **********Vitold P. Fokin, acting Prime Minister of the Ukraine, told Soviet television that the coupons would help balance supply and demand and bring order to the marketplace. **********\"For the last two or three years, in all republics, we've had all kinds of rationing coupons, identification badges and passport rules,\" he said. \"Until now, the Ukraine has refrained from introducing such extreme and unpopular measures and has tried to cope with a mass exodus of goods from the republic by increasing its production. But we became convinced that this was not effective.\"  Playing to Ukrainian Sentiment **********Ukrainian officials argued that since only Ukrainians will have the coupons, the system will prevent the flow of scarce products to other republics. This also plays to the growing sense of Ukrainian patriotism that has fueled a nationalist political opposition. **********Critics said the system would aggravate political and commercial relations with neighboring republics and would probably not work. **********Oleg S. Bai, an aide to the Ukrainian Parliament, said the new coupons -- which he described as \"shadow money\" -- would themselves quickly become a black-market item. **********\"They are already selling coupons in the pedestrian underpasses,\" he said. **********Confusion prevailed in many stores, as clerks and shoppers tried to figure out the system. Many customers did not realize that the coupons must be used together with rubles.  No Change Given **********Quarrels broke out because the coupons come only in denominations of a ruble or more. **********\"If you buy sausage or cheese for 2.28 rubles, nobody knows what to do,\" said Marina Taran, a reporter for Kiev radio. \"My daughter says her girlfriend tried, and the shop tried to take three coupons.

Cohen as chairman and chief executive. His replacement, Howard L. Clark Jr., has been chief financial officer at the American Express Company, Shearson's corporate parent. Though Mr. Clark was once an investment banker himself, he is likely to have Shearson adopt the conservative ways of American Express, where traveler's check receipts are invested in safe, short-term municipal securities. Riskier activies - merchant banking, real estate and bridge loans - might be trimmed. Analysts say Shearson will gradually devote more effort to retail brokerage. American Express, after all, is a consumer company. **********The Exchange After Phelan **********Now comes the New York Stock Exchange's chance to see how well it can get along without John J. Phelan Jr. He announced Friday that he would retire as exchange chairman by the end of the year. Mr. Phelan has won credit for turning an exchange that was becoming anachronistic and conflict-ridden in the 1970's into one capable of trading hundreds of millions of shares a day with no strain. Balancing the rival interests of floor traders and investment houses, he convinced the exchange to invest hundreds of millions on computer technlogy. And after the 1987 crash, he gave investors reassurance and calm. A former floor trader himself, he began at the exchange as a runner. **********Whipping Up the Product Mix **********The Philip Morris Companies sold more food than tobacco for the first time in 1989. But even after buying Kraft and its food brands - Jell-O, Cheez Whiz - in December 1988, the company still finds that tobacco accounts for about 65 percent of annual earnings. Philip Morris reported last week that fourth-quarter profits more than doubled to $863 million. *********** **********Coca-Cola profited from leaving the movie business. A $509 million gain from selling its interest in Columbia Pictures more than tripled fourth-quarter earnings, to $757 million. *********** **********The nation's largest steel company had a fourth quarter that appeared to repay its diversification into oil. Higher energy prices helped USX increase earnings 54 percent to $244 million. *********** **********Caesars World, it seems, got slaughtered at the baccarat tables. The company predicted sharply lower earnings for the quarter ending Jan. 31, and blamed bad luck in the casinos. As Henry Gluck, the company's chief executive, said, ''The laws of probability work in strange ways.'' *********** **********At Boeing, a 48-day strike cut fourth-quarter earnings 56 percent to $77 million. **********One of Europe's largest drug companies said Friday it plans to buy a majority stake in Genentech Inc., the pioneering American biotechnology company. Roche Holding Ltd. of Switzerland is to invest $2.1 million for a 60 percent share of the company, with an option to buy the rest. As part of the agreement, Robert A. Swanson, Genentech's chief executive, would become chairman and G. Kirk Raab, president, would replace him. **********An Optical Computer? **********It looks like the runner-up in a high school science fair. But the first optical computer, displayed last week, already has the ability to perform some operations as quickly as huge supercomputers. Researchers at A.T.&T.'s Bell Labs who developed the device hope that in several years optical computers will far surpass conventional machines. Instead of electric currents and silicon chips, the new computer uses laser beams, mirrors and lenses. Some scientists scoff at its commercial potential, while others foresee an optical computer on the market in a decade. **********Executives on the Move **********A five-year, $10 million package convinced Allen I. Questrom to become chief executive of Allied Stores and Federated Department Stores on Friday. Questrom had initially turned down the job in favor of remaining chief executive of Neiman Marcus. *********** **********The Campeau Corporation might not sell Bloomingdale's after all. Federated Stores Inc., the company's American subsidiary, plans to spend the next month or two deciding whether to accept one of several bids. Meanwhile, Robert Campeau himself might be joining his stores in insolvency. Available records indicate that his $500 million fortune has shrunk with the plunge in Campeau stock, and he is in default on two major bank loans. *********** **********Thomas S. Murphy, who built Capital Cities/ABC Inc. from a bankrupt UHF television station in Albany into a $5 billion media empire, said Thursday that he will step down as chief executive May 31. Daniel B. Burke, the company president, is to succeed him. **********S.&L.'s - It's Not Over Yet **********Savings and loan news: Federal regulators seized Centrust Bank, Florida's largest savings and loan, on Friday. They said that management had wasted assets on yachts, art and oriental rugs. The regulators also announced on Friday the sale of Bright Banc Savings Association, one of Texas's largest S.&L.'s, to the Banc One Corporation of Columbus, Ohio. On the brighter side, American Savings Bank, of California, sold to the Robert M. Bass Group more than a year ago, reported a $214.2 million profit for 1989. **********THE ECONOMY **********Greenspan on Recession **********Don't count on the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest rates soon. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told Congress last Tuesday that, based on the Government's index of leading economic indicators, his staff sees only a 20 percent chance of a recession in the next six months. The economic index, released Wednesday, rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in December, the largest gain since April, even after accounting for the end of the Boeing strike in late November. But another figure last week pointed to continuing weakness. New home sales fell 9.6 percent in December and 3.8 percent for all of 1989, making it the slowest year since 1984. **********Job Data, the Good and the Bad **********Unemployment edged down one-tenth of a point to 5.2 percent in January. But Friday's unemployment report may not be as healthy as it seems. Manufacturing jobs fell for the 10th straight month, with the auto industry hit hardest. And Richard B. Freeeman, for one, a Harvard economist, argued that stagnant real wages are a more accurate guide to the economy than low, stable unemployment. ''If we hold the same unemployment rate for the next 20 years and do not have any real wage growth, that would be a disaster,'' he said. Recent wage improvements have only matched inflation, he added. *********** **********Renewed aircraft business after the Boeing strike contributed to a 1.9 percent rise in factory orders for December. But excluding transportation, orders rose just two-tenths of 1 percent. **********The Bush Budget **********President Bush gave Congress a budget last week that would restrain military spending, lower capital gains taxes, expand some domestic programs while cutting others and sharply reduce the budget deficit. Democrats dismissed it as an impossible, impractical relic of the Reagan years. They reacted more warmly Wednesday night when the President, in his first State of the Union message, proposed sharp new reductions in Soviet and United States troops in Europe. Behind the budget battles this year will lie a fight over economics. The Bush Administration assumes a healthy 2.6 percent economic growth rate; the Congressional Budget Office, 1.8 percent. If the President is right, the deficit will meet his target of $63 billion; if Congress is right, the deficit will be $100 billion. The consensus of private economists is on the side of Congress. But the Administration was more optimistic than Congress and the economists last year - and the Administration turned out to be right. **********INTERNATIONAL **********ast and East, Head to Head **********The opening of Eastern Europe and the availability of its low-wage labor force could hobble some Asian economies. Asia may be able to produce textiles and shoes more cheaply, but Eastern Europe offers better-educated workers to handle technology and electronics. As Ed Hewett, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, put it, that Asia's ''four tigers'' - South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong -have less to fear than their poorer neighbors around the Pacific. With Eastern European workers available for capitalism, he said, ''It's almost as if you suddenly created a Philippines in the middle of Europe.'' But Eastern Europe's situation is ''like the Philippines in other ways,'' Mr. Hewett cautioned. ''Troubled.'' **********McDonald's in Moscow **********The workings of digestible materialism culminated Wednesday in the opening of the Soviet Union's first McDonald's. The chain's largest restaurant, smack on Moscow's Pushkin Square, was mobbed with customers eager for ''Beeg Meks.'' For McDonald's, the toughest task was drilling Soviet farmers and counter help in the ways of standardized production and relentless good cheer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/29/world/evolution-in-europe-constituent-lobby-calls-for-yeltsin-s-election.html": {"writer_name": "Celestine Bohlen", "pub_date": "1990-05-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 769, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Constituent Lobby Calls For Yeltsin's Election", "print_headline": "EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;   Constituent Lobby Calls For Yeltsin's Election", "body_text": " **********Members of the Russian Parliament returned today to the task of choosing a president of the republic, and reported that they were being inundated by telegrams and phone calls from angry, impatient voters urging them to stop stalling and elect Boris N. Yeltsin, a rival of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. **********''We all feel the hot breath of the voters,'' said Dmitri Volkogonov, a military historian and Yeltsin supporter who declined to become a compromise candidate as the election process went into its fourth day. **********Three candidates, including Mr. Yeltsin, are competing in another round of voting scheduled for Tuesday. **********In a runoff election Saturday, Mr. Yeltsin, an increasingly formidable critic and rival to Mr. Gorbachev, fell 28 votes short of the required 531 votes, a majority of the 1,060 members of the Russian Parliament. **********Yeltsin Bid to Conservatives **********Today, Mr. Yeltsin, who has the backing of the liberal Democratic Russia coalition, tried to break the deadlock by offering to form a coalition government with his conservative opponents. **********In the first two rounds of voting last week, Mr. Yeltsin was opposed by a solid bloc of deputies loyal to the Commmunist Party apparatus. Their choice in the first rounds of balloting was Ivan K. Polozkov, a hard-liner. **********Today, Mr. Polozkov withdrew his nomination as the party swung its support behind Aleksandr V. Vlasov, the Prime Minister of the republic, whose career has been closely linked to that of Mr. Gorbachev. **********Mr. Vlasov took himself out of the running last week after he was sharply criticized for a tepid performance in defense of government policies. Rejoining the race, he confirmed that he had dropped out because he chose not ''to oppose a candidate backed by the party Central Committee.'' **********Yeltsin Too Radical for Some **********The party's switch in tactics would offer moderate Communists a more acceptable option to Mr. Yeltsin, who is seen by many as too radical and headstrong. But by hastily dropping one candidate for another, the party has also reminded deputies - and their electors - that old-style subservience is still expected of members of the Communist Party apparatus. **********But several deputies, speaking from the lectern today, indicated that the wishes of the Communist Party were no longer relevant. A delegate from Mr. Polozkov's Krasnodar district, said the reports from back home were clear. ''The people are ready only for Yeltsin,'' he said. **********A delegate from the textile city of Ivanovo reported the results of one informal poll that showed 3,700 respondents out of total of 3,716 as backing Mr. Yeltsin. A deputy from the Far East said 90 percent of telegrams from Vladivostok were in support of Mr. Yeltsin. **********''The train of national consensus is already on its way,'' said a collective farm chairman. ''And I am referring not just to the people who go to meetings, but to the average people.'' **********Mr. Yeltsin already has strong support from the liberal strongholds in Moscow and Leningrad and from industrial regions in the Urals, where he served as a party leader before coming to Moscow in 1986. **********His popularity dates back to his conflict with Mr. Gorbachev and hard-liners in the Politburo in 1987 - which led to his resignation as head of the Moscow Communist Party organization. He is now hugely popular, and is widely seen as a credible alternative to Mr. Gorbachev - a leader who has captured the faith of an otherwise deeply skeptical population. **********Debate an Embarrassment **********Several deputies proposed various coalition combinations for the Russian Republic as a way of closing the long election debate, which has been televised nationally in full and at times has become a political embarrassment in advance of Mr. Gorbachev's departure for Canada and the United States. **********Deputies report that when they go home, voters tell them they should be ashamed of wasting time bickering over procedures. **********Today, another stormy protest broke out when the presiding officer proposed that both Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Polozkov, as losers in the runoff election Saturday, should be barred from running again. **********Angry Yeltsin supporters stormed the podium, interrupting debate for 15 minutes, until the chairman reversed himself, ruling that the two men could be candidates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/13/business/new-england-bank-strategy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-03-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 278, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New England Bank Strategy", "print_headline": "New England Bank Strategy", "body_text": " **********Lawrence K.

What precisely is the cause of VMS's problems? **********A. Although I have not talked to the company, my best sense is that VMS's problems do not relate to the syndication process itself but rather to VMS's activity as a developer. Either with its own funds or with bank loans or with someone else's money, VMS has done what developers normally do: It has acquired land and built on it, and some of its projects just have not worked out. Either buildings didn't lease up or they didn't get the rents they had expected. **********There is also a problem of size here. If you buy one property in a down market, you might get lucky and pick one that will do well. But if you are like VMS and are buying $1 billion in property and you are broadly based, you will do as well as real estate in general in the last few years - not very well. **********Q. How likely are VMS's individual lenders to get their money back? **********A. To answer that, I would need to know the stage of development of the properties that are securing VMS loans. I would need to know how long it will be before VMS's buildings begin servicing their debt and renegotiated debt. And even if I had all the information about VMS's properties, I would still be giving you only a seat-of-the-pants response. The reason is that part of the answer is imponderable because it is anybody's guess as to what will happen to realty markets. **********Q. Should we conclude from VMS's experience that other syndicators are in deep financial trouble? **********A. No. The basic reason is that there is not a lot of construction lending in syndication. There used to be back in 1981, when there were tax advantages associated with the construction phase of lending, but that is no longer the case. Most syndication today involves either ownership of buildings or lending against completed, occupied structures. **********Q. Is tighter regulation of syndicators needed? **********A. Have you ever heard of the Securities and Exchange Commission? Have you ever heard of the North American Securities Administrators Association? Both of them already regulate syndication. The problem is that no regulation in the world can prevent a bad investment. When problems arise in partnerships it is typically from the investment rather than the money-raising process. Saying we need more regulation of syndicators is like saying that we should tighten regulation of mutual funds that do not perform well. What's at fault is not legislatable or regulatable: investment judgment. **********Q. How have syndicators performed relative to other money managers? **********A. Nineteen percent of all mutual funds have lost money in the last three years on a total return basis. Our estimate is that real estate syndicators turned in about the same performance. **********Q. What is the outlook for real estate partnerships? **********A. The outlook is grim, and it will depend on the real estate cycle itself. We have been in a significant bear market for real estate over the last three to five years. When rents start to go up and building values rise, people will perceive a change in the investment environment for real estate and will be interested again in partnerships. Until that happens, they won't be interested. **********Q. Even though the near-term outlook is grim, might this be precisely the time to buy into real estate parnterships? **********A. Rather than reading all the negative headlines and being scared, I'd say that reading those headlines is a condition to finding a bottom of the real estate market. If the headline says, ''Don't touch it with a 10-foot pole,'' the contrarian says, ''Buy it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/07/business/condominiums-in-connecticut-with-sales-strong-a-greenwich-builder.html": {"writer_name": "Diana Shaman", "pub_date": "1990-12-07", "snippet": "At a time when many builders in the New York metropolitan area are cutting prices to attract buyers, a Greenwich, Conn., developer, Glenville Associates-Hawthorne, has been raising prices because its sales have been so strong.\n\nThe price increases...", "word_count": 698, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Condominiums in Connecticut;\nWith Sales Strong, a Greenwich Builder Raises Prices", "print_headline": "Condominiums in Connecticut;\nWith Sales Strong, a Greenwich Builder Raises Prices", "body_text": " **********At a time when many builders in the New York metropolitan area are cutting prices to attract buyers, a Greenwich, Conn., developer, Glenville Associates-Hawthorne, has been raising prices because its sales have been so strong. **********The price increases at the 80-unit Hawthorne condominium have averaged less than 10 percent since sales began in March. Still, the increases indicate that there is still a strong market for housing that gives purchasers the features they want. The project, a mix of town houses and apartments, is being built on a six-acre site in Glenville, a section of Greenwich. **********Of the 18 units in the first phase, which was ready for occupancy in May, 17 are sold. Occupancy of the 16 units in the second phase began this week. Eight of those, including all four of the three-bedroom town houses, are sold. And of the 29 units in the project's third phase, on which construction has just begun, eight are under contract. A fourth phase will be built later. **********The condos range from one-bedroom apartments to two-bedroom duplexes. The eight purchasers in the final phase had only floor plans to go by, and cannot move in until June. **********\"There is always a demand for housing, even in a lousy market,\" said Steven J. Schacter, who is developing the project as a joint venture with Tony Schneider of Philadelphia and Seymour Schwartz and his son, Eric, of Greenwich. \"We bought our land in 1979,\" Mr. Schachter said, \"so we are able to sell at better prices and in a better location than people who bought in the 1980's and paid through the nose for inferior sites.\" **********Prices range from $149,900 for a 650-square-foot, one-bedroom unit in an elevator building to $354,900 for a three-bedroom, 1,500-square-foot town house. Bett McCarthy, executive vice president of the Greenwich Board of Realtors, said such prices were reasonable for new construction in Greenwich. In that affluent community, unlike many other areas, prices have remained relatively stable even as the number of sales has fallen, she said. **********The median selling price of condominiums, which include new and resale units, listed by the Greenwich Multiple Listing Service dropped from $320,000 in October 1989 to $300,000 in October 1990. But the median selling price for houses, $675,000, was the same in October as a year earlier, she said. The number of sales, however, has fallen since 1987. In the first 10 months of this year, there were 519 sales, compared with 581 in the comparable period last year and 706 in 1987. **********Part of the attraction of Hawthorne is its setting. Glenville's shops and restaurants are within walking distance, and the houses are being built high on a hill overlooking the Byram River. They also overlook a historic restoration of a cotton mill. **********Glenville grew up around the mill, which was established in the late 1700's. The original mill buildings were destroyed, but several built in the late 19th century have been restored and turned into offices and shops by a partnership of Mr. Schachter's uncle, Ralph Schachter, and Seymour Schwartz. They purchased the mill property in 1979. **********The six-acre Hawthorne tract, at Pemberwick and Glenville Roads, was taken over by Glenville Associates in 1989 for development as a separate entity, but it is also the final phase of development for the whole 30-acre mill complex. **********The first stage of development was completed five years ago. That phase, called the Mill, includes the office and retail compound as well as two residential condominiums with a total of 58 units. Of the total of 30 acres, about half, including woods adjoining the Hawthorne tract, has been set aside as permanent open space. **********A 120-year-old railroad station has been converted into small shops. Another 65,000 square feet of mostly new construction, designed to blend with the mill buildings, contains offices, shops and 12 residential rental units. **********A 100-year-old Victorian house on the mill property was also restored and converted to offices. The architect of the Mill, Robert Schwartz of Greenwich, is also the architect of Hawthorne. **********Of the 80 units, 19 will have one bedroom, 43 will have two bedrooms and 18, three.

The accord is expected at a meeting in London next week. **********Bush Administration officials said the United States expected to contribute $20 million to $25 million to the fund, which would total $150 million to $250 million. Today's announcement did not change the expected amount of the American contribution. **********Scientific Findings **********Although the amount of money involved is relatively small, White House officials led by the chief of staff, John H. Sununu, originally opposed setting up a new fund rather than providing the same amount of aid through existing institutions like the World Bank. The White House feared that a new fund would set a precedent for expensive new foreign aid programs on the environment. **********Chlorofluorocarbons and certain other chlorine-containing chemicals produced by industry have been found by scientists to be severely depleting ozone molecules in the upper atmosphere. That ozone shields the earth's surface from excessive ultraviolet radiation from the sun, which can cause skin cancer and cataracts and suppress the immune system in humans; the radiation also damages crops and wildlife. **********The White House has been under heavy domestic and international pressure to reverse its decision. Many other countries have warned that the American opposition to a fund to help the poorer countries could undermine the effort to bar future production of chlorofluorocarbons. **********Thatcher Writes Bush **********Last week, for example, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain wrote to President Bush urging him to reconsider, Administration officials say. On Tuesday, Mustafa K. Tolba, executive director of the United Nations Environmental Program, called on the United States to provide help to the developing countries. Environmental organizations and even the industries that make and use chlorofluorocarbons, called the original White House decision a mistake and asked for its reversal. **********The House of Representatives has already authorized $30 million to help the developing countries protect the ozone layer. A similar proposal has been introduced in the Senate. Members of Congress from both parties have written to the President urging him to change policy. **********Stephen Hart, a White House spokesman, said today that the change came as result of ''internal Administration discussions.'' Mr. Sununu issued a statement today saying that at the London meeting the United States would propose a new fund, operated and administered by the World Bank, to help the poorer countries phase out chlorofluorocarbon production. **********A U.S. Condition **********But Mr. Sununu's statement said the United States would support the fund only if it was not considered a precedent for dealing with other international aid programs. Mr. Hart said the White House intended to have such a caveat written into any agreement. **********The United States proposal would also build in strict controls to assure that the financial aid is used for its intended purposes. **********A treaty signed in Montreal in 1987 under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Program requires a 50 percent reduction in the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000. But subsequent scientific data on the seriousness of the problem have shown that such a reduction would not be adequate. The United States and most other countries now support a total phaseout by 2000 and sharp reductions in other ozone-depleting chemicals, including methyl chloroform. **********Many developing countries have insisted that they would not be able to phase in substitutes without additional assistance. India and China, two countries with development plans that call for substantially expanded use of the chemicals, have said they will not join a treaty to eliminate the use of the chemicals without substantial new economic and technical help. **********Praise for White House Change **********The change of White House policy was praised today by members of Congress, environmentalists and industry representatives. **********''Hurray for the President,'' said Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, one of those who wrote to Mr. Bush urging him to reconsider. ''This is a very wise political decision but more than that it is a very wise decision for the future of the world.'' **********David D. Doniger, a lawyer and expert on chlorofluorocarbons for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national environmental group, said of the White House decision: ''They have closed the hole in ozone policy that they opened themselves.'' **********But Mr. Doniger also complained that the American plan for phasing out chlorofluorocarbons by 2000 was too slow and that members of the European Community had been urging a faster schedule to reflect the gravity of the threat to the ozone layer. **********Kevin J. Fay, executive director of the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy, an association of companies that make and use the chemicals, said, ''Hopefully, with this measure, government, industry and environmental community can move forward with a solution for solving this global problem.'' **********On a separate issue involving the global atmosphere, the West German Cabinet on Wednesday decided to reduce that country's carbon dioxide emissions by 25 percent by 2005. West Germany thus is the first major nation to formally adopt a target and timetable for reducing industrial emissions that, many scientists believe, will lead to a warming of the earth."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/26/business/company-news-ich-to-make-offer-for-first-executive.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1990-01-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 455, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  I.C.H. to Make Offer For First Executive", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   I.C.H. to Make Offer For First Executive", "body_text": " **********The I.C.H.

Instead of bouncing back, it plunged 108 points the next day, Friday, Oct. 16, leaving it 5 percent below its 200-day average. The following Monday, Oct. 19, saw the index fall a record 508 points. The 1984 case was less dramatic, but getting out as the indicator dropped to 2 percent below the moving average would have saved an investor from a further 10 percent decline. **********No technical indicator is infallible, but the sheer fact that some speculators follow one can give it some impact, at least on a short-term basis. Yesterday's buying was concentrated in blue-chip stocks, with some buying by index-arbitrage program traders. Among the 30 stocks in the Dow, 16 were up, 11 down and 3 unchanged.

''Longer term, this market is sick and is going to disintegrate,'' he said, citing the fact that few stocks rallied with the Dow as the year began.

For Mr. Kohl, who is campaigning for the all-German elections scheduled for Dec. 3, it also provided a well-timed chance to bask in the continued popularity of the Soviet leader, who despite his troubles at home is still held in high esteem by Germans as the man they perceive as having made possible the reunification of their nation. **********\"We Germans in particular acknowledge with deep gratitude your personal contribution to the propitious turning point in our history,\" Mr. Kohl told Mr. Gorbachev at a state banquet this evening. **********\"A year ago today the Berlin wall collapsed,\" Mr. Kohl said. \"A few weeks ago our divided nation recovered its unity in freedom and in harmony with all its neighbors and partners. The fact that you are the first foreign head of state to visit our united country augments our esteem.\" **********But it was also clear that Mr. Gorbachev was not the same leader who had drawn chants of \"Gorby! Gorby!\" when he first visited Bonn in June 1989. Then he was still undisputed master of the Soviet Union, and still held levers over the Germans. **********This time, his shaky standing at home was evidenced by the fact that Mr. Gorbachev had delayed his visit by several days because of unspecified Soviet problems. His weakened standing was further underscored by his appeal to the Germans to treat the Soviet soldiers remaining in their land \"as a test of the ability to build relations among people truly on the basis of humanity and friendship.\" **********The Germans agreed last summer to let the Soviets phase their military withdrawal from the former East Germany over four years. But the pullout has been marred by numerous defections and by outbursts of hostility from Germans. **********\"The euphoria of breaking with everything that was connected with the G.D.R. regime, especially in recent years, has given painful tones, even an anti-Soviet element, to the attitudes of a certain portion of Germans toward the Soviet Union,\" Mr. Gorbachev said. \"But I am convinced that this is only a temporary development.\" No New Aid Pledges **********German officials indicated that Mr. Gorbachev received no new pledges of financial aid on this trip. Germany has already pledged a hefty package, including 3 billion marks, or $2 billion, in interest-free loans and 12 billion marks, or $8 billion, in assistance for the Soviet troop withdrawal, and Bonn is facing heavy expenditures in eastern Germany. **********But the Germans did agree to increase their purchases of oil and gas from the Soviet Union, and to send a team of experts to advise Moscow on economic reforms. **********The treaty that served as the centerpiece of the visit basically defined far-reaching cooperation in economic, scientific, cultural and political spheres between Germany and the Soviet Union. Unlike similar treaties signed with other European countries, however, it also included a nonaggression clause that called on both sides to \"never and under no circumstances be the first to employ armed forces against one another or against third states.\" **********France, for example, signed a similar treaty with Moscow on Oct. 29, but rejected a nonaggression clause. **********In his comments, Mr. Gorbachev seemed to take pains to preclude any impression that the treaty created a special relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union, perhaps mindful that some Europeans might hear echoes of the infamous Soviet-Nazi pact that preceded World War II. Treaty 'Not Unique' **********\"The Soviet-German Treaty is not aimed against anyone,\" Mr. Gorbachev said. He declared that the improved relations with Germany were due in large part to the improvement in Soviet-Amercan relations, as well as in Moscow's ties to France and Britain. He insisted, too, that \"our treaty is not unique,\" that a similar pact had been signed with France and that another might soon be reached with Britain. **********Mr. Gorbachev said he and Mr. Kohl spent considerable time discussing the Persian Gulf crisis, but he gave few details. **********At the news conference, he spoke of the cooperation achieved at the United Nations as a \"great victory.\" **********\"Maybe this seems strange to you,\" he said, \"but this is the first time since the war, maybe in all history, that we have acted in the spirit of unity in so critical a situation in the context of the United Nations.\" **********On the question of further measures, however, Mr. Gorbachev said, \"We do not need to discuss any plans for any operations here.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/15/business/money-fund-yields-drop.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1990-11-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 367, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Money-Fund Yields Drop", "print_headline": "Money-Fund Yields Drop", "body_text": " **********Yields of tax-exempt and taxable money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report fell in the week ended yesterday. **********Analysts at Donoghue's said the markets continued to react to weak economic news and the anticipation of an easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve.

Nathaniel Howell 3d and fewer than a dozen aides remained in the American Embassy early today. Indications here Thursday night were that any Iraqi effort to shut down the United States Embassy or those of other nations would not trigger an immediate response by the American military, as long as no attempt was made to harm or kill the American citizens who remain inside. **********The Bush Administration appears to have concluded that the Iraqis are preparing to cut off water, power and telephone lines to the embassies. But the Iraqis are seen as unlikely to take any other overt military action to invade the buildings, which are considered sovereign territory of the nations involved. **********Uncertainty on Deadline **********American officials said they were uncertain about the exact deadline imposed by the Iraqis for closing embassies in Kuwait. Some accounts gave it as noon today (5 A.M. Eastern standard time), while others gave it as 8 P.M. today, or 1 P.M. EST. **********But the impression here Thursday night was that the United States and other countries believed that diplomats in Kuwait could only hold out for a matter of days under such circumstances. **********The ''red lines'' set by the Bush Administration as intolerable Iraqi action that could prompt a military response were more extreme: the killing of American citizens, an Iraqi military attack on Saudi Arabia or its oilfields, or an attack by Iraqi forces on Israel - a possibility that may be the one most feared by Mr. Bush, according to indications here Thursday night. **********There were also indications that the Administration was moving toward a decision in the next day or two to start boarding or disabling Iraqi oil tankers. **********Soviet Influence **********The Administration is said to have been delaying such action primarily at the urging of the Soviet Union, which is concerned about the fate of 5,000 to 8,000 of its citizens living in Iraq. Moscow also is said to have argued that there is a glimmer of hope that Iraq might back down in the face of international sanctions, basing that contention on a visit to the Soviet Union this week by the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq, Sadun Hammadi. **********While the Administration has not addressed the issue of how Mr. Bush intends to weigh the lives of American hostages against the potential need for military action, the impression here is that Mr. Bush would use force if he believes it is unavoidable - even if that might endanger the lives of Americans and other foreigners. **********Mr. Bush has almost said as much himself, declaring that while American lives are important to him, the United Nations sanctions imposed against Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 must be enforced. **********''I think any decision maker in the United States or in any of these countries is concerned about the lives of innocent civilians, innocent people,'' Mr. Bush said Wednesday at a news conference here. ''And so, you weigh that very thoroughly against your actions. Having said that, international law in this case, the Chapter 7 sanctions, must be enforced.'' **********A convoy carrying more than 100 people from the United States Embassy - diplomats, dependents and the entire Marine guard detachment -crossed from Kuwait into Iraq on Thursday, leaving behind Ambassador Howell and fewer than a dozen aides. A senior White House official said, ''A few Marine guards aren't going to fight off the entire Iraqi Army.'' **********The diplomats who stayed behind risked being taken hostage, for Baghdad has said that envoys who remain in Kuwait after the deadline will lose diplomatic status. **********Only India and Lebanon, among major nations, acceded to Iraqi orders to close their embassies. There were unofficial reports that the Philippines would also do so. But like the United States, most countries evacuated most of their staffs; Britain left only four diplomats in place, including Ambassador Michael Weston. **********Suggesting that a showdown could be near, European officials said they had been told that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq would surround the embassies with troops. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney warned that this would be a mistake. A Belgian official said all of the European Community ambassadors might assemble in one place ''to make their expulsion as dramatic as possible.'' **********The Pentagon said Thursday that as many as 49,703 servicemen and women could be involved in the first two rounds of a limited reserve callup, 10,000 more than officials had said on Wednesday. Britain announced the dispatch of a second 12-plane squadron of Tornado attack aircraft, American minesweepers were dispatched to join the Persian Gulf flotilla and a United States military unit, the 7th Medical Command, was sent from Germany to Saudi Arabia. No Breakthrough at U.N.  In another military development, officials said that American sailors had already boarded about a half-dozen merchant ships suspected of violating the United Nations embargo on Iraqi commerce. **********Washington's effort to win explicit United Nations support for the naval blockade it has been leading yielded some progress as representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council - the United States, France, Britain, China and the Soviet Union - sent a draft resolution to their Governments for review. Diplomats said France and Britain had accepted the wording of the proposal, but that Soviet objections had not yet been resolved. **********Mr. Bush said in the news conference on Wednesday that he was willing to wait only a little longer for United Nations action before ordering American ships to use force to halt vessels that violate the sanctions. **********As the Middle East crisis entered its fourth week, Iraq continued to move foreigners from Kuwait to Baghdad and its environs. Poles returning home reported that about three dozen Americans were taken last Friday to the Chemadex chemical plant at Al Qaim in western Iraq, where the Eastern Europeans had been working. American experts said the plant produces phosphorus fertilizers, not chemical weapons. **********Outrage at Iraqi Broadcast **********American officials, reportedly including Mr. Bush, were outraged by an Iraqi television broadcast on Thursday in which an avuncular President Hussein met with a number of hostages, playfully ruffling a small boy's hair. Most of the captives seemed to be British. **********The broadcast seemed to be an attempt by Mr. Hussein, who has been denounced in the West as a bully, to demonstrate his benevolence toward individuals while signaling that an American attack on Iraq would inevitably cost the lives of Western women and children. **********Richard A. Boucher, a State Department spokesman, denounced the broadcast as ''shameful theatrics.'' The British Foreign Office assailed it as a ''repulsive charade.'' **********Baghdad radio reported Thursday night that the Iraqi leader had authorized the release of a 15-year-old British youth who was separated from his family during the crisis. The broadcast gave his name as Alex Cameron Farni, but The Associated Press said that officials at the British Foreign Office in London later identified him as Alex Barnett. A spokesman for British Airways quoted by the news agency said the boy was traveling to the Gulf region from London without his family when his plane was stranded in Kuwait. **********Elite Iraqi Troop Movements **********The State Department said it had counted 56 Americans who were in the hands of the Iraqis - 41 seized in Iraq and 15 in Kuwait. Mr. Bush declared earlier this week that the 2,500 non-official Americans in Kuwait and the 530 in Iraq must now be considered hostages. **********In Tokyo, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said that 178 Japanese had been flown in three groups to Baghdad from the Japanese Embassy in Kuwait, where they had taken refuge. Another group of 62 was reportedly following. Shortly before the movements, Japan announced its intention to help reimburse countries that supported United Nations sanctions against Iraq at considerable cost to their own domestic economies. **********Two Under Secretaries of the United Nations met on Thursday with nine hostages at an undisclosed location about an hour's drive from Baghdad, a spokesman for the organization said. **********The nationalities of the nine captives, men between the ages of 17 and 63, were not given. The United Nations Under Secretaries, Virenda Dayal and Kofi Annan, arrived in Iraq on Tuesday to seek the release of some of the thousands of foreigners, including 21,000 Westerners estimated to be trapped by the conflict. **********A Pentagon official said Thursday night that there were signs that Iraq was pulling back elements of the elite Presidential Guard, the vanguard of the force that invaded Kuwait, from the Saudi border and replacing them with ''second stringers.'' **********Concern Over Soviet Advisers **********The official said it was unclear why the guard units were pulling back. He suggested that Mr. Hussein may not want to entrench his elite fighters along the front lines, or that the Iraqi President fears coup attempts from within his ranks and needs the guard's help. **********Jordan, which announced on Wednesday that it was closing its border with Iraq to all refugees, left it open for another day Thursday. At least 30,000 more refugees poured through the Ruweishid border crossing as King Hussein of Jordan embarked on another peace-seeking mission to Arab capitals, starting with a trip to the Sudan. **********Although Mr. Bush praised Soviet cooperation in American efforts as ''superb'' on Wednesday, United States officials said they were troubled by the presence of almost 200 Soviet military advisers in Iraq. Mr. Boucher said the Administration strongly believed ''that it is inappropriate to provide any form of military assistance to Iraq.'' **********The Soviet Union's reluctance to have the United Nations promptly endorse a blockade also irritated policy makers here. **********'Mounting Toward a Peak' **********Still, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Yuri Gremitskykh, pleased Washington with his comment Thursday that ''Iraq should change drastically the policy which it is pursuing now.'' He added, ''Baghdad has lost much, politically and morally, in the eyes of world public opinion by its illegal and inhumane actions against citizens of third countries.'' **********In Israel, which is separated from Iraq by an increasingly shaky Jordan, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir warned that the crisis was ''mounting toward a peak,'' and a civil-defense official urged citizens to stock up on food, tape their windows shut and mix a homemade antidote in anticipation of Iraqi use of poison gas. **********But in Washington, military officers said the Bush Administration had canceled an earlier alert issued to two United States-based Ranger battalions, in the belief that their involvement would feed speculation about a commando-type thrust by American forces into Iraq or Kuwait. **********Representative Dante B. Fascell, the Florida Democrat who heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called on the President to tell Congress in a joint session when lawmakers return in two weeks exactly what his intentions are in the Persian Gulf. Among other things, he said he wanted to know how the enormous military undertaking would be financed and whether other countries were ready to pay a share of costs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/28/business/forum-a-company-gives-up-on-new-york.html": {"writer_name": "Charles Schultze", "pub_date": "1990-10-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 671, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Company Gives Up on New York", "print_headline": "FORUM; A Company Gives Up on New York", "body_text": " **********THE budget agreement that is now working its way toward enactment is a good one. It will not achieve all that is claimed for it, but it will make substantial cuts in the deficit that are real. The tax increases and some of the entitlement cuts will be locked into substantive law, and, barring a shooting war in the Persian Gulf, future defense spending is likely to be less than what the budget agreement promises. **********We Americans are finally facing up, if only partially, to correcting a decade of public and private profligacy, during which the country borrowed massively at home and abroad to finance a consumption boom. As a nation we now save and invest only 3 percent of our national income. Our economic future depends on raising national saving, mainly through getting rid of the Federal budget deficit and ultimately turning it into a surplus. The budget agreement is a major step in that direction. **********The magnitude of the sacrifices the American people have now been asked to make is actually quite small. The sum of all the tax increases, about which such a titanic struggle has been waged, will amount to something like seven-tenths of 1 percent of national income. Yet listening to months of rhetoric about \"fairness\" -- on the part of the Democrats -- and \"the need to preserve incentives,\" on the part of the Republicans, made it seem that the country was engaged in some massive economic restructuring, a perestroika of our own. **********The progressivity of the latest tax agreement makes it better than the original proposal. And establishing the principle that progressive income taxes are not off-limits when taxes have to be raised is worthwhile. **********But most of the political fights that erupted were not worth bringing the whole agreement to the brink of defeat. Reducing the gasoline tax increase from 12 cents to 5 cents a gallon, for example, will mean a savings of only about $1.40 a week for the average family. Inequality in the United States has indeed increased over the past 15 years, but the tax code was not the principal culprit. **********The Republican position in the recent squabble was particularly silly. Does anyone really believe that American productivity and efficiency will be seriously affected by whether upper-income executives and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs pay a top-bracket rate of 28, 31 or 33 percent? Do our German and Japanese competitors appear to be severely handicapped by the fact that one has a top income tax rate of 53 percent and the other of 50 percent? Only in the heat of an ideological passion, could grown people make so much of so little. **********The payoff from reducing the budget deficit will not be immediate. It will not rescue us from the recession we are apparently entering. Rather, it will come from larger national savings and investment, whose benefits in the form of higher economic growth will show up only gradually. **********It is terribly hard to muster political support to do painful things for such subtle and distant goals. And for eight years the country has had two popular Presidents who have not only failed to use their office to mobilize public opinion toward that goal, but have actively blocked the modest tax increases that were obviously necessary to reach it. **********Small wonder that the Congressional troops concentrated on bickering about how the costs were to be divided. The bully pulpit had never been used to educate the troops' constituents on what the benefits would be. **********In the end what is truly remarkable is the fact that the system ended up doing the responsible thing. President Bush deserves credit for reversing his stand on taxes. But the real heroes are the Congressional leadership. Ultimately, even the troops in the trenches look as if they will respond with an act of political courage. The majority will vote for a tax increase two weeks before an election.

Even if they are not true, they could impair his effectiveness. **********One official said he and other policy advisers were now unenthusiastic about providing information and recommendations for the Prime Minister because they believe that he might not be around much longer. **********So far, no one says he has seen a document spelling out Mr. Li's resignation, and there is no clear evidence that he is in difficulty. Indeed, there is some evidence to the contrary. A friend of Mr. Li, Zou Jiahua, was named to the pivotal position of head of the State Planning Commission last month. **********But some Chinese officials say Mr. Li was highly embarrassed at the fifth plenum of the Communist Party Central Committee, in November. They say he made a detailed proposal to the Central Committee, calling for rewriting the formula for how much money the provinces pass on to the central Government. The proposal would have called for higher contributions from the provinces; the Central Committee, which includes many provincial leaders, rejected it. **********Those who believe that Mr. Li will lose his job note that China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, hinted at that on May 31 in a speech that has still not been officially released. ''We should change the group of leaders,'' Mr. Deng said in the speech. ''The new group of leaders should be a brand new one that conveys a new image to the people.'' **********Mentioned most often by Chinese officials to replace Mr. Li is Li Ruihuan, a 66-year-old former construction worker who is one of six members of the Politburo's standing committee. He is more popular than most top officials, and he is regarded as a centrist. **********A senior Chinese cited an incident in support of the theory that a power struggle was under way. The official said the Prime Minister's office telephoned the national television headquarters to complain that the news clip of Li Ruihuan meeting with a foreign dignitary lasted longer than the one of Li Peng meeting with the dignitary. **********Aside from Li Ruihuan, the most widely mentioned candidates for promotion are Zhu Rongji, the ruler of Shanghai, and Ye Xuanping, the Governor of Guangdong Province. Mr. Zhu and Mr. Ye, who are believed to be under consideration for deputy prime ministers, are regarded as among the strongest advocates of economic restructuring left in the leadership."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/03/business/all-about-platinum-a-thriving-market-guaranteed-by-both-vanity-and-pollution.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1990-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1321, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "All About/Platinum;   A Thriving Market Guaranteed By Both Vanity and Pollution", "print_headline": "All About/Platinum;   A Thriving Market Guaranteed By Both Vanity and Pollution", "body_text": " **********When the Ford Motor Company announced in December 1988 that it had developed a catalytic converter that would not require platinum, the metal's price plunged. Platinum producers feared that demand would evaporate. But Ford's new converter is still in testing, and platinum demand is near an all-time high. **********Platinum prices have been sustained at about $500 an ounce this year by environmentally conscious governments in the United States and Europe, and by status-conscious Japanese. The metal's leading uses are in jewelry and catalytic converters. **********Jewelry accounted for 38 percent of the 3.4 million ounces sold outside Communist (or formerly Communist) nations in 1989. A record 1.15 million ounces of platinum went for jewelry in Japan, almost 20 times the amount used by American jewelers. **********Another 37 percent of the non-Communist world's demand came from producers of catalytic converters. Slightly more than half of this amount went into converters in the United States, the first country whose air pollution standards made the devices necessary. Tougher American pollution laws will require a new generation of converters that will use even more platinum. **********The likelihood of tighter environmental standards is making the converters more common in Europe as well, especially in West Germany, where stricter anti-pollution regulations are already in place. **********Platinum is also an important chemical catalyst, used in making many products worth far less per ounce than the pure metal: gasoline, fiberglass, optical glass, certain types of rubber, some electrical equipment, even plastic seat covers and nylon carpeting. But the metal's chemical use has diminished as manufacturers seek ways of doing without this costly ingredient. **********Investors, too, are becoming less likely to buy platinum as they become disenchanted with the financial returns. **********And the music industry's platinum records? They are usually made of nickel, with shiny foil or paint, and not a single gram of platinum. **********Of Metal and Politics **********South Africa, Soviets Are Main Suppliers **********For all the economic sanctions the United States has invoked against South African apartheid, trade in platinum continues undisturbed. The non-Communist world depended on South Africa last year for 77 percent of its platinum, and the United States was no exception, buying in about the same proportion. **********The only other major source, the Soviet Union, produced about 16 percent of international supplies - up from about 10 percent in previous years, as the Soviet Union tried to earn more Western currencies. **********The worldwide stock of platinum is close to meeting demand, but turmoil in either country could disrupt shipments. **********Some analysts suggest that political reforms in the Soviet Union and South Africa could bring new militancy among mine workers looking for improved conditions. News of unrest in either country regularly sends platinum prices climbing; calm sends them back down. While jewelry makers could easily turn to gold and silver, automobile makers cannot. **********Jeremy S. Croombes, an analyst at Johnson, Matthey P.L.C., the London-based corporation that is the world's largest trader in the metal, said he is especially worried about unrest among black miners in South Africa. **********''The black population might want to sit back and let various leaders negotiate on their behalf,'' Mr. Croombs said. ''Or they may want to make their voices heard through strikes and industrial disruption.'' **********Investment Ups and Downs **********Once-Healthy Market Collapsed Last Year **********For a while, platinum appeared likely to join silver and gold as a mainstay in any precious-metal portfolio. Investment demand, virtually nil until the early 1980's, grew to 155,000 ounces in 1983, 490,000 ounces in 1985 and 630,000 in 1988. A range of bars and coins was proliferating. **********But last year, as gold and silver prices stagnated, investors decided they needed only 160,000 more ounces of platinum. The Japanese, the world's most active platinum investors, turned away abruptly, cutting their demand from 415,000 ounces in 1988 to 65,000 in 1989. **********''The demand for platinum as an investment tool has been dragged down by gold and silver prices, which have performed more poorly than platinum,'' said Bruce Kaplan, a precious metals consultant in Los Angeles. Last year, platinum prices fell from about $560 an ounce to about $500. Investors are less interested in using platinum as a hedge against inflation, Mr. Kaplan said. **********Higher demand from jewelry and industry sources has kept platinum prices relatively stable this year - which might be making the metal less attractive to investors. **********Common wisdom in the platinum business is that the metal seems brighter when its price is moving, no matter which way. The Japanese are said to buy when the price is falling, while Europeans and Americans jump in on the way up. **********New Technology **********It Isn't Likely To Curb Demand **********For a while, it seemed that Michigan had more to say about platinum prices than producers or investors. In December 1988, Ford announced ambitious tests of a catalytic converter made without platinum. About 40,000 Cougars and Thunderbirds in California were to be equipped with the new devices. On the day of Ford's announcement, platinum prices plunged $71 per ounce. Ask the company how things are going with its platinum-free converters now, and the response is a copy of the 1988 press release. **********Platinum assists in converting nitrogen oxide pollutants in automobile exhaust into carbon dioxide and water. Few still believe that pollution control equipment can dispense with platinum entirely. **********Ford says that even if converters without platinum are practical now, tighter emissions standards might require platinum to be reintroduced. **********Ford contends that its new converters will at least enable the company, and the nation, to lessen its reliance on South Africa and the Soviet Union. **********Some auto makers are increasing their use of rhodium, another precious metal that is often found in platinum ores. ''Rhodium will undoubtedly be an essential component of auto catalysts used in Europe,'' Mr. Croombs said. Its use in catalytic converters increased 16 percent worldwide in 1989. At $1,600 an ounce, rhodium is far more costly and rare than platinum, but also more efficient for use in converters. **********But even as some turn to other metals, the demand for platinum in converters increased 9 percent in 1989 and is likely to grow more quickly this year. The growth is likely to be greatest in Western Europe, where only three of every 10 cars already have the converters. **********WHEN PRICE IS NO OBJECT **********Where price is no object, platinum fuel cells are fine. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has used the exotic batteries to power its space shuttles. **********Now the developers of these cells need to make the giant leap back to earth and find less expensive, everyday applications. **********The cells, which look somewhat like stacks of car batteries, use platinum to catalyze a chemical combination of hydrogen and oxygen, generating electricity. Lee Marino, a spokesman for Johnson Matthey P.L.C., said that the fuel cells waste 10 percent less of their power than do standard utility engines. **********Major corporations are eager to pursue this new technology. International Fuel Cells, a division of the United Technologies Corporation, is already selling platinum fuel-cell generators that can heat and provide emergency power for small apartment buildings. **********A Japanese joint venture between International Fuel Cells and the Toshiba Corporation developed the cells for the space shuttle. **********In the longer range, scientists say that the power cells can propel buses and delivery trucks. ''There are a variety of potential applications for the future that we're only beginning to explore,'' Mr. Morino said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/25/business/profit-slips-2.6-at-du-pont.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 249, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Profit Slips 2.6% at Du Pont", "print_headline": "Profit Slips 2.6% at Du Pont", "body_text": " **********E.

Mix in race and you really have a shouting match. Just ask the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. **********Last month, in a first for a cigarette maker, Reynolds said it would test-market a cigarette that it expects will appeal ''most strongly'' to blacks. The proposed brand name is Uptown, a menthol cigarette. The multimillion-dollar test market, scheduled to begin Feb. 5, is in Philadelphia, which has a large black population. **********If successful, the campaign for Uptown cigarettes - with their narrowly focused market, packaging and menthol taste - is sure to prompt Reynolds's rivals to try similar explicit marketing campaigns to blacks and perhaps other minorities. **********Marketing cigarettes to minorities is not new; saying so is. Billboards, newspaper advertisements and promotional circulars have featured black and Hispanic models for years. **********But critics, like the American Cancer Society, see the Uptown campaign as an alarming escalation in cigarette marketing. They believe the campaign exploits blacks, especially the ghetto poor. [In Philadelphia, representatives of 30 black and Hispanic religious and community organizations agreed Thursday to organize a protest of Uptown's sale. [''We want to halt it before Feb. 5,'' said Patti LePera, vice president-marketing and communications for the Philadelphia branch of the American Cancer Society. ''We want R. J. Reynolds to know we don't want it here.'']  Mary L. Clarke, the president of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg, N.C., branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said: ''With the poor health among black folks today, we do not need anything else to cause even more health problems. R. J. Reynolds's targeting of blacks is unethical.'' **********Black publications find themselves in the middle. The Philadelphia Tribune, a 105-year-old newspaper with a circulation of 108,000, plans to carry Uptown advertisements next month. ''We don't have the right to make a choice for our readers,'' said the newspaper's president, Robert W. Bogle. ''What we're doing is not illegal or immoral.'' **********Black magazines are also caught in the crossfire. They often depend on cigarette revenue to a greater extent than black newspapers. **********''R. J. Reynolds has been an advertiser for a long time,'' said Jeff Burns, vice president of Johnson Publishing, parent of Ebony and Jet magazines, which are scheduled to carry Uptown advertisements. ''This is just another product.'' Publishers Information Bureau estimates that for the first 11 months of 1989 Ebony received about 7 percent of its $35 million in revenue from cigarette advertising and Jet about 10 percent of its $16.4 million. **********'Tough Business Decision' **********Taking such advertising is ''a tough business decision,'' said Barbara A. Britton, national advertising director for Essence magazine. ''But it's advertising that is treated like any other advertising.'' The Publishers Information Bureau estimates that Essence received about 9 percent of its $18 million in ad revenue from cigarettes for the first 11 months of 1989, but Ms. Britton said the estimate was ''slightly overstated.'' **********''It's unfair to single out minority publications on this issue,'' she added. ''Given the health issue in America, this is a question that should be posed to the white media as well.'' Indeed, most newspapers and magazines accept cigarette advertising. **********Because of the health issue, cigarette makers are hobbled in selling to blacks, said Jerome D. Williams, an assistant professor of marketing at Pennsylvania State University who studies ethnic marketing. ''The irony is that if R. J. Reynolds made shoes or shirts and specifically marketed to blacks, they would probably be regarded as progressive and socially positive,'' said Mr. Williams, who is black. **********A Shrinking Industry **********For its part, Reynolds says it is only following the Darwinian dictates of the cigarette market. With the industry shrinking a further 6 percent last year, the business has long been a struggle of clawing customers away from competitors rather than wooing new smokers. The result is a vast proliferation of cigarette brands aimed at narrower and narrower market segments: There are more than 350 brands and styles (low-tar, filter, box, menthol, 100-millimeter versions and so forth) of cigarettes. Lorillard, for example, is test-marketing Harley-Davidson cigarettes, named after the motorcycle, for men aged 21 to 35. **********Reynolds, the unit that must provide much-needed cash flow for debt-laden RJR Nabisco, had a 1989 market share of 28.6 percent, said John C. Maxwell Jr., a tobacco analyst with Wheat First Securities in Richmond. The company lost 3.2 share points last year, partly because it discontinued ''trade loading,'' which is the shipment of more units than distributors can sell, thus inflating sales. But it also lost share because of competition, mainly from Philip Morris, the market leader with a 41.9 percent share. **********Nearly 44 percent of black adults smoke, compared with 37 percent of whites, according to the Simmons Market Research Bureau. Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the 58 million adults who smoke, or about 7.4 million, many cigarette marketers believe blacks are fiercely brand loyal and thus make ideal cigarette customers. **********Stakes Are High **********''Everything we do is going to be assaulted and picked at by the anti-smokers,'' said David Iauco, senior vice president-marketing for R. J. Reynolds, who was not surprised by the controversy. ''But taking away business from our competitors is the only thing that Uptown is about.'' **********The marketing stakes are high for a cigarette maker. While Reynolds will not disclose marketing costs for Uptown, it estimates that a typical test market costs $2 million to $10 million. Such expensive testing is necessary since a nationwide cigarette introduction can cost $100 million to $150 million. **********In a business where market shares are measured in tiny slivers, a single market share point is worth $358 million. The industry is immensely profitable because cigarette manufacture has become so efficient. For example, the huge Reynolds factory near Winston-Salem can produce more than 475 million cigarettes a day. **********It is difficult for manufacturers to determine how to appeal to smokers. They are not quite certain, for example, what women prefer. Marketers know only that women like long, thin cigarettes. Philip Morris's Virginia Slims, the dominant women's brand, was introduced in the late 1960's; no other women's brand -including those that smell sweet, taste lemony or are ultra-long and thin - has been as successful. **********Expensive Failures **********Hispanic smokers, who make up 15 percent of the market, show no special preference, buying such mainstream brands as Philip Morris's Marlboros and Reynolds's Winston. **********Asians, like Hispanic consumers, are diverse in ethnicity and nationality. making marketing programs difficult. **********Marketing campaigns for blacks are easier because of their preference for menthol, which has never been explained. According to Reynolds, 69 percent of black smokers prefer menthol, compared with 27 percent for smokers over all. **********There are three major menthol brands: Salem, Kool and Newport. Mr. Maxwell, the tobacco analyst, said only the Newport brand, made by Lorillard, a unit of the Loews Corporation, is prospering. Reynolds's Salem is losing substantial market share, with 6.2 percent in 1989, down from 7.3 percent in 1988. Brown & Williamson's Kool is flat at 6 percent. **********Newport Gains Market Share **********Only Newport saw its market share grow: to 4.8 percent from 4.4 percent. Newport's unit sales grew as well, to 25 million in 1989 from 24.8 million a year earlier. That is not much, but both its rivals experienced declines in cigarette sales. **********Those three brands constitute 53 percent of the market for black smokers, but flip-flopped in ranking, with Newport on top at 22 percent, Kool at 16 percent and Salem at 15 percent, according to R. J. Reynolds. **********Newport's secret may be the menthol recipe. The cigarette has the least menthol of the three brands; Salem has the most. To appeal to blacks in the ages of 21 to 34, the company planned a cigarette with less menthol flavoring, 19 milligrams of ''tar'' and 1.3 milligrams of nicotine - not a low-tar brand, but not especially strong either. **********'A Classy Sounding Name' **********Development of the new cigarette began in late 1988, when Salem was clearly losing ground among blacks. Trone Advertising, a Greensboro, N. C., agency, developed a list of about 20 names, later narrowed to 5, for the new cigarette. **********The name Uptown scored the highest in consumer surveys, Reynolds said. Uptown was not selected because it suggests the Harlem section of New York City. None of the other four names had any ethnic character to them either, the company said. **********''Uptown was meant to be a classy sounding name, that is all,'' said Timothy C. Harris, director of special markets. **********To appeal to blacks seeking a less pronounced menthol taste, Reynolds decided against using green, the traditional color to signal menthol, on the packaging. Instead, it used black and gold, the colors of luxury European cigarettes. The typeface, Onyx, was chosen for its ''classic, stylish look,'' Mr. Harris said. **********In the narrowest bit of marketing toward blacks, Uptown cigarettes are packed with the filters facing down, the reverse of the usual arrangement. Market research indicated blacks opened cigarette packs from the bottom, possibly to avoid crushing the filters. **********Six-Month Test **********To test the cigarette, Reynolds picked Philadelphia, which has about a 40 percent black population. The test will last at least six months. Much of the company's marketing funds will go to advertising, which will be carried in black newspapers, The Phildelphia New Observer and The Tribune, as well as such national black magazines as Ebony and Jet. It will also be used for billboards, posters inside buses, and point-of-purchase displays where cigarettes are sold The ads represent typical cigarette marketing, with beautiful models enjoying urban nightlife and smoking cigarettes. The slogan is ''Uptown. The Place. The Taste.'' Despite the heavy marketing to blacks, Reynolds does not say that Uptown is a cigarette designed for blacks. Rather, the company says, it is a cigarette for the entire market but which is likely to attract a disproportionate number of black smokers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/05/business/company-news-quaker-state-plan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-01-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Quaker State Plan", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Quaker State Plan", "body_text": " **********The Quaker State Corporation is offering a free warranty on engine parts of new cars lubricated by its oil for 10 years or 250,000 miles.

The Commodore Amiga, from Commodore Business Machines Inc., is also well suited to multimedia production. But I.B.M. PC's and compatible models have never been known for good sound or graphics. Until now. **********Multimedia is a buzzword these days, although the concept is hardly new. Television, for example, is a multimedia device. Some analysts have suggested that computers and television are destined to merge, resulting in ''smart TV's'' or ''video computers.'' Although the integration of full-motion video on a computer screen is still some time off, products like the Audio Visual Connection represent an initial step in that direction. **********The concept is simple: a computer-based sales presentation or training program that includes photographs, video, animated diagrams, a musical soundtrack, a spoken narration, text and data drawn from the user's data base, all put together with sophisticated techniques borrowed from professional audio-visual productions. Its designers believe it will hold a viewer's attention much better than the ''slide shows'' that are common on computers today. **********But multimedia is not yet simple or inexpensive, and those it must be to catch on in corporate offices. **********I.B.M.'s Audio Video Connection is a $3,310 combination of software and two plug-in boards that is designed to work on high-end PS/2 computers. One board captures and processes audio signals, the other video. The boards fit into Micro Channel expansion slots, a type of slot used by I.B.M. and a few other personal computer makers. **********One application that uses Audio Video is an interactive guide to the city of Austin, Tex., where I.B.M. developed the plug-in boards. The system mixes color photographic and still-frame video images of Austin with a soundtrack, and links it to a data base containing text, sound and images. Using a mouse, the user can select topics of interest - parks, for example, or high-technology companies - and a slick presentation begins. **********Such presentations, without the computer involvement, are nothing new. Cities, companies and government agencies routinely make promotional videotapes. **********But computer multimedia has advantages. While television or video tape is passive, computer multimedia can be interactive. The viewer can control the order of the presentation through keyboard or mouse commands (or by touching the screen in some cases), exploring the material randomly instead of linearly, as with a video tape. Laser video disks are also interactive, but they are more difficult to produce. **********Computer multimedia applications are, in general, less expensive to make than video productions, once the start-up equipment and training costs are absorbed. ''In short time, I was able to put together a five-and-a-half-minute presentation that would have cost the client $5,000 to $10,000 if it had been produced on video,'' said Mark C. Sherman, president of Audio Visual Computer Applications Inc. of Austin. ''Using A.V.C., it was $1,500,'' he said, referring to the Audio Video Connection. Professional audio-visual productions often cost more than $1,000 a minute, because they are extremely labor intensive, he said. **********But the relatively low cost of Audio Video may be misleading, Mr. Sherman cautioned. To produce his results, which compare favorably with those of a professional audio-visual studio, Mr. Sherman uses a powerful computer with high-resolution graphics and a special monitor, a digital video camera, audio and video cassette decks, a slide digitizer, a studio video monitor and other equipment. That means he is taking advantage of Audio Video using hardware that cost more than $30,000. It might be a hard sell to persuade corporate audio-visual departments to make that kind of investment. **********Another potential hurdle is that Audio Video appears to be complex, restricting its usefulness to companies where at least some employees have a good understanding of both audio-visual production and computers. As a result, the Audio Video Connection may find its greatest use among audio-visual professionals and companies that develop multimedia applications. **********One such company is Creative Services Inc., of McLean, Va., which uses Audio Video to produce multimedia applications for clients including Disney World and the Pentagon. The company also has ''a contract with Caterpillar to develop manufacturing training applications,'' said Judith A. Mezzullo, vice president of marketing, who said she expects training to be the most significant application for Audio Video in the next decade. ''Data can be changed rapidly and modifications to manufacturing equipment can be updated quickly,'' she said. ''With a video disk, you have to create a new disk and have it manufactured, mailed out and installed.'' Audio Video can be updated on a computer network, she said, adding, ''Where data is changing and you need the most current data, this is better than video disks.'' **********Creative Services is also developing a multimedia network version of the multiple listing service used by realtors. Such a system would enable clients to sit at a computer with a local real estate agent, fill out a profile of their housing requirements (four bedrooms, four baths, fireplace, trees and so on) and finances (in the $200,000 range, with $50,000 down and study their choices in other cities. Within minutes, the system would show them exterior, interior and neighborhood views of perhaps a dozen houses that come closest to meeting their descriptions. The program could also check local mortgage and tax rates and show the clients graphically what it would cost, including closing costs and monthly payments, to move into each house. **********Such an application would require far more data capacity than is available on most computer networks today. But long-distance carriers and regional telephone companies are planning to install fiber-optic digital phone networks in the mid-1990's that have far larger capacity and may be able to handle such applications. **********Another important advantage of multimedia is that because the information in the presentation was created by and drawn from a computer, it can be changed or updated in less time, and at less expense, than with video, which would have to be refilmed, edited, manufactured and mailed. **********Neither I.B.M.'s Model 70, with its limited expansion slots, nor the Model 80, with its relatively slow microprocessor, is an ideal Audio Visual Connection machine. Until I.B.M. comes up with a better computer, the best machine to run the Audio Visual Connection would seem to be a bigger, faster Micro Channel machine, like the Advanced Logic Research Microflex 3300, which is powered by a 33-megahertz Intel 80386 processor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/13/world/one-brooklyn-rabbi-s-long-shadow.html": {"writer_name": "Ari Goldman", "pub_date": "1990-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 837, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "One Brooklyn Rabbi's Long Shadow", "print_headline": "One Brooklyn Rabbi's Long Shadow", "body_text": " **********The last-minute failure of the Israeli Labor Party to form a new government has again focused attention on the role of a charismatic Brooklyn rabbi who asserts an unusual amount of influence in Israel. **********The 88-year-old rabbi, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Grand Rabbi of Lubavitch, has never been to Israel, although his picture hangs in many Israeli homes and offices and stares down at traffic from billboards in Jerusalem and Safad, Israel's historic center of mysticism. **********The rabbi's aides in Brooklyn and in Israel insist he is not politically involved.

After the defections on Wednesday, Mr. Peres was given another two weeks to try to put together another majority. **********The two defectors were Avraham Verdiger and Eliahu Mizrahi, both of the Orthodox Agudat Israel Party, a party that had committed its support to help Labor form a government. **********In Brooklyn yesterday, the chief spokesman and personal aide to Rabbi Schneerson confirmed that Mr. Verdiger had called the office before Wednesday's session and asked if the grand rabbi's position had changed. Mr. Verdiger was told that there was no change and that, in fact, Rabbi Schneerson, in a recent Sabbath address, had restated his position. **********''When Verdiger heard this, he deduced, on his own, that he was in the wrong place; hence the defection,'' said the spokesman, Rabbi Yehudah Krinsky. At no time was he told how to vote, the rabbi said. ''We are not political,'' he said. **********But when asked whether Rabbi Schneerson supported either of the leading parties, Rabbi Krinsky said, ''I would say clearly that the Rebbe would be opposed to any government that would have on its agenda the return or compromise of any territories.'' **********He insisted that that was a religious judgment rather than a political one. And he said no pressure would be brought to bear on other religious party members who were planning to support Labor. **********Organized in 18th Century **********Rabbi Schneerson is the seventh leader in a Hasidic dynasty that dates to late 18th-century Russia. The Hasidic movement was founded earlier in the century as a reaction to the Enlightenment, and stressed piety, song, dance and mysticism. **********By most accounts, Lubavitch is the largest of the Hasidic groups to survive the killing of six million European Jews. Rabbi Krinksy said there were 25,000 followers in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn alone, where Rabbi Schneerson lives, and more than one million worldwide. **********While others said that the worldwide number was grossly exaggerated, they tended to agree with Rabbi Krinsky that the organization is enormously influential. It has 1,000 centers in the world, and just in this week of Passover has held seders, or festival meals, at its centers in Nepal, Hong Kong, Honolulu, Rome, Budapest and Moscow. **********Rabbi Irving Greenberg, an Orthodox rabbi who has been a critic of Luvavitch, said the organization has been underestimated. **********''It is more than a sweet little rabbi who brings you matzoh on Passover,'' he said referring to Lubavitch's outreach work in sharing Jewish symbols. **********Called Most Powerful **********''Lubavitch is the single most powerful movement in the Jewish world,'' said Rabbi Greenberg, who is the director of the Center for Learning and Leadership, an interbranch Jewish organization based in Manhattan. **********While Rabbi Krinsky refused to make public the annual budget of Lubavitch, Rabbi Greenberg estimated that it was at least $100 million since the cost of running each individual center was at a minimum, $100,000 a year. **********Much of the Lubavitch money is raised from nonobservant Jews who want to support what they see as an authentic Jewish tradition."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/20/world/nicaraguan-says-arms-still-flow.html": {"writer_name": "Clifford Krauss", "pub_date": "1990-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 619, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NICARAGUAN SAYS ARMS STILL FLOW", "print_headline": "NICARAGUAN SAYS ARMS STILL FLOW", "body_text": " **********President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of Nicaragua has expressed concern to Salvadoran and United States officials that shipments of arms continue to pass through her country to the guerrillas in El Salvador, a senior State Department official said. **********Mrs. Chamorro brought up the arms shipments in a conversation with Secretary of State James A.

Bowsher, said the cost of the bailout could range from $325 billion to $500 billion over three decades, depending on the outlook for the economy and the trend of real estate values. Many of the troubled savings institutions invested heavily in real estate developments. **********The estimates by Mr. Bowsher, the Comptroller General, were far higher than the previous official estimates. Last July, the Administration's Office of Management and Budget put the cost at $257 billion. **********The rescue, Mr. Bowsher said, will be ''bigger than all the bailouts of New York City, Chrysler, and Lockheed put together.'' **********The Taxpayers Will Pay **********Most of the costs will be paid by the taxpayers. The Administration has estimated that more than $100 billion can be obtained from selling off assets from the hundreds of failed institutions the Government has seized in recent months and from other sources, like the Federal insurance premiums paid by the savings industry. But the rest of the bill must be paid by the Treasury, though the payment could be spread over as much as 33 years. **********The rising cost of the bailout will add to the Federal Government's chronic budget deficit, which makes the United States dependent on foreign capital and slows economic growth. **********''It looks as if we have spent the peace dividend,'' said Senator Larry Pressler, Republican of South Dakota. He referred to the savings in military spending that many legislators expect as the United States and the Soviet Union agree to cuts in armaments. **********Mr. Bowsher said that in the period since Congress authorized the bailout last year the cost estimate had increased because the number of troubled institutions had risen, the interest rates on bonds to finance the bailout had gone up and real estate values had fallen. Declining real estate prices in many parts of the country not only add to the problems of the savings industry, but also decrease the amount of money the Government takes in when it sells the real estate assets of seized institutions, he said. **********The $325 billion estimate, Mr. Bowsher said, assumes a fairly strong economy and modest interest costs. If interest rates rise, the cost could easily reach $400 billion, he added. An economic recession, he said, could mean that ''a cost of a half a trillion dollars is possible, unfortunately.'' **********He warned that new legislation would be needed because the money authorized by Congress last year will not be enough. **********Still, analysts said the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency created last year to handle the bailout, apparently does not face any immediate cash shortage. It has $18.8 billion and the authority to issue $20 billion in bonds, so there should be no need for legislation to provide additional money until the middle of 1991, one Congressional analyst said. **********Although the cost of the rescue is spread over more than 30 years, the heaviest burden on the Treasury comes in the early years when money is needed to close institutions and pay depositors. **********Another Estimate Is Expected **********L. William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation, told Congress last month that his staff was preparing new estimates on the bailout's cost. Experts within the agency, who asked not to be identified, said the expectation was that the figure would be far higher than the $325 billion minimum estimated by Mr. Bowsher. **********Stephen Katsanos, a spokesman for the agency, said trends within the savings industry indicate that more than 600 institutions will ultimately have to be bailed out. Mr. Bowsher's office, which is an investigative arm of Congress, assumed in its most optimistic estimate that 560 savings and loans would be involved. At present, 351 institutions are controlled by the Government. **********Private experts have been even more pessimistic. Bert Ely, a consultant based in Alexandria, Va., estimates that the final tally of institutions needing help will be 700 to 900. **********The bailout comes after the collapse of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, which guaranteed deposits and had accumulated losses of $87 billion when it was closed last year and was replaced by the Savings Association Insurance Fund. The Resolution Trust Corporation handles the actual bailout operation, selling off the assets of insolvent institutions to recover as much money as possible. **********Speculative Investments **********The savings industry crisis began after the regulation of savings and loans was eased in the mid-1980's. Many institutions strayed far from their traditional business of collecting consumer deposits and making home mortgage loans. The most aggressive institutions put millions of dollars into speculative investments ranging from real estate developments to ''junk bonds.'' When these markets dropped, the institutions became insolvent. **********Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn and a member of the House Banking Committee, warned that the growing cost of the bailout promised more trouble for the Federal budget. ''An increasing part of the rescue funds will come from the Government's general revenues, because the other sources have already been used up,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/27/world/deng-reappears-to-cast-vote-in-beijing.html": {"writer_name": "Sheryl Wudunn", "pub_date": "1990-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 718, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Deng Reappears to Cast Vote in Beijing", "print_headline": "Deng Reappears to Cast Vote in Beijing", "body_text": " **********Wobbly but beaming, China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, appeared on television tonight for the first time in five months, casting a vote in local elections conducted throughout the city. **********More than five million people were expected to go to the polls today in Beijing to elect representatives to local councils, the only Government institution elected directly by the Chinese people. **********At some polling stations, there was great fanfare, with firecrackers and streamers, but for the most part, many citizens privately expressed their indifference to the process. **********\"I'm sure there will be a lot of abstention votes this time,\" said a worker who helped organize voters in her district. \"We are given so little information on the candidates. The people never meet them and so it's nearly impossible to tell them apart.

Still, the Government was promoting today's elections, which occur once every three years, as an example of China's political openness and democratic process. **********The 86-year-old Mr. Deng was shown on television filling out his ballot and, escorted by his daughter, walking carefully over to the red ballot box. He gingerly stuffed his ballot into the box. **********\"That's all, right?\" Mr. Deng appeared to say, and then he walked away from the box. Mr. Deng was last seen on a publicity trip to the Asian Games village, where Beijing staged a mini-Olympics in the fall. **********His television appearance at the polls today indicates that Chinese leaders want to stress the importance of the elections -- and perhaps rebut rumors that Mr. Deng is on his deathbed. **********National television also showed the Communist Party General Secretary, Jiang Zemin, Prime Minister Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun casting their votes at the polls. **********\"The system of the People's Congress is the fundamental system of China,\" the official New China News Agency said in a paraphrase of comments by Prime Minister Li. \"While continuing its economic reform, China will also carry out political reform.\" **********Voters today elect representatives to the local People's Congress, which then elects deputies to a higher level people's congress.

But all the candidates are officially approved, and often there is little difference among them. **********At Beijing University, where brief biographies of the candidates were posted, many students still said they knew nothing about the candidates. The candidates apparently were carefully screened, and the popular former president of the university, Ding Shisun, withdrew his nomination, students at the university said. Mr. Ding was dismissed by the Government after the 1989 army crackdown on the democracy movement. **********Some students scanned the biographies just before they entered the polling halls. **********\"I have no idea who these candidates are,\" a second-year student said. \"It doesn't mean much anyway. Elections here are not like in America.\" **********Candidates rarely appear at the polling stations. Most citizens vote through their work units, which distribute materials about the candidates. **********At Fengsheng election district in west Beijing, the three candidates had videos of themselves distributed throughout the local work units, poll organizers said.  But more than a dozen people approached at the poll today said they had not heard about a video. **********At Jianguomen election district in east Beijing, poll organizers tried their best to portray the great respect that voters had for the election process. **********But several voters said they selected candidates at random.

With refreshing candor, the company's executives put out a statement that day saying they knew of no reason for the rise in the share price. **********A review of Southland's financial records doesn't suggest any explanation either. Indeed, the company's finances have become so frail that some Wall Street bears have been betting heavily that Southland will not sustain its recent rally. And that, in Wall Street's perverse way, may help explain last week's price jump. **********According to Southland's most recent public filings, for the fiscal year that ended Oct. 31, 1989, the company is nearly out of cash and running out of credit, both from its bankers and its paging-equipment suppliers. **********And while the company's reported revenues in 1989 climbed substantially over those in 1988, so did its costs, including the amount of interest it paid on money it borrowed to meet its cash needs. In fact, Southland's auditors, in their review of the company's annual results, cautioned that chronic losses and a lack of working capital ''raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.'' **********Moreover, a supposedly beneficial purchase of another small paging operation, which company officials have been promising for more than 18 months, has hit some new and potentially time-consuming regulatory snags, according to the company's public filings. Pacific Bell has asked the California Public Utilities Commission to block Southland's acquisition of the A-plus Beepers Company. A spokesman for Bell said his company is claiming that A-plus's customers actually belong to Pacific Bell, because A-plus had been acting as its Bell's agent when it signed up the customers. The P.U.C. has scheduled a hearing on the case for April 3, the spokesman said. Southland said it will review its plans if the P.U.C. blocks the deal. In short, Southland is facing a host of problems. But Ahmad N. Bayaa, Southland's chairman and leading shareholder, said he believes the company's troubles are largely behind it. In this business, he said, ''there is a lot of investment up front and the rewards come later.'' **********Of course, the ''beeper'' business itself has become increasingly competitive. In this regard, Southland's corporate structure would seem to give it something of an edge. It transferred its Federal and state P.U.C. licenses to a separate corporation, owned by Mr. Bayaa's brother, Ziad, and rents its airtime back at bargain rates. **********But even so, the company's paging business has never been able to make ends meet. And the arrangement has stripped Southland of one of the most valuable assets of any paging company, its transmission license. **********Of course, investors can be durable optimists at times, seeing silk purses where only sow's ears are visible to others. That may explain Southland's stock-price history. The shares, which were trading at $3.63 last May, had moved up to $13.50 by early September. **********That rally cooled a bit by Christmas, but prices hovered around $9 through the end of January. After the company filed its fiscal 1989 results on Jan. 29, the stock even began a modest rally and spent February in the neighborhood of $9.50 a share, before sliding back to $8.75 in early March. **********On March 6, Southland announced somewhat vaguely that it ''intended to raise up to $5 million'' by privately selling an undisclosed number of shares to ''a select group of foreign investors'' whom it did not identify. The market ignored the news, and Southland's shares continued to be quoted at $8.75 through last Tuesday. **********Then, between Wednesday morning and Thursday afternoon, the stock soared to $12.75 on uncharacteristically heavy volume. **********The move got the O.T.C. market's attention - especially among bearish short-sellers, who had borrowed Southland shares and sold them at those earlier single-digit prices, expecting to profit by later replacing the borrowed stock with even cheaper shares. **********Some of these bears were complaining bitterly last week that they were the victims of a ''short squeeze.'' In this classic Wall Street maneuver, bullish investors demand the physical return of their own shares, which their brokers may have loaned out to the ''shorts.'' The move forces the short-sellers to become purchasers of the stock - unwilling ones, since they must buy shares in the marketplace to replace the ones they have borrowed from brokers and sold. **********Several market-makers, who did not want to be quoted by name, attributed last week's climb to just such a squeeze. Such strategies are easier to execute, they pointed out, if a stock is illiquid and not widely held. And Southland's latest reports show that it has just 77 shareholders, fewer than the 300 required for listed companies on the National Association of Securities Dealers automated market, where Southland trades. The company explains that many of these investors ''were believed to be nominees for the actual beneficial owners.'' **********In any case, the bears on Wall Street aren't the only ones who were selling Southland shares as the price was climbing. The Bayaa brothers, the company's top executives, have been selling some of their original holdings as well, according to S.E.C. records. Since the stock began to rally last spring, the two men have reported sales of more than 82,000 shares. **********Ahmad Bayaa explained: ''We all have our own personal needs . . . I needed to take care of some personal matters, but we believe very strongly in the company and we're in it for the long term, for sure.'' **********Assuming that these shares fetched $9 each, the prevailing market price when they were sold, the executives made about $738,000 on the transactions - an amount that almost equals the entire book value of the company itself. **********UTILITY INDEX: A CRYSTAL BALL FOR INTEREST RATES? **********Interest rate forecasters often seek clues to the future in the behavior of dividend-paying utility stocks, considered to be the Big Board equivalents of long-term Treasury bonds. **********But the trick these days is to detect when utility-stock traders are being prescient, and when they're simply being practical. **********The 15 stocks in the Dow Jones utility index certainly have been running out of steam, falling 8 percent since mid-December. But is the index just reacting sensibly to the 10 percent decline in the price of 30-year Treasury bonds in the same period? Or giving a Delphic warning of even higher rates ahead? **********''We really don't know,'' concedes Mickey Levy, chief economist at First Fidelity Bank in Newark.

Miners in central Appalachia and the western United States are contemplating big gains in production. Railroads expect a surge in shipments. And the high-sulfur mines of the Midwest and northern and southern Appalachia are looking at leaner times. **********Under the new Clean Air Act approved by Congress last month, restrictions on sulfur dioxide emissions, which contribute heavily to acid rain, will take effect in 1995 and tighten in 2000, with each round requiring more coal-burning utilities to find lower-sulfur fuel or to install scrubbers or other cleanup technology. **********These restriction have not previously been applied to old plants. By some estimates, one-eighth of the coal-burning plants in the United States will have to shift to different suppliers, sometimes more than 1,000 miles away. Supply relationships that have existed for decades will be disrupted. **********\"This is going to be the biggest change in the use of coal at utilities in the past 50 years,\" said Scott B. Sitzer, an economist at the Department of Energy. **********Among producers, Ashland Coal will see compound annual earnings growth of 20 percent through 1995 because of increased demand for central Appalachian low-sulfur coal, said Rafael A. Villagran, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. Another Appalachian producer, Westmoreland Coal, and a company in the Powder River Basin of northeast Wyoming, Nerco Inc., will also benefit, he said. **********The losers will probably be \"mom-and-pop\" mining companies that lack the resources to buy low-sulfur reserves or build the mines to produce them. Bigger companies may already have such reserves or be able to acquire them. The largest company, Peabody Holdings, a subsidiary of Hansen P.L.C., has big low-sulfur reserves in Montana, but offering that coal to its customers may mean a cut in profits. Because of daunting transportation costs, Western supplies, even with their attractive low sulfur levels, sell for less at the mine than do Peabody's extensive coal holdings in the East. **********Consolidation Coal, a subsidiary of Du Pont, is the second-largest American coal producer, and does not have extensive low-sulfur reserves, but it is regarded as highly efficient and, as one expert said, will \"be the last guys to go.\" **********Among railroads, CSX and Norfolk Southern would benefit because they would haul more coal from central Appalachia, said Sandor J. Toth, senior analyst at the Fieldston Company, of Washington, a coal transportation publishing and consulting firm. In the West, Burlington Northern Union Pacific and Southern Pacific would haul more coal, he said. **********Eastern Enterprises, which owns the Midland Enterprises barge company, would also benefit, said Mr. Villagran of Shearson. Its barges ply a variety of inland waterways, including the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. **********AS for consumers, higher transportation charges and the cost of scrubbers will almost certainly push up electric rates sharply in places -- primarily in the Middle West -- now using high-sulfur coal. Coal accounted for 32.3 percent of the energy produced in the nation last year, and represents the vast majority of American fossil-fuel reserves. The United States has more than one-third of the world's coal reserves. **********When the Clean Air Act was first passed, in 1970, it meant big changes for new generating stations, but older coal-using plants were exempt. **********This time, all the older plants are affected, and some experts say that so many utilities will rush for new supplies at once that they will bid up the price of rail freight. The market for coal at the mine is also likely to change, with the now-modest price spread between low- and high-sulfur coals likely to widen. Similar price changes occurred in the oil market back when regulators set limits on sulfur dioxide emissions from oil-burning plants. **********C oal does not now operate in a national market. For one thing, the product varies sharply from deposit to deposit in energy content per pound and other factors, and most boilers can handle only a small range of coals. For another, proximity has historically been the most important determinant, with relatively little coal shipped over long distances. **********Currently, the difference in price between low-sulfur and high is small. In Eastern Kentucky, where high- and low-sulfur coals are available, the premium for low-sulfur is usually about 25 cents per million British thermal units, said A. Denny Ellerman, a vice president of Charles River Associates, a consulting firm. (A million B.T.U.'s is an amount of heat sufficient to make about 100 kilowatt-hours of electricity. That is a little less than the typical American household uses in a week.) But the premium exists only for the lowest-sulfur coals; intermediate grades actually sell for about the same as high-sulfur fuel. **********THE reason is that under the current regulations, a generating station is either in compliance or it is not; being most of the way there is of no help. The new act, however, allows averaging of the emissions of plants owned by the same utility. **********According to Department of Energy figures, coal-fired plants comprise 300 gigawatts of electrical capacity, or 44 percent of the total generating capacity. The balance includes plants fired by natural gas and oil, nuclear reactors and hydroelectric stations. The coal plants work more of the year, however, producing about 56 percent of the electricity. **********Of the total capacity of 300 gigawatts, 70 gigawatts are already treated with scrubbers, according to the Department of Energy. Additional plants with a total of 42 gigawatts of capacity will probably switch to lower-sulfur coal, and plants with 92 gigawatts of capacity will install scrubbers, said C. Hoff Stauffer Jr., a vice president of Booz, Allen & Hamilton Inc. **********Shearson's estimate runs a little lower: plants with 40 gigawatts will switch fuels and plants with 55 to 60 gigawatts will add scrubbers. **********A few plants will try other solutions, like building new boilers that produce less pollution, or burning coal with natural gas to cut emissions. But under a system of emissions-trading approved by Congress, not every plant will have to change. A utility that adds a scrubber to its biggest, dirtiest plant would save so much sulfur dioxide that it could apply its \"overcompliance\" to smaller units that it did not clean up. **********Even with the wide expectation of large-scale coal switching, the low-sulfur coal producers are not rushing into new investments, however. At ARCO Coal, in Denver, which owns the Black Thunder mine, the biggest in the country, Curtis E. Burton, a spokesman, said the first step was to see which strategy the electric companies favor to comply with the new rules -- low-sulfur coal or scrubbers. \"Every utility has to sit down and do some serious calculation, what makes sense for them to meet the new standards,\" Mr. Burton said. **********The Black Thunder mine, in the Powder River Basin in northeast Wyoming, produces nearly 30 million tons of coal a year, or about 3 percent of the United States' total. It is very low-sulfur coal, suitable for blending with high-sulfur coal to produce a mix that still burns with emissions below the Federal limit. **********AN ANALYSIS performed for the Environmental Protection Agency by ICF Resources Inc. in July predicted that a bill like the one that eventually passed Congress would cut coal production by up to 97 million tons from the high-sulfur areas of the Middle West and northern Appalachia by the year 2005, compared with what production would have been without a new law. The replacement coal would come mostly from central Appalachia, with some from the West. The Western coal is extremely low sulfur, below 0.7 percent; central Appalachian coal is between 0.7 and 2 percent. **********Companies in both the Appalachians and the Powder River Basin have ample capacity to produce low-sulfur coal and can expand capacity quickly, so big low-sulfur price changes are unlikely. Mr. Burton said his company foresaw \"very small increases\" in prices. Even with a higher demand for Powder River Basin coal, he said, competition would still be strong among producers of that type. \"We're going to have to go out and hustle for every new piece of business,\" he said. **********A bigger barrier for Western coal is the cost of transportation. Delivery to power plants in the Middle West or Southeast can run as high as $25 a ton. Coal from the region generally sells for $5 to $7 a ton, so transportation can account for four-fifths of the delivered cost for the coal, although this is an extreme case; rail charges are usually closer to half the cost. **********But the effect of the Clean Air Act on the price of rail transport is hard to predict because costs are expected to rise sharply with volume, Mr. Toth said. If many utilities switch quickly to Western coal and begin hauling their fuel 1,500 miles instead of 200 miles, \"you're talking about a lot of new cars, and a lot of new locomotives,\" he explained, adding, \"Unless the railroads do some upgrading, we think there will be some problems.\" **********At the moment, Mr. Toth noted, \"You can get rail rates from the Powder River Basin of a penny a pound a mile.\" And \"Some utilities are going to make their investment decisions based on that number.\" That could turn out to be a big mistake. If railroad costs rise, he said, a trip that formerly cost $12 a ton could jump to $14. **********In any event, the railroads are reluctant to take major steps, he said, until it becomes clearer precisely what steps and what combinations of strategies the utilities are going to pursue, just how much low-sulfur coal will be shipped and how many new scrubbers will be installed instead. **********TRADING IN THE RIGHT TO POLLUTE **********THE new Clean Air Act will let coal-burning utilities produce, buy and sell something besides electricity: the right to pollute. **********In a system that has some economists cheering and utility regulators scratching their heads, the law will allow utilities to overcomply -- by reducing sulfur dioxide emissions below the legal limit -- and then \"sell\" the extra to another company. **********Suppose two companies each have to remove 1,000 tons of sulfur dioxide a year; one can do the job for $400 a ton, the other has to spend $600. The first can remove 2,000 tons and sell the extra reduction of 1,000 tons to the second company. If the price is more than $400, the first company makes a profit; if less than $600, the second company saves money. **********Scrubbers are, in fact, most cost-effective on big plants, especially the nation's 107 \"big dirties,\" as they are known. A scrubber on a big dirty might cut sulfur-dioxide emission by 99 percent -- from 5 pounds per million British thermal units, say, to 0.05 pounds. Since the standard, when fully phased in, is 1.2 pounds, a plant that installed a scrubber would have 1.15 pounds to sell or to store against problems that might come up in the future. **********Estimates vary on the worth of this pollution commodity, but Paul R. Portney of Resources for the Future, in Washington, puts the figure at about $2.5 billion. **********\"There is a shared savings,\" said Ashley C. Brown of the Ohio Public Utilities Commission, adding that savings can reduce rates. **********But it is not clear who should benefit, shareholder or consumer. Normally, electric customers pay for all construction through their electric bills, and get the benefit in available electricity. They could be asked to pay for extra anti-pollution equipment, and, indeed, get the benefit in reduced rates if the pollution trade works. **********But there will be some risk, both in trading in the volatile energy market and in using machinery that can quickly become obsolete. If the trade goes bad -- if the utility, say, finds itself having spent more to create a pollution credit than it can sell the credit for -- then the investment might be judged imprudent by state regulators. In that case, shareholders might have to eat the loss in the form of reduced dividends. **********Should the shareholder be asked to assume that level of risk without the possibility of gain?"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/30/business/czechoslovakia-imf.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 129, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Czechoslovakia-I.M.F.", "print_headline": "Czechoslovakia-I.M.F.", "body_text": " **********Czechoslovakia expects to join the International Monetary Fund and World Bank by the time the groups hold their annual meeting in September, the Czech Finance Minister, Vaclav Klaus, said last week.

Then, go back into business under a new name. Finally, turn around and buy the property from the Government at a fraction of its initial cost. Such are the shenanigans already afflicting Federal sales of property seized from failed savings and loans. There's more: consultants and former savings executives drawing six-figure payments to manage failed institutions; country-club expenses billed to the Government; a deposit on the sale of one building made with a suitcase of cash. Should the Government screen buyers, managers and brokers to make sure none were involved in the savings and loan collapse? Do that in Texas, some say, and almost nobody would be left to broker or buy. But with a single state accounting for more than half the 35,908 properties (book value $14.9 billion) up for sale, the bailout is likely to result in a flood of funds from the rest of the nation into Texas. **********Pointing Fingers in Washington **********It was tough enough for Democrats and Republicans to observe a tacit nonaggression pact when the savings and loan bailout amounted to some piddling tens of billions. But now that it is a certified, half-trillion-dollar disaster, politicians from the President on down are hunting for someone - someone else - to blame. Democrats accuse the Administration of causing a second savings and loan crisis by bungling the bailout that Congress approved last year. ''The minute the bill was signed, there was an abdication of responsibility,'' Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, said at a recent hearing. Marlin Fitzwater, speaking for the President, responded sharply last week. He cited the roles several Democratic senators and House members played in the mess, and said, ''There are a lot of battles that can be fought on this turf, and we're ready.'' **********Accusations Against Neil Bush **********Mr. Fitzwater's attack on the Democrats took place the same day it was revealed that Federal regulators had considered banning the President's son, Neil, from the banking business. A draft document released by the House Banking Committee said Mr. Bush had violated rules on conflicts of interest three times as a director of the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver. For lack of evidence, the Office of Thrift Supervision has instead has sought only to prohibit Mr. Bush from violating the rules again. Mr. Bush has said he did nothing wrong. **********Bargains, but for Whom? **********Last week brought a sobering example of the losses the Government can expect for real estate taken from failed savings institutions. The Gibraltar Savings Association invested $330 milion in the Stonebridge Ranch, a dazzling spread of golf courses, man-made ponds and million-dollar homes north of Dallas. Richard C. Strauss, son of the former Democratic Party chairman, Robert S. Strauss, was the project's manager. The Government agreed on Thursday to sell it for $61 million to Yukio Kitano, a Japanese industrialist. **********Credit Crunch Is Relative **********Alan Greenspan isn't keeping Fed-guessers guessing. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve Board chairman said on Capitol Hill that the economy will keep chugging along without risk of recession. And, implicitly, without easier money from the Fed. And what about those complaints of a credit crunch? Credit seems tight only when compared with the lax standards that bankers and regulators have allowed, he said. **********No Free Ride for LTV **********The Supreme Court ruled last week that the Government can limit its Aid to Corporations with Dependent Pensioners. Only the truly needy companies will qualify, not those in search of a handout. In the case at issue, the LTV Corporation filed for bankruptcy four years ago and turned its responsibilities over to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which paid reduced benefits. Then LTV agreed in talks with the United Steelworkers of America to make up much of the difference between the Federal payouts and its former pension plan. The agency saw that its safety net was becoming more of a trampoline. It ordered LTV to resume paying for its pension plan without Government support, and the case went to court. The ruling will keep corporations from dumping more of their pension costs on the agency, which is already in financial trouble **********Economy Winds Down **********The latest gross national product economy is gasping but growing. A 1.9 percent annual growth rate for the first quarter, after a 1.1 percent rise in the fourth quarter last year, continued the weakest pace of expansion since 1986. The first-quarter number was revised last week from an earlier estimate of 1.3 percent, but economists paid more attention to a lowered figure for consumption. ''It points to slower growth ahead,'' said Joseph Carson, senior economist at Chemical Bank. **********Stocks Stumble **********The Dow Jones industrial average fell 78.71 points last week to 2,857.18. Traders blamed familiar culprits: computerized trading programs, a weakening bond market and fears of lower corporate profits. **********COMPANIES **********The Patent Wars **********Between Japan and America, the patent battles can be as punishing as the trade wars. A Federal District Court judge banned Motorola Inc. and Hitachi Ltd. from selling some chips last week; a higher court soon issued a stay. Analysts say Motorola faces the greater threat. The patent squabble pits Motorola's popular 68030 chip, used in Apple Macintosh and Sun Microsystems computers, against a Hitachi chip not yet sold in this country. ''If both chips had to stop shipping, Motorola would be hurt more,'' said John M. Geraghty, an analyst at First Boston. He added that Motorola is accused of far fewer patent violations than Hitachi. The broader issue might be the balance of power in patents, he said, with Japanese companies finding it much easier to enforce patent rights in the United States than American companies do in Japan. Hitachi led all companies in American patents last year, with 1,053. **********Ben's Advice for Mr. Trump **********Donald J. Trump went to the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where he presumably studied the art of leverage. He might have done better to study the teachings of the university's father, Benjamin Franklin. ''He who goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrowing,'' Franklin said. If Mr. Trump can claim that his methods rescued Central Park's Wollman Rink, Franklin even made the colonial postal system profitable. Mr. Trump has insisted he is no gambler: ''I've never gambled in my life. To me, a gambler is someone who plays slot machines. I prefer to own slot machines.'' But Franklin would have kept him from exaggerating his casinos' expected performance. ''Ah, think what you do when you run in debt; you give to another power over your liberty,'' Franklin said. ''The second vice is lying, the first is running in debt. 'Tis hard for an empty bag to stand upright.'' Even outside of work, Mr. Trump has failed to follow some of Franklin's best-known advice: ''In all your amours, you should prefer old women to young ones.'' **********In Brief **********E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company plans to build four plants to produce refrigerants that, unlike chlorofluorocarbons, would not deplete the atmosphere's ozone layer. *********** **********The House Judiciary Committee voted last week to repeal most of the insurance industry's exemptions from antitrust law, the first time such a measure has gone so far. It is still more likely to become a ''cash cow'' - provoking insurance companies to raise their campaign contributions - than a law. **********INTERNATIONAL **********Bustin' the Charts **********Rapper turned recording mogul? M. C. Hammer said last week that he was starting his own label, Bustin' Records. Mr. Hammer's first venture in the industry came three years ago, when he was an assistant to Charles Finley, owner of the Oakland Athletics baseball team. He borrowed enough from a couple players to press his own record, then sold thousands from his basement and the back of his car. A contract with Capital Records followed. Now Mr. Hammer's second album, ''Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em,'' has the top spot on Billboard's chart, and his own label has plans to release albums by 10 new groups. **********'Junk' Casualty **********The Coniston Partners will be among Wall Street's most feared corporate raiders no more. They plan to return the proceeds from their main, $700 million investment fund to backers. With the stock market high and the ''junk bond'' market low, Coniston has all but run out of financing and promising deals. The firm was founded on the familiar 1980's premise that forcing companies to cough up huge payoffs for noisy, impatient investors would somehow improve corporate performance. That notion at least did wonders for Coniston's performance, with 40 percent annual returns common until the firm lagged the stock market last year. The partners plan to keep their stakes in TW Services Inc. and the UAL Corporation, which after repeated raids and restructuring has gone from being the nation's largest airline to No. 2. **********An Even Bigger Philip Morris **********The Philip Morris Companies agreed on Friday to buy most of the operations of Jacobs Suchard A.G., the Swiss coffee and chocolate company, for $3.8 billion. The deal will vastly expand Philip Morris's presence in Europe, where its Kraft General Foods subsidiary already has revenues of more than $3 billion. Suchard's products include the familiar triangular Toblerone chocolate bars. Suchard will further Philip Morris's diversification away from tobacco. **********A First Bout of Unemployment **********East German unemployment is already surging. The official rate rose from 100,000 to 130,000 in the first two weeks of June. East German leaders have said they expect at least 20 percent of their nation's businesses to shut down after the two German economies become one on July 2. Economists say that more than 2 million of East Germany's 9 million workers will lose their jobs over the next year. Under its Communist rulers, the country had no unemployment - but plenty of inefficient factories spewing out second-rate goods. **********The Real Taj **********The ''Trumped-up Taj,'' one Indian newspaper called it. Indian publications just can't see how a wealthy American could transform a classic Mogul memorial into a mish-mash of onion domes, minarets and zillion-watt neon signs. ''It demonstrates that Hollywood does not have a monopoly on bad taste,'' said The Saturday Statesman. The original Taj was built in the 17th century by Shah Jehan as a tomb for his beloved consort, Mumtaz Mahal. Unlike Donald J. Trump, The Sunday Observer said, Shah Jehan needed no bank loans.

The Government's Case **********Mr. Milken, the former head of the high-yield \"junk bond\" division of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., pleaded guilty to six felonies in April. Judge Wood ordered the hearing to determine whether Mr. Milken's crimes were part of a broader criminal conspiracy, as the Government says, or were individual instances of going too far to help a client, as the defense contends. **********The Government chose three transactions to demonstrate that Mr. Milken committed more crimes than those he admitted. The first involved a 1986 manipulation of shares of the Wickes Companies Inc., in what the Government contends was an effort by Mr. Milken to push the stock price up to allow Wickes to redeem an exepensive preferred security. **********While agreeing a manipulation took place, the defense argued in its brief that the Government had no consistent evidence that Mr. Milken was part of it. Witnesses contradicted one another about their roles in the manipulation, a fact that the defense used to challenge the credibility of the evidence. A Conspicuous Absence >HE> **********The defense also argued that the Government's failure to call Ivan F. Boesky, the former arbitrager and a key witness in the Government's investigation of Mr. Milken, \"looms especially large.\" **********The defense brief also contended that the Government failed to prove its case in the second transaction. That involved the 1985 buyout of Storer Communications Inc., in which prosecutors contended that Mr. Milken misappropriated an equity stake from the deal and bribed money managers with it. **********Mr. Milken's lawyers said employee partnerships, which included Mr. Milken, received a large portion of the equity after committing to purchase $154 million worth of a risky preferred security. Such an investment in a Drexel deal was not unusual, given the relationship between Mr. Milken and the company, the document said. In 1985, Mr. Milken and his brother, Lowell, lent $27 million to the company, it said.   Caesar's World Bonds **********Giving money managers of high-yield bond funds the opportunity to invest in a partnership that held the Storer equity was not a bribe to get their institutional funds to invest in the deal, the defense document contended. All the money managers called by the Government testified that they received the offer to invest in the partnership after the funds had already purchased their securities. **********In the last transaction, in which the Government contends Mr. Milken engaged in insider trading in the bonds of Caesars World Inc., the defense argued that Mr. Milken had no inside information at the time he made trades in the bonds. In addition, the document says a trade that was the focus of testimony at the hearing took place days after Mr. Milken left the country for a vacation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/15/business/fast-food-and-bookstores-top-list-for-openings-in-80-s.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1990-11-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 567, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fast Food and Bookstores Top List for Openings in '80's", "print_headline": "Fast Food and Bookstores Top List for Openings in '80's", "body_text": " **********In the last decade, Americans' love for fast food, reading, home electronics and sporting goods helped to cause a boom in specialty stores.

He mentioned the aging population, the increase in the number of working women, large increases in the population of blacks and Hispanic people, and more double-income families. **********With more women working outside the home, the trend of couples and families eating out is growing, as is the popularity of one-stop shopping locations, he said. \"The double-income household also is creating a larger market for more expensive merchandise and also provides opportunities for people to spend more money for their leisure-time activities,\" Mr. Dutka said. **********Americans are living longer and leading more active lives, Mr. Dutka said. \"This is why the sporting goods are growing so much,\" he said. **********Some kinds of local and neighborhood stores are increasing, in great part because the two fastest-growing population groups are those of Hispanic background and blacks, who prefer to shop locally, he said. \"While overall U.S. population grew 11 percent in the decade, the number of Hispanics in the country rose 32 percent and blacks by 15 percent,\" Mr. Dutka said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/25/business/infotechnology-gets-new-top-executives.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1990-10-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 416, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Infotechnology Gets New Top Executives", "print_headline": "Infotechnology Gets New Top Executives", "body_text": " **********The board of the troubled Financial News Network and Infotechnology Inc., which owns 47 percent of FNN, announced a new management team for the companies yesterday in the face of severe cash-flow difficulties. **********The companies appointed Alan J.

Now, the agency has billings of about $60 million and a roster of clients including Rolling Rock and Labatt's beers, E. J. Brach's candy and Sportschannel. **********The agency has established itself as an important player in the New York advertising scene and is competing in the creative reviews for two big accounts -- MCI Communications, at $50 million, and Nikon, at $15 million -- against some big names like Ammirati & Puris, TBWA Advertising and BBDO. **********Yet becoming established in New York has not been easy for Hill, Holliday. For the first few years it was plagued by the same problem that most outside agencies face when they move to Madison Avenue, some analysts said. In order to succeed, the New York branch must establish an identity separate from its well-known parent. Otherwise, clients can see no reason for choosing the offspring. **********\"We had to differentiate ourselves from the main office because clients aren't interested in just a smaller version of Hill, Holliday,\" said Susan Smith, the managing director of the New York office. **********The agency had been having trouble doing that because management in New York had changed frequently and top executives from the Boston headquarters were too involved in running the office. **********But during the last year there have been several significant management changes. Hill, Holliday transferred Ms. Smith from Boston to run the New York office. Several other top people from Boston were also sent to New York. But the most important addition was John Ferrell, a former top creative executive at Young & Rubicam, who joined Hill, Holliday at the beginning of the year as it chief creative officer. **********With Mr. Ferrell on board, executives at the main office have given the New York office far more autonomy, Ms. Smith said. \"They wouldn't second-guess his work,\" she added. **********What Mr. Ferrell has done in New York is establish the office as a specialist in packaged-goods, hiring experts in creating that kind of advertising. \"Boston is a master at creating advertising for services like John Hancock insurance and hard goods like Wang computers,\" Mr. Ferrell said. \"Clients who want the Hill Holliday touch for packaged goods can come to New York.\" **********Hill, Holliday, which has total billings of about $400 million, has made its reputation creating unconventional, often emotional, advertising like the lifelike mini-dramas for John Hancock insurance and the Zen-like ads to introduce Nissan's Infiniti that featured rocks and trees but no cars. **********The first big campaign created by Mr. Ferrell has a similar unexpected approach. Unlike most ads for pain killers, the Motrin commercials do not focus on someone who is suffering. The ads do not show the product or anyone getting relief. **********Instead, the commercials zero in on a person trying to help. One spot features a woman telling her husband, \"I can't let you sit there and complain about your arthritis pain.\" The camera, which focuses solely on the woman talking about how she is going to help, bobs and weaves, cutting the woman partly out of the scene at times. It creates the effect of someone woozy with pain stumbling around a room. **********By creating a voyeuristic feeling and simulating how pain influences behavior, the agency is trying to create ads that hold the interest of consumers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/19/business/the-media-business-advertising-arnell-bickford-plans-to-open-on-west-coast.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1990-03-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;   Arnell/Bickford Plans To Open on West Coast", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;   Arnell/Bickford Plans To Open on West Coast", "body_text": " **********Peter Arnell, the co-founder of Arnell/Bickford Associates, said his New York agency would open a West Coast office in Santa Monica, Calif., in April.

With his team, the engineer waited expectantly, hoping for praise and encouragement; the plan was the result of months of work. **********But the reaction from the vice president was harsh. ''These specifications are ridiculous,'' he said. ''They haven't a chance of getting past my desk.'' Then, his voice thick with sarcasm, he added, ''How long have you been out of graduate school?'' **********''The engineer was crushed,'' said Dr. Hendrie Weisinger, a psychologist at the School of Management at the University of California at Los Angeles, who tells the story. ''For two weeks, he could think only about his humiliation in front of his team. He hated the vice president and worried over his future. He thought of leaving the company.'' **********Dr. Weisinger - whose book ''The Critical Edge: How to Criticize Up and Down Your Organization and Make It Pay Off'' was published earlier this year by Harper & Row - offers the tale as an example of the most common errors managers make in giving criticism. ''The worst way to criticize is with a blanket statement, like, 'You're really screwing up,' without offering the person some way to do things better,'' said Dr. Weisinger. ''It leaves the other person feeling helpless and angry.'' **********Dr. Weisinger is one of several psychologists studying the fine art of criticism, which, they say, is typically approached with far too little finesse, if it is practiced at all. Yet failing to let people know when they are faltering is, of course, a recipe for disaster. **********An artful critique can be one of the most helpful messages a manager can send. ''It's how the manager delivers a criticism that determines whether its effects will be productive or disastrous,'' said Robert Baron, a professor of psychology and management at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. The hallmarks of artful criticism include being specific, making no threats, placing no personal blame - and being timely. The key, said Dr. Baron, is that the person receiving the criticism feel that he or she is ''being helped to do better.'' **********''Giving criticism is one of the most important jobs a manager has,'' Dr. Weisinger said. ''But it's also one of the most unpleasant tasks managers face, and one of the most often put off.'' **********That delay can be costly. A supervisor's failure to give an employee timely criticism led to a $250,000 claim for wrongful termination, said Laurie Dutcher, director of human resources at the Capital Area Community Health Plan, in Latham, N.Y. **********''She was fired because of a terrible absentee record, but she didn't feel her performance was lacking in any way,'' Ms. Dutcher said. ''For years, her supervisor had put off telling her that she was remiss. We find that story often, with a manager being too uncomfortable giving criticism to let employees know when they are failing.'' **********Also, when managers let their dissatisfactions build up without saying anything at all, she said, the result is likely to be an outburst. ''Too often, a manager just blows up,'' said Dr. Baron. He encourages managers to ''give negative feedback as needed, regularly, and in small chunks, with suggestions for how to do the job better.'' a If a manager realizes he or she has offered crticism that is destructive, Dr. Baron urges an apology. ''You've damaged the relationship, and you have to get in there and repair things,'' he said. But many managers do not recognize their criticism as destructive. Dr. Weisinger said that the engineer, still feeling bitter, approached his boss two weeks later, and asked: ''What were you trying to accomplish?'' The vice president was astonished, said Dr. Weisinger. ''He simply hadn't realized how he was coming off.'' If criticism is being delivered ineffectively, Dr. Baron has found, the person receiving it simply makes excuses but does not change, is defensive and may simply avoid the critic. **********''The sign your criticism is skilful,'' he said, ''is that the person changes as you desired.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/06/business/credit-markets-treasury-prices-fall-in-light-day.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1990-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 912, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Treasury Prices Fall in Light Day", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS;   Treasury Prices Fall in Light Day", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury securities dipped and interest rates rose slightly in fairly light trading yesterday, as dealers positioned themselves for the release this morning of June employment data. **********The traders pushed prices lower early in the session in reaction to a report in The Wall Street Journal that the Bush Administration was considering whether to impose a sales tax on a wide range of securities, including stocks and bonds.

But Iraq also has huge outstanding debts to Japan and some European countries on which payments will now be indefinitely suspended. **********West Could Face Own Weapons **********If the current trade embargo leads to a naval blockade of Iraq, Western nations may find themselves confronting sophisticated weapons, including supersonic aircraft and missiles, that they themselves have supplied. **********In the hours and days that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week, Western Europe and Japan have nonetheless closed ranks with the United States, ordering freezes of Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets, banning oil imports from the two countries and forbidding exports to Iraq. **********One of the earliest signs of Western Europe's new determination to confront President Hussein has been its willingness to discuss the crisis at the headquarters of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels. In the past, France in particular has insisted that NATO has no authority to act in the Middle East. **********''Usually in these cases you have the United States calling for action and the rest talking about diplomatic solutions,'' one NATO official said. ''Not this time. Everyone, including France, believes something should be done. And everyone, including France, agrees this is an issue of direct interest to NATO.'' **********France's position is specially complicated because it has long been Europe's main supplier of both armaments and credits to Iraq. For example, during Iraq's war with Iran between 1980 and 1988, France provided some $17 billion of armaments to Baghdad, including Mirage fighters and Exocet missiles. **********Iraq Owes France Billions **********Since the war ended, French construction and electronics companies have also signed important contracts with Iraq. Today, Iraq owes France around $4.5 billion, including $2.5 billion for weapons. Arms sales to Iraq were suspended in May only because Baghdad fell behind on its debt payments. **********When the crisis erupted last Thursday, however, France apparently decided it could not be seen wavering. It quickly froze Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets and took the initiative of proposing that the 12-nation European Community boycott Iraqi oil and cut off arms sales to the country. **********Some domestic critics have charged that the Government shares responsibility for Iraq's aggression. A cartoon in Le Monde today showed Western hostages being led away by a tank marked, ''Made in France.'' But this has only prompted the Government to take a firmer stance, including dispatching a frigate to join two warships already in the Gulf area. **********Britain, in contrast, is not believed to have supplied weapons to Iraq, but British companies have also been vying for lucrative contracts in Iraq. And in recent months, opposition politicians in London have accused Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of overlooking assorted abuses of Iraqi power in the name of protecting British business interests. **********Just this year, Iraq ignored British protests and hanged a London-based Iranian-born journalist on spying charges. Iraq was also accused of trying to smuggle American-made nuclear triggers through Heathrow Airport in London and of acquiring parts in Britain and elsewhere in Europe for a gigantic gun. Baghdad denied both charges. **********But after the invasion of Kuwait, a former British protectorate with an estimated $28 billion worth of assets in Britain, Mrs. Thatcher immediately ordered a freeze of Kuwaiti holdings and, during a quick visit to the United States, showed herself anxious to coordinate the Western response with President Bush. **********No Japanese Peacekeepers **********Japan's stake in the crisis can be measured by the fact that it has not only been the main provider of foreign aid to Iraq, is a major exporter to Iraq and is owed some $4.7 billion by the Baghdad Government, but has also received about 12 percent of its oil during the first six months of this year from Iraq and Kuwait. **********But despite some domestic claims that Tokyo hesitated in responding to the Kuwaiti invasion, waiting until Sunday to announce a full embargo of trade and aid, the Government has insisted that it moved quickly on sanctions, despite the considerable commercial losses involved. **********Japan is nonetheless bracing for criticism for not offering to involve its armed forces. ''Our Constitution prohibits our military contribution, even to peacekeeping forces,'' Taizo Watanabe, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said. ''We have made it clear we will do what we can in a non-military way. But we don't know what kind of a contribution we can make.'' **********In Western Europe, apart from Britain and France, no other country has so far indicated willingness to participate in a naval blockade of Iraq, while Greece has announced that United States bases in Crete could not be used as a springboard for military action in the Middle East. **********In Bonn, a spokesman said the question of West German involvement in a maritime blockade ''has not yet been raised'' and refused to comment further. The magazine Der Spiegel claimed this week that West German firms had helped Iraq develop ''military nuclear technology, construction of rockets and production of poison gases.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/24/business/even-as-profits-fall-home-builder-plans-to-gain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1177, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Even as Profits Fall, Home Builder Plans to Gain", "print_headline": "Even as Profits Fall, Home Builder Plans to Gain", "body_text": " **********The Ryland Group, the nation's second-largest home builder, took analysts by surprise earlier this summer when it said it would earn less in the second quarter than it had expected. **********''Some people couldn't believe that what was happening to everybody else was happening to Ryland,'' said Melissa Cook, a New York-based analyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. **********The Columbia, Md., builder of moderately priced houses has indeed started to smart from the real estate downturn that is already consolidating its rivals. With housing starts at their lowest level since the early 1980's, Ryland's net earnings declined 46 percent in the second quarter, to $5.7 million, from the corresponding period last year. **********Low-Risk, Conservative Strategy **********But Ryland is showing the same resilience in the low point of this cycle as it has shown in previous slumps. Its success arises from a low-risk, conservative approach that limits the 23-year-old company's profits in boom times, but cushions it from losses during the downturns. **********''They have a tremendous record of long-term performance and will come out ahead,'' said Kenneth Campbell of Audit Investments, a money management company in Montvale, N.J. ''You cannot kick them in the teeth now simply because they aren't going to perform this year.'' **********While hundreds of home builders have gone bankrupt since early 1989, Ryland, one of the few that are publicly traded, earned $170 million on revenues of $1.4 billion last year. Today, it is one of the least leveraged companies in the business, allowing it to borrow and expand at a time when competitors are retrenching. **********Aiming to Gain Market Share **********In fact, Charles E. (Ted) Peck, Ryland's chairman and chief executive, said the company aims to double shareholders' equity in each of the next five years - just as it has in every year for the last 17. It hopes to pick up market share as rivals weaken, luring home buyers with financing plans that few in the industry can afford to offer. **********At the heart of its strategy is the fact that Ryland, unlike many home builders, rarely ties up its money in raw land. It buys finished lots already equipped with roads, sewage, water and utility systems. This method enables the company to get its money out of properties more quickly and reduces its borrowing costs and the risks of having an inventory of undeveloped lots when demand for new houses is slack, as it is today. **********In the rare instance when it buys raw land - as it does in California because developed lots are scarce -Ryland minimizes its risk by buying the properties in joint ventures with financial institutions. **********Debt-to-Equity Ratio: 0.5 to 1 **********''By using financial partners, they get only half the profits, but they can keep capital in lines they prefer,'' said Barbara K. Allen, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company. As a result, Ryland's debt-to-equity ratio is only 0.5 to 1, Ms. Allen said. By contrast, the top 100 builders had an average ratio of 8.4 to 1 last year, according to Builder magazine. **********''Ryland may have missed out in some markets, but they are not suffering the catastrophic losses from borrowing that other builders are,'' Ms. Cook said. In fact, at a time when bank regulators are tightening commercial lending standards and developers of all stripes are finding it difficult to obtain financing, Ryland recently managed to complete a three-year revolving credit agreement with about a dozen banks for $265 million. **********''I think our conservative practices offer them some reassurance,'' Mr. Peck said. **********Cautious Top Executives **********Ryland's conservative approach is in keeping with the backgrounds of its top executives, analysts say. While most home builders are headed by risk-taking entrepreneurs, Mr. Peck, who is 64 years old, worked for the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation for 32 years before joining Ryland in 1981, where he considered himself ''an organizational man.'' He was most recently an executive vice president and director of Owens-Corning. **********Before becoming president of Ryland in May, Roger W. Schipke, who is 53, was a senior vice president of the General Electric Company's $5.6 billion-a-year appliance division. **********Mr. Schipke is scheduled to become chief executive in January and may become chairman later next year when Mr. Peck retires, analysts say. He is expected to carry on in the company's cautious tradition. **********''He seems very much like Mr. Peck and takes a very analytical, well-thought-out approach to strategy,'' Ms. Allen said. ''Mr. Schipke is expected to continue the positive leadership left under Mr. Peck.'' **********Orders Down 21% in First Half **********Yet, Ryland recently started to skid. The company booked 4,207 orders for homes (their average sale price last year was $116,000) during the first six months of this year, a 21 percent decline from the corresponding period in 1989. **********And times are getting tougher. Housing starts have slipped to their lowest level since the recession of nearly a decade ago. Based on July's figures, new houses and apartments are being built at a seasonably adjusted annual rate of 1.15 million, the lowest level since September 1982. **********And with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait earlier this month have come renewed fears of inflation and the prospect of higher interest rates, which would further hurt housing sales. **********More Bankruptcies Expected **********Analysts expect bankrupcties among home builders this year to top those in 1989, when 1,840 builders of single-family homes went under, according to statistics compiled by Dun & Bradstreet. That figure is scarcely 1 percent of the approximately 200,000 home builders nationwide, most of which build fewer than 10 houses a year. **********Indeed, Ryland's stock has been trading at its lowest level in two years. Trading as high as $25.50 a share in 1989, it closed yesterday at $11.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, down 25 cents. **********Yet Ryland says it is less vulnerable to the vagaries of regional economies than many of its rivals, most of which operate locally, because it builds houses in 17 states. **********Shift of Regional Profits **********While most builders began feeling the slowdown in demand in 1987, Ryland thrived until about a year ago because of its business in Washington, D.C., and California, where real estate values continued to increase until recently. Ryland is now likely to pin its hopes on regions experiencing slight rebounds like Phoenix, Houston and Denver. **********Ryland says its ability to provide financing also gives it an edge. It is one of only about two dozen home builders to provide financing to its buyers. Ryland's mortgage unit has accounted for about 17 percent of the company's earnings for the last five years. **********''The mortgage company is not a big-income item, but it definitely gives them an edge in times when credit is tight,'' said Michael Mead, vice president of research at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. in Baltimore."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/18/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-magazine-revenues-up.html": {"writer_name": "Anthony Ramirez", "pub_date": "1990-07-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Magazine Revenues Up", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING - ADDENDA;   Magazine Revenues Up", "body_text": " **********Magazine advertising revenues for the first half of 1990 rose a slim 1.6 percent, to $3.28 billion, compared with the period a year earlier, according to the Publishers Information Bureau.

The town has its own television production station, and there is a computerized fan system to prevent frost damage to the bushy, well-kept rows of plum trees in the neighboring hills. **********One Big Problem **********It would have been yet another tale of the success of Japanese planning were it not for a deeply troubling piece of news to the local residents: despite Oyama's rising affluence, its population is shrinking, a dagger in the heart of its future. **********The population of the town, which spreads out from the crystal clear, gravelly Oyama River into the nearby wooded hills, fell from 6,500 in 1950 to 4,700 in 1975. That is when its plum- and chestnut-induced prosperity seemed to take hold, and the population leveled off. But the problem returned in 1986, as the population began to decline again, to about 4,500 now. And it is still falling. **********The most disconcerting aspect of this drop is that it has been concentrated among Oyama's youth. From 1955 to 1985, the number of people under 20 years old was halved to 1,300, while the number of people over 60 doubled, to slightly more than 1,000. **********''We just don't have the variety of things to do for young people here,'' Hideo Ogata, head of planning for the town government, said at the local farm cooperative recently on the last day of the plum harvest. **********As he observed plastic crates of the hard green plums, which are usually preserved in salt as a condiment, piling up on the loading dock, their sweet plummy scent filling the humid air, Mr. Ogata added, ''We've improved things a lot, but this is not a city.'' **********Now, Wealth Is the Enemy **********The enemy today, here in the center of Kyushu, the volcanic southern island, is not poverty but, in a sense, wealth. Freed from the need to scratch out a living in the countryside, many of Oyama's young people are fleeing for the more comfortable attractions of urban life. **********Reflecting this shift, Japan's cities are booming. The Tokyo metropolitan region's population has shot up from 21 million in 1965 to 24 million in 1970 and 31 million today, roughly a fourth of the nation's people. To Japan's leaders this is a source of concern that the cities have become much too big. **********It is a problem that goes to the heart of Japan's professed agrarian self-image and the realities of modern, industrialized Japan. The Government has regularly insisted when defending Japan's ban on imported rice that the farmers and their ancient traditions must be protected because they are the soul of the nation. **********But the young people of Oyama and other areas who prefer factory or white-collar jobs are making it clear that those symbols cannot compete with urban pleasures in a television age. **********''My generation was the U-turn generation,'' said Masakatsu Kurokawa, a 33-year-old hoisting his crates of plums onto a conveyer belt to be graded and then weighed. ''We left, and then came back when we saw how much people were making with the other crops. But you look at the young people here today: they're more individualistic and they say they need more variety. This place can't keep them.'' **********The Young Move Away **********Toyohiro Kawazu, who is 26, said he left for a while and worked in a supermarket in a nearby city, then returned to be with his family. ''I never thought of living away forever,'' he said, ''but a lot of my friends will.'' **********Mr. Ogata said: ''Before 1985, rarely did we have a problem with farmers getting one of their sons to take over the farms. Now it is common.'' **********It is a little to hard now to imagine the grinding poverty that older residents say existed here previously, when this was one of the poorest villages in one of the poorest prefectures in Japan. **********Harumi Yahata, the Mayor in the 1960's who began the self-improvement campaign, said many of the town's women had come down with a painful ailment because of their heavy work and poor diet. Children frequently suffered from malnutrition, he added. **********He told of the problems while sitting on the leather sofa of his comfortably air-conditioned home, surrounded by a large color television, a fax machine and, just outside the glass sliding doors leading to his backyard, an electric lawn mower. **********'We Need Something New' **********Mr. Yahata was emphatic in declaring that the town could overcome the problems once again, although many of the farmers at the cooperative did not agree. He acknowledged that it would be a constant battle, that Oyama could never expect the natural course of events to sustain it into the future. In effect, he was conceding that village life in a country that likes to think of itself as one big village was on a sort of life-support system: if it was stopped, the village would fail. **********''There are many things we could do,'' Mr. Yahata said. ''We have to shorten the work hours for the farmers, and we have to constantly find new products that require less work and have a higher value. We cannot stop, though. We need something new all the time, or Oyama will not survive. It will be a museum.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/21/business/company-news-bp-to-auction-dutch-gas-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 180, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  B.P. to Auction Dutch Gas Unit", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   B.P. to Auction Dutch Gas Unit", "body_text": " **********British Petroleum P.L.C. said it would auction off its gas exploration and production holding company in the Netherlands. **********B.P. refused to disclose the estimated value of BP Exploration B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of British Petroleum Netherlands. **********The unit holds stakes in 23 offshore fields and two on shore.

What he doesn't get is a secretary, or a phone - or a desk, for that matter. **********More than six months after President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro defeated Sandinista leaders in national elections, she has made clear her determination to seek reconciliation with her former Sandinista opponents. But she has found no such truce with her Vice President. **********From the day after his inauguration, when he arrived at the presidential office building to find that he was not allowed past the front desk, Mr. Godoy has learned that his prickly conservative world view does not fit within the new President's vision of Nicaragua's political future. **********A political party boss and former Sandinista Labor Minister, Mr. Godoy was initially opposed by business people and the American Embassy here as too liberal to serve as Mrs. Chamorro's running mate. **********But as Mrs. Chamorro has moved to find common ground with Sandinista leaders, her Vice President's unyielding criticism of the former Government has made him the most visible spokesman for conservative Nicaraguans. **********All Official Doors Shut **********''With Godoy, people know what they're getting,'' a European diplomat said. ''If they are disappointed with the Government and angry with the Sandinistas, they turn to him as a man who will stick to the program. He says what they want to hear.'' The combative Vice President has lost few opportunities to express his disagreement with the way the new Government is handling its democratic mandate. Mrs. Chamorro has responded by shutting every official door Mr. Godoy might care to enter, whether to Cabinet meetings, political negotiating sessions, regional diplomatic talks or his own office. **********Mr. Godoy has no government budget, no government vehicle, no government aides, no government bodyguard - and, most poignantly of all, no government audience. **********''I go to each of the ministries to find out what is going on and to tell them what I think,'' Mr. Godoy said matter of factly. ''Otherwise no one would be talking to me at all.'' **********The political feud between the President and Vice President, who remain cordial, even friendly, in public, reflects the diversity of the political coalition that brought Mrs. Chamorro to power, and the marriage of convenience that gave Mr. Godoy the second spot on the ballot after he lost his battle with Mrs. Chamorro for the presidential nomination last fall. **********The conflict is an extension of campaign trail tensions that brought the chief advisers for both politicians to physical blows on a public stage at the height of the election process last January. It has since been played out in the National Assembly, where Mr. Godoy holds sway over at least a dozen and as many as two dozen seats in Mrs. Chamorro's 51-seat majority. **********A Target of the Sandinistas **********But relations have also been aggravated by the sharp tongue and independence of the Vice President himself, an experienced lawyer and former university professor. **********The political implications of the Vice President's maverick image have not been lost on the Sandinista leadership, which Mr. Godoy challenged on his own in national elections in 1984, winning 10 percent of the vote, even after formally withdrawing his name in the final moments of the campaign. **********Sandinista news organizations have generally avoided direct criticism of Mrs. Chamorro, who is a figure of broad national sympathy. Instead, they have focused blistering attacks on Mr. Godoy, who is portrayed as a dangerous, erratic reactionary. **********Such ostracism from the country's two major political forces pushed the Vice President into growing isolation soon after Inauguration Day last April. But it has brought him back into the limelight as tensions over Sandinista strikes and protests - and the Government's reaction to them -have grown. **********As Mrs. Chamorro negotiated to bring an end to violent Sandinista strikes in July, Mr. Godoy became an instant hero to armed pro-Government Nicaraguans, who took to the streets to tear down Sandinista barricades. **********The Voice Is Silenced **********Mrs. Chamorro brushed off Mr. Godoy's incendiary recommendation that she call her supporters into the streets to oppose the strike. **********But the Vice President's followers staked out their turf, anyway, taking over the politically turbulent neighborhood of Ciudad Jardin, where Mr. Godoy maintains the ramshackle offices of his political party. And with the Government stations off the air, the conservative Radio Corporation, from the same neighborhood, kept up a drumbeat of reports, interviewing Mr. Godoy about the situation and reporting on the spreading skirmishes outside its studios. **********That, it seems, was enough for Mrs. Chamorro and the Sandinistas alike. In the only such police action she has taken, Mrs. Chamorro ordered her riot squads to forcibly disarm the citizens of Ciudad Jardin. **********At the same time, a squad of four demolition experts, widely presumed to be from the Sandinista-controlled army, blew up Radio Corporation's transmitting tower, silencing Nicaragua's Vice President so that his Government could finish talking."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/02/business/the-media-business-advertising-chiat-day-lays-off-30-in-new-york.html": {"writer_name": "Kim Foltz", "pub_date": "1990-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 708, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;   Chiat/Day Lays Off 30 In New York", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;   Chiat/Day Lays Off 30 In New York", "body_text": " **********CHIAT/DAY/MOJO, the Venice, Calif., agency that seemed to have the golden touch in the last decade, announced yesterday that it had laid off 30 employees in its 150-person New York office, which has lost three major accounts this year. **********Chiat/Day employees, aware of the financial pressures on the agency, which built its reputation on its Nike and Apple Computer ads, said that the number of layoffs could go as high as 50 this month. **********Jane Newman, the president of the New York office, said the layoffs were necessary because one of the office's biggest clients, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, had decided to put its $35 million account into review. ''We aren't sure that we are going to re-pitch the account,'' she said. ''This is the prudent thing to do.'' **********If, as expected, the agency loses the Royal Caribbean account, it will be the fourth big loss this year for the New York office. It lost the $7 million Sara Lee bakery account; the $5 million to $10 million Bissel account and the $30 million Reebok account. American Express and the New York Life Insurance Company have also cut back substantially on their advertising spending with the Chiat/Day New York office, which currently has billings of about $130 million. **********The loss of the Royal Caribbean account would mean billings at the New York office would fall below the critical $100 million mark. It is generally believed in the industry that agencies with billings of less than $100 million would not be considered by national clients for their large accounts. **********The recent problems at the New York office have sparked rumors that there will be a management shake-up there, with several of the office's top executives leaving, including at least one senior creative executive. **********''We are very concerned about what is happening in New York, and we plan to fix it,'' said Bob Wolf, the chairman and chief executive of Chiat/Day's North American operations. But he would not comment on what, if any, changes would be made in light of the loss of accounts. **********Mr. Wolf said that the agency had no plans to cut back further in the New York office or to close it. ''We are still very committed to it,'' he said. ''New York is an important part of our future.'' **********Some advertising executives said a primary reason for the problems at the New York office was the frequent absences of Jay Chiat, the agency's founder, who moved his office to Manhattan when the New York branch was opened in 1981. He recently has been spending increasing amounts of time at the agency's other offices in the United States and abroad. **********Recently, Chiat/Day/Mojo, which has total billings of about $1 billion, has sold several of its smaller businesses. Last week, the agency announced it had reached an agreement to sell its public relations subsidiary, Jessica Dee Communications, for an undisclosed amount to the firm's management. In June, Chiat/Day sold most of its San Francisco operation to that agency's management. **********The agency's plans to establish itself as a big international advertising power seem to have stalled. Last year, Chiat/Day acquired Mojo MDA, an Australian agency, for about $68 million. The acquisition gave Chiat/ Day a valuable foothold in the Pacific Rim and also an office in London, which it could use as a jumping-off point to begin an assault on Europe. **********But its Australian operations have faltered lately. The agency is suffering primarily because of Australia's depressed economy. One of the agency's primary clients is the Australian tourism account, which has cut spending drastically. In addition, one of the agency's biggest clients, the Bond Corporation Holdings' brewing interests in Australia, filed for bankruptcy protection. **********The one bright spot, Mr. Wolf said, is the agency's flagship office in California.

In this case, Marx meant Groucho, Harpo and Chico. **********The observation came in a recent issue of The Economist. In an acerbic article that made Italian officials wince, the respected British weekly gave a firm thumbs down to the rotating presidency of the European Community that Italy has held since July and will yield soon after a gathering of Western European leaders here this weekend. **********The Italian presidency, the magazine said, quoting an unidentified diplomat, \"is proving like a bus trip with the Marx Brothers in the driver's seat.\" **********That stung.

By many indicators, Italians are quick to point out, their economy is larger than Britain's. **********But beyond arguments over whether specific anti-Italian criticisms are fair -- and the feeling here is that they are not -- the sensitivity to such attacks underlines more fundamental concerns about where Italy fits in Europe's new order. **********Its economy is ample and its energetic Foreign Minister, Gianni De Michelis, seems to have no shortage of ideas for altering European structures. But in politics and diplomacy, Italy still falls short of the heavyweight division. Now, some commentators fret that the long shadow cast by the newly unified Germany may make the perennial Italian yearning for international respect harder to satisfy than ever. **********Along that line, Italy attached great importance to its opportunity to guide the European Community over the last half year, even if the job is a mechanical function, with each of the community's 12 members taking its turn.  Behaving for the Duration **********Indeed, many Italian officials and political analysts are convinced that the 17-month-old coalition of Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti would have fallen apart, like its 48 postwar predecessors, had it not been for a tacit agreement by politicians to behave themselves while the nation held the spotlight. Now that the center of the European Community universe is about to shift to Luxembourg, political experts say the Andreotti Government may be doomed. **********Still, it has been an important six months with Italy at the helm. **********Germany completed its reunification, the Soviet Union stumbled closer to collapse, the community took a big step toward creating a single currency and the cold war came to an official end with new agreements signed in Paris last month. **********And the Persian Gulf crisis erupted.

Number of Meetings Draws Scorn **********Nevertheless, others have heaped anonymous scorn on Rome, especially at community headquarters in Brussels. Much of the criticism amounts to a diplomatic version of inside baseball: sniffing about how the Italians called too many meetings with too little substance and preparation. **********Yes, a senior official here agreed, some of the criticism may be correct. But the image of an Italian bus careering wildly down the road with Harpo beeping his horn is not only an insult but, he said, is also wrong. Other Italians say their critics could do worse than to think more creatively about diplomacy instead of dwelling endlessly on organizational rituals. **********On that score, Mr. De Michelis has come to symbolize Italy's situation. **********Foreign publications rarely write about him without prominent references to his imperial girth, his long, unkempt hair and his passion for disco dancing. The 50-year-old Mr. De Michelis tends also to be voluble and quick to offer opinions on almost any subject. All this is presented by detractors as evidence that he and his country are not to be taken seriously. **********But Mr. De Michelis has also been accused of thoughtfulness, and some of his early ideas on expanding cooperation among Adriatic and Mediterranean states and on giving the European Community a greater military role are fast becoming conventional wisdom. Dangerous to Underestimate **********It sometimes seems easy to ignore Italy, but political experts warn that it is always dangerous to underestimate this country's talents for diplomacy and for seizing the political moment. **********Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher learned that lesson after another summit meeting held here in October, when 11 of the 12 nations, led by the Italians, decided to move toward creating a central European bank by 1994 despite her objections. **********The others were living in \"cloud cuckoo land,\" Mrs. Thatcher railed. But the domestic fallout from her intransigence set in motion her ouster in late November. **********Publicly, of course, Italian officials insist that they did not seek her downfall.

Baker 3d told reporters in Paris. **********Human-rights monitors have documented that more than a million Cambodians were killed under Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970's during a radical restructuring of society that included the forced mass migration of urban people into the countryside. **********Administration officials said that the Khmer Rouge rebels are following rural-based strategy similar to the one used in encircling Phnom Penh in 1975, when the Khmer Rouge came to power. **********American officials said that in their current rainy-season offensive, the rebels are taking advantage of the Government's decreased mobility. The rebels are spreading their forces across the countryside - from northwestern Siem Reap province and Bantheay Meanchey province to southern Kampot province - while they cut off major highways and communications lines to choke the cities. **********In the face of this offensive on northern, southern and central villages within 40 miles of the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, Government forces are retreating and in some cases dropping their weapons, the officials said. **********A Defense Department official said the Khmer Rouge strategy was directed at ''undermining the people's confidence in the Government and the Government's confidence in itself.'' The official continued: ''The Government forces are hard pressed and extended in contending with the Khmer Rouge offensive. Morale problems and corruption are clearly evident.'' **********The Vietnamese-backed Government of Prime Minister Hun Sen is struggling to manage a series of problems. The Government cannot pay all of its civil servants and soldiers, a situation made all the more severe by rising inflation and a decline in Vietnamese and Soviet economic aid. **********Regular Vietnamese Army forces, which once numbered up to 200,000, left the country last year. American officials report that a few thousand Vietnamese military advisers have returned to help beat back the offensive. **********Support for Khmer Rouge **********In briefings to other Government officials earlier this week, Central Intelligence Agency analysts estimated that the Khmer Rouge faction consists of 30,000 to 40,000 fighters, slightly larger than the size of the two non-Communist rebel groups combined. **********They fight a Government army of from 60,000 to 100,000 men. The C.I.A. estimated that the value of Chinese assistance to the Khmer Rouge approaches $100 million a year, while the non-Communist groups receive much less from several countries, including Singapore, which sends them $10 million a year in military hardware and other supplies. **********The C.I.A. estimates that the Khmer Rouge is backed in one form or another by 30 percent of the population, with larger proportions of support in areas they control, where they can exercise intimidation. **********C.I.A. analysts also said the non-Communist groups and Khmer Rouge share supply lines, raising questions of how the Bush Administration can continue to supply the non-Communists without inadvertently helping the Khmer Rouge. The deeper the American-supported groups operate inside Cambodia, the more dependent they are on the Khmer Rouge."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/07/business/the-hidden-pep-in-america-s-economy.html": {"writer_name": "Louis Uchitelle", "pub_date": "1990-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2666, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Hidden Pep in America's Economy", "print_headline": "The Hidden Pep in America's Economy", "body_text": " **********In their determination to sharply cut the budget deficit during the next five years, Congressional leaders and the President may be ignoring or overlooking important strengths in the American economy that over the long term could lessen the need for such drastic medicine. **********These strengths show up with surprising regularity in reviews of how businesses actually conduct their operations. **********Even so, business leaders and economists generally endorse the budget proposal now before Congress, at least in its initial stage, though many believe it may drive the nation toward recession. They do so if only to demonstrate that Government spending can be controlled. **********''Even someone as much in favor of deficit reduction as I am must agree that this package is initially contractionary,'' said Benjamin Friedman of Harvard University. **********But locking the nation into repeated cuts - taking $500 billion from the budget between now and 1995, as the President and Congressional leaders are proposing - could sap the country's productive strength and cut off potential for growth, making matters worse. **********Risking the hardship requires great faith in two interlocking economic theories that are widely espoused by economists but have not been fully tested since World War II, and they are often challenged by American corporations in daily practice. One theory is that during periods of economic difficulty the United States loses the capacity for robust economic growth; the other is that a budget deficit limits national growth. **********''The whole exercise in cutting the budget deficit and endangering the economy is based on the perception that the long expansion in the 1980's has pushed the economy close to its capacity to expand efficiently,'' said Robert M. Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a Nobel laureate in economics. ''If that is not true, then we are forcing ourselves into a hardship that might not be necessary.'' **********The theories go something like this: Just as a grocer who takes in $10,000 in sales but pays $5,000 in store rent has little left over to invest in a second store, so Americans, after loaning billions of dollars to the Government to pay all its bills, lack enough cash to invest in new sources of wealth. Neither the high rent nor the Government's outlays for weaponry, food stamps and many other programs are considered particularly wealth-producing. **********Lay the Blame on Spending **********In the news media, these theories show up in various forms. One is the criticism that Americans don't save enough, so there aren't enough funds available in the private sector to invest in new machinery and other wealth-producing devices - without help from the Japanese and the Europeans, who have become big American investors in the last decade. Sometimes consumers are blamed for the savings shortage; they're dismissed as profligate spenders. But mostly the Government is accused of dipping too heartily into the national savings pool for what amounts to wasteful consumption. Or borrowing too much from the Japanese and the Europeans, who in the future will drain billions of dollars in interest payments from the country. (In fact, Government debt held by foreigners ranged between 15 and 18 percent of the total in the 80's and is now 16.5 percent.) Another outcry is that the low civilian unemployment rate, 5.3 percent until recently and now only 5.7, is evidence that the nation lacks enough skilled workers to expand production and generate great new wealth. There simply aren't enough skilled people to open a new factory or expand an existing one without luring workers away from another operation, which then has to shut down. ''I don't know whether full employment is 5.1 percent or 5.5 percent, but compared with the early 80's, when it reached 9 percent, we are at full employment now,'' Mr. Friedman said. **********No economist doubts that the United States economy, or any economy, for that matter, has a growth ceiling. Many hold that the American ceiling today is roughly 6 percent a year, before adjustment for inflation. In other words, the United States can only add $300 billion in 1990 to a gross national product that generated $5.2 trillion last year in new manufactured goods and in payments for the numerous services that Americans performed. The $300 billion, in theory, is the nation's maximum growth capacity. **********The upshot is that the deficit - $149 billion in 1989 and more than $250 billion in 1990 - is growing at 67 percent, eating up potential investment funds in an economy that today is expanding not at its 6 percent maximum, but at only 4 percent. If allowed to grow unchecked, such deficits will choke off economic growth altogether. That's the theory, but ask business executives about these deadly growth ceilings and a much more amorphous picture emerges, one suggesting that deficit reduction might be an oversold solution and the deficits themselves an exaggerated danger. **********Even with very little Government belt-tightening, the economy might be made to grow faster than the deficit, the businessmen seem to suggest. Or as Richard Ayers, chairman and chief executive of the Stanley Works, the tool manufacturer, put it: ''If people ask me, 'Is Stanley operating at full capacity,' I say to them, 'that is a crazy question.' I don't know what full capacity means.'' **********Dynamics of Growth **********Four corporate experiences help to illustrate the dynamics of economic growth: *********** The Stanley Works, whose network of factories includes a Dallas operation that manufactures sockets and wrenches, found that bottlenecks had developed last year in heat-treating and plating, two of the 20 or so steps that go into making these tools. A relatively small investment in new equipment for these steps increased overall production capacity by more than 20 percent, Mr. Ayers said. **********Theoretically, high interest rates - corporations often pay 9 percent or more to borrow for investment - should have discouraged Stanley from making the investment. The high rates reflect the shrunken savings pool in the private sector, and they do discourage many companies already deeply in debt. But in thousands of investment decisions, they aren't an obstacle. In Stanley's case, ''given the big increase in output, the cost of the capital was a minor factor,'' Mr. Ayers said. A limited supply of labor is also often a minor factor. Stanley makes steel tape rules in Norwalk, Conn., its headquarters, and in Besancon, France; the former for the American market and the latter for Europe. But when demand surges in the United States then, rather than increase the work force in Connecticut and perhaps bid up wages in a tight labor market, Stanley imports extra tapes from Besancon. And the line vanishes between America's labor supply and the world's. **********''One virtue of capitalism is that it is very adaptable,'' said Richard Freeman, a labor economist at Harvard. ''A tight labor market leads to all sorts of inventive solutions.'' *********** Gillette, operating a factory in South Boston that makes razors and blades, has found that applicants for the 2,000 factory floor jobs are, increasingly, immigrants whose English is weak. Many know enough English to hire on as packers, at more than $8 an hour, but not enough to move up to machine operators, said Timothy Horan, director of human resources for Gillette's manufacturing group. So the company is beginning to offer courses in English, in effect upgrading each immigrant worker's productivity. **********The machine operators are also drawn from impoverished South Boston neighborhoods, and many are school dropouts. To do their jobs, Gillette requires that they carry out various math calculations to monitor the efficiency of their machinery. Many can't do the math, so the company runs math courses. Gillette still scours the Boston area for skilled machinery repair people, who can earn $14 an hour, but here too standards are changing. **********''Our engineers might be asked to find ways to simplify repair work, or we might soon set up a training classification,'' Mr. Horan said, challenging the economic thesis that Gillette has hit its labor-supply ceiling. As Rudolph G. Penner, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, explains the theory, ''The more you press, the more the cost in training people or in paying higher wages to get trained people.'' As labor costs rise, so does the national inflation rate, diluting the value of the new production. That's how ceilings work. **********Mr. Horan doesn't quite agree. ''The training classification would be costly,'' he said, ''but in the end you might get good value because you wouldn't pay these people as much as a skilled mechanic. In the end, it wouldn't be inflationary because you get a payoff.'' *********** The National Mutual Life Insurance Company, faced with growing competition for life insurance sales, invested $1 million in new computer equipment and software to automate many tasks. In addition, work was reorganized. Service departments, for example, that might once have responded to any customer's telephoned request, no matter how time-consuming, were given guidelines that required them to ''ration'' their replies, said Frederic H. Bertrand, chairman and chief executive. **********As a result, without any loss in revenue, employment at National's Montpelier, Vt., headquarters has fallen to 1,009 today from 1,450 in 1987, and two of the five management layers have been eliminated. ''Computerization gets data faster to decision makers,'' Mr. Bertrand said. **********Why wasn't National so productivity-minded five years ago? Competition was less. Fluctuating interest rates gave the numerous life insurance companies offering policies the opportunity to compete on the yields their policies earned for their customers. ''People shop for life insurance as if it were certificates of deposit,'' Mr. Bertrand said. Such shopping has shrunk profit margins at National and other companies, prompting much effort and outlay for productivity. **********National did not borrow the money for its recent investment. It simply drew on retained earnings. Such corporate income, held at the bank, is part of the nation's savings pool. National in effect financed its investment in labor productivity, increasing the capacity of its work force, by ''borrowing'' from this pool. But the investment wasn't made because the savings existed. Investment does not automatically and instantaneously equal savings, as economic theory often suggests. The driving force in National's case was competition and lower profit margins. The money might also have been distributed as dividends and spent on consumption. **********''Capacity is a nebulous notion,'' said Edward F. Denison, a senior fellow and a specialist in productivity at the Brookings Institution. ''Until you test the system, you don't know what the capacity is. When a company has to do something to survive, to compete, it thinks of ways to get what it needs.'' *********** Penney's, faced with weak department store sales as the economy has grown sluggish over the past year, has invested in a computerized cash register system for its network of stores. Its main feature is a simplified way to ring up a sale, whether the purchaser pays cash or offers a credit card, buys one shirt, or an assortment of shirts and ties. **********''There isn't the necessity of a separate credit-card imprint; you just sign the receipt,'' said Ira Silver, Penney's chief economist. ''The machines cut the cashier process from two or three minutes to 30 seconds, and we keep better sales records.'' **********Increased Productivity **********The equipment takes time to install, but as it goes in, Penney's work force shrinks and becomes more productive. The sluggish economy, even a recession, prompts some companies to make their workers more productive - in effect, to expand the capacity of the American labor force. **********''When an economy goes through a shock, a boom or a recession, many opportunities are created for a business to reorganize in a different way,'' said Albert Wojnilower, a senior economist at the First Boston Corporation.'' **********Many factors, then, dictate how quickly and by how much the American economy will grow. Recession plays a role. So does competition. And government policy, including cuts in the budget deficit. As Mr. Solow of M.I.T. notes, the $35 billion or so in first-year budget cuts under the five-year package now before Congress, shifted to the private sector, would add substantially to the nation's array of plants and equipment, if the money were fully invested. **********Such a sum could add 7 percent to the $510 billion in gross investment in plants and equipment that is expected this year. The proportion climbs to 17 percent, if the $35 billion is compared with the $200 billion in new investment only, leaving aside replacements of plants and equipment. **********The problem is that the investments might not be made; the banks might have the money, and interest rates might fall to lure borrowers, but with national demand way off, many companies will shy away from new investment. Why should the Stanley Works invest in heat treating and plating equipment to remove a potential bottleneck in the production of wrenches and sockets at its Dallas plant, when demand for these tools might be insufficient and production at the factory moves along too slowly for bottlenecks to occur. **********Many economists recognize the irony of cutting the budget deficit in the midst of a weak economy. ''If I were God, I would not have picked this moment to cut the budget deficit,'' Mr. Solow said. ''If I were George Bush, who is not God, I would have tried to pick a couple of years ago, when the economy was stronger. But it is better to cut the budget now than not at all.'' **********The Uses of Spending **********But in the years to come it is also conceivable that increased Government spending and involvement in the economy could be helpful, not harmful. Subsidizing corporate research, for example, might help Gillette develop automated razor-making machinery that can be repaired in some simple fashion. Incentives, perhaps tax breaks or trade rules, might convince Stanley to invest in enough new equipment in Norwalk to increase tape rule production there when demand in the American market surges. The new capacity, replacing imports from Stanley's French plant, in effect increases the rate at which the economy can grow. **********The main engine for economic growth, then, seems to be the steady demand that comes when both consumers and the Government are in a mood to spend. And objections to Government spending, even deficit spending, subside when the economy manages to grow at a faster pace than either the deficit or the total national debt. **********That was the case in the late 80's, when the deficit fell to 3 percent of the gross national product from 6 percent in 1983, and it was also the case in the 50's and 60's. Robust economic growth made the nation's debt a minor concern, although in the 50's and 60's, the debt was 45 percent or more of the gross national product Today it is 44.5 percent. Budget deficits, of course, surge during recessions. Tax revenues fall as income declines, but Government outlays remain strong. The deficit rose beyond the $200-billion-a-year level after the 1981-82 recession, and the cry went up for reform. Now as the economy weakens again and the annual deficit moves toward $300 billion, deficit cutting once more becomes an American obsession. **********The nation was similarly driven to seek a balanced budget in 1932. As the Depression began to unfold, the budget went from surplus into deficit. **********The switch came just before the Presidential nominating conventions, alarming both Democrats and Republicans. With Franklin Delano Roosevelt in agreement, the Hoover Administration and Congress, in a display of bipartisan accord, doubled income tax rates and cut spending sharply - all in the name of fiscal integrity."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/08/business/careers-personnel-executives-on-the-rise.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 840, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Careers;   Personnel Executives On the Rise", "print_headline": "Careers;   Personnel Executives On the Rise", "body_text": " **********THE job of vice president or top manager in charge of human resources, or personnel departments, has become much more important in the last few years. Two recent surveys by leading management recruiters confirm the trend. **********Last week Carl W. Menk, chairman of Canny Bowen Inc., said in an interview: ''The vast majority of executives we surveyed expect the human resource function to increase in importance over the next three to five years. No one expects it to decrease.'' **********The survey, titled ''Effectiveness of the Human Resources Function,'' is based on responses from 82 chief executives and 84 human resources executives, mostly at Fortune 500 companies. **********A Heidrick & Struggles Inc. survey called ''Chief Human Resources Executive,'' which was based on 260 responses from the specialists, carries Mr. Menk's argument a step further. **********Emanuel N. Monogenis, a partner in the firm, said in an interview: ''The most important issue American companies will deal with during the next decade is not foreign competition nor mergers, but building and keeping a qualified work force.'' That means close attention to both recruitment, training and management development, he said. **********''Skills training at all levels has become much more important,'' Mr. Menk noted. **********Mr. Monogenis said there must also be emphasis on top managers learning how to handle an increasingly diverse work force, including women, blacks, Hispanic people and others, especially in the lower and middle managerial ranks. ''A happy byproduct will be more social tolerance and emphasis on ability,'' he said. **********Reasons for the changing role of human resources executives appear to be allied to business trends, both management recruiters agreed. **********For example, the rash of mergers and corporation cutbacks has made life more complex for human resources managers. They must help select persons to be discharged or retired; they must decide amounts of dismissal pay; they must assist departments to reorganize so that fewer people can handle the same amount or more work. **********At hundreds of companies, widespread dismissals with severance pay, early retirements and ''golden parachutes'' have been expensive, focusing more attention on the short-term bottom-line results The Heidrick & Struggles survey found that the cost to a company of dismissing an employee averaged $18,000. On average, the total turnover rate from all resignations and dismissals is an alarming 17.4 percent a year. **********Mr. Monogenis called this ''a huge indirect cost not presented glaringly enough to managements.'' Certainly it is not well known to stockholders, the real owners of companies. **********The Heidrick & Struggles survey also found that 40.8 percent of the respondents believe that employee stock ownership plans can help deter takeovers. So far, employees own almost 14 percent of the shares of the responding companies. **********Mr. Menk argues that more and more human resources directors will be line officers. By line officers he means those ''who have profit and loss responsibility,'' not just those who function as staff professionals. **********The Canny Bowen study found that only about 17 percent of companies responding so far have placed line officers as head of the human resources - officers whose orientation is to the bottom line. The study cited Citibank as one example of a company that has done so, along with CBS and Colgate-Palmolive. **********Mr. Menk said, ''Functions that most directly impact growth and profitability are given high priority, and they reflect the new role of human resource executives as part of top management.'' They have been clamoring to reach that level for years, he said, suggesting that ''chief executive officers should consider involving them in strategic planning and acquisitions.'' **********''Management succession and controlling benefits costs require more of a line mentality,'' Mr. Monogenis said. For example, controlling employee benefit program costs like health and pensions has ''become a critical issue.'' **********The Heidrick & Struggles study profiled the typical top human resources executive as a 48-year-old white Protestant male, married to his first wife. In most cases (54 percent), he has an advanced degree beyond the bachelor's level, probably a master of business administration. In his career, he has worked for three companies. **********For his efforts, he receives an average $189,000 yearly in salary and bonuses, a 35 percent increase above salary averages reported by Heidrick & Struggles in a similar 1984 survey. **********Approaching compensation from a different angle, Mr. Menk's survey found that the median compensation of top human resources directors amounted to about 30 percent of the pay received by the chief executive. **********Mr. Monogenis stressed that there is, and perhaps always will be, a shortage of what he called excellent human resources directors.

Brady said today that the Bush Administration was leaning in the direction of limiting individuals and businesses to a maximum of $100,000 in deposit insurance, whether in one or several accounts. **********He said, however, that the Government was not likely to reduce the current $100,000 level of insurance that is in place for deposits at Federally insured banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions. **********His testimony before the Senate Banking Committee was the clearest signal yet about where the Bush Administration is heading on changes in the nation's bank deposit insurance system. Many experts see such changes, which would be subject to approval by Congress, as crucial to avoiding further debacles like the savings and loan crisis. The bailout of that industry over the next 30 years is likely to cost taxpayers upward of $500 billion. **********Present Coverage Is Wide **********Currently depositors are insured for $100,000 in deposits in each institution where they have accounts, as well as for money in joint accounts up to $100,000, creating almost unlimited coverage. **********When asked whether insurance should be restricted to only one account, Mr. Brady said, ''If you are going to start any place, that would be a place to start.'' **********But he stressed that he did not believe the $100,000 level should be reduced. **********''I can't see at this particular point in time a rush to lower that amount of insurance at a time that we have a question of confidence not only in our banks, but in our thrifts,'' Mr. Brady said. **********He added that the Administration would not make a formal recommendation until later this year when it finishes a study of the deposit insurance system, mandated by the savings and loan bailout bill of 1989. **********Mr. Brady's comments were significant in light of recent speculation in the banking industry that the Government might try to reduce the $100,000 insurance limit to as low as $50,000. **********Changes are being considered in the deposit insurance system in an effort to both restrict the financial exposure of the Government and impose discipline from the market place on bankers who otherwise have few incentives to pursue prudent lending practices. For the nation's weaker institutions, many of which have invested in risky assets, any changes would be expected to add to the pressure on them to either seek a merger partner or focus on more secure investments. **********One probable outcome of limiting deposit insurance, either through the dollar amount or the number of accounts, would be that some depositors would shift some money to Treasury securities and other safe investments. Depositors are also likely to move money from weaker institutions to stronger ones that have less chance of failure. **********Although any changes could cause uncertainty in the short run, experts strongly agree that, done properly, they will strengthen the nation's financial system. **********A primary concern of the Bush Administration, which has been stung by the fact that it is presiding over the nation's costliest financial crisis, is that regulatory precedent has now effectively extended the Government's blanket guarantee to all deposits at the nation's 13,000 banks, 2,500 savings and loan associations and 15,000 credit unions. **********Regulators acknowledge that under current practice all deposits, whether under the $100,000 limit or above, are effectively backed by the Government, and they are casting about for ways to lower that exposure. **********A Limited Effect Expected **********Experts said today that a plan like the one Mr. Brady described to limit the number of insured accounts would have a modest effect on the amount of money insured. Of the $4 trillion in total deposits at insured institutions, about $3 trillion was explicity insured as of the end of last year. Analysts say that limiting the number of accounts could reduce the Government's obligations to between $2 trillion and $2.4 trillion. **********But before such a plan could be effective, the Government would have to eliminate what has effectively become blanket insurance coverage for depositors. **********That practice evolved from the Government's rescue of Continental Illinois Bank and Trust Company in 1984. Fearful that allowing depositor losses at the failing Continental would create a crisis of confidence and a run on other shaky institutions, Federal banking regulators effectively extended blanket insurance coverage to all the bank's deposits, promising to take whatever actions necessary to insure that depositors would not lose money. **********Out of a sense of fairness, the regulators later exended that policy to smaller institutions. And that practice has been further entrenched by the nervousness surrounding the savings and loan crisis, which Mr. Brady alluded to today. **********Government officials acknowledge that such a policy represents a radical departure from the original intent of deposit insurance - to provide a Federal safety net for the savings of the unsophisticated depositor. **********Computer technology has also played a role in changing the nature of deposit insurance. Under the current system, financial institutions other than banks, like brokerage firms, are able to offer wealthy investors essentially 100 percent protection for millions of dollars by creating accounts for up to $100,000 at scores of banks. **********This practice helped stimulate explosive growth among savings and loan associations in the mid-1980's, permitting high-risk operators to attract billions of dollars in so-called hot money from money brokers and to make lavish loans to real estate speculators and other investors. **********Regulators now say that if deposit insurance had been limited in the mid-1980's to $100,000 per individual, or, as some recommend, per Social Security account, the savings industry would never have experienced that kind of growth. **********How a system would be structured to limit deposit insurance to $100,000 per individual is still unclear. **********Various Arrangements **********The issues will revolve around whether the $100,000 is limited to one account at one bank or whether an individual could specify several accounts totaling $100,000. It is also unclear whether future insurance coverage would be denied to an individual who has already received an insurance payout on a $100,000 deposit at a failed institution. **********Experts say, however, that any of these arrangements could be easily circumvented, at least to some extent. A husband, for example, could put money in accounts in his wife's or children's names. **********The Treasury will also have to address the issue of how to handle depositors at giant banks if such an institution should fail. A proposal from the American Bankers Association calls for the Government to stipulate in advance that any depositor at a giant bank can be expected to take a limited loss - of about 12 percent - on uninsured deposits. Treasury officials have said they are looking at ways to encourage the banking industry to offer private insurance for banks. **********Members of Congress at the hearing today also raised concerns about how banks would go about offering accounts that did not carry deposit insurance. Some said banks might have to pay higher interest rates on these accounts than on Government-backed savings. **********Just a Starting Point **********The ideas discussed today by Mr. Brady are probably only a starting point for the Administration in its overhaul of deposit insurance. But they also represent an approach that is gaining in popularity among members of Congress since it would primarily be aimed at reducing benefits to the very wealthy and would not represent a radical shift in the insurance system at a time when confidence is fragile. **********Many members of Congress have said that they would not support a plan to lower insurance levels to $50,000, for fear of constituent backlash. **********But the proposal to limit insurance to one $100,000 account per individual also has its drawbacks. It would affect two voting groups the lawmakers do not like to cross - retirees and small businesses. These two types of depositors often have multiple accounts to protect either a life's savings or accumulated cash and they might find themselves suddenly more exposed to loss under a new system."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/05/business/media-business-publishing-publishing-turmoil-rises-business-expertise-sought.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Cohen", "pub_date": "1990-03-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1287, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Publishing;   As Publishing Turmoil Rises, Business Expertise Is Sought", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Publishing;   As Publishing Turmoil Rises, Business Expertise Is Sought", "body_text": " **********The American publishing industry is in turmoil. Some leading publishers have been forced out; employees have been laid off, and companies are feeling more pressure to focus on profits. **********So a question is increasingly being asked: do the people who run publishing houses have sufficient expertise in business, as well as books, to manage companies that deal with ever-larger sums of money? **********Simply posing the question creates discomfort. Some people in publishing see the question as an insidious attack by accountants on the diversity of America's literary culture. Others argue that it heralds a salutary, if tough, adjustment for a profession that for too long has muddled through without coming to terms with computers, marketing and balance sheets. **********But there is agreement on why people in publishing are now under tough scrutiny: too much money has been lost on too many books. The fierce competition for the books of leading authors and celebrities has swollen advances to a point where, often, they are not recouped. This trend, coupled with the spread of book chains, has led to bigger printings, bigger returns of unsold books and big losses. **********At the same time, the media giants that have bought publishing houses ''are simply more demanding,'' said Leonard Riggio, president of B. Dalton Bookseller. **********These simmering tensions boiled to the surface last week when Andre Schiffrin, the managing director of the Pantheon Books division of Random House, was forced out, apparently because he refused to cut his annual book list despite heavy losses. **********Although many people in the industry said the forced resignation was reasonable, five senior editors at Pantheon, an imprint that has resisted the commercial for the iconoclastic, resigned in sympathy. They called Mr. Schiffrin's departure a symbol of ''a world in which books belong to accountants.'' **********Pantheon, with annual sales of less than $20 million, represents no more than about 3 percent of Random House's sales. But rightly or wrongly, it has become the flash point of a broader debate over whether publishers must think more about making money and be better trained to do so. **********Many believe that debate has been building since Robert L. Bernstein, long the president of Random House, was forced out five months ago by S. I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of Advance Publications, which owns the publishing house. **********Mr. Bernstein stood for a long-successful, but also gentlemanly and culturally committed, style of publishing. His departure was widely interpreted as a signal that publishing management had to get tougher. **********Bookish and Businesslike **********Publishing executives with solid backgrounds in business as well as books are suddenly in demand to counterbalance what Arlynn Greenbaum, marketing director of Little, Brown & Company, called ''the widespread seat-of-the-pants approach to publishing.'' **********Such bookish yet businesslike executives seem in short supply. Publishing executives said the West German media conglomerate Bertelsmann A.G. had found few suitable candidates for the vacant chief executive position at its Bantam Doubleday Dell group, while Simon & Schuster has also left a top position unoccupied for several months. **********''There is a dearth of people with a feel for books and a solid financial sense,'' said William Shinker, publisher of the trade division of Harper & Row Inc. ''People used to feel publishing was about a kind of mysterious alchemy, and we'd like to move away from that.'' **********A leading literary agent, Morton Janklow, said low salaries were responsible for much of the industry's lack of talent at both the top and middle levels of management. ''For too long, the typical person who went into publishing had been to a good university, done an arts major, could not write and did not want to teach,'' he said. ''Publishing is a badly managed cottage industry that now needs more Harvard M.B.A.'s.'' **********Harold Hoffman, president and chief executive of Waldenbooks, the largest American book chain, contends that many publishers are business dinosaurs. ''Have publishers found out what Americans want to read?'' he asked. ''Several executives have no idea what is happening at the commercial end'' in the $6 billion retail book business, he said. **********Multimillion-dollar book purchases - like those of ''My Turn,'' Nancy Reagan's memoirs, published by Random House, and James Clavell's ''Whirlwind,'' published by William Morrow & Company - have reinforced the sense that publishers are spending freely on books unlikely to earn back the money paid for them. **********One sign of the industry's lack of business sophistication, many say, is that that most publishing houses are not fully computerized. Some executives suggested that computerization could cut perhaps as much as 30 percent from manufacturing costs. ''What other word-oriented industry is not fully computerized at this point?'' asked Marcy Posner, a former associate publisher at Pantheon. **********Parker Ladd, a director at the Association of American Publishers, also asserts that much could be done to sell more books profitably. Last year, he said, his association, Waldenbooks, the B. Dalton chain and two other partners put up $125,000 to study an advertising campaign to get more Americans to read books. Just 13 percent of Americans buy general-interest books in stores, according to the association. **********''But when it came to putting up the $14 million for a full year's advertising,'' Mr. Ladd said, ''everybody just faded and the project folded.'' **********A research project that tries to bring more rigor into publishing is about to be started at Little, Brown, which is owned by Time Warner Inc. Groups of fiction readers will gather next month to discuss why they buy books by some leading fiction authors like Danielle Steele rather than by selected Little, Brown authors. **********But many are skeptical - or alarmed - by such ideas. They believe publishing is essentially about the unpredictable. **********''Product management in publishing is very iffy,'' said Jonathan Galassi, editor in chief at Farrar, Straus & Giroux, ''You can't eliminate the gamble and be a good publisher.'' **********Some people in the industry contend that big corporations like Bertelsmann and Advance Publications are putting unreasonable pressures on publishers to produce profits because they have overpaid for recent acquisitions or, in the case of Time Warner, face large debts. The result of this process, they say, will be the progressive commercialization of American publishing and a narrowing of the country's culture. **********Prime Interest Is Profit **********Moreover, they say, the conglomerates fail to appreciate that publishers slowly build up worth by accumulating back lists of fine books and cannot be fast-moving cash cows. **********''Because the prime interest of these conglomerates is profit, institutions like Pantheon and things like first novels are more and more marginal,'' argued Noam Chomsky, the author. And, Mr. Bernstein said, ''the history of publishing shows that those interested in books do it better than those interested in money.'' **********But Kelso Sutton, president of the Time Inc. Book Company, said his company was fully aware that ''you can't research your way to good creative solutions.'' **********A widespread hope is that a compromise can be reached under which good literature will be published, creativity thrive and publishing houses become more profitable. **********''The corporation has a responsibility to allow editors to publish good literature,'' said Phyllis Grann, the president of Putnam.

Although he did not say who made the accusations, a parliamentary committee is investigating links to the Stasi and most similar assertions have come from its members. **********A Legislator Resigns **********Wolfgang Thierse, chairman of the East German Social Democrats, said one legislator, a Social Democrat, had already resigned his seat in the face of accusations and that others were being investigated. **********On Thursday, after hours of bitter debate, Parliament voted down a measure to drive Mr. Diestel from office. The vote was 184 to 107, with 18 absentions. But today Mr. de Maiziere, whose Government will dissolve after the two Germanys reunify next month, said that he was appointing Eberhard Stief, until now Mr. Diestel's deputy in the Stasi dismantling, to oversee the process. **********The search for agents has become a permanent headache for Mr. de Maiziere. For if a kind of benign tolerance for former Communists prevails in much of East Germany, anger is sharply focused at former members of the Stasi, the security machine that compiled extensive files on more than five million East Germans, about a third of the population. At its height, the Stasi is believed to have employed 85,500 people, with more than half a million paid informers. **********Mr. Diestel is generally praised for his efforts to root out Stasi agents. But he has also come under intense pressure from left and right, and there are regular calls for his resignation. **********Dismantler Was Also a Spy **********On Tuesday, Mr. Diestel, who took office in April, was forced to admit that the man he had appointed to oversee the dissolution of the Stasi, Dieter Stein, and 12 other senior ministry officials turned out to be secret Stasi agents. All were dismissed. **********Mr. de Maiziere said he had ordered investigations into possible former Stasi links of three of his government ministers, including Environment Minister Karl-Hermann Steinberg. **********Mr. Steinberg has denied working for the Stasi, though he admits that, like many East Germans, he was forced to prepare reports for the security agency about people he met on trips abroad. The names of the other ministers suspected of Stasi links have not been made public. **********This week, education officials in West Berlin disclosed that last January, under the Government of the last Communist Prime Minister, Hans Modrow, as many as 1,000 to 1,500 former Stasi agents were given jobs as schoolteachers in the East Berlin school system. They said the goal was evidently not to infiltrate classrooms, but simply to find jobs for some of the tens of thousands of agents who were dismissed as part of the Stasi dismantling."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/23/business/reebok-net-falls-17.8.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reebok Net Falls 17.8%", "print_headline": "Reebok Net Falls 17.8%", "body_text": " **********Reebok International Ltd., blaming sluggish sales of its footwear in the United States, reported a 17.8 percent drop in third-quarter earnings today.

Gathered at the swank Meridien Hotel here, bank executives cheerily greeted prominent business people as they dined on hors d'oeuvres and kept their glasses filled. To the casual observer, it was a scene of glad tidings and seasonal bonhomie. **********Back at headquarters, however, there was no cheer. Federal regulators had just combed through the books and, shocked by the widespread bad loans they had found, ''read the riot act,'' according to one insider. After four years of solid earnings, the bank was in a crisis. Top management's days were numbered and anxious directors, lawyers and investment bankers met around the clock. As they did, the bank's condition only worsened. The bad loans ''came in waves,'' said one insider. First, they were in the millions, then the billions. The fate of the bank hung by a thread. And it still does.  ''What happened to Bank of New England is even worse than Texas,'' said Masaru Kakutani, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service Inc. ''There's a strong probability of their requiring Federal assistance.'' James Hanbury, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Company, added, ''The survival odds are 50-50. The company's got a sliver of capital and lots of bad loans.'' **********Indeed, a Texas-style financial disaster has come to New England and the wreckage is stunning. Thousands of Bank of New England employees are being let go. The bank's bond and stockholders have seen their investments dwindle to virtually nothing. And regional businesses complain they are being strangled by a credit crunch, brought on, in part, they say, by the chilling effect this episode has had on all lending in their area. **********Ambition and Carelessness **********The fall, so far and so fast, of such a pillar of the New England banking community is the tale of the overreaching drive, sloppy management and hubris of one man - Walter J. Connolly Jr., the bank's recently ousted chairman. A marketing whiz, Mr. Connolly came to Boston with the notion of creating the biggest and boldest bank in the region, and built the second largest, through costly acquisitions and aggressive real estate lending. Unfortunately, he did it at the expense of the basics of banking. As long as the so-called Massachusetts miracle heated the region, the bank's imprudent lending went unnoticed. But when the ''miracle'' ended, the Bank of New England tumbled like a house of cards. **********Now, the survivors are left to sort through the rubble. Last week, the bank said it would name a new chairman to replace H. Ridgely Bullock, a board member who is serving in that post temporarily. The naming of Lawrence K. Fish, former president of the Columbia Savings and Loan Association in Beverly Hills, Calif., was openly discussed by bank insiders, but never announced. On Friday, the bank said an announcement is due ''shortly.'' Whether it is Mr. Bullock, Mr. Fish or another, the task ahead is daunting. **********The bank, which announced that its losses for 1989 will reach $1.1 billion, agreed last Thursday to Federal cease-and-desist orders giving regulators broad oversight powers. Some $3 billion in deposits is expected to flow out in the coming months, the bank estimates, and it is frantically selling assets to raise cash and meet Federal capital rules. So far, some $3.7 billion in assets have been sold and nearly $4 billion more are on the block. The bank has also borrowed heavily from the Boston Federal Reserve Bank - some $1.6 billion last week alone. Nonperforming loans are now estimated at $2.3 billion.  Such deep problems have the tightknit Boston banking community concerned. Federal regulators, wary of troubled real estate loans, have visited other area banks, most notably the Bank of Boston and the Shawmut National Bank Corporation. Regardless of the findings, bankers say, the Bank of New England debacle has tarred them all. It has already depressed their own shares, making it more difficult for them to raise capital and leaving them more vulnerable to takeovers. **********''We're all in the same boat,'' said William M. Crozier Jr., president of BayBanks Inc. ''And they're rocking the boat. It would be better for the rest of us in the boat if they could just sit down.'' **********Mr. Connolly shook the boat from the start. The Connecticut banker came to Boston in 1985 and in four short years turned the sleepy $7 billion bank into a $31 billion giant poised to overtake the venerable Bank of Boston as the biggest. Boston, which traces its banking lineage to the Revolutionary War, never saw anything like it. ''There were all dry eyes when Connolly left town,'' said one leading Boston banker, who declined to be named. **********Mr. Connolly, 61, has retreated to Cape Cod where, in a telephone interview last week, he blamed problems on the ''dramatic'' real estate downturn and ''more aggressive'' regulators. Speaking in halting phrases, he sounded almost apologetic: ''This was something nobody expected and I certainly regret. There are a lot of reasons why things have come to the point they have. A lot of us would have done things differently. Most troubling for me personally is the disruption and dislocations to so many people's lives.'' **********Such sensitivity was never Mr. Connolly's hallmark; in fact, words generally offered to describe him were ''arrogant'' and ''aggressive.'' **********Insatiable Appetite **********On the way up, Mr. Connolly displayed an insatiable appetite for small banks and gobbled them at a pace - and price - that stunned bankers here. His drive even took him to the Supreme Court, which approved the 1985 merger of the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, the Hartford-based bank he headed, and the Bank of New England. **********This decision affirmed the constitutionality of regional interstate banking and set Mr. Connolly on a spree in which he snapped up 20 other banks, including the Worcester, Mass.-based Conifer Group at a record three-and-a-half times earnings, or $656 million. When the dust settled, his colossus ranked 18th in the nation. **********Having spent so much, Mr. Connolly then embarked on a lending binge, particularly in the overheated real estate market, to get the high returns and big fees such loans provided. **********''Walter Connolly had grandiose plans to grow the bank like crazy,'' said Mr. Hanbury of Wertheim Schroder. ''His acquisitions were too expensive, and that forced him to grow loans rapidly. The easiest was real estate, since developers borrow as long as banks lend.'' Nearly 38 percent of the bank's $25 billion portfolio was in real estate, more than any major New England lender. **********Loan concentration wasn't the only problem; so was loan quality. Intense competition - from savings banks that had gone public, from savings and loans and from the region's other banks - pushed Mr. Connolly into increasingly marginal loans. Making matters worse, after assembling his empire, Mr. Connolly had little talent for managing it. Scant attention was paid to implementing controls over the disbursement of so much money. **********''The quality of their loans was very poor,'' said H. Rodgin Cohen, a banking lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell, in New York. ''They made loans other people turned down and there was pressure from on high to do so.'' **********Out of Their Depth **********The bank was a model of decentralization - and, often, confusion. Mr. Connolly left decisions to local officers and small-town bankers were making big-city deals. ''Many officers knew how to make loans for banks much smaller,'' said one bank insider. ''They didn't always rise to the occasion.'' Said one lawyer close to the bank: ''They were throwing money out the window in an overheated market. It was without limits, appraisals or review. These were sloppy loans by not-astute bankers.'' **********Even Mr. Connolly now admits controls were lacking: ''Looking back, procedures could have been tighter.'' **********''Walter Connolly could run a $9 billion company,'' said James E. Moynihan, a senior vice president at Advest Inc., a Boston-based research firm. ''But he did not have the depth to run a $30 billion company. When you have a $30 billion bank with 17,000 employees, you can no longer run it on the buddy system.'' **********Behind this, however, was Mr. Connolly's ego; his desire to be the leader of a generation of New England bankers who occupied the top spots at rival banks. This group included Joel Alvord at Shawmut, who lived near Mr. Connolly in Hartford and played golf and tennis at the same clubs, and J. Terrence Murray, at Fleet/Norstar, who bid against Mr. Connolly for banks. And there was Ira Stepanian at the Bank of Boston, the pinnacle of the Brahmin establishment that stood as an ever-present challenge. **********''The trouble began when Walter's ego got in the way and overwhelmed his business sense,'' said Thomas Finneran, chairman of the banking committee of the Massachusetts State Legislature. ''He didn't want to lose Conifer to Terry Murray, who was also bidding on it. So he paid too much. And he wanted in the worst way to pass the Bank of Boston. He was just a tough guy to cross, and he had a reputation of wiping out people who stood in his way. Ruthless was one word I heard more about him than about any other person I know. Utterly ruthless.'' **********Mr. Connolly's empire began to unravel last November when Federal examiners, concerned about the bank's exposure to a deteriorating real estate market, descended. Clearly, the bank was caught unawares. Just that September, it sold $200 million in bonds through Morgan Stanley & Company, offering a rosy picture to the Securities and Exchange Commission. (Today, those bonds are trading at 25 cents on the dollar.) In October, at least eight insiders, including the chief financial officer, bought bank shares by the thousands. Local Federal Reserve officials say they had warned the bank about declining real estate but, said one, ''the bank didn't believe us.'' **********On Nov. 27, in a Boston meeting with regulators, the bank agreed to set aside a $400 million reserve for bad loans. The first hint of trouble came the next day in a carefully worded news release saying a ''substantial'' reserve was set up. **********A week later, a new group of Texas-hardened examiners, who had worked on the Mcorp banking collapse, arrived and a tougher tone sounded. Mr. Connolly and other executives were called to a meeting with regulators in Boston on Dec. 7 and told that the situation was out of control, that the regulators had never seen such terrible loans and that the survival of the bank was in question. **********''To say everyone was surprised would be a masterpiece of understatement,'' said DeRoy C. Thomas, a board member and president of the ITT Corporation. Added Edward D. Herlihy, a lawyer at the New York-based firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, which represents the board: ''Between Nov. 22 and three weeks later, the whole world changed for Connolly and the bank because some guys from Texas came up and said Boston was another Houston.'' **********There was grumbling that regulators came down hard. But, in Washington, Dean S. Marriott, a senior deputy comptroller at the Comptroller of the Currency, bristles at such talk: ''The charge floating around New England is about our tougher standards. But we haven't changed. We have, however, brought more expertise from Texas to bear on Bank of New England and other banks.'' **********All-Night Sessions **********Mr. Thomas took over running the bank from a stunned Mr. Connolly, who was shunted aside. Mr. Thomas set up board committees - to sell assets, find a new chairman and calm depositors. Investment bankers from Lazard Freres and Goldman Sachs began all-night sessions to learn the complexities of a big troubled bank and how to save it. **********Merger discussions with Fleet/Norstar were held but halted by regulators who feared a healthy Fleet would be infected. Day-and-night talks were held with Citicorp to buy the credit-card division and the bank's Connecticut subsidiary. The City of Boston and other big depositors threatened to pull funds, and did. Equity capital sunk to a dangerously low 1 percent of assets. **********And the bank had no money to cover some $180 million in commercial paper obligations coming due - which, if not paid, would cause bankruptcy. That was staved off by an 11th-hour tax refund rushed from the Internal Revenue Service. Insiders feared the bank might collapse, causing a run on all New England banks. **********Meanwhile, the regulators kept finding more bad loans and by Dec. 21 laid down the law: Mr. Connolly, said to be in an ''absolute state of shock,'' would have to go. On Friday before Christmas, Mr. Connolly resigned. **********Well-known bankers were approached, but declined the job. They included Richard Ravitch, who rescued the Bowery Savings Bank in New York; William J. McDonough, former vice chairman of the First Chicago Corporation, and John Terell, former president of the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation. (Mr. Bullock was named interim chairman on Jan. 26.) **********'Here's the Keys' **********By mid-January, weary bank representatives, worn down by the regulators, met again with Mr. Marriott, of the comptroller's office. To test whether the regulators wanted to take over the bank or let it work out its problems, Mr. Thomas issued a challenge. ''Here's the keys,'' he said. ''You take the bank.'' When Mr. Marriott demurred, the group got the sign they wanted. **********Today, the bank is paddling fast. It has a string of asset sales under its belt, is luring depositors with mouth-watering interest rates and is waging an advertising campaign to win investor confidence. **********As for Mr. Connolly, he said he's ''got a lot of thinking to do.'' He may only get two weeks' pay as severance from his employment contract, which had two years to go. Had the bank been sold during his final weeks, he would have gotten a $7 million golden parachute. As it is, however, he's left with little: Most of his net worth is in Bank of New England stock. **********BILLIONS ON THE BLOCK **********There's a great sale going on. It's of the Bank of New England. **********Goldman, Sachs & Company and Lazard Freres & Company are aggressively peddling some $4 billion in bank assets. But some analysts and bank insiders worry that such massive sales will leave the bank with few income-generating assets for the future. **********Right now, the bank is just trying to survive the next few months and bring its assets down to around $20 billion. This is so it will not be forced to borrow to meet reserve requirements backing its deposit obligations. **********''Asset sales buy them time and get them to tomorrow,'' said Charles Peabody, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company. ''The question is once the sales are done, where the bank stands as an operating entity and what will be left to generate operating income. But they have no choice.'' **********The bank sold its credit-card business to Citicorp for $828 million, a figure analysts say is top dollar. But it did not fare as well selling its BancNew England Leasing Group to the Bank of Tokyo. The Japanese had agreed to pay a $110 million premium for the group. But once the troubles arose, that came down to $92.5 million, of which $30 million is a note - not much-needed cash. **********The bank is about to announce the sale of $1.3 billion in home equity loans; it has just agreed to sell $900 million in highly leveraged loans and is marketing residential mortgages, commercial loans and auto loans. It also sold $1.4 billion in municipal bonds and $450 million in leasing assets. **********The trickiest sales may be of the subsidiary banks, especially Connecticut Bank and Trust, where Walter J. Connolly Jr., the bank's recently ousted chairman, got his start. So many good assets have been stripped from C.B.T. that potential buyers fear getting stuck with the bad. They worry also about C.B.T.'s real estate portfolio. In addition, Bank of New England debtholders must approve any C.B.T. sale and may well demand compensation to offset the loss of a subsidiary whose revenues stood behind their debt. These problems are so daunting that early suitors - Citicorp and Fleet/Norstar were among them - appear to have lost interest. **********HECTIC DAYS AT NEW ENGLAND **********It was pretty hectic at the Bank of New England last week. The bank almost got a new chairman, and it signed detailed agreements with Federal regulators setting a tight timetable to recover its financial health. **********Word from well-placed sources at the bank began to leak out at midweek that Lawrence K. Fish, 45, would be named chairman. But by week's end, nothing was forthcoming from the bank. **********If he is named, it would be something of a homecoming. Two years ago, Mr. Fish left the Bank of Boston, where he had worked for 16 years, to become president of the Columbia Savings and Loan Association in Beverly Hills, Calif. **********His task was to reorganize the savings institution - which is plagued by massive losses in high-risk, high-yield ''junk bonds'' - along traditional banking lines. He left 17 months later, with both Columbia and Mr. Fish saying that his plan had eliminated his job and that his leaving was voluntary and not related to the institution's problems. **********Analysts have described Mr. Fish as an aggressive and hard-working decision maker. At the Bank of Boston, he held a variety of overseas posts before becoming head of New England retail operations. **********The agreement with Federal regulators includes such unusual provisions as allowing the regulators to review every bank officer at the level of senior vice president and above. It also sets out practices, already part of the regulatory review process, for proper lending procedures and real estate appraisals. And it bars the bank from paying dividends without Federal approval. **********AT A GLANCE: Bank of New England **********All dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data           Three months ended       Dec. 31   1989   1988        Net Income   ($1,113,300)   $281,700        Earnings per share   --   $4.06                Year ended        Return on Equity    (68.08%)    18.56%        Return on Assets    (3.48%)   0.94%                          Total assets, Dec. 31, 1989   $29,773,000        Stock Holders Equity   458,000        Net interest revenue   980,919        Noninterest revenue    307,904                   Book value per share,        Dec. 31, 1989   $6.17          Stock price, March 2, 1990        N.Y.S.E. consolidated close   4 1/2        Stock price, 52-week range   2 1/2-24 1/2        Employees,march 2, 1990   17,500        Headquarters   Boston        (Loss)"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/02/business/company-briefs-858390.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 224, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Boeing Co., Seattle, received orders totaling $1 billion from Japan Air System, Tokyo, and Qantas Airways, Australia. *********** Cineplex Odeon Corp., Toronto, completed the $43 million purchase of 152 cinema screens in 55 locations from clients and affiliates of Carena Developments Ltd. *********** Computerland Corp., Pleasanton, Calif., said a franchisee, Michael Tseytin in Secaucus, N.J., received approval to open a store in Moscow. *********** International Business Machines Corp., Armonk, N.Y., will introduce more powerful work stations on Feb. 15 that are based on newer reduced instruction set technology, which reduces the number of built-in computing functions. *********** Hanson Industries, the U.S. arm of Hanson P.L.C., said its Gold Fields American Corp. unit had completed the sale of the stock of four ARC America units for about $650 million.

Traub, longtime chairman of Bloomingdale's, sometime before 1993, officials of the department store chain and its corporate parent said yesterday. **********They said the process was not a formal search but a long-term effort by Federated Stores Inc., owner of the 15-store chain, and Mr. Traub himself. Allen I. Questrom, chairman and chief executive of Federated, and James M. Zimmerman, president and chief operating officer, were said to be personally involved in the process. **********Mr. Traub, who is generally considered one of the most innovative merchants in American retailing, turned 65 years old in April. But he is not being forced to retire because Federated has no policy of mandatory retirement for its division heads. **********Carol Sanger, vice president for public relations at Federated, said Mr. Traub's employment contract, which was to expire earlier this year, had been extended. Although she would not specify the length of the new contract, retail industry executives said it was for three years. **********Asked why Federated was seeking a successor so soon, Ms. Sanger replied: \"It would not be prudent to do otherwise. We recognized that we would eventually have to deal with that issue, so that it is logical to begin the process well ahead of time.\"  A 'Preliminary' Effort **********In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Traub demonstrated some reticence about the effort to find his successor. \"It's all at a very preliminary stage, and I cannot comment further other than there's certainly no immediate urgency,\" he said. **********But he added, \"I'll certainly be around for a while, and there are many exciting things going on, and will go on, at Bloomingdale's, and I will want to see them through.\" **********Several weeks ago, when Mr. Questrom was asked how long Mr. Traub would be running Bloomingdale's, he said, \"As long as he wants to, because we think he is a great merchant.\" **********The retail industry seems to agree. In January, the National Retail Federation plans to award Mr. Traub its annual gold medal for distinguished retailing, which is considered the highest recognition American retailers give to their peers. **********Mr. Traub has been grappling with problems at Bloomingdale's: sales have been soft for more than a year and the company has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since the beginning of 1990. Bloomingdale's and eight other store chains owned by Federated fell under the court proceedings when Federated and the Allied Stores Corporation, the two American retailing entities of the troubled Campeau Corporation of Toronto, filed for bankruptcy protection in January. Improving Business **********Business at Bloomingdale's, however, has been improving, Mr. Traub said. \"October was better than September, which was better than August,\" he said. **********Names that have been mentioned as possible successors to Mr. Traub include Marshall Hilsberg, chairman and chief executive of Lord & Taylor, the fashion chain owned by Federated's rival, the May Department Stores Company; Michael Gould, the chairman of the Giorgio cosmetics company in California and the former chairman of the J. W. Robinson department stores in Los Angeles, and Millard S. Drexler, president of The Gap Inc., Bruno, Calif., and the former president of the Ann Taylor stores. **********But a senior executive at Bloomingdale's observed: \"Any name you hear today in speculation will probably be wrong by the time any decision is made.\" **********While Mr. Traub was reluctant to sound as though he was stepping down, he admitted to one project that suggests an eventual retirement: He plans to write his autobiography. **********He said he had selected Random House as the publisher and was negotiating terms. \"It's several years down the road,\" he said, adding that the book would be a combination of an autobiography and a set of memoirs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/24/business/eurotunnel-cost-estimate-up-again.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Prokesch", "pub_date": "1990-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 501, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Eurotunnel Cost Estimate Up Again", "print_headline": "Eurotunnel Cost Estimate Up Again", "body_text": " **********Eurotunnel, the British-French company, today raised its estimate again for the cost of completing the channel tunnel and predicted that the rail line linking France and England would cost as much as $:7.5 billion, or about $12.27 billion. **********At a news conference, Eurotunnel executives said half of the 93 miles of tunneling in the three-tunnel project had been completed. Noting the progress, the executives said they were still confident that the tunnelers would meet beneath the English Channel at the end of November and that the tunnel service would go into operation in June 1993. **********The new cost projection is $:300 million ($490.8 million) higher than Eurotunnel predicted in January and about $:500 million ($818 million) more than in the fall. The original estimate in 1987 was $:4.87 billion. **********Graham Corbett, Eurotunnel's managing director of finance and administration, said the main reasons that the projection was higher than the one made last fall were an expected $818 million in additional tunneling costs and $286.3 million for raising additional money. He said the costs would have been even higher without the $327.2 million in anticipated savings from previously announced changes in the tunnel. **********To pay the higher bill, Eurotunnel hopes to persuade its syndicate of more than 200 banks to agree to lend it an additional $2.62 billion to $3.27 billion and to raise an additional $654.4 million to $818 million from a stock offering. **********Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's deputy chairman and chief executive, said negotiations with the company's lead banks had been largely completed. Eurotunnel hopes to gain the bank syndicate's approval by the end of the summer and to complete the stock sale by the end of the year. **********Mr. Morton said Eurotunnel and Transmanche-Link, the consortium of 10 British and French construction companies that are building the tunnel, have yet to resolve their disagreement over who should bear the projected higher cost of the terminals and outfitting the tunnels. While Mr. Morton said independent studies made him confident that Eurotunnel would win, he predicted that the disagreement would go to arbitration and might end up in litigation. **********Eurotunnel previously raised $:1 billion in equity and obtained $:5 billion in promised bank loans. The additional financing would provide Eurotunnel with a total of $:8 billion to $:8.5 billion ($13.09 billion to $13.91 billion), which ''far exceeds our forecast of the project's cost,'' Mr. Corbett said.

There were no write-offs or special charges taken in the latest quarter. **********The oil-and-gas production unit earned $930 million, compared with $667 million a year earlier, benefiting from worldwide crude prices that on average were $6.30 a barrel higher than in the quarter a year earlier. **********Profits in refining and marketing fell to $246 million, from $347 million a year ago, with $70 million of the decline coming in the United States. Chemical profits fell to $65 million from $250 million a year earlier. **********Petroleum and chemical refineries, which rely on crude as an important raw material, were unable to recover higher crude costs because competition prevented Exxon from raising prices of gasoline and other products at the same pace as crude oil, said Lawrence G. Rawl, chairman and chief executive. **********He said the refining and marketing unit, which produces and sells gasoline, operated at a loss in the United States during the two months after the Middle East crisis began. **********Earnings at Exxon's refining unit typically are depressed in times of rising crude prices because Exxon must buy large amounts of crude to supply its worldwide refineries.

At issue are the United Nations economic sanctions against Iraq, and how much food, and under what arrangements, will be permitted to pass through the blockade that the United Nations Security Council has imposed on Baghdad. **********The organizers of the convoy said they had not sought exemption from the Security Council's sanctions committee for the convoy, as required under the terms of the sanctions, because their undertaking was a humanitarian one. The organizers said the cartons of powdered milk, sugar, rice, pasta and vegetables were to be unloaded sometime Tuesday evening and turned over to the Iraqi Labor Ministry in Baghdad.

''With our souls and blood,'' the children shouted, ''we sacrifice ourselves to you, Saddam.'' **********On Sunday, apparently prompted by tightening food shortages, Mr. Hussein issued a warning to the United States and other nations with military forces deployed against Iraq that Baghdad would not allow its 16 million people to be ''strangled'' by the United Nations embargo. Mr. Hussein implied that Iraq might mount pre-emptive strikes against Israel and against oilfields in Saudi Arabia and other Arab states arrayed against Iraq. **********Mr. Hussein's statement set the stage for what diplomats here and in Baghdad said today is likely to be a new, and, for the United States and its allies, increasingly awkward phase of the confrontation with Iraq. **********Mr. Hussein has already indicated that he intends to use the specter of food shortages in Iraq to weaken and perhaps break the common front among nations that have condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The diplomats predicted that Baghdad would increasingly publicize scenes of Iraqi women and children, in particular, suffering from food shortages. **********An official representing a United Nations relief agency in Amman put it bluntly. ''How long will the Americans be able to hold to the embargo when the television news begins to show shots of hungry children?'' he said. **********The situation poses a dilemma for Jordan, which is caught between strong support for Iraq among its 3.5 million people and a desire not to alienate Western nations that are its main sources of aid. Senior officials on the Government's Higher Committee for Relief, set up to handle refugees from the invasion arriving in Jordan, said tonight that they had no knowledge of the food convoy heading for Iraq. **********A senior Foreign Ministry official said that the Government had not approved the convoy. ''I didn't have any idea about this,'' he said. **********Shipments Subject to Approval **********When it voted 10 days ago to approve shipments of food through the embargo ''to relieve human suffering,'' the Security Council authorized its sanctions committee to review specific cases and approve shipments. The Council ruled that food should be provided ''through the United Nations in cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross or other appropriate humanitarian agencies and distributed by them or under their supervision in order to insure that they reach the intended beneficiaries.'' **********Officials of the United Nations committee in New York say that only one exemption has been granted - to India, the nation that pressed the issue hardest. The committee gave permission for an Indian ship, the Vishwa Siddhi, to carry 10,000 tons of food for Indian and other Asian residents of Kuwait. **********Indian diplomats in Baghdad said today that their Ambassador, Kamal Bakhshi, was in Umm Qasr, a port in southern Iraq, awaiting the ship's arrival, which United Nations officials said is expected on Tuesday. **********Jordan has said that it will abide by the United Nations sanctions. But the Palestinian convoy that left Amman today appeared not to meet the conditions set by the sanctions committee. Abu Mohammed, a spokesman for the General Union of Voluntary Societies, the Palestinian organization that chartered the tractor-trailers, said that distribution of the food would be left to the Iraqi authorities. **********United Nations officials said that at least 60,000 Asians are in transit camps around Baghdad, and that conditions there may be worse than anything evacuees encountered when they began pouring into camps in the Jordanian desert last month. **********Diplomats who have visited the Baghdad camps said that they are closely guarded by heavily armed Iraqi security forces, that food is extremely scarce, and that there are no organized sanitary arrangements. **********United Nations officials here said that information about Asians in the Baghdad camps and about food shortages in Kuwait was extremely sketchy because nearly all United Nations staff members who are not Iraqis or Kuwaitis were evacuated shortly after the Iraqi invasion. But the officials said that Asians who arrived in Jordan over the weekend were markedly weaker than those who arrived only a week ago, and that their accounts of their stays in the Baghdad camps were grim. **********''What we are seeing is just the tip of the iceberg,'' a United Nations official said. ''I'm afraid that if we don't get more supplies into Iraq, we may end up with some of these people dying before they even get here.'' **********Iran Says It Seized Food **********CAIRO, Sept. 24 (Special to The New York Times) - The Iranian authorities said today they had seized 29 people accused of trying to smuggle food across a remote border region into Iraq, the first suggestion that Teheran is enforcing the international embargo imposed after Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait. **********The Iranian press agency said two bands of smugglers trying to cross the frontier had been arrested with contraband food including rice, vegetable oil and sugar and had been handed over to a revolutionary court in the northwestern Kurdish-speaking city of Sanandaj. It gave no other details. Iran officially supports the international sanctions imposed on Iraq. But there have been suggestions, despite Iranian denials, that Teheran has agreed with Baghdad to provide food in exchange for oil. **********The announcement coincides with a visit to Iran by the Syrian President, Hafez al-Assad, his first since the Islamic revolution of 1979. Syria is considered Iraq's archrival in Arab politics.  The Syrian leader is said by diplomats to be pressing Iran for a tough stance against Baghdad, Teheran's foe in the eight-year gulf war."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/23/business/economic-scene-war-is-no-way-to-start-a-career.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Passell", "pub_date": "1990-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 797, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene;   War Is No Way To Start a Career", "print_headline": "Economic Scene;   War Is No Way To Start a Career", "body_text": " **********WAR, as everyone knows, is not good for children and other living things.

In both wars, they discovered, draft procedures created an arbitrary link between birth dates and the probability of serving in the armed forces. And in both, men with no distinguishing characteristic other than being born on the wrong date earned substantially less in civilian life than men who lucked out. **********The Angrist-Krueger analysis of World War II veterans, published as a working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research, makes use of the fact that draft boards drew on the pool of men in simple chronological order of their birth. Roughly 75 percent of the men born in the first six months of 1926 ended up in the military. Thereafter, the probability declined quarter by quarter: Just 22 percent of those born near the end of 1928 ever served. **********It seems unlikely that youth alone was, in itself, a key to success in the postwar labor market. But strikingly, younger workers earned more, strongly suggesting that military service was a handicap. The authors calculate that adjusted for other factors, World War II veterans have earned about 5 percent less over the decades. **********Mr. Angrist's study of Vietnam experience, to be published in June in the American Economic Review, exploits an even sharper statistical distinction. During the Vietnam War, birth-date lotteries were used to set draft priorities within each group coming of draft age. In 1971, for example, 20-year-olds born on the first 125 dates chosen like the numbers in Lotto were eligible; the rest were exempt. **********Most draft-eligibles never served. Still, draft status made a big difference: Two eligibles in seven ended up in uniform, compared with just one exempt in seven. By matching birth dates with earnings data, Mr. Angrist figures that military service during Vietnam reduced average earnings for white males by about 15 percent. The earnings of non-whites did not seem to be affected. **********The enduring psychological damage from combat may play a role for the relatively small percentage of veterans who were ever under fire. But Mr. Angrist's interpretation of the earnings deficit is more straightforward: Skills acquired in the military do not make up for the lost years of civilian experience. Nor, apparently, does that modest privilege of veteran status, G.I. Bill education subsidies. **********The trade-off is closer for non-whites, Mr. Angrist speculates, because they entered the Army with fewer skills and left fewer opportunities behind. **********The numbers offer a new perspective on an old issue. Americans have long rationalized tight limits on assistance to war veterans on the ground that the time spent in uniform was an advantage in later life. In fact, it appears to be quite costly, at least for men who were not already victims of poverty or discrimination. **********The results might also lead to second thoughts about the use of national service as a means of giving the underclass a second chance to gain the discipline needed to succeed in a middle-class world. **********Mr. Angrist's numbers suggest no net benefits for recruits who met the Army's minimum standards. Nor does a recently published analysis of the post-military earnings of low-aptitude recruits, admitted to the Army under a special dispensation during the 1960's and 1970's. Indeed, according to the Human Resources Research Organization in Alexandria, Va., veterans of ''Project 100,000'' did less well in the civilian job market than comparably skilled non-veterans. **********War may make men out of boys.

Then one day, the railroad magnate Jay Gould (no relation to this writer) came to Jefferson. He wanted to bring his railroad through town, but local leaders scoffed and Jay Gould took his railroad plans somewhere else. Not long afterward, the Red River around Jefferson became unnavigable and the once-booming town boomed no more. **********Historians say this is not just a tall tale, although they can't confirm all the details. But when Thomas R. Powers, chairman of the Investment Company Institute's board of governors, told it at the industry's recent convention, it left an uneasy stillness in a room crowded with hundreds of fund executives. One man who has attended seven of these annual gatherings said he had never heard a speech that left the audience so quiet. **********Mr. Powers clearly wasn't the only one who saw this as an apocryphal tale about the industry's struggle to keep up with changing times. Such sobering fare is not the usual stuff of the industry's conventions. Sure, there was some of the back-slapping and self-congratulation so prevalent in earlier years. Yet for an industry that just broke the $1 trillion mark, the tone was oddly subdued. ''I'm not hearing a lot of 'atta-boys' this year,'' one executive said. **********For some, the pessimism was subsumed in anger. ''The industry had better sit up and start paying attention,'' said Palomba Weingarten, chairman of the Los Angeles-based Pilgrim Group, who believes that most executives underestimate the competitive impact of banks, especially foreign ones. **********There were plenty of other reasons for pinched faces. There has been a clear shift away from the easy money of the 1980's. The industry's explosive growth during the past decade cannot be sustained and its increasingly important role in financial markets makes it fair game for competitors and regulators alike. Funds will be forced to struggle just to keep the money they already manage. Clearly, boom times are over. **********''Today's friendly competition will probably turn ugly,'' said Heidi S. Fiske, a New York City consultant on financial services and marketing, who was commissioned by the institute to look at industry conditions in the coming decade. A preview of her report, scheduled for release to institute members this summer, shows what's behind the industry's pessimism. **********She forecasts industry growth as ''healthy but probably slower,'' with yearly growth in assets of about 12 percent, almost two-thirds less than the annual rate recorded during the 80's. There are two reasons for the slowdown: Funds will have to compete against each other, and they will begin to lose market share to banks and other outside competitors. The investment pie is expected to reach $3 trillion by the end of the decade, said Alfred P. Johnson, a mutual fund consultant based in McLean, Va. ''Demand will be there, but supply will be there in spades,'' he said. **********As a result, fund executives will probably start viewing each other with a more jaundiced eye. At conventions in the past, they could afford to be generous, to swap stories and try to come up with new schemes to split an ever-expanding pool of investors' money. **********But price wars are pushing down revenues. For example, two industry giants - Fidelity Investments and the Dreyfus Corporation - are in a battle for investor money, subsidizing expenses to raise yields but shaving profit margins. At the same time, fund expenses - for labor, technology and marketing - are rising. The industry's average expense ratio - funds' expenses as a percentage of average assets - has been up steadily since 1985, said Morningstar Inc., a Chicago mutual fund research firm. **********And expenses are likely to rise even faster this decade. The market is saturated with new types of funds, and now fund groups are trying to grab market share with better service. But that will require large capital investments in computers and telecommunications. ''It's a tough act, and expensive, but there's a need for funds to differentiate themselves with service,'' said Brian S. Mattes, a spokesman for the Vanguard Group, a fund company based in Valley Forge, Pa. **********The resulting margin squeeze is expected to shrink some fund group's profits badly by mid-decade. One likely consequence is industry consolidation. Smaller groups unable to compete on price or carve out a niche may fail. It is already more economical to buy existing funds than create new ones. There were 15 mergers last year and six so far this year, and in coming years, merging funds ''will be the thing to do,'' said Wayne S. Huff, a research associate with Charles E. Simon & Company, a Washington research firm. **********The industry is clearly at a crossroads and the memory of Jefferson is fresh in the minds of fund executives. But one beneficiary of all the turmoil may be you: According to Mr. Johnson, investors are likely to reap the rewards of lower fees and charges as competition accelerates. **********THE TOO-HIGH RETURNS **********Traditionally, stock market investments return about 10 percent and bonds return about 7 percent. But the raging bull market of the 1980's knocked that standard out of kilter, and only recently have bonds moved back to their traditional levels. **********Stocks have not followed suit. The accompanying chart shows just far stocks have to fall to return to levels that market analysts consider normal. **********Right now, the return on stock funds is about 30 percent higher than the historic norm. Although bond fund returns were clearly higher than usual for the five-year period, they dropped to a more traditional level in the last year. **********Market experts say investors who were spoiled by the fat gains in the stock market during the 1980's will have to adjust their expectations of gains in coming years. Indeed, they should expect returns to go back to the norm - that is, for the market to drop 30 percent.

Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman. **********No Profit on Gulfstream Sale **********Although Chysler was able to sell its Gulfstream Aerospace subsidiary in March for $825 million, the company said its pretax gain of $40 million from the sale was entirely offset by an equal amount of income tax on the transaction. As a result, ''on an after-tax basis, we made no money on sale of Gulfstream,'' said Jerome B. York, executive vice president, finance at Chrysler. **********Chrysler executives acknowledged that it had become harder to find investors willing to buy the short-term debt securities issued by Chrysler's financial subsidiary since the company's debt was downgraded by credit agencies in late June. The debt securities, or commercial paper, are used by Chrysler to finance auto loans to dealers and retail customers. **********In the last month, Chrysler has been forced to repay holders of its commercial paper whose investment policies preclude them from holding debt securities rated at Chrysler's current BBB- rating, the lowest investment-grade rating. **********Chrysler's financial subsidiary has borrowed $3.5 billion through credit lines it has established with banks to pay off holders of its commercial paper, said John T. Tierney, chairman of Chrysler Finance. **********The cost to Chrysler will be approximately $25 million over 12 months, Mr. Tierney said, partly reflecting the higher interest rates Chrysler must pay on its bank borrowings since its debt was downgraded. **********The action ''will reduce gross profit for Chrysler's Financial subsidiary,'' said Joseph Phillippi, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York. **********Mr. Phillippi said the action by Chrysler did not threaten the survival or viability of the financial subsidiary, ''but this makes it more expensive for them to operate.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/01/world/mideast-tensions-iraqi-envoy-calls-bush-s-bid-for-talks-important-step.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1990-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 476, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iraqi Envoy Calls Bush's Bid For Talks 'Important Step'", "print_headline": "MIDEAST TENSIONS; Iraqi Envoy Calls Bush's Bid For Talks 'Important Step'", "body_text": " **********Iraqi officials reacted with surprise and enthusiasm tonight to President Bush's offer to hold direct talks with Iraq in an effort to avoid war over Kuwait. **********Although there was no immediate response from President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Baghdad's Ambassador to France said, \"This is a very important step and we hope it is going to achieve what we are all striving for: negotiations instead of beating the drums of war.\" **********The Ambassador, Abdul Razak al-Hashimi, was speaking on a British Broadcasting Corporation radio program monitored in Amman. **********Another Iraqi official, reached by phone in Baghdad, said President Bush's offer to meet with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq and to dispatch Secretary of State James A.

It is inevitable and unavoidable. But the essential doctrinal rules are readily compressed into a six-week bar review course after law school. It is from these courses that many law students ultimately learn the rules necessary to obtain professional certification. What then does the law school do? **********First, law schools baptize students in the traditional approach modeled on the study of law-as-a-science. This approach, developed in 1870 by Christopher Langdell, a Harvard Law School dean, takes place within the ''laboratory'' of the casebook study of appellate cases. Appellate decisions are based on a re-examination of law; they accept the facts of the case as fixed at trial. **********Unfortunately, after graduation most lawyers practice in the factually indeterminate world of the trial attorney, rather than in the legally indeterminate world of the appellate attorney. **********Second, the appellate cases studied exclusively in the traditional law school curriculum come at the end of the litigation process. Law schools thus implicitly present litigation as the norm and the focus of professional practice. This presumption that litigation is the proper and exclusive mechanism for legal dispute resolution is wrong. Litigation is a poor mechanism for resolving most legal disputes; it is expensive, time-consuming and often harrowing. **********Some law schools have significantly modified the traditional curriculum. In the Lawyering Program at New York University Law School, first-year law students learn to cope with the problems of clients who have not yet entered the litigious universe depicted in the appellate cases. Using role-playing, videotaped clinical simulations and factually complex problems set in the time-frame that occurs prior to trial, the N.Y.U. curriculum emphasizes negotiation, interpersonal relationships and non-litigatory mechanisms for dispute resolution. **********These students are acculturated into the practicing attorney's complex world in which the legal rules may be merely a shell of straightforward propositions and the primary difficulties may be rooted in conflicting relationships. They learn to marshal facts into coherent stories that fit into readily identifiable legal categories. **********Unfortunately, only a few law schools are implementing such programs, even though there is a growing realization among lawyers and scholars of the law that current institutional pedagogy is woefully misshapen for the purpose of training competent attorneys. **********It is all of us who pay the price for perpetuating today's law school curriculum.

''We've been flooded with calls, people asking, where will he stop, where can we see him,'' a Canadian official said. **********And He Said 'Hi,' Too **********Mr. Gorbachev gave another version of a spontaneous stop after his arrival ceremony at the Uplands International Airport outside Ottawa. After reviewing the guards, signing the guest book, and greeting his Canadian hosts, Mr. Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, walked over to a pen where some 1,000 waving and giggling Canadian elementary schoolchildren waited expectantly.

Gorbachev's blockade is pinching neighboring regions of the Soviet Union, which depend heavily on gasoline and oil from the Mazeikiai refinery in Lithuania. Mazeikiai, now choked to a standstill by the oil cutoff, also supplies oil to parts of Latvia, Estonia and the Kaliningrad and Pskov regions of the Russian republic. **********Jobs in Jeopardy **********A member of the Leningrad City Council, Aleksandr Seryakov, said today that the jobs of 18,000 garment workers were in danger because they depend on fabrics from Lithuania,and other factories that use components from Lithuania are now slowing down. **********Mr. Seryakov, who visited Lithuania last week, said that the Leningrad Council was interested in direct barter of their industrial products and metals for Lithuanian food, but that it was ''unrealistic'' to think this could be organized quickly. **********Moscow repeated today that it would not begin negotiations with the Lithuanians until they had repealed or suspended their declaration of independence, made March 11, and accepted the Soviet Constitution's pre-eminence. **********A Soviet Procedure **********Yevgeny M.

The Lithuanians say they need not follow Soviet laws because the republic's forced annexation by Stalin in 1940 was illegal. **********A delegation sent to Moscow by Vilnius has had no official contact except for a phone call from Mr. Primakov advising them to go home until they are willing to play by Soviet rules. **********Extensive Hoarding **********Reports from Lithuania today described extensive hoarding of food staples and black-market gasoline brought from neighboring Soviet Byelorussia selling for up to 20 times the official price in some cities. **********Assertions by Lithuanian officials that the oil and gas embargo had expanded to a total economic blockade were denied by Moscow officials, and appeared to be exaggerated. **********The chief railroad dispatcher in Vilnius, Kestutis Juras, said in a telephone interview tonight that cargo handlers in Vilnius who normally unload 1,200 incoming boxcars a day were now handling about 600.

One, operating as part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, was formed in late 1988 to advise the governments attending the World Climate Conference. The other, which was formed in 1986 and was the progenitor of the intergovernmental panel, has no government affiliation but rather is an association of independent scientists called the Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases. **********The independent group's report, issued yesterday in London, Stockholm and New York, goes beyond the scientific assessment of the intergovernmental panel, made public last June, in attempting to set targets for the control of global warming. **********Among the practical measures that the scientists said might be taken to limit the warming were improved energy efficiency, greater reliance on natural gas, reforestation and the adoption of alternative energy sources that are both technologically and economically feasible. The sources include solar, wind, geothermal and biomass technologies. ''Limiting emissions so we can stay below the minimums should be attainable,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, senior scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund, who was the chairman of the working group on control measures. **********Rate of Increase Forecast **********In June, the scientists advising the intergovernmental group predicted that under what it called the ''business as usual'' scenario, the average global temperature would rise by nearly two degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2025 and by more than five degrees by the end of the next century. The rate of increase, which scientists say is as important as the absolute increase because of the difficulty of adjusting to rapid climatic change, was predicted at about half a degree per decade. **********In the report issued yesterday, the independent scientists said that to minimize the risk of environmental damage, the rate of increase should be held below one-fifth of a degree per decade. **********An absolute increase beyond 1990 of more than about two degrees above pre-industrial levels, it said, ''may elicit rapid, unpredictable and non-linear responses that could lead to extensive ecosystem damage.'' Non-linear responses refer, for example, to sudden jumps in global temperature rather than even, gradual increases. **********The report last June of the intergovernmental scientific panel said that the world has already warmed by about half a degree to one degree since the industrial age began, but scientists do not know whether this rise was caused by greenhouse gases emitted as a result of human activity or whether it is attributable to natural climatic variability and therefore, possibly, is temporary. **********'Severe Impacts' Without Action **********The report said that the atmosphere may already contain enough heat-trapping gases to push the global temperature above the two-degree target. ''This means that unless we take very prompt and significant actions to reduce greenhouse emissions, we're very likely to experience severe impacts,'' said Peter Gleick, a co-chairman of the working group dealing with targets. He directs the global environmental programs of the Pacific Institute in Berkeley, Calif., a non-profit research institute. **********The report established an ''upper limit'' of about 3.5 degrees in temperature increase since the start of the industrial age ''beyond which the risks of grave damage to ecosystems, and of non-linear responses, are expected to increase rapidly.'' **********While the voluminous study was reviewed in detail by other scientists before it was issued, not all authorities were initially prepared to give it unqualified endorsement. **********''It sounds as if they've taken the worst-case scenarios and tried to make the case for a maximum effort,'' said William D. Nordhaus, a Yale University economist who cautioned that he had not yet had a chance to read the report.

They can certainly weigh down a fund's return to shareholders. **********This is not to say investors should buy only no-load funds. Some funds' superior performance can more than offset their loads. The Fidelity Magellan Fund under the legendary Peter Lynch is the outstanding example of the past decade. The fund, which has a 3 percent load, posted a total return averaging 23.9 percent a year for the decade, well ahead of a 14.8 percent average annual return by the issues in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index. **********But the majority of equity funds underperform the index, just as a majority of bond funds underperform bond indexes in total return. One reason is the funds' management expenses, as well as the loads that some charge and the 12b-1 fees - annual assessments for selling and advertising costs, named for the section of the securities law that authorizes them - that some funds charge. Rating services generally base total return numbers on capital appreciation and dividend after expenses but before loads. **********''Any investor should be the educated consumer,'' said Joel S. Isaacson, the partner who is in charge of personal financial planning for Weber Lipshie & Company, certified public accountants, in New York. ''Both blatant costs and hidden costs'' like an annual 12b-1 fee or a load on reinvested dividends ''can be a major differential in what a fund yields,'' he said. **********Like many financial advisers who recommend but do not sell products, he often recommends the Vanguard family of funds in Valley Forge, Pa., as the low-cost producer. Its bond fund expenses are around a third of a percentage point, and Mr. Isaacson noted that for a bond fund particularly, keeping expenses 60 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, lower than many competitors can make a big difference in return. **********Tim Kochis, national director of executive financial counseling for Deloitte & Touche in San Francisco, said he often recommended stock-index mutual funds to clients because of ''relatively low cost, automatic diversification and automatic record keeping with reinvested capital gains and dividends.'' **********He contends that it is unrealistic for most investors to think they can beat the market over the long term. The way to keep up is to buy into a fund that mirrors the S.&P. index. Its management fees will be low because a computer essentially replaces a portfolio manager and research staff. ''You maximize profits by keeping costs as low as posible,'' Mr. Kochis said. This is appropriate for long-term needs like I.R.A., Keogh or other retirement plans, but it is not a universal recommendation, he added. For some people with high levels of discretionary income, it can be appropriate to put some money into higher-risk funds with the potential for higher reward. Then the impact of any loads and 12b-1 fees must be considered, given the investment's projected duration. **********T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore-based manager of no-load funds, released a study this week showing the impact of loads and 12b-1 fees over 25 years, assuming a 10 percent annual return. If $10,000 was put into a no-load fund, it would grow to $108,347. In a fund with an 8.5 percent load, the maximum permitted by law, it would grow to $99,138. In a no-load fund with a 1 percent annual 12b-1 fee, it would reach $86,231. **********''A 12b-1 can be insidious over time,'' said Steven E. Norwitz, vice president of Price, ''and our studies show most people hold funds 10 years or more.'' **********The totals accumulated for 25 years for $2,000 invested annually are $216,364 for a no-load, $197,973 for an 8.5 percent load, and $184,648 for a no-load with a 1 percent 12b-1 fee. Generally, no-load funds are marketed directly by management companies, as are some low-load funds. Load funds are sold by brokers who spend time with the client. The load is a sales commission; it is not related to the portfolio manager's skill. **********There may be front-end loads, which reduce the amount of money going to work for an investor from the start, or back-end loads, sometimes referred to as redemption or exit fees. There may also be deferred sales charges, a type of back-end load that may be 5 percent or 6 percent if shares are redeemed after a short holding period, but decreases over time. And there may be 12b-1 fees. All funds also have management expenses. **********All fees and expenses must be shown in a standard table in the first few pages of a fund's prospectus under S.E.C. regulations, so an investor would be well advised to study the prospectus."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/26/business/the-media-business-ad-about-pantheon-leads-to-quarrel-between-publishers.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Cohen", "pub_date": "1990-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 479, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ad About Pantheon Leads to Quarrel Between Publishers", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Ad About Pantheon Leads to Quarrel Between Publishers", "body_text": " **********A provocative advertisement in The New York Review of Books has strained relations between two of America's leading publishers, Random House Inc. and Farrar, Straus & Giroux. **********The full-page advertisement, which appealed for new authors to come to Hill & Wang, an imprint of Farrar, Straus, denounced \"the sorry destruction of Pantheon Books,\" an imprint of Random House.

Hill & Wang, the ad said, would represent \"freshness of spirit, freedom from corporate constraints or a computer model making the publishing decisions.\" **********Sara Bershtel, a former Pantheon editor, has come to Hill & Wang as executive editor, bringing several Pantheon authors with her. **********Both Random House and Farrar, Straus are privately held companies that do not disclose their sales or profits.

No company has ever reported such strong earnings growth over such a long period. **********But Safety-Kleen stumbled last year, if earnings growth of 8.6 percent -- to $46 million on revenues of $478.1 million -- can be called stumbling. **********Since then, Donald W. Brinckman, Safety-Kleen's chief executive throughout the marathon of success, has been anxious to prove that Safety-Kleen can pick up where it left off. The company is pouring money into plants and collection systems for recycling used oil and a wider variety of chemicals, anticipating that quick expansion of capacity will bring a return to growth rates of 20 percent during the environmentally conscious 1990's. This year, the earnings growth rate is expected to top 15 percent. **********Investors seem to be betting that Mr. Brinckman can pull it off. Safety-Kleen shares have a price-to-earnings ratio about double the market average, among the highest in the popular waste-handling segment. Last week, Safety-Kleen completed a public offering of three million new shares of its common stock at $33.50 per share. This will allow the company to retire enough debt to cut pre-tax interest expenses by $8 million next year, according to Robert Willm-schen, the company's vice president of finance. **********\"Money managers love this company and won't listen to analysts who say that it has become overvalued compared to others in the environmental group,\" said Vishnu Swarup, who follows environmental stocks for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. **********Safety-Kleen fell on its version of hard times when its older businesses could not grow fast enough to support its heavy capital investment in new businesses. And some of the new ventures, particularly oil recycling, have developed more slowly than the company hoped. **********\"We could see the break coming, but there was still some disappointment,\" said Mr. Brinckman, a 59-year-old executive who combines a taste for strategy with the drive and imposing bulk of a linebacker. **********Mr. Brinckman hopes the company will return to its old growth rate in 1991, when a $55 million refinery the company is building in East Chicago for processing used oil into lube oil and fuel comes on line. **********The rapid rise in oil prices brought on by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait will undoubtedly help, but Safety-Kleen is stifling the natural urge to raise at a comparable clip the price of reclaimed oil from its existing refinery in Breslau, Ontario. **********\"We are not attempting to optimize our earnings based on the oil price rise,\" said Joseph F. Knott, the company's president and chief operating officer. \"We are not in this for the short term.\" **********One reason for moving slowly on pricing is that Safety-Kleen needs to persuade big oil companies to buy its re-refined oil and sell it under their own names. Safety-Kleen, which is based in this industrial city 35 miles west of Chicago, has neither the marketing expertise nor the name recognition among lube oil buyers to easily unload all the oil it hopes to reclaim. **********THE company already collects 80 million gallons of used motor oil and industrial lubricants annually from 65,000 customers, but that represents a small fraction of the total supply, which analysts estimated to be 2 billion gallons annually. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 800 million gallons annually are recycled by numerous small companies, some for re-refining and some for blending into fuel oil. **********\"Our biggest challenge in this business will be to get the big oil companies to realize that it's in their interest for used oil to be handled in an environmentally sound way and to get them into the circle,\" said Joseph Chaloub, the Safety-Kleen vice president who manages the oil recovery business from Breslau. **********Safety-Kleen also needs to close the gap between the 17 cents a gallon it costs to collect used oil and the 12 cents it is currently able to charge businesses for picking it up. The company expects the E.P.A. eventually to issue regulations classifying waste oil as a hazardous waste and creating penalties for improper disposal. Then Safety-Kleen figures there would be fewer disposal options, giving it the leverage to raise pickup prices to between 20 and 25 cents a gallon. **********But the E.P.A. has been reluctant to regulate waste oil, in part because much of the oil thrown out is disposed of by individual car owners who would be outside the reach of any regulations it is authorized to adopt. The agency fears that such regulations could backfire -- if service stations charged car owners more for oil changes to cover rising disposal costs, more people might dispose of the oil in the nearest drain. **********Safety-Kleen owes its name to a device for cleaning auto parts invented in Milwaukee in the early 1950's. It was little more than a sink mounted over a barrel filled with solvent and equipped with a pump to shoot the solvent into the sink. A filter below the sink trapped most waste, allowing the solvent to be used many times. **********After first trying to sell the devices, Safety-Kleen's initial owners decided to lease them and charge users for servicing. Several hundred units had been placed in auto shops when Mr. Brinckman, then an executive for Chicago Rawhide Inc., came calling in 1968, looking for companies to acquire that fit in with Rawhide's plans to sell its seals and other parts to the auto parts replacement market. **********MR. BRINCKMAN persuaded Rawhide to buy Safety-Kleen, for $25,000 in cash and $120,000 in assumed debt, describing it as \"a Geiger counter for finding people who would buy auto replacement parts.\" He quickly divided the country into seven regions with 130 service routes and sent teams out on a marketing blitz to sign up customers. The company also instituted a system that allowed route managers to become branch managers and raise their income by adding sales and service representatives. **********Rawhide spun off Safety-Kleen to its shareholders in 1974 and the company went public five years later. Since then, tightening environmental laws have repeatedly increased the value of the company's recycling services, gradually shifting investor perceptions of Safety-Kleen -- and the company's self-image -- from that of a business selling convenience to auto mechanics to that of a leader in the battle to control pollution. **********The most obvious change came in 1984 when Safety-Kleen pounced on the opportunity created by E.P.A. regulations that brought small businesses like dry cleaners under its supervision. Within two years, the company was making monthly pickups of used cleaning fluids and solvents at more than half of the nation's 25,000 dry cleaners. **********The company expanded again by acquiring chemical reclamation businesses, including the McKesson Corporation's Envirosystems subsidiary in 1987. Today, after investing millions of dollars to upgrade McKesson facilities, the company's Fluid Recovery Service can handle nearly 300 different chemicals. The growth of this unit, which became profitable last year on revenues of $22 million, is also giving the company a foot in the door at industrial sites that can use its traditional parts cleaners. **********AS it grows, Safety-Kleen is also seeking more business from bigger waste generators, an effort that has led it to develop a separate sales staff for national accounts. **********\"It requires a change of style for us to work on deals that can take two or three years to complete and to talk to coat-and-tie guys,\" said Mr. Knott, who ran Chemical Waste Management, the nation's leading handler of hazardous waste from large-scale producers, before joining Safety-Kleen in 1987. **********Nevertheless, the company's bedrock customers are likely to remain the dry cleaners, auto body shops and other mom-and-pop generators of waste products. The logistics and accounting involved in managing so many small customers may be daunting for Safety-Kleen, but it also discourages would-be competitors. **********\"Nothing we do is easy,\" said Mr. Brinckman, happily.   LITTLE ROOM FOR RIVALS **********LIFE is rough for the small privately owned independent operators who are the Safety-Kleen Corporation's only competition in its original business of supplying parts-cleaning equipment to garage owners. **********Independents say Safety-Kleen is careful to avoid price cuts that might be called predatory underpricing but quick to match prices of smaller rivals that are gaining market share. **********\"Safety-Kleen is pretty ruthless when it comes to competition,\" said Joseph W. Janecky, whose company, Resolve Industries of Denver, makes parts-cleaning equipment that the independents sell or lease to auto shops. Mr. Janecky once harbored dreams of becoming a strong No. 2 to Safety-Kleen in the equipment-rental and solvent-recycling segment of the business, but ran into financial disagreements with investors that led him to sell his routes in 1988. Not surprisingly, the highest bidder was Safety-Kleen. **********\"It takes so much capital,\" said Mr. Janecky. \"And now it takes a ton of lawyers as well to deal with all the regulations.\" Recently, he hosted a meeting that led 11 of the independents to set up a trade association that will share expertise on dealing with regulations as well as marketing ideas. In all, Mr. Janecky estimated, there are fewer than 25 independents, which together have about 5 percent of the market. **********The independents often offer lower prices than Safety-Kleen and some may be willing to supply a garage owner with customized equipment. Washington Chemical Inc. of Spokane has managed to overtake Safety-Kleen in that eastern Washington city because its local recycling facility allows it to offer a more complete range of services. **********However, the independents' main attraction these days is often simply that they are not Safety-Kleen. \"Safety-Kleen has a pretty hard sell when it comes to ancillary products like wheel sealers and hand cleaners,\" said Mr. Janecky, who said that he admires the company and is a shareholder. \"They pester some customers so much they get irritated. And customers want a choice.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/10/world/mongolia-communists-offer-to-resign-from-government.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-03-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mongolia Communists Offer To Resign From Government", "print_headline": "Mongolia Communists Offer To Resign From Government", "body_text": " **********Mongolia's Communist leaders offered to resign today in the face of protests by thousands of people calling for multiparty democracy, Eastern European press agencies reported from the Mongolian capital, Ulan Bator. **********The East German press agency A.D.N. and the Soviet press agency Tass said a national referendum would be organized to give the people an opportunity to say whether they had confidence in the Mongolian Parliament. **********A.D.N. said the Mongolian Communist Party Politburo had ''given in'' to demands for resignation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/23/world/in-polish-race-no-parties-need-apply.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Engelberg", "pub_date": "1990-11-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 961, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Polish Race, No Parties Need Apply", "print_headline": "In Polish Race, No Parties Need Apply", "body_text": " **********Poland's presidential election campaign, now entering its final stage, has embraced most of the external trappings of democracy, from bumper stickers to posters to opinion polls and last-minute mudslinging. **********But as Poles prepare to vote Sunday in their first free presidential election in 68 years, there is one obviously missing element: national political parties. **********When the Communist Party lost much of its monolithic power more than a year ago, there was a general expectation that it would be replaced by political groups representing the varied and often contradictory interests of such constituencies as farmers, industrial workers and the rising enterpreneurial class. **********Instead, this fall's presidential campaign has been characterized by the politics of personality and a pervasive distrust of organized parties.  An Unexpected Challenger **********This trend is being disclosed by the remarkable showing of Stanislaw Tyminski, an emigre businessman from Canada and Peru, who has come from nowhere in three weeks to mount a serious challenge in public opinion polls. **********Mr. Tyminski was virtually unknown when he announced his candidacy. Moreover, unlike his more established rivals -- Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader, and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki -- he played no role in the struggle to overturn Communist rule. **********\"In the absence of parties, we have something like the Greens in West Germany or like Proposition 13 in California,\" said Andrzej Wroblewski, the editor of the Polish financial weekly Gazeta Bankowa. \"People here are angry at anyone who could be seen as an authority.\" **********The latest public opinion poll shows that Mr. Walesa leads with 28 percent of the vote, with Mr. Tyminski at 21 percent and Mr. Mazowiecki at 17 percent. Under the election rules, a second round will be held Dec. 9 if no candidate wins a majority on Nov. 25. Emulating Solidarity **********For the last month, the six candidates in the race have done their best to try to emulate the Solidarity movement, which at the start of the decade was able to attract 10 million members with a program of anti-Communism designed to appeal to all Poles, regardless of their trade, profession, social group or geographic region. **********In interviews, Mr. Walesa always portrays himself as being above or apart from any political parties. **********Mr. Mazowiecki, the candidate with the greatest appeal to the most educated voters, has for his part sought to reach out to rural dwellers by promising telephones in every village within two years and stressing a platform promise that \"Polish farmers should have no fears for the future.\" **********That optimism stands in sharp contrast to the statements of Ryszard Bujak, one of Mr. Mazowiecki's leading supporters, who repeatedly says Poland's economic restructuring requires the bankruptcy of millions of small, inefficient farmers. **********In both the local elections earlier this year and the presidential race, politicians in Poland quickly concluded that declaring themselves members of a \"party\" inevitably invoked memories of \"the party.\" **********\"We think of ourselves as a party that has not yet consolidated,\" said Stanislaw Rojek, the secretary of the Center Alliance, a group that someday hopes to play a role similar to the Western Europe's Christian Democratic parties. No More Big Parties **********\"There is a considerable dislike of people for political parties as such because of the Communist past,\" Mr. Rojek said. \"But this is something that is slowly changing. Still there won't be anymore big parties in Poland. Their time is over.\" **********The Center Alliance, which has 60,000 to 70,000 members among Poland's 27 million voters, has been the most vocal force behind the candidacy of Mr. Walesa. Broadly speaking, its supporters come from the center-right of the political spectrum. Its main opponent, the Civic Movement for Democratic Action, has been organizing on behalf of Mr. Mazowiecki. **********A third major grouping, bidding to become the political voice of the 30 percent of the Polish population living in rural areas, is the Peasants' Party. Its presidential candidate, Roman Bartoszcze, has hovered between 5 and 10 percent in the opinion polls. **********Mr. Wroblewski said the lack of established political structures in Poland -- coupled with an intense longing for simple solutions to complicated problems -- explains the sudden emergence of Mr. Tyminski. **********\"What party structure means is not only an electoral machine to win elections,\" Mr. Wroblewski said. \"It's a certain system of gradual filtration of programs, of people. When you're in a political party, you have some place where you can turn to the person next to you and ask: 'Does this comply with the philosophy of our party?' That hardly exists here. The very idea was completely compromised by the Communist system.\" 'A Pole Can Do It' **********Supporters of Mr. Tyminski said in interviews that they saw him as a fresh face. They were attracted to his success in Western business, and, in the words of Mr. Wroblewski, \"he says to people, 'A Pole can do it.' \" **********After weeks of ignoring Mr. Tyminski, the Polish press reported today that he had been refused entry into the military in the 1960's because of mental illness. Another report said he had often traveled to Poland before the fall of Communism, despite his statements to the contrary. The report noted that he obtained visas several times from the Polish Consulate in Tripoli, Libya. **********Polish television and newspapers also criticized Mr. Tyminski for falsely charging that the Prime Minister planned to sell state enterprises for too low a price. The documents cited by Mr. Tyminski as proof of this charge actually refer to the company's annual sales, not the offering price. **********But it was unclear whether the attacks on Mr. Tyminski by established press organizations would not be counterproductive, since for many years Poles say they have learned not to trust what they read in the newspapers or see on television."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/18/business/accounts-seized-in-inquiry-on-colombian-drug-profits.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1990-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 770, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts Seized in Inquiry On Colombian Drug Profits", "print_headline": "Accounts Seized in Inquiry On Colombian Drug Profits", "body_text": " **********The Justice Department announced today that based on a review of bank records seized in Panama after the American invasion, as well as in other foreign countries, it had obtained a court order freezing hundreds of bank accounts in the United States suspected of having been used to hide nearly $400 million in Colombian drug profits. **********Federal investigators said that while relatively little money remained in the accounts, a review of the bank records would offer the Government its best opportunity to date to determine how the Medellin drug cartel had conducted its day-to-day business in the United States. **********More than half of the 173 banks involved are in New York and Florida, where many of the nation's largest drug-trafficking organizations are based. **********The banks, which include Chase Manhattan, Chemical and the Bank of America, have not been accused of any wrongdoing.

These transfers are known as money laundering.

Djinis, a trial lawyer at the Justice Department. But he said in an interview that with this week's action, ''now we're going to find out where the money is going and about the frequency of these disbursements.'' Money Flowed Back to U.S. Investigators said that the examination of foreign bank records showed that of the $1 billion in drug profits moved out of the United States, nearly $350 million was eventually transferred back to American banks. Some $50 million in drug money apparently never left American accounts, they said. **********''The cartel needs these secret U.S. accounts in order to run their illegal business here,'' Mr. Thornburgh said.

Ross. **********People close to the Thorn EMI negotiations, however, have said that Mr. Geffen is near a deal to sell his company to the hardware and music company for $700 million, but no official announcement has been made. **********The Geffen company's existing contract with Warner is ending at a time when Geffen, a major producer of rock music, is doing particularly well and the outlook for the industry is bullish. **********Because Geffen currently distributes through Warner Records, its sales and profits are not reported separately. But Geffen has been immensely successful in recent years with performers like Cher and the rock groups Guns and Roses, Aerosmith and White Snake. **********The 47-year-old Mr. Geffen has also invested, together with Warner, in a number of Broadway shows, including ''Cats,'' ''Little Shop of Horrors'' and ''Dream Girls.'' His company has also produced a handful of films, including ''Risky Business'' and ''Little Shop of Horrors.'' **********People in the industry believe that Geffen's record operations alone had sales of about $225 million in 1989, with operating profits estimated to be $40 million to $50 million. Those figures do not include profits from Broadway shows or film releases. And the Geffen company has no debt. **********Time Warner and Geffen have a deal in which Warner Records distributes Geffen's records and the two share the profits. Beyond that, however, Warner gets a distribution fee and makes profits from manufacturing cassettes. All in all, Time Warner may have taken in $30 million to $50 million last year from its deal with Geffen. **********The relationship with Geffen is crucial to Mr. Ross's global strategy. American rock music continues to gain market share in many markets abroad, and the Geffen history of discovering hit groups is unusually strong. **********This is a particularly healthy time for the record business because sales of compact disks are gaining at the expense of albums and cassettes, and the disks provide a higher profit margin. Also, a wider variety of music is now popular, from jazz to rap. The record business also remains one in which capital investment is still relatively low compared with the potential return from a hit. **********Thorn EMI has reportedly offered Mr. Geffen $700 million for his business, half in stock and half in cash, a figure so high that it caught the music industry by surprise. That price would be about three times sales. Harold Vogel, a media analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said such a multiple was at the very high end of recent transactions. For example, Polygram paid 2.1 times 1988 sales when it bought A&M Records for $219 million. **********A deal with Thorn EMI would include giving Mr. Geffen one of the top two positions in that company's music group, people close to the talks said. **********Some analysts say his help is needed by EMI, the music arm of Thorn EMI. Robert Collins, an analyst at Kleinwort, Benson Securities in London, said EMI ''does not have a reputation for the highest management in the music business.'' Mr. Geffen has declined to comment on any agreement.  The half-cash, half-stock offer that Thorn EMI has reportedly made would be costly for it. Even if, as Mr. Collins explained it, the company avoids a heavy dilution of its per-share earnings by using a convertible preferred stock, ''it would still dilute earnings for a year or more.'' **********Using stock as well as cash could, however, serve as an incentive to Mr. Geffen to play a strong role in the company. **********Mr. Geffen is already immensely wealthy. Not only does he own all his company, but he also has extensive real estate holdings in Beverly Hills and an important art collection. **********Analysts said Thorn EMI had offered such a high price because it was weak in American rock.

That treaty is currently being negotiated by the East and West German Governments. **********Before approving the motion for unity on Oct. 3, Parliament voted down a proposal by the German Social Union for immediate accession and a proposal by the Social Democratic Party for formal merger on Sept. 15. **********This morning's move means that East Germany will pass into history four days shy of the 41st anniversary of its founding on Oct. 7, 1949. **********''Parliament has decided no more and no less than the demise of East Germany on October 3,'' said Gregor Gysi, leader of the Party of Democratic Socialism, the remnant of the Communist Party that ruled East Germany with an iron hand for four decades. **********A Talk With Kohl **********Parliament had been called into session by Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere in an attempt to force a decision on the unity date. It came after a telephone conversation with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany Wednesday morning in which Bonn's leader reportedly expressed his growing impatience with the controversy and said he was willing to accept a date earlier than Oct. 14. **********The final setting of a date for formal unification ended an episode in which the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats in both Germanys sank into a partisan welter of proposals and counterproposals on dates for unity and all-German elections as the fabric of East German society continued to unravel. **********''It is time that we end this tortuous discussion over the date of accession to the Federal Republic of Germany and find a common solution,'' Mr. de Maiziere told Parliament as the late-night session began. **********The issue has become a matter of amusement here. Hans-Joachim Friedrichs, West Germany's most respected television newscaster, opened his broadcast Tuesday night by running down the confusing events of the day, then looking into the camera and asking his viewers, ''Are you still there?'' **********The first all-German elections since 1933 are scheduled for Dec. 2, after unification. On Wednesday, the East German Parliament approved an election law that had failed to get the needed two-thirds approval in a vote two weeks ago. **********On the election law, Parliament voted 295 to 74 to adopt the West German method of requiring a political party to get at least 5 percent of the total vote in order to be represented in the legislature."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/31/business/ford-loses-patent-suit-on-wipers.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1990-01-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 750, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ford Loses Patent Suit On Wipers", "print_headline": "Ford Loses Patent Suit On Wipers", "body_text": " **********A former engineering professor who says he invented the intermittent windshield wiper now used by most major car and truck manufacturers has won a bellwether patent-infringement case against the Ford Motor Company. **********A jury in Detroit ruled that Robert W. Kearns, who has waged a lonely 12-year legal battle against the automobile industry, was entitled to seek royalties on Ford's sales of the device, which allows a driver to adjust the intervals at which the wiper sweeps the windshield. **********In the Ford case, Mr. Kearns is seeking $50 for every vehicle to which his patent would apply. **********Possibly $1 Billion **********On Feb. 26, the same jury will weigh arguments on just how much money Ford should pay Mr. Kearns. If the inventor gets everything he wants, the case could cost the entire automobile industry hundreds of millions of dollars, and possibly more than $1 billion. **********But Mr. Kearns must overcome many obstacles: the judge could set aside the jury verdict, or Ford would almost certainly appeal. **********Mr. Kearns has suits pending against most of the world's other major car makers, from General Motors to BMW to Porsche, and the outcome of those cases will likely be heavily influenced by the result of the suit against Ford because many of the same principles apply in each case and the same Federal District Court is overseeing them. **********The essence of Ford's defense, which the jury rejected, was that Mr. Kearns's patents involved nothing new and were therefore invalid. The company cited earlier patents that it argued anticipated Mr. Kearns's claims. **********But the jury sided almost entirely with the 62-year-old inventor, who installed a set of his wipers on a 1962 Ford and took it to the auto maker. Mr. Kearns argued that because Ford engineers frequently asked him to discuss the design, he thought the company would buy the system. But it never did. **********In answering a long list of questions posed by Judge Avern Cohn, the jury decided that none of the earlier inventions cited by Ford had made Mr. Kearns's invention obvious and therefore unworthy of a patent. **********Important Victory **********Neither side would comment on the decision, citing a strict gag order from Judge Cohn. But the verdict clearly marks an important victory in what had for a long time seemed like a quixotic exercise. **********Mr. Kearns says he invented his device in the early 1960's. Until that time, intermittent windshield wipers were generally powered by vacuum pumps. Mr. Kearns designed an electronic device that was more practical and convenient, and obtained a series of related patents from 1967 to 1974. **********Mr. Kearns argued that he showed the device, mounted on a Ford Galaxy, to Ford officials in 1963. He also tried to commercialize the invention through a company called the Tann Corporation, but again was unsuccessful. Meanwhile, American car makers began introducing devices similar to his invention around 1969. **********The suit against Ford was filed in 1978, and those against other manufacturers have mostly come since then. **********Interest of Patent Lawyers **********The inventor has drawn the interest of top patent lawyers. In recent years, he has been represented on a contingency basis by Arnold White & Durkee, one of the most respected patent firms in the country. **********Some patent lawyers who have followed the case said they were not surprised by Mr. Kearns's victory. Experts said Ford had at one point tried to reach a settlement with Mr. Kearns but was not successful. **********''Ford is paying the price for the extremely arrogant anti-patent attitude of a generation ago,'' said Harold Wegner, a Washington patent lawyer. **********Outsider to the Car Industry **********Mr. Kearns, an outsider to the car industry all his life, taught engineering at Wayne State University in the 1960's and then went on to become commissioner of buildings and safety engineering for the city of Detroit. In 1971 he joined the Federal Bureau of National Standards. He retired in 1976 and later moved to Gaithersburg, Md. **********Judge Cohn ruled earlier that Mr. Kearns had failed to prove he could make and market the system on his own and therefore was not entitled to the ''lost profits'' that a manufacturer could claim - a sum greater than the royalties."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/06/business/business-people-chairman-is-named-for-emery-worldwide.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-09-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 288, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Chairman Is Named For Emery Worldwide", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   Chairman Is Named For Emery Worldwide", "body_text": " **********Long a leader in the trucking industry, Consolidated fell into a financial crisis after the April 1989 acquisition of Emery Air Freight for $478 million.

But today, the old relationships between authors and publishers have given way to growing differences over the contracts that define the business ties between them. **********''What has changed is the trust -it's gone,'' said Joni Evans, the publisher of Random House. ''There has been paranoia on both sides. The money is high, the risks are high and the old relationships between authors, editors and publishers have been disrupted.'' **********This ''paranoia'' inevitably centers on contracts. They were once the formal statements of much deeper understandings. Now, they have become more contentious as writers and editors have grown far more fickle in their attachment to particular publishers, the money involved has spiraled and the genial publishing houses of the past have been transformed into mere units of huge media corporations. **********''Contracts have grown more and more complex and difficult as they have gotten bigger,'' said Charles E. Hayward, the president of Simon & Schuster's trade book division. ''We are having to formalize what might previously have been an understanding on both sides.'' **********Of course, most book contracts still work smoothly. But many also go wrong, leading to book cancellations, bruised feelings and even lawsuits. **********This year, there was the unprecedented case of McGraw-Hill's suit against the estate of the author James Baldwin to recover a six-figure advance paid to him before his death in 1987. The company later dropped the suit. **********And there is the case of the author Roger Kahn, who wrote the best-selling ''The Boys of Summer'' and has been embroiled in a bitter dispute with Laurence J. Kirschbaum, the president of Warner Books. **********In July 1987, Mr. Kahn's 22-year-old-son committed suicide. The author was then in the midst of writing a $750,000 book for Warner about the baseball star Pete Rose. He and Mr. Rose had already received $225,000 of the advance, split evenly between them. But after his son's death, Mr. Kahn said, he felt unable to write. **********At the time of the suicide, the book, which had been due in April, was already late. Two weeks after the suicide, Mr. Kahn said, Mr. Kirschbaum told him, ''We need the book.'' **********When it was not completed by December, Warner canceled the contract and later sued to recover the $225,000 advance. **********''Warner's behavior was unbelievable,'' Mr. Kahn said. ''To sue a writer after a death in the family just shows no sense of civil behavior. Do publishers often treat writers in this way?'' **********Mr. Kirschbaum disputed Mr. Kahn's account of what happened. He said he felt devastated when he learned of the suicide and told Mr. Kahn to take a couple of months off. But when Warner still had no more than 20 percent of the manuscript five months after the suicide, it felt compelled to cancel the book, he said. **********''We spent hundreds of hours on this very expensive book, and Mr. Kahn was just not fair about it from day one,'' Mr. Kirschbaum said. **********In the end, the suit was settled. Mr. Kahn and Mr. Rose, whose book was ultimately published by Macmillan Inc., agreed to pay Warner $150,000 of the advance in several stages. **********Questions About Boilerplate **********As such conflicts have become more frequent, writers are questioning the standard, so-called boilerplate contracts of publishing houses. They are particularly concerned because last-minute cancellations of books have become more common. At Bantam Doubleday Dell this year, ''Dangerous Thoughts'' by Yuri Orlov; ''Constructive Thinking: The Intelligence That Counts'' by Seymour Epstein, and Luciano Benetton's life story have all been canceled after the manuscripts were completed. **********In this light, authors want to know why, as boilerplate contracts state, they should have to return money advanced to them if publishers deem a manuscript unsatisfactory. **********Typically, boilerplate contracts state that if a text is not satisfactory ''in the publisher's judgment,'' then the author ''agrees to repay forthwith all amounts which may have been advanced hereunder.'' **********''This is one of the most troubling clauses,'' said J. Anthony Lukas, the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer. ''You can spend several years on a book, and then be told it's not being published and we don't have to tell you why. And you have to pay back the advance.'' **********Basis for Negotiation **********Publishers say they cannot guarantee money to authors when they may find themselves with an unpublishable manuscript. Moreover, they argue that their boilerplates are merely a basis for negotiation with authors and their agents. Indeed, the contracts are routinely changed. **********But agents are increasingly wary. Some say they try to get a better description of what a satisfactory manuscript is. **********''In this new climate, we've all become increasingly careful about watching manuscript delivery dates,'' said Kathy Robbins, an agent. **********''When author-editor relationships were more stable, no one worried if a manuscript was a few months late,'' she added. ''But now, editors and publishers come and go. So if an editor tells me it's all right to be late, I make sure I get that in writing.'' **********Amanda Urban, another agent, said she found that increasingly an agent's role was ''to serve a book down the line'' to iron out any difficulties that might arise. And she said she had always been able to resolve conflicts amicably. **********But Ms. Urban added that she recently had a client who brought in his own lawyer, and the lawyer commented on a boilerplate publishing contract: ''Nobody in his right mind would sign a document like that. The publisher has all the advantages.'' **********'Rolling Thunder of Audits' **********Many authors are also contesting payments of royalties and the increasingly large reserves on royalties that publishers retain as a safeguard against unsold books coming back from stores. **********Robert K. Massie, the president of the Authors Guild, said he would like to see ''a rolling thunder of audits'' to make sure payments are being properly made. Moreover, authors want to know why they should accept a so-called ''option clause,'' which commits them to offering their next book to the same publisher. **********''It is no longer an even playing field,'' Mr. Lukas said. ''On the one side, you have a group of individual contractors, the authors, and on the other, multinational corporations. There is a pretense that this is an even bargaining situation. But thousands of authors do not even have agents. We would like to even out the playing field a little by negotiating, house by house, a minimum acceptable contract.'' **********Contract Discussions **********Mr. Massie disclosed that over the last two years writers and publishers held an unprecedented series of discussions about contracts. But in the view of the authors, the talks failed. **********The meetings were attended by publishers including Ms. Evans of Random House and Mr. Hayward of Simon & Schuster, lawyers from several publishing houses and writers. **********''The idea was to reach a consensus on how to publish books,'' Mr. Massie said. **********But Ms. Evans said the only point of the talks was to get to know each side's concerns. She added that the meetings had been useful and that Random House was reviewing a possible new boilerplate contract. **********Mr. Hayward called the meetings ''rather frustrating.'' **********''There were a lot of good intentions,'' he said, ''but the objectives were not laid out.'' **********For Mr. Massie, however, the aim is clear: ''We wanted to get a standard basic contract. But it was a two-year process that went nowhere.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/14/world/mandela-says-south-africa-persecuted-his-wife.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 687, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mandela Says South Africa Persecuted His Wife", "print_headline": "Mandela Says South Africa Persecuted His Wife", "body_text": " **********Nelson Mandela, the South African black nationalist leader, today defended his wife, Winnie, saying she had been the victim of the ''most scandalous persecution'' by the Government. **********It was Mr. Mandela's first comment on criticisms of Mrs. Mandela, one of whose former bodyguards is on trial in connection with the kidnapping and killing of a black teen-ager. **********Three men have testified that they were abducted in December 1988 along with the teen-ager and taken to Mrs. Mandela's house in Soweto.

Cohen, vice president for the Emergency Committee for American Trade, a group of 64 American multinational companies that generally support liberalization. \"It's an example of having to take the middle ground the closer we get to the final days.\" **********In recent days, the Bush Administration has signaled that it wants to exclude four sectors -- shipping, civil aviation, telecommunications and banking -- from the clear, open, nonrestrictive rules being written in Geneva. **********The banking, telecommunications and airline industries had originally supported the push for liberalization, hoping their competitive skills would enable them to penetrate foreign markets. The shipping industry has never had much enthusiasm for ending its protectionism. **********Bush Administration officials deny that they are retreating from their initial goals of broad-scale liberalization. \"We are not backing down, but assessing the situation and determining what the best negotiating stance is,\" said a senior aide to the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills. Exceptions for the four sectors have occasioned some dismay among the negotiating partners. **********The shift by the United States is causing some alarm within the European Community generally. **********\"We're very concerned,\" a senior Danish official said. \"This is the sort of thing that can multiply and lead to unraveling.\" **********France is now seeking an exception for so-called cultural industries, which means that films and television programs from the United States might face new quotas and restrictions.   Shipping Industry Blamed **********Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, blames the maritime industry, which won an exclusion from the Canadian-American free-trade agreement of 1989 and seems to be achieving the same thing in the current talks, known as the Uruguay Round. **********\"We will be avalanched with quotas and restrictions, all of which would be perfectly legitimate if the U.S. maritime industry succeeds in bending the United States trade representative to its will,\" Mr. Valenti said. **********Shipping has a long history of protection, going back to the Jones Act of 1920, which reserves all inland waterway and coastal traffic for American ships and crews. The United States shipping industry has been outspoken in its opposition to liberalization. **********In the negotiations on the Canadian agreement, the maritime industry showed its strength by getting more than half the members of the Senate and House to sign resolutions declaring the Jones Act out of bounds in any trade negotiations. **********In the final run there may not be much argument at the trade talks about exempting shipping, since nearly all countries have similar laws requiring ports to be serviced by their own carriers.   Position of Regulators **********The situations of the other three sectors share one element -- regulation by agencies reluctant to give up a regulatory grip in the interests of freer trade. **********Aviation routes are negotiated by the State and Transportation Departments subject to a network of bilateral arrangements under the 1944 Chicago Convention. **********The route negotiations are governed by strict and narrow reciprocity. What a country gets in terms of access to a new market it has to be willing to cede in access to its own market. In aviation, there is no equivalent market access for all countries, which is one of the guiding principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the multinational forum that is sponsoring the Urguay Round of talks. **********To provide unconditional open skies, one of the goals of the Geneva talks, would bring chaos, aviation regulators insist, a view widely shared by airline executives.  Treasury and Fed Concerns **********Banking is regulated chiefly by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board, with the principal goal of maintaining the safety and soundness of depository institutions. **********The regulators -- including treasurers and finance ministers of most other countries -- are generally not keen about having banking on the trade agenda. **********In Washington, territorial strains also figure. Treasury officials say that if there is to be any further opening of banking services in the interests of freer trade, they should handle the negotiations, not Mrs. Hills's office. **********Telecommunications is governed by the Federal Communications Commission, whose chairman, Alfred C. Sikes, warned Mrs. Hills in a letter in August that coverage of basic voice telephone service in the trade talks could \"significantly impair\" the regulatory framework of the Communications Act of 1934. Her response has been to seek exemptions in line with his request, which was made at the behest of the top United States long-distance companies. **********Basic service in most countries is provided by state monopolies, and some American officials fear that an agreement in telecommunications might lead to a one-sided commitment by the United States to keep its market open without any additional access to foreign markets with solidly entrenched state monopolies.  Benefits in Narrower Accord **********While it would seem that credible liberalization must include all service industries without exception, a narrower accord could still be beneficial, many experts maintain. **********Even if banking is removed from the financial-services category, a number of other areas could be opened up -- for example, insurance, credit cards, commodities bartering, electronic fund transfers, securities underwriting and traveler's checks. **********\"The goal hasn't changed,\" said Margaret S. Wigglesworth, executive director of the Coalition of Service Industries, representing the service sector, which generates two-thirds of the United States gross national product. \"What we've discovered in all this is that some areas of services do not lend themselves to immediate liberalization.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/05/world/south-africa-s-new-era-exiled-south-african-communist-says-situation-now-more.html": {"writer_name": "Sheila Rule", "pub_date": "1990-02-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 967, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "South Africa's New Era;   Exiled South African Communist Says Situation Is Now More Volatile", "print_headline": "South Africa's New Era;   Exiled South African Communist Says Situation Is Now More Volatile", "body_text": " **********The general secretary of the South African Communist Party said today that the changes announced by President F.

But he did not repeal South Africa's three-year-old state of emergency regulations, saying that there was still too much political unrest, and did not announce an end to the system of legislated racial segregation known as apartheid. **********The gathering in Stockholm, which includes Walter Sisulu and other veteran Congress leaders who were released from jail last year, is to be followed soon by a meeting of the group's national executive committee. **********The officials had arranged to visit Stockholm to meet with the organization's president, Oliver Tambo, who is in a clinic here recovering from a stroke, before Mr. de Klerk made the announcement in a speech at the opening of Parliament. **********Asked to describe the current political situation in South Africa, Mr. Slovo said: ''In a word, volatile; from every side, from our side and from the Government's side. From de Klerk's side, he's got major divisions within his constituency and already the right wing is making threatening noises. From our side, of course, the volatility consists of the new space which de Klerk has been forced to provide, increased organization and political activity.'' **********The African National Congress had been banned for 30 years and the South African Communist Party for 40. Mr. Slovo, a former head of the Congress's military wing, whose wife, Ruth First, was killed in 1982 by a letter bomb he believes was sent by South African agents, has not been in South Africa since 1963. He said that exiled members of the African National Congress and Communist Party were studying how and when to return home. But he said that Mr. de Klerk's proposals, which did not include amnesty for political opponents in exile, had left many ''ambiguities'' and ''an uncertain situation.'' **********'Armed Activity Played a Role' **********''We have been engaged in a political struggle,'' said Mr. Slovo, a soft-spoken, stocky, gray-haired white South African who has long been the South African Communist Party's most prominent member, ''in which armed activity played a role. We can't look at our membership and leadership as consisting of two segments, those who commited political offenses and those who committed so-called terrorist offenses.

All of its deposits were bought by the Chase Manhattan Bank, which will begin operating Seamen's 13 branches today. **********The Seamen's Bank fell on hard times in the early 1980's when sharply higher interest rates paid on deposits caused losses at many savings banks. The losses from high interest rates were compounded in 1987 and 1988 when Seamen's invested heavily in new kinds of mortgage-backed securities. The securities failed to protect the company from fluctuating interest rates and, instead, resulted in large losses. In the first nine months of 1989, Seamen's lost $166.8 million. **********The Federal takeover of Seamen's is expected to cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation $350 million to $400 million, according to Alan Whitney, a spokesman for the F.D.I.C. The Government insurance fund, with assets of about $14 billion, will sell Seamen's assets, including loans and securities, and use the proceeds to repay creditors other than depositors. The F.D.I.C insurance fund is separate from the reorganized insurance fund created by Congress last year to rescue the savings and loan industry. $5 Million Price Chase, which will rename the branches, plans to combine Seamen's $2.1 billion of deposits and 13 branches with the $13.7 billion of consumer deposits and 185 Chase branches in New York City, Long Island and Westchester County.

The polls show that Mr. Kaifu remains popular, but politicians say the criticism could undercut his ability to govern effectively. **********The latest problem for Mr. Kaifu occurred after the visit to Pyongyang last week of Shin Kanemaru, a former Deputy Prime Minister who is widely known as the most influential power broker in the governing Liberal Democratic Party. **********Tokyo Assails Communique **********On Friday, Mr. Kanemaru's delegation signed a statement with North Korean leaders calling for an early dialogue to establish diplomatic relations.

Indeed, Foreign Ministry officials said the Pyongyang communique had no official standing. **********Breach of Protocol **********The communique raised eyebrows in Tokyo and in South Korea, because it seemed to adopt some of North Korea's longstanding positions, using language like ''Korea is one,'' a longtime code phrase by Pyongyang for its position that Seoul is an illegitimate usurper and pawn of Washington. **********The communique also promised that Japan would compensate Korea for injustices in the years after 1945, which diplomats said was confusing to them because Japan has had no dealings with Pyongyang since World War II. **********In Seoul, President Roh Tae Woo said he wanted clarifications, asserting that South Korea had never been compensated for the postwar years.

Many thought they had won a major victory in December when Congress repealed the surtax for catastrophic medical care that could have run as high as $800 per person or $1,600 per couple. But there it is on the forms, line 54 of the Form 1040 and line 23 of the 1040A. **********''Ignore it,'' said Hal M. Cohen of Deloitte & Touche. ''Don't use it. The forms had already been printed when the surtax was repealed.'' Those who included that liability when making estimated tax payments last year ''will get it back as a refund,'' he added. **********Mr. Cohen, who is based in Morristown, N.J., is a member of the accounting firm's executive financial planning group. So he has a suggestion for how to use the funds that would have paid the surtax: buy supplemental medical insurance. **********''The emotional and financial expenses of a long-term illness can deplete the assets and income of two generations,'' he said, if a family must pay for the uninsured portion of doctor and hospital bills or for custodial or nursing-home care not covered under Medicare that can cost $20,000 a year or more. **********Consequently, Mr. Cohen is advising all his older clients, as well as those who may be responsible for elderly parents, to be sure they have adequate health-care insurance ''in order to avoid financial disaster or substandard medical care.'' **********Once a person reaches age 65, he or she is eligible for Medicare. It becomes the primary carrier for those who are retired, and supplemental ''medigap'' insurance is available through private carriers. Medicare pays 80 percent of allowable charges, but medical costs often exceed Medicare's allowable limits. **********Medicare and the medigap policies will pay for nursing-home stays in approved facilities with medical staffs after hospitalization. Unlike Medicaid, which is the medical-welfare program for the indigent, Medicare will not pay for long-term custodial care for people who have not been hospitalized, like those suffering from Alzheimer's disease. So middle-class people are likely to need private insurance for this. **********''Shop around,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''There can be tremendous differences among policies,'' both in terms of the cost and of the coverage provided. He suggested starting with the American Association of Retired Persons, which markets a Prudential medigap plan, or by consulting an independent insurance agent. **********Insurance is regulated by state insurance commissions, so what is available in one state may not be available in another. **********Tamara G. Telesko, vice president of Chase U.S. Private Banking, part of the Chase Manhattan Bank, said that with the frequent need for custodial care among the elderly, more people are becoming aware of the need for private insurance to supplement Medicare. However, she cautioned, this is a relatively new product, and actuarial data are still being developed. With rising health-care costs, premiums may rise. **********Deloitte & Touche has advised its clients to look for policies that provide a waiver of premium in the event of disability, a maximum benefit period for one nursing-home stay of at least four years and a daily nursing-home benefit of about $80, with inflation protection written into the policy. Inflation protection can increase the premium cost by as much as one-third. **********It is also important to make sure that the company issuing the policy is financially sound. One way to do this is to check the rating issued by A.M. Best & Company. Ratings range from A+ (superior) to C (poor). **********Among the features Deloitte & Touche recommends in considering policies are these: *********** Guaranteed Renewability. The policy should be guaranteed renewable for life, except for nonpayment of premium, so that the insurer cannot cancel the policy when the individual is making use of its coverage. *********** Deductible Period. This is the period, generally 21 to 365 days, that must pass before the insurer begins to pay benefits. Although the shorter period is preferable, the longer period may reduce the premium. *********** Grace Period. This is the time, generally seven to 31 days, after the premium due date, before which the insurer may cancel the policy. It gives the policyholder some protection, should he or she forget to pay the premium on time. *********** Care Coverage.

Timothy Ryan Jr., a former Labor Department lawyer in the Reagan Administration, cast doubt on his chances. **********With the bailout process essentially at a standstill because of court battles on the constitutionality of recent regulatory actions, and Government officials acknowledging that it will remain that way until a Senate-confirmed regulator is in place, the Administration had hoped that Mr. Ryan would be approved by the end of next week, before a scheduled April 11 hearing in the case. **********The hearing also provided a moment of drama in an unscheduled appearance by Charles H. Keating Jr., the Phoenix developer whose failed Lincoln Savings and Loan Association has come to symbolize to many the ills of the industry. **********Troubled by Statements **********Members of the committee were particularly troubled by statements by Mr. Ryan, nominated as the next director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, that he did not ''have an opinion'' on whether there should be a savings and loan industry in the future. He also said that deregulatory measures passed by Congress in 1982 had contributed to the crisis. **********What Bush Administration officials knew would be a tough hearing became worse than expected, with senators and Banking Committee staff members saying they had never before seen such skepticism expressed at a nomination hearing. **********''I am not prejudging the outcome of this confirmation process, but some members have already expressed to me serious reservations about your nomination,'' Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the committee, told Mr. Ryan. **********''I am one of those troubled members,'' said Senator Timothy E. Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, who said he was alarmed that Mr. Ryan had ''virtually no exposure in no way, shape, or form in the financial industry.''

At the hearing today, Mr. Ryan acknowledged that he lacked expertise in the financial sector, but contended that his experience as a manager of a Government bureaucracy, a reputation as a tough enforcer and almost a decade as a lawyer in a Washington law firm were sufficient qualifications for the job. **********''I have experience in managing people and a proven track record in enforcement,'' the 44-year-old Mr. Ryan told the committee.

I get things done.'' **********But that did not seem to be enough for a number of members of the committee, who repeatedly wondered why at such a time the Administration did not choose someone with extensive expertise in the savings industry. **********Senator Alan Cranston, the California Democrat, asked Mr. Ryan whether deregulation had contributed to the crisis. **********Citing the Garn-St Germain Act of 1982, Mr. Ryan said, ''It appears that the results have not been positive.'' **********Mr. Ryan was quickly taken to task by Senator Jack Garn, Republican of Utah, who said that the legislation bearing his name provided only modest deregulation for the industry, and that it was excessive deregulation at the state level that was to blame. **********Senator Howard M.

The American troops are out of sight, 15 to 20 miles away in the desert. **********Oil has made the Saudis one of the world's most prosperous nations, with an economic growth rate of 5 percent and virtually no unemployment. In Jidda, where the Saudi Government has been for the summer, the pulse of life is untouched. Cars linger over the long seaside corniche, and Egyptian soap-operas fill television programming. **********On the nightly news Saudi soldiers are paraded and senior Saudi officials review troops endlessly and listen to patriotic poems. But there is little discussion of the huge American buildup under way and virtually no mention of Iraqi troop movements close to the Saudi borders. **********''We don't feel a thing,'' said a senior oil executive in Dhahran as he drove his car up and down the main avenues of the oil town that is the headquarters of the Aramco oil company. ''If it weren't for foreign radio stations you would not suspect we are on the verge of war.'' **********A Xenophobic Grip **********Yet, a deep and fundamental debate has started in Saudi circles about the impact of this crisis on the future of the country. **********Saudi intellectuals and liberals are thrilled by the notion that the presence of American troops, and the immense good will the world is showing Saudi Arabia, will loosen the hold of the fundamentalist Muslim religious leaders, who have opposed every step of modernization in this country, from the education of girls to the introduction of television. **********But the purpose of the foreign presence does not escape Saudi officials. They are concluding that this country can absorb a first strike by Iraq, but fervently hoping that the United States would hit first, with a devastating attack on Iraqi forces. **********''We think that there is a 3 percent chance of missiles getting through to our vital oil facilities,'' said one Saudi official, who expressed confidence that the combined American-Saudi airpower can handle any such atack with a ''knockout'' blow to Iraq's air force and missile launchers. **********Saudi intelligence officials estimate that Iraq's rate of production of land-to-land missiles is two per day, and a Saudi defense offical said it is believed that Iraq has not perfected the technique of mounting chemical warheads on its missiles. **********''The greatest probability is that they have to deliver chemical payloads by airplanes or artillery, which gives them a limited range of operation,'' said the defense official, who like many Saudis and foreigners interviewed here about the current crisis, asked for anonymity. **********In the streets of this desert country, the burning topic of conversation is the threat of war, and foreigners fret over whether they should stay or leave, while Saudis are content to bask in the notion that with American troops here and the whole world standing against Iraq, there is little doubt that President Saddam Hussein's days are numbered. **********''He is finished,'' said Khalid Ali Alturki, a successful businessman who lives in Al Khobar, speaking of President Hussein. ''The only question is how much it will cost - not whether it will happen. I think Kuwait will pay a heavy price, but no matter how much it costs, it is worth it to have back the country and rid us of Saddam.'' **********Saudi officials and senior members of the ruling Kuwaiti al-Sabah family who live here in the summer capital of Taif, said that Kuwait is indeed putting its formidable economic muscle behind the military effort against Iraq. **********It is understood from these officials that Kuwait, which holds foreign assets estimated at over $100 billion under the control of its Government-in-exile in Taif, is increasingly footing a growing part of the enormous costs of the deployment here of the American, Egyptian and other forces, which is running at some $25 million a day. **********''We are willing to sacrifice everything,'' said the Kuwaiti Crown Prince, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, in a meeting with the foreign press on Thrusday in Taif. **********Kuwaitis Underwriting **********Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are also believed to have advanced financial aid to Egypt to compensate for the rising costs of moving back tens of thousands of Egyptians fleeing Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait from Jordan. **********And, Saudi Arabia has been carrying the cost of housing, feeding and giving refuge to some 100,000 Kuwaitis who are refugees here. **********But Saudis in decision-making positions are rethinking the country's financial aid to the Palestine Liberation Organization. They make it clear that they will no longer deal with the current leadership of the P.L.O. and that they expect Yasir Arafat to be replaced as its chairman if the organization expects to resume normal ties and continue to receive financial aid. **********In Saudi Arabia, hardly a single Saudi misses the opportunity to vilify Mr. Arafat, who is seen as having betrayed this country and other gulf Emirates by siding with Iraq in the conflict. **********''From now on, we will support causes not people,'' said one well-placed Saudi in an extensive interview today. ''We are making the point that Yasir Arafat is finished here but that other Palestinian leaders who appreciate all the financial help we have extended to the Palestinian movement over the years and who have not turned against us will be welcome.'' **********Officially, the Saudi Government denies that there has been any break with the P.L.O. Saudi officials said that a request by Mr. Arafat to come here a few days ago was politely turned down, but on Thursday King Fahd received Hani al-Hassan, a senior P.L.O. leader who is widely seen as sympathetic to the gulf monarchies within the Palestinian movement. **********In conversations with many Saudis, including ordinary citizens, there appears to be a firm conviction that Iraq, the P.L.O., Yemen and Jordan have conspired to subdue the gulf emirates and Saudi Arabia in the hope of each getting rewards out of what is described as an obvious plot. **********''When Saddam attacked Kuwait, he really calculated that we will back down,'' said a Cabinet minister. ''Eventually they thought the P.L.O. would dominate Kuwait using the 400,000 Palestinians living there to govern and that Yemen would get a territorial adjustment in the South taking some land from us there. Jordan and Iraq would reap substantial financial aid from a subdued Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.'' **********The talk of the future in this region now envisages a whole different scenario. ''This is the beginning of what I think is going to be a rollback of the excessive influence of the Saudi religious establishment,'' a liberal Saudi official said. **********Faced with the immense good will the world has shown Saudi Arabia, the most conservative religious leaders, led by Sheik al-Baaz, the most senior religious figure in the kingdom, conceded in television interviews over the past few days that even though those who came here to ''defend Islam'' include ''atheists and Christians,'' not to mention women, they will be ''rewarded by God for their good deed,'' thus putting the seals of approval on the American presence here. **********American Habits **********Even though they deny it, American troops here are believed to have access to alcoholic drinks, including beer, and as their numbers rise to an anticipated 200,000, their influence is bound to be felt more strongly. **********Already in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia, where the bulk of Kuwaiti refugees and American troops are, Kuwaiti women and American women soldiers have been seen driving their cars and jeeps in a country where women are strictly forbidden from driving. **********There is a story that has circulated widely in Saudi Arabia over the past few days: that an American woman soldier in uniform drove her car into Al Khobar to shop. Her behavior was viewed as nothing less than scandalous in a society where women virtually never appear alone in public. **********The soldier was approached by a Mutawaa, one of the Islamic fundamentalists who enforce laws of proper behavior. The Mutawaa raised his cane warning the soldier to get back into her car and go away. Whereupon, the story goes, the American pulled her gun and pointed it at his face sending him scrambling for cover. **********''It does not matter that the story is true or not,'' said a Cabinet minister who was among 14 people recounting it over a lunch recently. ''What matters is that everyone wants to believe that it is true,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/20/business/company-newsbp-to-reduce-staff-by-1150.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 197, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWSB.P. to Reduce Staff by 1,150", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWSB.P. to Reduce Staff by 1,150", "body_text": " **********The British Petroleum Company said today that it was cutting 1,150 jobs, or nearly half the staff, at its London headquarters in a reorganization intended to lower costs and make the oil giant more flexible. **********About 900 people will be laid off and the rest will be transferred, said a spokesman, who was not identified in accordance with British practice. **********The cuts, mainly affecting workers in administrative, computing and information services, would reduce by 46 percent the 2,500-member staff currently employed at the company's headquarters.

Hundreds of institutions have collapsed and hundreds more are in danger of failure, victims of regional economic downturns, poor management and outright fraud. The cost to taxpayers will reach into the hundreds of billions of dollars. Industry executives are widely viewed as incompetent or criminal, and all too often the stereotype is true. **********But a significant portion of the industry has always remained profitable and honest. The Sandlers, for example, are conservative, methodical, penny-pinching and risk-averse in the extreme - and they have spent nearly three decades shaping Golden West, now the nation's sixth-largest savings and loan, in their image. The antithesis of the high-rollers attracted to the industry by deregulation, they remain downright boring - and proudly so. **********An Appetite for Calm **********''Perhaps we can best characterize Golden West's attitude toward lending by simply saying that your management likes to sleep undisturbed by worries and nightmares,'' the Sandlers wrote in a letter to shareholders in their most recent annual report. **********The Sandlers use all the techniques of modern financial management, paying especially close attention to cost control. But the core of their business is decidedly - some might say refreshingly - old-fashioned: The company lends out Federally insured deposits almost exclusively in the form of home mortgage loans, forgoing potentially more lucrative but far riskier loans and direct investments in shopping centers, office buildings and other commercial real estate. Of the 27,436 loans it made last year, 93 percent went to single-family homes and virtually all of the rest to multi-unit residential housing. **********It does this through a network that seems almost anachronistic in this age of one-stop financial shopping. It has 205 branches in California and five other states and operates 65 loan offices in 16 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. **********For the most part, the branches accept only savings deposits, eschewing the business of offering checking and other ''transaction'' accounts that might attract more customers but are far more expensive to maintain. To keep costs low, the company does not even have automated teller machines, almost certainly making it the largest financial institution in the nation not to offer that service. Most of its customers are old-fashioned savers, who patiently deposit their funds in return for competitive interest rates. ''They've identified their customer and the services the customer wants, and they don't provide anything else,'' Mr. Treadway said. ''They have tremendous control of expenses.'' As archaic as the strategy might seem, it has worked. Golden West's earnings have been consistently strong at a time when the industry as a whole has been running up huge losses. The company's shares are worth 10 times what they were at the beginning of the 1980's. It has almost no bad loans. **********Even as most other institutions scramble to raise more capital to meet the Government's tougher new standards for financial strength, Golden West is in the enviable position of having far more capital than regulations require. Unlike most savings and loans, Golden West has also been able to raise new capital in the financial markets in recent months, completing two subordinated debt offerings totaling $215 million. **********As a result, it is one of the few institutions with the capability of expanding, either by acquisition or internal growth. In May, for example, the company acquired from the Government the $725 million in deposits held by a failed savings institution in Colorado, already its second-largest market after California. And just last week, the company completed the acquisition of Community Federal Savings and Loan in Ramsey, N.J. Community Federal, with six branches and assets of $460 million, gives Golden West its first deposit-taking offices in the Northeast. **********The Partnership **********The Sandlers have been running Golden West together since acquiring it for $4.1 million in 1963, when it had $34 million in assets. They took it public in 1968, and today, assets have grown to $20 billion. **********Mr. Sandler, 58 years old, is a former New York lawyer who serves as chairman and co-chief executive and, in his three-piece suit, looks very much the old-fashioned banker. Mrs. Sandler, 59, learned about the industry as a securities analyst on Wall Street. She holds the titles of co-chief executive and president. The two finish each others' sentences, prompt each other to tell favorite stories and appear to have long since worked out whatever problems might have cropped up in the marriage of their personal and business lives. **********''You know that old saying about it being lonely at the top?'' asked Mr. Sandler. ''Well, it's not here.'' **********Moreover, they are clearly enjoying the vindication of their cautious approach after having been roundly criticized by Wall Street for not being aggressive enough and disparaged by competitors for running something of a dinosaur. ''Over 20 years, running the institution in our fashion, through all the turmoil that's taken place, our compound annual rate of growth and earnings is 20 percent,'' said Mr. Sandler, ticking off the kind of statistic that has turned Golden West into a current favorite among stock analysts. ''To my knowledge, no bank or thrift has done that.'' **********Yet the Sandlers still face questions about whether their approach can continue to work in an age of full-service banking. Most of Golden West's major competitors - including its two biggest rivals, H. F. Ahmanson & Company of Los Angeles and the Great Western Financial Company of Beverly Hills - are positioning themselves to compete directly with commercial banks. **********Believing that the distinctions between banks and savings and loans will continue to disappear in coming years, both Ahmanson and Great Western are pushing to get more transaction accounts from customers. Great Western offers consumer loans and other services that were once the exclusive province of banks. **********''Golden West is very strong for what it attempts to do, but that's not the only route to success as the banking and thrift worlds come together,'' said Bert Ely, an industry consultant in Alexandria, Va. ''The thing I worry about is that while their strategy certainly works today, it may not work five years from now.'' **********Looking at Change **********The Sandlers say they have nothing against change. After Congress and the state legislatures deregulated the industry during the early 1980's, ''We researched discount brokerage,'' said Mr. Sandler. ''We just couldn't figure out how to make money in it. Everyone else got into it, and a few years later they were all getting out.'' **********Now, Mr. Sandler said, the company is studying the possibility of offering traditional checking and other transaction accounts. ''We're going to analyze it, and if there's a role for it, we'll go ahead with it,'' he said. **********Still, the Sandlers freely admit that they see no advantage to plunging into new businesses just to be trendy or to match the competition. **********Golden West's most clearly visible advantage is its low operating costs. The company's general and administrative expenses last year - the cost of running the company - were $181.8 million, or 0.97 percent of total assets, down from 1.14 percent the year before. That compares to 1.57 percent of assets on average last year for the 10 other largest savings and loan companies in California. **********If the company's expense ratio had been the same as that of its competitors, its earnings last year would have been $86.5 million, or $1.37 a share, instead of its actual profits of $157.9 million, or $2.51 a share. In this year's second quarter, Golden West earned $49 million, or 78 cents a share, a 22 percent increase over the same period in 1989. **********The greater profit margin gives the company more flexibility in deciding how many new loans to make - and therefore it may say no to riskier loans that other institutions might consider as they try to generate higher earnings. **********''Because we're such a profitable company, we can operate well with a lower volume,'' Mrs. Sandler said. ''We don't have a high-fixed-overhead loan machine that we have to feed continually.'' **********The company's cost advantage comes from many things, large and small. It does not have the expense of installing and maintaining automated teller machines nor the costs involved in traditional checking accounts, which require expensive check-processing equipment, data bases and manpower. Cost-consciousness is so ingrained that branch managers charge executives visiting from headquarters for the phone calls they make from the branch. **********The company also studies the work load in its branches and has an hour-by-hour and day-by-day model for each staffing requirement. Of the 1,050 employees who work in its branches, more than 500 are on permanent part-time status, keeping payroll costs low. The company has something of a reputation for stinginess and has never invested much in the appearance of its branches. **********A Modest Look **********''Their branches are - I wouldn't call them low rent, because that would be unfair,'' said Eric I. Hemel, an analyst at the First Boston Corporation. ''They're streamlined. They're smaller and more Spartan. They're a visual metaphor for the entire company.'' Just as important to Golden West's success as cost-cutting is the high quality of its loan portfolio, a result, to some extent, of its almost total concentration on home mortgage lending. Borrowers, after all, are less likely to default on their mortgages than on any other type of loan. **********And even within the field of mortgage lending, Golden West stands out. Last year, an impressive 93 percent of its residential loans were made with downpayments of 20 percent or more, considerably higher than the industry average. The result has been to keep the number of bad loans to a minuscule five-tenths of 1 percent of total loans last year. **********Just Say No **********How do they do this? The Sandlers point to a deeply ingrained corporate culture, which holds that there is no shame for a loan officer to say no. Indeed, when in two periods in the last decade economic conditions or intense competition suggested that they would have to lower credit standards to attract borrowers, they instead virtually swore off making new loans, even at the cost of not growing for a year or two. **********''We were damned by Wall Street,'' Mrs. Sandler said. ''When you have zero loan growth for two years, you really feel the heat.'' **********But by retaining earnings at a time when it was not growing in asset size, Golden West improved its underlying financial strength. **********The strategy paid off when Congress, in legislation passed last year to bail out and reform the industry, substantially increased capital requirements. **********Today, as one of the few institutions whose capital levels greatly exceed all three of the Government's new minimum tests for financial strength, Golden West has options closed to most institutions. Chief among them is the ability to grow. **********Many analysts think the company's next big move will be in Florida, where it holds an option to acquire Beach Federal Savings, a failed institution in Boynton Beach owned by the Government. **********But whatever Golden West does - and however it chooses to adapt to growing competition from banks and to the always changing regulatory climate - as long as the Sandlers stay in charge, it is certain to remain conservative, even dull. ''We have a jewel of a company,'' Mrs. Sandler said, ''and we're not about to do anything to jeopardize it.'' **********THE SANDLERS, SIDE BY SIDE **********OAKLAND, Calif. **********It is not always easy for Herb and Marion Sandler to be husband and wife as well as co-chief executives. They will occasionally be at a dinner party or business gathering when the men and women drift into separate groups. ''The wives gather here and the gentlemen gather there, and I want to be over there where Herb is talking about business,'' Mrs. Sandler said. ''It can be a little awkward.'' **********But aside from that type of situation, the Sandlers say they have almost no problems working alongside each other. ''If we came at things differently all the time, it would be impossible, but that's true for any executives working closely together, not just husbands and wives,'' Mrs. Sandler said. After graduating from City College of New York and Columbia University Law School, Mr. Sandler became a lawyer and represented a number of savings institutions. Mrs. Sandler, after graduating from Harvard and New York University's business school, worked as a securities analyst, following the stocks of savings and loan companies. After their marriage, in 1961, they talked constantly about how they were unimpressed by the quality of the management running most savings institutions. Finally, deciding to see if they could do better, they moved to the West Coast from New York to scout small savings institutions that might be takeover candidates. In 1963, they made a deal for Golden West. **********Today, they work in adjacent offices and are in and out of meetings together all day. And although it's clear that they run the company, they stress repeatedly how much they rely on the two other members of their office of the chairman - James T. Judd, 51 years old, and Russell W. Kettell, 46, both senior executive vice presidents. ''This isn't the Herb and Marion show,'' Mr. Sandler said. Although they are not planning on retiring any time soon, the Sandlers have a succession plan in place, in case of the unexpected. Mr. Judd and Mr. Kettell are at the top of the list. ''We call it the Mack Truck question,'' Mr. Sandler said. ''We all have backups ready to go in case something happens. The idea of somebody being indispensable is anathema to corporate governance.'' **********THE SEATTLE STAR **********When listing the nation's best-managed savings institutions, analysts usually mention a handful of other large California-based companies in addition to Golden West, including the Great Western Financial Corporation of Beverly Hills and H. F. Ahmanson & Company of Los Angeles. **********But there are also small, little-known institutions like the Washington Federal Savings and Loan Association of Seattle - ''arguably the stellar performer - pound for pound, inch for inch - of the nation's savings institution industry,'' according to Eric I. Hemel, an analyst at the First Boston Corporation. **********Washington Federal has $2.6 billion in assets and 65 branches in Washington, Oregon and Idaho. It is perhaps the strongest company in the industry as measured by its capital reserves. **********Unlike most other institutions, Washington Federal continues to make mostly fixed-rate instead of adjustable-rate mortgages. Fixed-rate mortgages can be riskier than adjustables for savings institutions because they become less profitable if interest rates rise. **********Elliot Knutson, Washington Federal's chairman, said he has never been worried. ''We've been profitable every month for 30 years,'' he said. ''If you keep your costs low enough and your people are good enough and your capitalization is strong enough, you can keep the risks low.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/25/business/briefs-696490.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 314, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Aztec Manufacturing Co., Crowley, Tex., a maker of machine tools, oil tubing and drilling equipment, said it was negotiating to purchase Calvert Co., Jackson, Miss., a maker of bus ducts, which convey electrical current. *********** Continental A.G., Hanover, West Germany, a tire company, said it had rejected a proposal from Pirelli Tire Holding N.V., a tire company, to merge the two companies. *********** Delaware North Companies, Buffalo, an international holding company, said it had sold Dairy Farm Catering Group, its Hong Kong-based inflight general catering subsidiaries, to LSG Lufthansa Service, part of Lufthansa German Airlines, for $80 million. *********** Fiat S.p.A., Turin, Italy, the auto maker, said talks on a possible cooperative venture with Chrysler Corp. would have to be completed soon.

Should multinational companies like Caterpillar be required to disclose their profits from individual countries if one or more of them is contributing disproportionately to the profits? Do Wall Street analysts - supposed to be the eyes and ears of investors - often make naive assumptions about a company's operations? **********These questions arose from a briefing for analysts on June 25 that was called by Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment. When the company announced before the session that its Brazilian operations had sunk into a deep slump because of economic changes in that country, the company's stock dropped only slightly. **********Stock Plunges **********But later that day, Caterpillar informed analysts in a telephone conference call just how important its Brazil operations are - they provided 20 percent of 1989 profits. In large part because of the circumstances in Brazil, Caterpillar told analysts that earnings in its second quarter, ended June 30, would be ''less than half'' the $99 million it earned in the first quarter and that profits for the year would be ''substantially lower'' than 1989 results. **********Caterpillar's stock, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, went into an immediate free fall, dropping to $52 over two days, from $63, or by more than $1 billion. Analysts, after all, had assumed in their earnings estimates that the Brazil operations were relatively unimportant, since they had generated only 5 percent of Caterpillar's 1989 revenues. **********Some experts in financial analysis say the assumptions demonstrate how naive the investment community can be. But analysts accuse the company of failing to disclose on a timely basis the critical importance of Brazil. They say that Caterpillar had allowed them to disseminate optimistic earnings estimates even though its executives knew the estimates were based on a false assumption. **********The analysts contend that some investors would not have suffered such losses had Caterpillar been forthcoming earlier. Between March 16, when the Brazilian economic package was announced, and June 25, when the company disclosed the importance of Brazil to its overall profit picture, Caterpillar's market value rose by roughly $700 million. **********''The whole concept of what Cat has been earning and the quality of those earnings has been brought into question by the disclosure about Brazil,'' said Alex Blanton, an analyst who follows the company at Merrill Lynch. **********Tobias Levkovich of Smith Barney said: ''People are angry because they lost a lot of money on the stock. . But there is clearly now a credibility problem at Cat.'' **********Caterpillar executives say they were merely following company policy of not disclosing profits from individual countries for competitive reasons. They say Caterpillar never comments on the accuracy of analysts' reports, no matter how far off the mark. They say they decided to abandon those rules only when it became clear that Brazil's economic package would have a major effect, well beyond what the company itself had anticipated. ''As soon as we saw it was going to have a profound impact, we went to the marketplace with it,'' said Len A. Kuchan, head of investor relations at Caterpillar. **********In fact, a number of companies, including Citicorp, Sears, Roebuck and Parker Hannifin, the heavy machinery company, do not comment on analysts' forecasts as a matter of policy. These companies prefer to release information at formal analysts' meetings or in connection with earnings announcements. **********Under accounting rules, companies must break out the assets or revenues from operations in a particular country only if they exceed 10 percent of total revenues or assets. Companies are not required under securities laws to help analysts or to correct misinformation being circulated by investment professionals. **********''A company is free to adopt a policy of not comenting on any analyst report,'' said Richard Phillips, a Washington lawyer who is an authority on disclosure. **********But what companies clearly may not do is create misimpressions. Experts said an argument might be made that in disclosing only sales but not profits or losses about its Brazilian operations Caterpillar had set the stage for analysts to err. **********''The importance of Brazil to earnings should have been highlighted in the company's annual report, or Cat should have issued a special news release,'' said Edward D. Hurlihy, a securities law expert at the New York law firm of Wachtel, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. ''There is a real question in my mind as to whether they were derelict in their disclosure.'' **********Some investor-relations professionals suggest that Caterpillar should have disclosed the information earlier in the game anyway. ''If you want analysts to be comfortable with your company, you will keep them informed,'' said Lou Thompson, president of the National Investor Relations Institute, a Washington trade group. **********Caterpillar's June 25 announcement, no doubt, took analysts by surprise. Many of them rushed to cut their earnings estimates. Merrill Lynch, which had forecast that the company would earn $5.25 a share this year, has lowered the projection to $2.50. The First Boston Corporation had predicted that Caterpillar would earn $4.50 a share; now it sees $2.25. Oppenheimer & Company cut its earnings estimate to $2 from $4, and Morgan Stanley, to $2.50 from $4.25. **********A good part of the reductions in these estimates could be attributed to Caterpillar's Brazilian troubles. But the company is also hurting from the strength of the dollar against the yen, which has enabled a major competitor, Komatsu of Japan, to hold down price increases because it bills customers in dollars. Caterpillar is also feeling the effects of the slowdown in construction spending. **********As a result, some people think analysts' estimates on Caterpillar's earnings should have been closer to reality than they were. **********''People stopped listening,'' said Eli S. Lustgarten, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. who placed a ''hold'' recommendation on Caterpillar shares several months ago. ''They were afraid of missing a big run-up in the stock.'' **********Some analysts say this is not the first time the company has permitted them to stray far from the mark only to be told the true situation at the last minute. In the fall of 1988, for instance, analysts circulated reports saying that Caterpillar would enjoy double-digit increases in earnings per share in 1989. The company said nothing to dispute those reports. In the following January, Caterpillar said it expected earnings to be flat. **********''It kicked the stock from $66 to $60 before you could blink an eye,'' said Karen A. Ubelhart, the Caterpillar analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ''That's why you can get blown away by Cat - because they don't give you much help.'' **********Having taken a fall, is Caterpillar's stock, which rose $1, to $53.375, on the New York Stock Exchange today, now a good buy? **********Mr. Lustgarten of Paine Webber said that over the next few quarters, cash invested in Caterpillar is ''dead money.'' He worries that the company could give more details of its trouble at a meeting with analysts later this month, sending the stock lower. In the past, he noted, Caterpillar stock has typically bottomed out at the company's book value per share - the excess of assets over liabilities. Recently, that has been $45. **********''Given that declines in volume are just now being announced, it is too early to buy the stock,'' Mr. Lustgarten said. **********But a number of other analysts say that Caterpillar is a good bet for long-term investors. At McDonald & Company, a Cleveland-based securities firm, Patrick E. Sheridan said that Caterpillar had nearly a 50 percent share of the construction equipment market and was an acknowledged leader in quality. He predicts that the company's stock will climb to $70 in the next few years. **********''A friend of mine, a New York analyst, says this company is going to win and that it's just a question of when,'' Mr. Sheridan said. ''I couldn't have said it better.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/11/business/after-the-run-of-rich-deals-risk-in-arbitrage-is-back.html": {"writer_name": "Leslie Wayne", "pub_date": "1990-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1872, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "After the Run of Rich Deals, Risk in Arbitrage is Back", "print_headline": "After the Run of Rich Deals, Risk in Arbitrage is Back", "body_text": " **********At a time when a shaky ''junk bond'' market and a paucity of takeover deals have sent many Wall Street arbitragers to the sidelines, a few stalwarts are still hanging in. In fact, they contend that the current bloodbath in takeover stocks should not be cause for concern. Rather, they say, it should be seen as just another business opportunity. **********''A lot of people are nervous and think the world is coming to an end,'' said one veteran arbitrager, who declined to be named. ''But right now, the business is terrific for a firm that is well positioned and really does its homework. It will make money.'' **********To be sure, that's a decidedly contrarian viewpoint among Wall Street's arbitragers, a secretive, tightknit band of investors who buy stocks in takeover deals. Wall Street at large has the jitters, but arbitragers have been stung in particular by the failure last October of the proposed buyout of the UAL Corporation. This has left some with multimillion-dollar losses and even more with a fear of dipping into the market too aggressively. **********In the last few months, many arbitragers have been ''cleaned out of the marketplace,'' said Guy Wyser-Pratte, head of arbitrage at Prudential-Bache Securities. Other traditional players, like Salomon Brothers; Smith Barney; Prescott, Ball & Turben, and even Mr. Wyser-Pratte, have scaled back considerably. **********Still, some arbitragers, largely independent operators, say there is money to be made where others fear to tread. They say that spreads between takeover bids and the underlying shares are the widest in years. The key is to pick the right deals from the few around and to have enough nerve to stay the course. **********''People have gotten beat up and discouraged and tired,'' said Richard Nye of Baker, Nye, a private New York investment firm. To Mr. Nye, this represents a ''moment of great opportunity.'' Even though Mr. Nye said that his firm has scaled back, he insists that, ''on a selective basis, there are some very attractive opportunities.'' **********Arbitragers make money by betting on the outcome of takeovers, restructurings, leveraged buyouts and bankruptcies. They buy massive amounts of stock in hopes of cashing in when the deal is consummated. The returns can be enormous; but the losses can be equally staggering if the deal collapses. **********Arbitrage is generally portrayed as high-risk, but veterans say they are really quite conservative at heart - their investments are based on intense research and a keen eye for potential losses. In fact, today's environment, veteran arbitragers say, is what highlights the risk in risk arbitrage, something, they say, that many new entrants into the business lost sight of in the heady days of takeovers and buyouts in the late 1980's. **********That point was brutally driven home by the fiasco at UAL, the parent of United Airlines. **********In that deal, a $300-a-share bid by the pilots' union and top management triggered a high-wire drama that ended when lenders balked at providing funds for the highly leveraged transaction. The company's unions are putting together another buyout proposal, but no formal bid has been made and none is imminently expected. **********Several big investors have been left with huge potential losses. Coniston Partners, for example, which bought 11.8 percent of the company for an average disclosed price of $161 a share, is facing paper losses of more than $60 million. Last Friday, UAL stock closed at $136.50 a share. **********If that didn't scare many away - or wipe them out - the takeover news since then has only continued to be bad. The virtual collapse of the market for high-risk, high-yield junk bonds - the primary source of financing for speculative takeovers and buyouts - as well as a sharp contraction in takeover lending by commercial banks have pretty much brought activity to a halt. **********And the failure of such celebrated takeovers as the acquisition of the Federated and Allied retail store groups by Canadian investor Robert Campeau and the sour publicity surrounding megadeals like the RJR Nabisco buyout have only increased the concern over such deals - and decreased their numbers. **********Even some of the few deals around - ones that would be considered small potatoes in days gone by - have met with sad demises. A proposed $367 million, $30-a-share takeover of the Birmingham Steel Corporation by the Harbert Corporation was halted last month when financing could not be arranged. The stock closed last Friday at $16.875. **********And a $24-a-share, $672 million acquisition of Philips Industries, a manufacturer based in Dayton, Ohio, has been halted because of financing problems. When the deal was first announced last September, Philips was to be acquired by a unit of Merrill Lynch & Company at $25.50 a share. But that buyout price was cut in November before the deal was halted last month. Last Friday, Philips closed at $15. **********''You are entering situations and they are just not panning out the way they would have a year ago,'' said Michael Greenberg, a senior vice president at Prescott, Ball. ''So that's why it's tough being an arb. You put money on the line in these transactions and they are not going through. You are not getting rewarded. The market is lousy.'' **********In such a market, the contrarians say, the task is to do enough research to know when to buy and whether to hold or sell. The current roster of takeover stocks has seen its shares drop considerably in value in the last few weeks. This has created nervousness and paper losses, but it could also produce tremendous gains for the gutsy arbitrager who has a cool head and bets right. **********''When you see panic and uncertainty, you will see spreads, and in a time of panic, these do not reflect reality,'' said Mr. Wyser-Pratte. Added one arbitrager who is currently buying takeover stocks: ''One of the reasons that takeover stocks are going down is because others are too frightened to buy them. This is what makes it a terrific business now.'' **********Arbitragers still in the market are looking at a handful of deals: *********** Following a hostile $58-a-share bid from the Georgia-Pacific Corporation last October, the stock of the Great Northern Nekoosa Corporation shot up about $20 a share, amid talk that the final price would be between $65 and $70 a share. Last week, Georgia-Pacific, which now is bidding $63 a share, won a major court victory that could end the long takeover fight. Great Northern's stock closed at $61.375 on Friday. *********** Last Thursday, management at Sea Containers Ltd. proposed a second $70-a-share recapitalization plan. The new plan was viewed as less attractive in some respects than the original, which was proposed last October in the face of a hostile bid. Sea Containers stock fell $3.75 on Thursday and Friday, closing the week at $62.875. *********** The shares of the Lin Broadcasting Corporation, which had traded as high as $130, closed Friday at $113.375. It appears that a planned sale of a majority stake to the McCaw Cellular Communications Corporation might have financing trouble. *********** And then there is the Hilton Hotels Corporation, which put itself up for sale last August and saw its stock rise to $115.50 a share. But no buyer has emerged. Hilton stock closed Friday at $61.75. **********With numbers like these, it is not surprising that so many traditional players have cut back their arbitrage activities to a shoestring operation - contrarians notwithstanding. Some firms, like the Blackstone Group, which had raised some $175 million for arbitrage, have even decided to leave the business. **********''It will be a good business to be in at some future period; the question is when,'' said Stephen Schwarzman, a Blackstone partner. **********Said Lewis L. Glucksman, vice chairman at Smith Barney: ''The smart money is waiting on the sidelines. We've got almost no exposure at this time. There have been so many busted deals all over the place that the smart money is waiting until deals don't bust so fast.'' **********The wait may be lengthy, given that concerns about a possible economic slowdown have not only dampened takeover activity even further but have also caused the stock market in general to be sluggish. **********''It's like a huge trend right now,'' said Mr. Greenberg at Prescott, Ball. ''The collapse of the junk-bond market is a repudiation of everything that happened in the last five years. The way it feels in your gut is like no deal can get done. And as each one of the deals out there doesn't get done, it makes arbs in the other deals more nervous.'' Despite this, still others feel arbitrage is not dead. ''A lot of these deals will work,'' one arbitrager said. ''The real business of arbitrage will go on forever. There will be good times and bad times. But there will always be situations, and the people who say that arbitrage is dead are ridiculous.'' **********FROM OBSCURITY TO EXCESS **********Until the 1980's, arbitrage was an arcane activity performed by a handful of firms, primarily L. F. Rothschild, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and Bear, Stearns. The business consisted of these firms cautiously investing their capital in announced takeover deals. **********As buyouts, takeovers and the bull market took hold in the mid-1980's, a band of individual arbitragers appeared on the scene. Perhaps the best known was Ivan Boesky, who was later brought down for insider trading. **********These new investors transformed the business by amassing large pools of money through limited partnerships that they formed with outside investors. What was once a money-making activity for Wall Street partners now was available to institutional investors and wealthy individuals. **********This new era also saw the risk of the business increase. Big bettors, like Mr. Boesky, would stun the arbitrage community by putting all their chips on one deal - forsaking the golden rule of diversification. Moreover, the investment pools frequently purchased stocks on margin. **********But a rising tide of takeover deals kept the business growing and the risk at bay. Money chased deals and there were plenty of deals to chase. The growth of the ''junk bond'' market over the same time fueled a speculative takeover and buyout boom that provided endless opportunity for arbitragers. Not surprisingly, more people set themselves up as arbitragers, and more money poured into the business. **********But as the 1990's begin, Mr. Boesky, who ultimately went to prison for his illegal activities, is a shameful symbol of Wall Street's excesses and the junk-bond market is in shambles. **********The collapse of the UAL deal and the problems at the Campeau Corporation may well bring arbitrage back to its conservative roots."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/11/business/business-people-concurrent-computer-appoints-top-officers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-09-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 270, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Concurrent Computer Appoints Top Officers", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   Concurrent Computer Appoints Top Officers", "body_text": " **********Mr. Brown said the company's substantial losses in recent quarters mask its strengths.

That would provide the other investors with better prices than they might have gotten otherwise and help to control volatility in the period that became known as the ''triple witching hour,'' because of the expiration of stock options, stock index options and stock index futures. **********The policy changes were supposed to take advantage of the nature of index arbitrage. When futures contracts are trading for less than their fair value, as can happen, traders can buy the contract and, more or less simultaneously, sell the underlying stocks. That strategy is easy with the Major Market Index, which is based on only 20 stocks. When the contracts expire, they are sure to be worth exactly the same as the underlying index, and traders simply buy back the stocks at the close of trading. In doing so, they get the prices that determine the value of the expiring contracts. **********Late last week, the rumor was that there would be heavy buying as a result of the Major Market Index expiration. Sure enough, the announced imbalances showed big buy orders. But even as they were being reported, prices started to fall. Anyone who put in sell orders to offset the imbalances wound up getting prices far lower than expected. **********What happened? One rumor is that there were games being played, and that some ''buy on close'' orders were suddenly withdrawn. It is legal to withdraw an order, unless it is for the purpose of market manipulation, and the New York Stock Exchange says it is studying the trading. **********Another explanation says that the buy imbalances, while large, were simply not so big as many had expected. When traders saw that development, they expected prices to fall and began to sell stock index futures and options based on other contracts, notably the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures, which did not expire this month. As the selling grew in Chicago, waves of index arbitrage selling hit the New York market, which was ill prepared for it. **********An aggravating factor may have been the fact that all this action was happening late on a summer Friday afternoon, after many money managers and traders had packed up and left for the weekend. The last hour on Friday is one of the lowest for liquidity. **********The Big Board has tried to solve that problem by having index option and futures expirations based on opening rather than closing prices. The argument is that with more traders at their desks, and with more time to sort out imbalances, volatility can be restrained much more effectively. **********But while officials in charge of the S.&P. 500 futures contract, which is traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, have gone along, the Major Market Index contract continues to expire at the close. The Chicago Board of Trade, where the futures contracts are traded, and the American Stock Exchange, which handles the options, have contended there is no evidence that a change is needed. Friday's experience may renew the pressure for such a change. **********If preliminary inquiries, already under way, come up with suspicious trading practices that warrant full-scale investigations, it will be interesting to see how they proceed. Any such investigation would look at futures trading, which is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as well as stock and option trading, which are under the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********At the moment, suspicions between the securities and futures industries are as high as they have ever been, as the S.E.C. and the Bush Administration are pushing Congress to transfer the stock-index futures authority to the S.E.C. **********After the Oct. 13, 1989, fall of 190 points in the Dow, an S.E.C. report was much more critical of futures traders than was a study by the futures commission. In both industries, there is a belief that those reports showed that the other industry's regulator was prejudiced about futures trading. For them to cooperate now will not be easy, but it may be necessary."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/07/world/upheaval-in-the-east-east-germany-berlin-communist-urges-troop-cuts.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1990-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1044, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: East Germany;   Berlin Communist Urges Troop Cuts", "print_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: East Germany;   Berlin Communist Urges Troop Cuts", "body_text": " **********The head of East Germany's Communist Party proposed today that all NATO and Warsaw Pact forces quit both Germanys within a decade, adding spice to an already bitter political struggle shaping in East Germany. **********The proposal by Gregor Gysi, the new party chief, was not likely to become Government policy or be accepted by NATO or the Warsaw Pact any time soon. But as a political ploy it played directly into a conflict between the Communists and the opposition that has soured East Germany's euphoric march toward democracy. **********According to A.D.N., the East German press agency, Mr. Gysi proposed at a party meeting that all allied troops leave by 1999 and that both Germanys cut their armies in half within a year. **********''Without an end to military rivalry between the two German states, any talk of the unity of the nation is not credible,'' Mr. Gysi said in introducing a program he dubbed ''Security 2000.'' **********Aggressive New Campaign **********Mr. Gysi is not in the Government, and the Communists may lose control of the Government when free elections are held May 6. But diplomats saw the proposal as an effort to position the Communists as champions of disarmament and national unity as part of an aggressive new campaign by the party to revive its fallen fortunes. **********According to a recent public-opinion poll conducted by sociologists from the East German Academy for Social Sciences, support for the Communists has grown to 34 percent, far more than that of any opposition party. The accuracy of the poll could not be checked, but the newly active Communists have alarmed both the opposition and the West German Government. **********Over the past week, East German opposition groups have accused the Communists of manipulating their control of the Government and the press to gain unfair advantage, and of trying to reconstruct the security apparatus, using purported neo-fascist incidents to justify doing so. **********The incidents, including anti-Soviet slogans painted on Soviet war memorials, were given extensive publicity in the East German press, and the Communists held a mass anti-fascist protest on Wednesday. But many in the opposition charged that the government had deliberately sensationalized the incidents to foment fear in the population and strengthen the Communists' hand. **********Fears of New Security Forces **********At the Wednesday session of ''round table'' talks between the Communists and eight opposition groups, the opposition angrily contended that the Government had begun to construct a new security agency in place of the despised State Security apparatus and demanded a full report by Monday. **********Bonn has joined the opposition in accusing the Communists of denying the fledgling political parties equal access to important offices and the press. A West German Government spokesman, Norbert Schafer, said Friday that all parties had to be able to compete in the May elections on equal terms. ''According to our observations, this does not exist at the moment,'' he said. **********Mr. Gysi rejected the criticism in an interview with West German television, and the East Berlin Government said it would supply the opposition with cars, office space, paper and printing, and access to radio and newspapers. **********The East German Communists, for their part, have accused the opposition parties of miring the discussions in procedural disputes. At the stormy session of the ''round table'' talks last week, the head of the caretaker government, Prime Minister Hans Modrow, threatened to cancel the elections unless the opposition quit its bickering. **********Failure by the Opposition **********According to diplomats and experts in Bonn, the state of affairs in East Berlin reflects in part a failure by the East German opposition to assert leadership over the popular movement that drove out the Communist old guard and compelled the party to grant extraordinary concessions. **********Unlike the opposition in Czechoslovakia, which rallied behind the dissident playwright Vaclav Havel and the Civic Forum to secure a majority voice in the caretaker government, the opposition in East Germany has remained fragmented and without a nationally recognized leadership. **********New Forum, the coalition of dissidents and intellectuals that gained considerable exposure abroad in the first weeks of the East German revolution, has failed to evolve into a political force. This weekend, leaders of New Forum are finally meeting to decide whether to become a political party. In the meantime, the East German poll week found that support for the movement had slipped to 5.8 percent, from 9 percent. **********The only non-Communist party to make sizable gains was the East German Christian Democratic Union, which saw its support rise to to 7.9 percent. from 1.7 percent, probably because it shares a name and has the support of the party of the West German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl. **********Rallying the Communist Forces **********At the same time, the Communist Party appears to have rallied its forces. The press agency A.D.N. today reported that the party still had 1.4 million members, down from 2.3 million when it was master of the country but far more than any opposition group. Of the largest, New Forum has claimed about 200,000 supporters and the East German Christian Democrats about 140,000 members. **********The opposition's accusations seemed to sour the mood that had prevailed through the end of 1989, when West German and foreign leaders flocked to meet with the new East German leaders and the opening of the Brandenburg Gate seemed to symbolize a reunion that was leading toward at least a confederation. **********Some politicians in Bonn and East Berlin now assert that Mr. Kohl and the other leaders who visited East Germany only encouraged the East German Communists. **********Konrad Weiss, a member of Democracy Now, the East German opposition group, wrote in an open letter to Mr. Kohl that ''you have clearly favored the Communists and their representatives while neglecting opposition groups.'' **********'Democratic Fig Leaf' **********Annemarie Renger, a deputy speaker of the West German Parliament from the Social Democratic Party, charged that the ''round table'' talks were becoming ''a democratic fig leaf for the Communist Party.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/01/business/prosecution-brief-accuses-milken.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1990-11-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 579, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prosecution Brief Accuses Milken", "print_headline": "Prosecution Brief Accuses Milken", "body_text": " **********Government prosecutors argued in a memorandum released yesterday that the pre-sentencing hearing of Michael R.

Wood, who ordered that certain references to crimes involving other individuals be deleted. **********Judge Wood ordered the hearing to determine whether the crimes of Mr. Milken, the former head of the high-yield \"junk bond\" division of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., were part of a broader criminal conspiracy, as the Government says, or were individual instances of going too far to help a client, as the defense contends. **********The Government chose three transactions to demonstrate that Mr. Milken committed more crimes than those he admitted. The first involved a 1986 manipulation of shares of the Wickes Companies, in what the Government contends was an effort by Mr. Milken to push the stock price up to allow Wickes to redeem an expensive preferred security. **********In their memorandum, the prosecutors noted the testimony of Peter Gardiner, a former Drexel employee, who said Mr. Milken had ordered him to manipulate the stock of Wickes when the former financier pointed to a machine that listed stock prices and said \"Peter. Wickes. Six and an eighth.\"  Boesky Ties Cited **********The Government says the manipulation, which was done through the trading firm of Ivan F. Boesky, the fallen arbitrager, could only have been done by Mr. Milken. At that time, \"Milken, alone in the high-yield department, had the authority to use the Boesky organization for illegal purposes.\" **********In the second transaction, the 1985 buyout of Storer Communications Inc. by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, prosecutors contended in their memorandum that they had proved that Mr. Milken misappropriated an equity stake from the deal and had improperly given money managers an interest in it. **********\"Milken himself deliberately deceived K.K.R. concerning the allocation of the equity,\" the Government document says. **********The document also says thatproviding money managers an interest in MacPherson Partners, a partnership that held the Storer equity, \"violated numerous Federal criminal provisions.\"  Caesars World Bonds **********In the last transaction, the Government contended Mr. Milken engaged in insider trading in the bonds of Caesars World Inc. The Government document restated the argument that Mr. Milken learned in June 1983 that the company planned to swap debt for equity. **********Perhaps the most damaging information came regarding a phone call Mr. Milken had with Prescott Crocker, an institutional investor who sold Caesars World bonds and accused the firm of insider trading. Mr. Crocker testified that Mr. Milken offered to engage in illegal trading to make up the losses and told him that he knew nothing of the debt exchange, a contention the Government says is a lie. **********\"Milken's conversations with Crocker are powerful evidence of his guilt,\" the memorandum says."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/25/business/business-and-the-law-bankruptcy-work-is-getting-respect.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Labaton", "pub_date": "1990-06-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 806, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business and the Law;   Bankruptcy Work Is Getting Respect", "print_headline": "Business and the Law;   Bankruptcy Work Is Getting Respect", "body_text": " **********FOR decades, the largest and most established law firms in the nation avoided bankruptcy work because it was disdained by highbrow partners as lower than divorce and criminal law and too distasteful for their practices. That attitude has changed. **********The bankruptcy specialty has replaced mergers and acquisitions as the hot area of the law in the 1990's. **********When big firms had clients who needed advice on bankruptcy law, the matter was usually referred to boutique outfits with bankruptcy specialists. These smaller firms posed no threat of stealing the client because as specialists they were limited to the arcane provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. **********The firm nationally regarded as the top bankruptcy boutique has been Manhattan-based Levin & Weintraub, Crames & Edelman. Its 14 lawyers, led by Michael J. Crames, have been beneficiaries of the referral system. They have found themselves in pivotal roles in many high-profile bankruptcies, including those of Texaco, Revco and Eastern Airlines. **********And one large firm that had continually refused to expand its own bankruptcy practice was Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler, even though many of the New York firm's largest clients were banks and other financial institutions. **********Now, Levin & Weintraub and Kaye, Scholer have decided to merge. The two firms announced Friday that they will become one on July 1. **********The merger reflects the growing pressure on large firms to establish bankruptcy specialties, as well as the recognition by boutiques that they can no longer survive without the resources of large firms. **********For Levin & Weintraub, which had coveted its independence and had spurned other offers over the years, the move came after significant defections by lawyers who were lured to larger practices last year. Myron Trepper, one of Levin & Weintraub's partners, left with two other valued lawyers to bolster the bankruptcy practice of another large firm, Willkie, Farr & Gallagher. Integrated Resources was among the clients the partners took with them. **********Mr. Crames, whose bread and butter had been referrals from the large firms, began to see that many of those firms had decided to keep bankruptcy cases for themselves. **********Davis, Polk & Wardwell, for instance, which had shared its LTV and Manville clients with Mr. Crames when it came to Chapter 11 filings, recently decided that it would be better off keeping future bankruptcy business for itself. **********''Times had changed,'' Mr. Crames said in an interview on Friday. ''As Jimmy Durante used to say, everyone wants to get into the act.'' **********For its part, Kaye, Scholer decided it was time to shed its attitude of bankruptcy as a stained collar practice. While it had two partners and six associates working in the area, the view of the 375-lawyer firm toward bankruptcy had never been strong. **********''Kaye, Scholer never had a major bankruptcy practice because it was frowned upon as being second-rate, like ambulance chasing,'' said a partner at the firm who asked that he not be identified. ''This merger is a clear recognition that while bankruptcy was once viewed as unbecoming, money talks. We need these people.'' **********Nonetheless, partners at the firm said there had been a vocal minority at Kaye, Scholer who objected to the acquisition, arguing that it could create conflicts of interest and might not be worth the potential extra expense. **********Lawyers from the two firms are in the midst of conducting a check to see whether any of their clients are in conflict with one another. **********In the meantime, other bankruptcy lawyers see the new combination as a strong symbol of the changing times and predict that the new entity will be formidable. **********''The age of boutiques, for all practical purposes, is over,'' said Harvey R. Miller, Mr. Crames's adversary in scores of big and little proceedings over many years. Mr. Miller, the partner at Weil, Gotshal & Manges who heads the nation's largest bankruptcy practice, said the move would probably lead to even fewer referrals to Mr. Crames by other firms in direct competition with Kaye, Scholer. **********But that probably will not hurt Mr. Crames's practice, said Joel B. Zweibel, a bankruptcy specialist who once worked at Kaye, Scholer and who recently joined O'Melveny & Myers. **********''He has an excellent name and a significant share of the market,'' Mr. Zweibel said.

The study group will also include Deutsche Airbus, West Germany's leading builder of airliners and a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz. $10 Billion to Develop the Plane British Aerospace and Aerospatiale have estimated that it could cost $10 billion to develop the plane.

Boeing even started building a prototype during the late 1960's, but abandoned it, largely because of concern about the noise it would make on takeoff and the sonic boom that would reverberate to earth when the plane passed overhead at speeds greater than the speed of sound, roughly 750 miles an hour. **********Analysts say it remains unclear whether any supersonic airliner can be commercially viable. The Concorde cost $2 billion to develop and required heavy subsidies from the British and French governments. The manufacturers hoped to sell hundreds of the plane, but ended up selling only 14, seven to British Airways and seven to Air France. **********Commercial supersonic flight has always been hampered by a variety of environmental and economic concerns. Because of the sonic boom, the Concorde's routes have been largely limited to those that take it primarily over the Atlantic Ocean. Environmentalists say the release of combustion gases from supersonic engines can harm the ozone layer.

But they nevertheless see a parallel between the emerging situation in South Africa and the move from white colonial rule to black majority rule in several black African countries, particularly Kenya. **********Like Mr. Mandela, Kenya's first President at independence, Jomo Kenyatta, had been put in jail by the ruling whites. And as with Mr. Mandela, a group of more mainstream whites began to talk to Mr. Kenyatta while he was still locked up. **********''I took the view, unlike most of the settlers, that 10 percent of the population could not lead in perpetuity without the backing of the British Government and the rest of the population,'' said Peter Marrian, one of the three prominent white politicians who visited Mr. Kenyatta in jail and saw him as the future leader. **********Mr. Kenyatta was convicted in 1952 by a colonial court on charges of managing the Mau Mau rebellion against the settlers. He remained in detention for 10 years, the last several in a Government house. ''There was no doubt his trial was not fair,'' said Mr. Marrian, now a stockbroker in Nairobi and an officer of the colonial-era Muthaiga Club. ''I met several people afterwards, including top Kenyan policemen, who said he should not have been convicted.'' **********'He Was Just Like Mandela' **********The year before Mr. Kenyatta's release, Mr. Marrian, known among African politicians as the white who had dared to run on the platform that the ''sanctity of the white highlands is bunk,'' was invited by one of them to visit Mr. Kenyatta. **********''I spent three hours with him alone,'' Mr. Marrian said. ''Everything he told me came to pass. He said to me, 'People say Kenyatta wants to push the Europeans into the sea.' He made it clear that if they stayed and accepted the fact of an African government, then they were welcome to stay.'' **********On the day of Mr. Kenyatta's release, Petal Allen, the daughter of another mainstream white politician, recalls the African coming to her father's house for an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation. **********''He was just like Mandela, so magnaminous,'' said Mrs. Allen, a well-known liberal member of the white community here. ''He said, 'We don't want the whites to be frightened.' '' **********Social Pariah Among Whites **********A little later, Mr. Kenyatta addressed a meeting of the farmer's union, the bastion of white landowners, whom Mr. Marrian said had all sworn they would leave Kenya the day Mr. Kenyatta came out of jail. ''Two things happened after he spoke,'' Mr. Marrian said. ''He got a standing ovation and the second was, they said, 'The day he dies, we leave Kenya.' '' **********Mr. Marrian, who became a minister in Mr. Kenyatta's Government, said his pre-independence advocacy for Mr. Kenyatta and that of his two colleagues, Sir Derek Erskine and Bruce McKenzie, made them pariahs among whites. ''I could empty the bar at Muthaiga by walking into it,'' he said. **********After independence in 1963, white landowners were compensated by the British Government in British pounds for their land. ''There was vast transfer of land from white ownership to black with very little trouble,'' Mr. Marrian said. **********While the talks with Mr. Kenyatta in jail bear some resemblance to the dialogue that went on with Mr. Mandela, and both black leaders carried messages of conciliation to the whites on their release, the similarities probably stop there, Mr. Marrian said. ''All told, there were about 70,000 whites at the time in Kenya. In South Africa, you have four million. It's a different ball game.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/19/business/next-inc-returns-to-center-stage.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1990-09-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1244, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Next Inc.

Jobs returned to the stage at this city's symphony hall today, hoping to rekindle the sense of anticipation his computer company, Next Inc., had when it introduced its first product in the same place two years ago. **********The announcement of four new computers did not have quite the sizzle of the previous introduction, which was the Silicon Valley equivalent of opening night at the opera. But there is general agreement that there was more steak this time, and that the new machines will do better than the original one, a hulking black cube that was criticized as slow and overpriced and that had only lackluster sales. **********Orders Already Taken **********Indeed, Mr. Jobs, the evangelical boy wonder of the personal computer industry who is only slightly more subdued at 35 years old, announced that Next has already received orders for 15,000 of the new machines. That is thought to be at least 50 percent higher than the number of machines sold by the company so far. **********The new machines remedy many of the shortcomings of the first model. They are faster, because all of them use the latest Motorola 68040 microprocessor and because the innovative but slow optical disk has been replaced by a more conventional but speedier hard magnetic disk. They are cheaper, with the least expensive model selling for $5,000, half the price of the old machine. **********Two of the new models can display color images, whereas the first machine could display only black and white. And there are several more of what Mr. Jobs called ''best of breed'' software packages available for the machine from leading vendors, including the Lotus Development Corporation, Ashton-Tate Corporation and the Wordperfect Corporation. **********Analysts and industry executives say Next now has a good shot at becoming successful and profitable. Executives of Next, based in Redwood City, Calif., hope the company will become profitable by early next year. **********However, it might be too late for Mr. Jobs to realize his ambition of duplicating the success he had as the founder of Apple Computer Inc., of producing a computer that becomes a class unto itself, fundamentally changing the industry as did the personal computers from Apple and International Business Machines and the work stations from Sun Microsystems Inc. **********''I just don't believe that coming in late with these new products he has the opportunity to become the next PC for everybody,'' said Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies Research International, a market research firm. **********A Surge of Competitors **********In the two years it has taken Next to iron out bugs, competitors including Sun, Apple, I.B.M. and the Compaq Computer Corporation have filled millions of desks that might once have welcomed a Next machine. And while Next has eliminated many of the obvious shortcomings of its first computer, it is still unclear whether the machine offers enough unique features to draw buyers to it. **********Competitors can also leapfrog Next in the coming year. In addition, the favorable reviews the products received today could fade upon closer analysis, as happened two years ago. Indeed, it is often said in the computer business that Mr. Jobs generates a ''reality distortion field'' that makes people see things his way, at least while they are in his presence. **********Another company with Next's record might have been out of business by now. But Next officials say they have enough cash on hand to exist for at least another year even without another sale. That is because the company received a $100 million investment from Canon, the Japanese office equipment and camera manufacturer, and tens of millions of dollars from I.B.M., which promises eventually to offer Next's basic software as an option for its computer work stations. **********Still, this is widely viewed as the last chance for Next, which was founded in 1985, when Mr. Jobs left Apple after losing a power struggle with Apple's chief executive, John Sculley. **********Mr. Jobs now concedes that the company has not fared as well as he had hoped, something he long declined to admit. ''Introducing a new platform is like pushing a boulder uphill,'' he said Monday night at a dinner for customers. But he quickly predicted the boulder was now finally ready to roll downhill. **********In a separate interview he said, ''I think our main challenge will be convincing people we're a viable competitor.'' He added: ''We're cautiously optimistic. We don't want to get carried away.'' **********This is quite humble talk for Mr. Jobs, who was once widely known for lambasting competitors as ''brain damaged.'' But Mr. Jobs has had to swallow a lot of pride in the last two years. In designing the new machines, he has caved in to pressure and given up on some unusual features of his first machine that some found odd but that Mr. Jobs had insisted users would want. **********''It looks like he wants to be successful more than he wants to be right,'' said Seymour Merrin, a consultant in Palo Alto, Calif. **********Next's New Look **********Gone, at least in two models, is the black cube, replaced by a much more svelte unit the size of pizza box upon which the monitor can rest. The optical disk drive is relegated to an option, and most of the machines will no longer contain the complete works of Shakespeare on disk. The new machines also contain floppy disk drives, so that software companies can finally distribute software on floppy disks. **********The new machines start with the Nextstation, a machine with a list price of $5,000 that includes a black and white screen and a 105-megabyte hard-disk drive and 8 megabytes of internal memory. A color version of the Nextstation will sell for $8,000. These machines have the new pizza-box shape. **********The Nextcube, which retains the original cube shape, will start at $8,000. It is meant for those who need more storage; it can be expanded to hold up to 2.8 billion characters of memory on hard disks. **********The upper end of the line is the Nextdimension, a color machine that will sell for $14,000. It will allow displays of images of near-photographic quality and will allow television pictures to be played in a window on the computer screen. **********The black-and-white machines will be available in November and the color ones in the first quarter of next year, the company said. **********To bolster its chances of winning corporate accounts, Next is beginning to sell directly to companies and is adding distributors that specialize in selling computers to particular industries. In the past, corporations could buy Next computers only through Businessland Inc., the retailer. **********What will make people buy Next machines? Next is relying on a new spreadsheet program called Improv written by Lotus for the company's machine. Improv allows users instantly to rearrange the presentation of their data in a way not possible with other spreadsheets. **********The company also hopes to win sales to companies that need to write their own programs, because the Next computers come with tools that help automate programming."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/27/business/media-business-advertising-addenda-air-france-account-to-tbwa-advertising.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-11-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 139, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Air France Account To TBWA Advertising", "print_headline": "MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Air France Account To TBWA Advertising", "body_text": " **********TBWA Advertising has created advertising for French water and cheese, and now it will try to sell French airline services to American consumers.

Baker 3d in West Berlin on Dec. 12 that called for ''a significantly strengthened set of institutional and consultative links'' between the United States and the European Community. **********''I'm not authorized to make a response for the E.C.,'' he said, ''but it's a British contribution to the debate, and I think it's a practical option.'' A European Community official in Brussels said the proposals would probably be received favorably by the organization's executive commission and member countries. Mr. Hurd said he would discuss them with President Bush, Mr. Baker and other American officials next week. **********Mr. Hurd proposed a series of regular and formal meetings between European Community foreign ministers and the United States Secretary of State beginning this summer to discuss ''our common Western response to the developments in the East.'' **********Hong Kong on Agenda **********He also proposed having meetings between the community's executive commissioners and members of the United States Cabinet twice a year instead of just once. Topics of discussion would be trade and the community's move toward a single European market by the end of 1992, with regular, frequent meetings and briefings by both sides at lower levels. **********Also on the British agenda in Washington will be Britain's wish to begin repatriating some of the 56,000 people from Vietnam who have sought asylum in the colony of Hong Kong. At an international conference in Geneva this week, the United States opposed Britain's desire to resume mandatory repatriation July 1. The United States held out, almost alone, for a one-year moratorium until the end of the year, and Vietnam wanted a delay until October in the repatriation, which began last month with a single flight of 51 men, women and children. **********''We have quite a large problem ahead of us this summer,'' Mr. Hurd said, ''which is when people come to Hong Kong by sea. The international community needs to recognize the possibility of quite a large emergency.'' **********British officials say that most of those arriving in Hong Kong do not qualify as refugees from political persecution and has placed them in guarded camps pending their return, voluntarily or involuntarily, to Vietnam. **********Legislation Planned **********Mr. Hurd was in Hong Kong earlier this week, also trying to encourage officials and business leaders of the colony to stay there rather than seek to emigrate before 1997, when Britain will turn back the territory to Communist China. **********The British Government plans to introduce legislation here to grant the right to live in Britain to 50,000 of Hong Kong's 3.5 million British passport holders and their families, hoping they will stay on there with a greater sense of security, but faces a revolt among Government supporters in Parliament who oppose any further immigration here. **********Mr. Hurd said he was encouraged by recent signs that the opposition Labor Party may break ranks in opposition to the measure because some of them fear accusations of racism from their constituents, and thus make its passage easier even if some Conservatives vote against it. **********''That particular struggle hasn't gone too badly,'' he said, but conceded that defeat of the bill, which is not expected to be introduced in the House of Commons before April, would be ''fairly disastrous.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/26/business/the-media-business-agents-fight-for-share-of-foreign-book-rights.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Cohen", "pub_date": "1990-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Agents Fight for Share Of Foreign Book Rights", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;   Agents Fight for Share Of Foreign Book Rights", "body_text": " **********Lynn Nesbit, a literary agent, is selling Tom Wolfe's next book around the world. Publishers in Europe have paid well in excess of $1 million for it. Yet, Ms. Nesbit said: ''It's not a book yet. It's not even an outline. In fact it's hardly even an idea.'' **********Another novel, ''Fade the Heat'' by Jay Brandon, has just been sold to publishers in 11 countries for almost four times the six-figure advance paid by Pocket Books in the United States. Virginia Barber, an agent, said the sales were made even though the book is not due out in the United States for six months. **********These days, even embryonic books have a market abroad. Indeed, the sale of foreign rights to American books - a sleepy backwater of publishing a decade ago - has become a fiercely competitive area. And as the stakes get higher, agents are doing battle with publishers in what Carol Janeway, director of foreign rights at Alfred A. Knopf Inc., called ''an incredibly fast, tough volleyball game.'' **********Publishers vs. Agents **********On one side of the net are publishers convinced that the industry is now global. They are armed with expensive, newly acquired foreign subsidiaries and are intent on recouping spiraling advances to authors by exploiting their books overseas. **********''If you're paying big advances, at least you want the whole pig so you can go out and make your banquet,'' said Roger W. Straus, chief executive of Farrar, Straus & Giroux. **********On the other side are agents like Ms. Nesbit and Ms. Barber, reluctant to surrender a book's world rights to publishers and convinced that they can serve their authors' interests best by selling these increasingly lucrative rights themselves. **********''We really have a terrible tug of war now with publishers,'' Ms. Barber said. Mr. Straus concurred. ''It's a battle,'' he said. **********Behind the struggle lies the growing value of foreign sales. ''A few years ago, if a publisher gave you $10,000 for world rights, you would give it away,'' said Robert Gottlieb, the representative of the William Morris Agency who recently sold Tom Clancy's ''Clear and Present Danger'' in Japan for $500,000. But now, foreign sales often represent as much as a third of the revenues for the rights to publish leading American authors like Mr. Clancy or James Michener, Mr. Gottlieb said. **********Some American books like ''Fade the Heat'' make half or even more of their rights revenues from overseas. **********The System Changes **********In the past when publishers bought a book by paying an advance to an author, they acquired world rights to it. Eventually, they sold these rights to foreign publishers, taking a 20 to 25 percent cut on each sale. The balance of the foreign revenue was applied against the author's advance. Only when it was paid off did foreign income flow to the author. **********Today, many agents say this system is outmoded. Lured by the size of foreign rights sales, they want to take the cut on each foreign sale themselves. They argue that in this way authors get foreign income directly before the advance is earned. ''We also cut a better deal in each country,'' said Michael Carlisle of the William Morris Agency. **********Such views irritate many publishers. Richard Snyder, chief executive of Simon & Schuster Inc., argued it was ''insane'' for publishers to give up world rights to their books. ''We absolutely must control foreign rights,'' he said. ''Agents think they have more control through slicing and dicing, but this will change. It is an area for negotiation where it really should not be.'' **********Publishers are increasingly owned by larger media conglomerates (Simon & Schuster, for example, is a subsidiary of Paramount Communications Inc.) and they want to be able to use excerpts from their books in their magazines and use the stories in movies. And the companies want to distribute their books abroad. **********''In our music business, we are able to market a star worldwide,'' said Bernard von Minckwitz, a member of the executive board of the West German media conglomerate Bertelsmann A.G. ''We try to do the same with books. But we are frustrated because we are not always able to get world rights.'' **********But this vision does not sway agents. Ms. Barber scoffs at the ''globalization'' argument. ''American houses may be only kissing cousins to their foreign subsidiary houses when it comes to ability to publish in the best way,'' she said. **********Agents are reinforcing their position by sending their representatives to the Frankfurt Book Fair, where many foreign rights deals are made. ''Every year, there are more U.S. agents in Frankfurt,'' said Maria Campbell, a scout who searches for American books for foreign houses like RCS Rizzoli and Macmillan London. She notes that her business has been booming recently. **********Sales of foreign rights are now split about 50-50 between publishers and agents. In practice, there is often a trade-off between publishers and agents. Some agents sell world rights because they do not want to handle the sales in individual countries. **********Sometimes, a deal is reached under which agents agree to channel earnings from foreign rights to the publisher until the advance, or some part of it, is paid off. **********'You Pay a Lot Less' **********As Alberto Vitale, chief executive officer of Random House, pointed out, ''If you don't get the world rights, or at least world English rights, you pay a lot less for the book.'' **********But Karl Otto Bonniers, vice president of Sweden's biggest publishing house, Albert Bonniers Forlag, suggested that the agents' involvement had caused prices of foreign rights to become inflated. ''People in the U.S. are often asking more money than is reasonable,'' he said. **********Mr. Bonniers expressed a slight preference for dealing with publishers rather than agents. ''Sometimes it is simply counterproductive when a book is hyped,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/17/world/india-s-embattled-leader-struggles-with-rising-violence-and-party-rivals.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1990-06-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1439, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "India's Embattled Leader Struggles With Rising Violence and Party Rivals", "print_headline": "India's Embattled Leader Struggles With Rising Violence and Party Rivals", "body_text": " **********For Prime Minister V. P. Singh, leading an alliance of diverse opposition parties to victory in national elections nearly seven months ago was the easy part. Consolidating his new Government's power over this fractious nation of 840 million people is proving to be much more difficult. **********Undermined by rivals in his Janata Dal organization and under pressure from powerful parties on the left and right whose support he needs to sustain his minority Government, Mr. Singh is also badgered and taunted daily by an out-of-office Congress Party apparently trying to obstruct the working of government at every level. **********Wavering alliances and opposition vitriol are constant features in Indian politics. But the dangers they pose to Mr. Singh are enlarged in the face of a growing Muslim insurgency in Kashmir, and a militant Sikh separatist campaign in Punjab. **********Mr. Singh came to power promising both areas speedy political resolutions of their conflicts. But in a response to rising violence, he has instead resorted to increased use of force, further alienating largely non-Hindu populations who are denied the right to elect their state governments and in many towns compelled to live under undeclared martial law. **********Establishing an Alternative **********The Janata Dal Government faces another crucial challenge. It has to establish itself as a real alternative to the Congress Party, which ruled India for most of the last four decades and from which many Janata Dal leaders come. The new party, rent with squabbles, has not concentrated on organization. **********Personally, the 58-year-old Prime Minister is in every way different from his rival, Rajiv Gandhi. While Mr. Gandhi, grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru and son of Indira Gandhi, moves with an entourage that is part political and part crony, Mr. Singh is a quiet loner who seems to enjoy befuddling audiences with Delphic answers or unexpected suggestions. **********In the last week, he has thrown off balance plotters who were talking of forming a national government without him by replying, ''Why not?'' Reams of newsprint have been sacrificed in the effort to plumb what he meant. **********One colleague says that although the Prime Minister consults often with colleagues, in the end he makes up his own decisions, sometimes wasting precious time along the way. **********Many politicians and commentators believe that despite his preoccupation with the violence in the northwest and the attendant tensions with Pakistan, which rise and fall from day to day, Mr. Singh will soon have to begin delivering on the election promises that raised the expectations of voters in November, especially pledges to expose official corruption, restore states' rights and strengthen local government, and free broadcasting from the rigid controls that have made it little more than a medium of propaganda. **********There has been little or no progress in any of these areas. **********''Six months have passed since the new Government has taken over, and right from the word 'go,' skepticism has been very much there,'' said L. K. Advani, leader of the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, which supports Mr. Singh from outside his National Front coalition. ''Will this Government last?'' **********''It's a live question,'' Mr. Advani told foreign correspondents. ''My own assessment is that the persistence of this question certainly impairs the credibility of the Government. But what is more important is, Will this Government be able to deliver the goods?'' **********Mr. Singh's preference for slow, methodical investigations through established institutions and procedures has annoyed some supporters who were convinced there would be speedy moves to prosecute some aides of Mr. Gandhi on allegations of corruption in the purchase of civil aircraft and military equipment. **********Social planners have been slow to offer bold ideas. Commissions and study groups are set up instead. Recently, the Planning Commission suggested a complete reorganization of the country's education system. The Prime Minister has also called for a new look at population control, and at large irrigation and power projects that threaten to dislocate hundreds of thousands of Indians. Framing these new policies will take time, putting them into practice even longer. **********Inflation and Debt Rising **********The national economy is heading toward a tough decade, Indian and foreign economists say. This week, the World Bank recommended a halt in the growth of government and the bureaucracy, which now consumes more than 30 percent of the country's gross national product, according to S. P. Ahuja, director of New Delhi's Center for Research, Planning and Action, an independent research center. Inflation and foreign debt are rising. Public-sector companies continue to perform poorly, while many restrictions and widespread corruption still hedge in private enterprise. **********''India is running out of time,'' Vikram Satyanath, a young advertising executive in Bangalore, said. ''If this Government doesn't do something, we will find another one that will.'' **********For many impatient young people that choice will not be Congress, a party that voters rejected as discredited in national and state elections, but Mr. Advani's disciplined free-enterprise Bharatiya Janata Party, which is better known for its appeal to conservative or militant Hindus. But is also seems to be attracting the rising, secular middle class. **********The Bharatiya Janata Party, in contrast to Mr. Singh's Janata Dal, has been growing steadily over the last year, consolidating strength at state and local levels for what many Indians believe will be a bid for power nationally in the next election. **********Most politicians and analysts in this land where the word pundit was invented believe that Mr. Singh still commands substantial respect and popularity around the country for his integrity, and that voters are not ready to consider bringing Mr. Gandhi back. **********''The Prime Minister may derive his greastest strength from the fact that no party wants to fight another election now, not even Congress,'' said Bhabani Sen Gupta, of the Center for Policy Research. **********Although the Prime Minister says he is not averse to open debate among his colleagues, there are many politicians, including some in his own party, who believe that he will have to put an end to some unseemly public disputes among his colleagues. **********Ultimately, many believe, there will have to be a showdown with his Deputy Prime Minister, Devi Lal. **********When Mr. Singh broke with Mr. Gandhi and was expelled from the Congress Party in 1987, he was a man without a political base. He succeeded in creating a national party, the Janata Dal, and later the wider National Front only with the help of several important regional politicians. **********Foremost among them were Mr. Lal, Chief Minister of the northern state of Haryana and a near-feudal leader of increasingly prosperous farmers belonging to the Jat caste, and Chandra Shekhar, a wily politician who never hid his ambition to be prime minister, a position he believes he was unfairly denied in 1977, when another non-Congress Government was in power. **********When Mr. Singh took office in December, Mr. Lal joined him in a decisive political manuever to sideline Mr. Shekar, who challenged Mr. Singh for the chance to form a government. Mr. Lal was rewarded with the title of Deputy Prime Minister as well as Agriculture Minister. Mr. Shekhar, shunted to the sidelines, began to plot. **********Progress on Foreign Policy **********Now he has renewed his relationship with Mr. Lal, and the two have become a virtual fifth column in the party. They threaten to deprive Mr. Singh of their support bases in the populous Hindi-speaking north. **********If Mr. Singh has acted cautiously on the domestic political front, he moved quickly in foreign policy. Troops were brought back from Sri Lanka, agreements were signed with Bangladesh and a trade war with Nepal has ended. Mr. Singh recently joined officials from other developing nations in establishing a new international organization, the Group of 15, for helping one another and forming a front to tackle their perceived probelms with industrialized nations. **********But relations with Pakistan, the largest neighbor, have been set back significantly by the crisis in Kashmir, raising the level of suspicion and tension between the two nations. Over the next few months, this issue will test the statesmanship of Mr. Singh, and at the same time his domestic political acumen will be facing its greatest challenge."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/28/business/ftc-studies-farley-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 261, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "F.T.C.

Two-thirds of that oil is likely to be sold to the United States, Venezuela's largest customer. Last year, Venezuela sold a million barrels a day to the United States, 18 percent of American oil imports and about half of the country's total production. **********With war preparations gripping the Persian Gulf, it is no surprise that American eyes are suddenly turning to Venezuela, which likes to style itself as a ''safe source'' nation, unlike those in the troubled Middle East. And Venezuela holds the world's largest proven oil reserves outside the Middle East - 59 billion barrels. **********''When you buy the cheap oil of the Middle East, you're not calculating the cost of defending the Middle East,'' said Antonio Cassella, planning manager for Petroleos de Venezuela, the state oil company, known as PDVSA. **********But beyond the short-term production increases, Venezuela, one of Latin America's oldest and most stable democracies, is poised to play a newly prominent role in the United States energy scene well into the 1990's. **********Moves that Venezuela is already making in that direction include a $24 billion six-year capital investment plan by PDVSA that was started months before the current Middle East troubles, and new policies to encourage foreign investment. There is also the geographical proximity to the United States. **********Most of the oil will come from Maracaibo, an oil-soaked region in western Venezuela where decades of production have caused the ground to sink by as much as 15 feet. **********An oil tanker leaving Maracaibo takes just four days to reach the East Coast of the United States. That compares with the 30 days it takes a tanker to reach the United States from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela's traditional competitor as America's top foreign supplier. That means not only lower transportation costs, but more flexibility for changing orders on short notice. 4th-Largest Oil Company The story of Venezuela's energy exports in the 1990's will largely center on PDVSA, the fourth-largest oil company in the world, according to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, which bases its rankings on ownership of reserves, production and refining capacity, among other factors. The company ranks behind only Aramco of Saudi Arabia, Royal/Dutch Shell of the Netherlands, and Exxon. **********In contrast to widespread negative stereotypes of state companies, the Venezuelan company is profitable and is considered to be professionally managed. But it has found itself hemmed in by production quotas. **********Not known as a successful negotiator within the Arab-dominated Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Venezuela has seen its quota share of OPEC production drop almost in half over 20 years, from 16 percent in 1970 to 8.6 percent today. But Venezuela was a prime engineer behind OPEC's decision to authorize its members to start pumping all they could to make up for the embargo against Iraq and Kuwait. **********New Technologies a Concern **********Noting that many Arab oil producers cheat on their quotas, oil company executives here had been bitter about Venezuela's regular OPEC quota of 1.945 million barrels a day. **********''The question of how long our oil will last is irrelevent,'' said Alberto Quiros Corradi, a former president of one of PDVSA's 11 subsidiaries. ''The question is: Will new technologies replace oil before we run out of oil?'' **********The company has invested aggressively in extending control over production, refining and marketing. It ranked as the second most profitable company in the world in 1989, after a Brazilian state mining company, according to Fortune magazine's survey of the world's 500 largest corporations. Using the same formula, profits as a percent of assets, the survey ranked the company as the most profitable oil concern in the world. **********The company startled Americans by paying $700 million last November to complete its purchase of Citgo Petroleum. Through Citgo, Venezuelan oil has priority access to 8,500 affiliated gasoline stations. **********More Profitable Than Pemex **********When compared with Latin America's other oil-exporting giant, Petroleos Mexicanos, the contrast is striking. **********Both companies had roughly similar sales volumes in 1989 - $15.2 billion for Pemex, and $13.7 billion for PDVSA. But Pemex had more than triple the labor force - 165,000 workers compared with 47,000 for PDVSA. The Venezuelan company was 8.5 times as profitable as Pemex in 1989: $2.7 billion, compared with $320 million for the Mexican company. **********''For a state-run company, PDVSA is admirably run,'' said an American diplomat in Caracas. ''There is very little smell of corruption, and they think in terms of businessmen.'' **********Much of the profit comes from the extraordinary energy wealth of Venezuela, which is larger than Texas and Oklahoma combined. **********The cost of oil exploration averages 10 cents per discovered barrel - literally pennies when compared with the $5-a-barrel average in the United States. Oil production costs here average $2.50 a barrel - less than 10 percent of the current international sales price. **********Last year, the company accounted for 75 percent of Venezuela's $12 billion export earnings and for 17 percent of the nation's $79 billion gross domestic product. **********In 1975, when PDVSA was formed from multinational companies, the company refined 40 percent of its product. Now it refines 80 percent. **********One Soft Spot **********The company's only major soft spot is domestic sales. Those operations had a $286 million loss last year. High-octane gasoline is sold here for 26 cents a gallon, cheaper than bottled water. Street riots have greeted Government efforts to raise the price, which may be the world's lowest. **********The company is in the midst of an ambitious expansion program. These are some of the goals for 1995: *********** An increase in crude production potential by 30 percent, to 3.5 million barrels a day. *********** An increase in domestic refining capacity by 25 percent, to 1.5 million barrels a day. *********** A tripling of petrochemical production, to 10 million tons a year, and a doubling of natural gas production, to the equivalent of 200,000 barrels of oil a day. **********Plans also call for building, with foreign participation, a $3 billion liquefied natural gas plant and increasing coal production sixfold, to 10 million tons a year. **********Price Relief Is Sought **********TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras, Aug. 29 (AP) - Five Central American countries have asked Mexico and Venezuela for relief from the increase in oil prices prompted by the Middle East crisis. **********''The military invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, which deeply concerns our people, will affect the world petroleum market and will bring inevitable political and economic consequences for Central America,'' the President of Honduras, Rafael Leonardo Callejas, said yesterday. **********Under a 10-year-old agreement, the five countries have been buying Venezuelan and Mexican oil for an average of $17 a barrel, paying 80 percent in cash. The other 20 percent is used as loans for development projects, or to finance imports from Venezuela and Mexico. **********The proposal made today calls for payment to be made in 70 percent cash and 30 percent loans. The other four nations are El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Guatemala."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/27/business/looking-ahead.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LOOKING AHEAD", "print_headline": "LOOKING AHEAD", "body_text": " **********MONDAY: Memorial Day, Banks, government offices, stock exchange ans many businesses are closed. **********Fox announces its fall television schedule. **********TUESDAY: CBS announces its fall television schedule. **********Investment Company Institute reports mutual fund investment figures for April one day this week. **********WEDNESDAY: Leading economic indicators and new home sales for April. **********THURSDAY: Factory orders for April. **********President Bush and Soviet President Gorbachev begin their summit meeting inWashington. **********The National Association of Realtors publishes its housing affordibility index. **********FRIDAY: Unemployment and construction spending for April."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/07/world/evolution-in-europe-yeltsin-warns-soviet-party-its-time-for-reform-is-short.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1990-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 899, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Evolution in Europe;
