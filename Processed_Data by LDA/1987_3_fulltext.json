Bankruptcy and real estate law are particularly hot areas. **********As their clients enter fields far removed from the traditional industrial base of American corporations, large firms are diversifying as well. **********Whether it is a biotechnology division that specializes in patent problems or a white-collar crime unit, the staid giants of business law are adding departments never envisioned a decade ago. Catering to 'Product Lines' **********''There is a great interest in creating in-firm boutiques for particular product lines, the way Macy's does with clothes,'' said Stephen Gillers, a professor at the New York University School of Law. **********The trend reverses the approach of the 1970's, when whole departments of major firms broke off to form their own small partnerships, specializing in such fields as environmental and product liability law, which emerged at that time. **********Numbers are difficult to come by because of the private nature of the mergers and acquisitions among firms. But lawyers who have participated in recent acquisitions and academic observers who follow the trends in the profession say the prices paid to draw in the small firms can run to hundreds of thousands of dollars per partner. **********With many major firms enjoying their most profitable year ever, according to a study by The American Lawyer magazine, there is ample cash available to attract the independent firms. **********Traditionally, large firms have maintained departments in litigation, corporate practice and taxes, while many areas involving a high degree of expertise were handled by smaller firms that served as specialists. The Seminal 60's **********Though the tradition began to change as early as the 1960's, the trend has accelerated dramatically in the last two years. **********In October, for instance, Charles M. Carberry will leave his job as a Federal prosecutor to join the New York office of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, the nation's third-largest firm, to develop a white-collar crime practice in New York. **********White-collar crime, which used to be handled mostly by small firms or solo practitioners with a background in criminal law, has emerged as a bigger business in New York lately in no small part because of the vigor of Mr. Carberry and other prosecutors. **********In his current position as assistant United States attorney in Manhattan, Mr. Carberry has helped direct the prosecutions of Dennis B. Levine, Ivan F. Boesky, Martin Siegel and other Wall Street professionals. **********Also this fall, Morrison & Foerster, a leading corporate firm based in San Francisco, will absorb Parker Auspitz Neesemann & Delehanty, a New York practice with 22 lawyers that is known for its expertise in litigation and entertainment law. **********Parker Auspitz was organized in 1977, when a handful of lawyers at two blue-chip firms in New York left to hang out their own shingle. Specialists Flourish **********''There is no such thing as a corporate lawyer any more,'' said Anthony M. Radice, a partner at Parker Ausptiz. ''There are securities specialists, takeover specialists, regulation specialists and all sorts of others.'' **********In other words, law firms have followed where their clients have led. The growth of the gene-splicing industry, for instance, has created a strong demand for patent lawyers who have scientific backgrounds and are experts in the new technology. **********The Wall Street scandal and political corruption in New York City and on the national level in Washington have created demand for criminal counsel from firms more familiar with public stock offerings and commercial law. **********The broadest changes have come in bankruptcy and real estate law, two specialties that had been considered less prestigious than the kind of corporate counseling practiced on Wall Street. 'It's Big Time' **********''Firms such as Milbank, Tweed and Davis Polk just wouldn't have gone into real estate, which was seen before as a kind of semi-sleazy work,'' said Steven Brill, president and editor in chief of The American Lawyer magazine. ''Now it's big time.'' **********But even within the traditional area of corporate law, the nature of transactions has become complex enough that established firms have been hiring specialists in such growing areas as merchant banking, mortgage-backed securities and futures. **********''The practice of law has become very transaction-oriented and clients are picking their lawyers based on their specialty,'' said Arthur Fleischer Jr., a takeover specialist with Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. ''In the securities area, for instance, there have been more innovations in the last decade than in the previous 50 years.'' **********The turmoil in the profession stems in part from the competition for clients. Every merger takes a client away from a law firm. Large Firms Are Nervous **********''Not too long ago, a firm could relax on a relationship with a few big corporate clients,'' said Carl A. Leonard, the managing partner at Morrison & Foerster. ''But large firms are now nervous about being dependent on few clients, because so many companies are being gobbled up.'' **********The competition for business has led to increased competition for talent as well. In the past, major firms would not have considered enticing senior partners away from competing offices. ''More and more firms are raiding each other's partners, so you can't get dependent on a few lawyers,'' Mr. Leonard said. ''This is quite different from the past, when the same people who started with you at the firm would retire with you.'' **********Legal circles were shocked almost 30 years ago, when Carolyn E. Agger, the wife of former Associate Justice Abe Fortas of the Supreme Court, led a mass defection from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison to the firm now known as Arnold & Porter. Free Agency Among Lawyers **********In hindsight, that move was a harbinger of things to come. Now senior partners seem to be hopping from firm to firm much the same way that baseball players declare themselves free agents and move from team to team. **********''Firm loyalty has gone out the window,'' said Professor Gillers of New York University. **********The trend can perhaps most clearly be seen at such venerable firms as Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn and Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCoy. Until the last few years, neither firm would hire top partners from outside their ranks, choosing instead to work young associates who over the years climbed the ladder to coveted partnerships. **********Earlier this year, Milbank announced that it would take on Thomas P. Puccio, the former Federal prosecutor who handled the Abscam case, to bolster its litigation practice and perhaps handle some white-collar criminal work. He becomes one of a dozen partners hired from the outside in the last two years. Proskauer has hired a battery of partners to open two divisions. 'Willing to Make Changes' **********''It was a much more conservative profession before than it is now,'' said Edward Silver, a partner at Proskauer who heads its executive committee. ''People are willing to make changes when they were not willing to do that before.'' **********Among the biggest beneficiaries of the wave of diversification are legal headhunters. **********''I see '88 as a very strong year,'' said Alan Roberts, who recruits senior lawyers. ''As a result of firms expanding and servicing different clients, a firm may not have the right mix of talent to handle its business, so they have had to look to the outside for experts.'' **********Mr. Roberts said bankruptcy law had been one of the strongest areas of recruitment in the last few years, and he predicted that it would grow. **********''Many of the buyouts of the last few years have been financed by heavy debt,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''The debt will pull many of those companies down, and that will create more demand for experts in bankruptcy law.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/09/business/faculty-protest-in-kodak-case.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 247, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Faculty Protest In Kodak Case", "print_headline": "Faculty Protest In Kodak Case", "body_text": " **********Most of the faculty of the William E.

KILBORN News Analysis WASHINGTON, Sept. 13 - Friday's report of the biggest monthly deficit ever in the nation's foreign trade illustrates the power of partisan politics over theories of sound economics to which even partisan politicians say they subscribe. **********Most economists, including many in the Reagan Administration, attribute much of the trade deficit and the lost jobs and business it represents to the other big deficit, that in the Federal budget. The budget deficit, in turn, in their view persists mostly because of the President's refusal to yield on raising taxes. **********This viewpoint contends that the President has undermined the economically sound and politically calculated objective of Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d and the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Paul A. Volcker, in steering the two-and-a-half-year decline of the dollar. Well before now, Mr. Baker could have assumed that the trade deficit would have shrunk enough to calm the anger in Congress over the jobs the nation was losing to foreign competition. **********Of course, a political impasse between the President and Congress cannot alone explain why America's purchases abroad are exceeding the sales of its goods. In the current situation, the expected effects of the dollar's drop have been offset by several other factors over which American officials have little control. **********For one thing, foreign companies have been willing to cut their profits to hold onto the market shares they have gained in the United States. For another, American consumers continue to show a preference for imported goods in the belief, justified or not, that their quality is higher. Also, the world economy has been growing too slowly to swallow larger quantities of American exports. **********All these circumstances have led to the persistent trade deficit that threatens the President with retribution from Congress in the form of a politically seductive but potentially damaging protectionist trade law. If enacted, it would limit the President's authority to negotiate free-trade agreements with other nations and impose new curbs on American imports of their goods. The Worst Probably Over **********Paradoxically, the protectionist measures might be enacted just as the nation has probably seen the worst of both deficits. Big as the trade imbalance is - $16.5 billion in July and running at a rate $12 billion more than last year's record of $156 billion - the figures camouflage a pronounced turn in the volume of trade, such as bushels of wheat and corn, and shipments of automobiles and computers, if not as yet in the monetary value. **********The turn, obscured by the sinking dollar, began a year ago, and since then much of the nation's farming and manufacturing businesses have been selling more abroad, restoring their edge against imports at home and reaping the rewards of more jobs and fatter profits. American trade, in fact, is now displacing business and consumer spending in leading the economy's growth. **********This month, next month, sometime soon, economists say the value of trade will start following the trend in volume, as it already has in agriculture. But the evidence of the turn has yet to influence the oratory of Congress. **********''We are in the sad situation of going from bad to worse,'' the Senate majority leader, Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, said in the aftermath of the trade report. In West Virginia, unemployment has dropped to about 9 percent from 11 percent a year ago, and the national rate, at 5.9 percent, is the lowest in eight years. **********''The Democrats had a partisan issue that they could exploit,'' said Richard N. Cooper, an economics professor at Harvard and an Under Secretary of State in the Carter Administration. ''They're not willing to back off because it means eating their words of a year ago.'' Smaller Budget Deficit **********Meanwhile, the budget deficit, to which economists attribute much of the trade deficit, is expected to plunge to around $160 billion this year, from a record $221 billion last year, and then rise to $190 billion in the next two years before declining again. As a percentage of the overall economy, the gross national product, it has fallen sharply from more than 6 percent four years ago to less than 5 percent last year. **********These changes in the gauges of the economy's performance would imply that the nation needs less restrictive trade legislation, not more, to exploit the rewards of a cheaper dollar. The fall in the currency's value raises the prices of the goods the nation imports and lowers the prices of its exports. **********But the shifts in the statistics have not been nearly so pronounced now as they have been in past instances of a falling dollar or persuasive enough to alter attitudes in some of the politically powerful sectors of the economy that suffered most from the dollar's rise in 1980 to 1985. **********The biggest reason for that, most economists say, is the size of the budget deficit, which keeps the dollar stronger than it would be otherwise. The Treasury sells securities to finance the deficit. Foreigners, like Americans, buy the securities, and they have to buy dollars to do so, pushing up demand and thus the currency's value. Partisan Gridlock **********The budget deficit remains large because of the continuing partisan gridlock over President Reagan's refusal to raise taxes and Congress's refusal to cut nonmilitary spending unless he goes along with a tax increase. The more intransigent of the two is the President, to the dismay even of many members of the Administration. They worry that, whatever the hazards of giving some ground on taxes, the hazards of the trade deficits are worse. **********''The economy's now on the right track,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''It would be desirable if the President would make a deal on a tax increase, but he won't.'' **********Aides to the President attribute his tenacity to his political priorities. His top priority is not free and open trade but stopping the growth of government, an objective he can meet by stopping the growth of taxes that pay for government. **********The Democratic leadership of Congress is tenacious, too, in resisting the President's proposals of further reductions in nonmilitary Government spending to cut the budget deficit. **********The President's stand has frustrated those of his associates who expected the protectionist crescendo in Congress. However much critics have faulted some of the Reagan Administration's economic policies, Mr. Baker, as the architect of the drive against the dollar, stands on the side of the angels on this one, in the opinion of most economists. His initiative was indisputably good economics, and it was widely applauded across the spectrum of economists and even by Democrats in Congress. Effects of Protectionism **********The alternative, protectionist laws to restrain imports, would help domestic industry for a while, but other countries would be expected to retaliate against the American protectionism, enacting tariffs, quotas and other restraints of their own. World trade would atrophy, inflation would rise, and countries could face a depression like the one of the 1930's that is often attributed in part to the American Smoot-Hawley tariffs. **********In the present case, bringing the trade deficit down required more than a campaign against the dollar. The strong, trade-surplus countries, especially West Germany and Japan, would need to speed up their economies so they would buy more American goods, and as yet they have delivered much less than Mr. Baker expected. And more important, reducing the trade deficit required solid reductions in the budget deficit. **********Some senior officials speak, without attribution, of a compromise under which the President would go along with a tax increase if Congress accepted the President's proposals for a balanced budget amendment or a line-item veto, which would give him authority to excise specific expenditures that Congress puts into the budget. But Congress has repeatedly rebuffed him on these, even when the Senate was in Republican control. **********Analysts say they expect that, with trade now helping the American economy, the protectionist passions of Congress will cool and that the trade law that emerges will be milder than some have feared. But because of the gridlock over the budget, they still expect a measure of politically expedient, unsound economics. **********''Any way we look at it,'' said Robert D.

Aquino said at a news conference this month. **********In a country in which seven persons out of 10 live below the poverty line, an economic recovery is essential if Mrs. Aquino is to consolidate her fragile authority. **********Philippine and foreign analysts say that the ultimate test of Mrs. Aquino's policies is whether they can alleviate the worst poverty in this island group of 56 million people, where per capita income is only $600 a year. Just over a year ago, the country was in disarray because of growing opposition to former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, and then a campaign after which both Mr. Marcos and Mrs. Aquino claimed victory. People took to the streets, and business confidence plummeted with the uncertainty. Even after Mr. Marcos fled to Hawaii in February 1986, the social disorder and possibility of a coup or gains by the insurgents dampened the business climate. Evidence of Improvement **********Since then, after some initial hesitation, the economy has shown signs of improvement. Statistics here are often out of date and not reliable, but analysts cite this evidence: *********** After falling in the first half of 1986, economic output swelled in the fourth quarter, resulting in 0.13 percent growth in gross national product for the year. That is meager, and well behind the population growth of 2.5 percent per year, but it is a welcome reversal from declines in G.N.P. of 3.8 percent in 1985 and 5.6 percent in 1984. *********** The rate of inflation dropped from 40 percent two years ago to less than 1 percent over the last year. Interest rates also have fallen sharply, allowing businesses to borrow again. *********** Capital flight, which had robbed the Philippines of billions of dollars in recent years, has abruptly stopped. Some of the money may return voluntarily, because of attractive investment opportunities. Some of it also may come back as a result of lawsuits seeking to recover the wealth of Mr. Marcos and his associates. *********** The price paid to farmers for copra, or coconut meat, has jumped two and a half times over the last year. A year ago, the money would have gone to a coconut monopoly, but since the monopoly was ended last year, the funds now go to the farmers. One-third of the Philippine population depends directly or indirectly on coconut farming, so the price increase has resulted in a vast infusion of buying power in rural areas. Consumer Sales Increase **********''The coming boom was already evident in the last quarter,'' said Bernardo M. Villegas, an economist at the business-financed Center for Research and Communication in Manila. ''Consumer firms were reporting sales increases of 20 percent to 25 Mr. Villegas, whose estimate for 1986 was on the mark, says his calculations suggest a boom. The Government forecast of 6 percent economic growth this year is ''chickenfeed,'' he said, and growth could amount to 8 percent. **********Most economists are not so optimistic, however, and think growth of 3 percent to 5 percent is more likely for 1987 - a still-robust gain for an economy that had been shrinking. **********For now, two forces seem to be at work in waking the economy: Government spending and consumer spending. The Government is starting some major housing and public works projects, while shoppers seem busier than they have been in a while. More Investment Sought **********But challenges remain. Simply to keep unemployment at the present 11.8 percent level, the economy must create 628,000 jobs this year. And to achieve stable growth, businesses must invest in factories and equipment so that production can be increased. **********''The real question is when investment in real assets will pick up,'' a Western diplomat in Manila said. **********The Philippines expected a jump in investment after Mr. Marcos left a year ago, but instead investment continued to fall. Overall investment fell 15 percent last year, on top of a 21 percent decline in 1985. The biggest drop was in investment in private construction, which plummeted 42 percent. One reason is that the economic contraction has resulted in enormous unused capacity at many factories. **********A boom in foreign investment also failed to materialize. For the first nine months of 1986, foreigners invested $137 million in the Philippines, not much more than the $95 million in the depressed year-earlier period. Hopes for Foreign Money **********But signs are emerging that Americans and perhaps Europeans may now invest more money in the Philippines, even though the Japanese may remain aloof. A group of 27 American executives toured the country last month and said at a news conference they found many attractive investment opportunities. **********One deterrent to increased investment has been the Government's slow pace in selling state assets. Officials are proceeding cautiously, partly for fear of criticism that they are holding a ''fire sale'' of hotels and companies owned by the Government. **********Revenue from the sale of the assets will go to finance a land distribution program, Mrs. Aquino announced this month. But some economists fear that the land program, while a crucial move toward greater equity, will absorb vast amounts of money without increasing agricultural production. **********Foreign investors will gain more confidence if the Philippines and its bank creditors reach an agreement soon on rescheduling some of the country's $28 billion debt. Officials in Manila are seeking a very low interest payment on those bank loans, to conserve dollars desperately needed at home. **********However, a continued impasse in the debt talks - or a freeze on interest payments, as is being discussed here - might frighten potential foreign investors."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/28/business/currency-markets-dollar-falls-nearer-key-test-levels.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1987-08-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 781, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dollar Falls Nearer Key Test Levels", "print_headline": "CURRENCY MARKETS; Dollar Falls Nearer Key Test Levels", "body_text": " **********The dollar slipped closer to critical levels in relation to the yen and mark yesterday. **********If the dollar breaches those levels, traders forecast, central banks would have to intervene forcefully or else see the dollar move substantially lower. The test could come as soon as today, they said. **********Yesterday's decline was substantial, and dealers said it was significant that so few participants were buying dollars. Bearish sentiment remains rampant, traders said. **********''The overwhelming interest is still to sell the dollar,'' said Paul O'Gara, chief foreign-exchange dealer at the Midland Bank in New York. Developments Watched Closely **********The dollar's decline suggested that higher interest rates would be needed to attract foreigners back to the dollar, and that sent bond yields to their highest level of the year. The selloff in the bond market in turn hurt equities, with the Dow Jones industrial average slumping 26.79 points, to 2,675.06; the average has dropped 47.36 points since hitting a record 2,722.42 on Tuesday.  [ Page D4. ]  Currency traders and market technicians watched the day's developments closely because the dollar descended near levels - 140 Japanese yen to the dollar and 1.80 West German marks to the dollar - that are considered particularly significant. **********Most participants assume that monetary authorities would like to see the dollar trade in a range of 140 to 150 yen and 1.80 to 1.90 marks. **********''It will be interesting to see if the market will hold here,'' one bank trader said. ''We are closing close to a very big signal. If we break 1.80 marks, I would not be surprised to see the central banks come in in force.'' There were unconfirmed reports yesterday that the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve were in the market yesterday, buying small amounts of dollars. **********In late New York trading, the dollar was bid at 141.70 yen, down from Wednesday's 142.95 and nearly 2 yen lower than Tuesday's rate. Dollar Off Against Mark **********The dollar slipped even more against the mark, dropping to a late New York bid of 1.8085 from 1.8249 on Wednesday. **********Gold also weakened yesterday. At the Republic National Bank in New York, the 4 P.M. bid for gold was $456 an ounce, down $1 from Wednesday. **********The testing of the dollar could come early this morning after the Japanese announce their trade results for July. **********''Around 6:30 Friday morning the Japanese trade numbers will be out,'' said Carmine J. Rotondo, chief corporate dealer at the Security Pacific Bank in New York. ''If that number comes out showing a surplus of more than $7 billion, and I think it will, that will be a bearish signal.'' A figure that large, he said, ''will give us an indication of how bad our own trade numbers could be when they are reported on Sept. 14.'' **********Mr. Rotondo's comments underscored a pervasive fact that has been running through the currency markets for the last two weeks: June's stunningly large $15.17 billion merchandise trade deficit. That number continues to prey on traders' minds and is at the core of why the dollar has fallen since early August. **********''The last trade number was really a slap in the face,'' one dealer said. Negative Feelings About Dollar **********That figure, plus the absence of any comment about the dollar from either Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d or Alan Greenspan, the new Federal Reserve chairman, has left participants with their own negative feelings about the dollar. **********''I'm not sure the central banks want to see the dollar go higher,'' said the chief trader at a major New York bank, ''but merely want to be there to insure that it doesn't go into a free fall.'' **********The trader added that the depth of the market's bearishness was brought out on Wednesday when, in spite of significant dollar buying by multinational companies, the dollar continued to slide. Corporations were absent from the market yesterday; trading was limited to professionals. **********''On Wednesday corporates bought well over $1 billion,'' the trader said. ''But the darn thing just kept going lower.'' Market's Pessimism **********The market's pessimism was compounded during the day when remarks by Henry Kaufman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, flashed across screens. **********In a reiteration of an earlier forecast, Mr. Kaufman predicted that the dollar would eventually drop below 130 yen and 1.70 marks. **********''Kaufman didn't move the market,'' one trader said, ''but he didn't make us feel any better.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/05/world/canton-journal-where-capitalist-roaders-cling-to-the-fast-lane.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Gargan", "pub_date": "1987-03-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 886, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WHERE CAPITALIST ROADERS CLING TO THE FAST LANE", "print_headline": "CANTON JOURNAL; WHERE CAPITALIST ROADERS CLING TO THE FAST LANE", "body_text": " **********South of the Yangtze River here, the frigid political gale from Beijing seems little more than a faint breeze, dissipated in a climate of brazen money making, spirited discussion and fashions that shout Hong Kong chic. **********Relentlessly, national newspapers rail against the evils of Westernization, the political sins of making and spending money and the pollution of ideas from the likes of Sartre and Freud. **********But here in Canton, and in Shenzhen, down the Pearl River, there are few signs that the political campaign against ''bourgeois liberalization'' means very much. There are even fewer signs that the country's new economic policies will stall here. **********Canton's province, Guangdong, ''is a place that has been opened to the West earlier than the rest of China,'' said Li Zuoxing, the deputy editor of The Yangcheng Evening News. ''These things came earlier. A lot of people here have relatives in the outside world. People here pay attention to the outside world.'' 'People Here Are More Open' **********''Every place is different,'' he continued. ''Every place has its own historical background. The people here are more open to the outside world, more relaxed. In history, our people were more like this.'' **********Both Canton and Shenzhen, a so-called Special Economic Zone created to attract foreign investment a bit more than 100 miles from Hong Kong, are at the heart of the economic policies devised by Deng Xiaoping, the principal Chinese leader, to invigorate the country's economy. Western and Japanese management practices are spreading, private businesses are germinating, and the Government is loosening its grip on economic activity. **********On People's Avenue here, young men in tidy jackets and ties and women in crisp pastel cotton suits with subtle padded shoulders dart along the sidewalks to their offices. Restaurants, both private and city-owned, swell with lunchtime crowds, and young entrepreneurs flash their Great Wall credit cards with the deftness of a New York banker on an expense account lunch. Flexible Private Enterprise **********''Each year since 1979, private enterprise has jumped,'' said Liu Xingya, who heads the Canton Individual Labor Association, a group formed to protect the interests of private shopowners and businessmen. ''Private enterprise is more flexible than state enterprise. It's scattered in every part of the city. Private enterprise provides more small business, more service.'' **********There are, Mr. Liu estimates, 150,000 residents engaged in some sort of private business, from the Changxin Fashion Shop with 40 employees to individuals who repair shoes on streetcorners. **********The surge of private business here has lent this city of three million a freewheeling character that contrasts markedly with Beijing's bureaucratic stodginess. It has also helped to insulate Canton and much of southern China, at least so far, from the political campaign against Western ways. **********In Beijing, Communist Party leaders and the press continue to focus on the need to struggle against ''bourgeois liberalization'' - the phrase is a pejorative catchword used to denote Western ideas that challenge the supremacy of the party - but in Canton, the notion is brushed off like a piece of lint. Using Hong Kong **********A Western diplomat in Canton argued that the desire of Chinese leaders not to upset Hong Kong, for fear that investors will pack up and leave, is a shield hoisted by southern China. **********''The south is using Hong Kong to fend off the north, to protect themselves from Beijing,'' the diplomat said. ''If things get out of hand in Beijing and Hong Kong starts to get nervous, the south sure points this out to the north. Nobody wants to upset Hong Kong. And they save themselves in the process.'' **********Despite the confidence exuded by many southerners, there remain limits on expression. In Shenzhen, a city that sprang from waterlogged rice paddies in the last eight years, city officials closed the popular newspaper, The Shenzhen Youth Herald, for, among other things, calling for the retirement of Mr. Deng, who is 82 years old. **********''The Youth Herald went against the aims of the party and went against the socialist road,'' said Zou Erkang, a Deputy Mayor of Shenzhen. ''It did not play the role it should play.'' **********Shenzhen, which abuts Hong Kong, has in fact developed very much like a bit of the West clinging to the edge of China. Tipping, a practice shunned in most of China, is encouraged. Factory workers punch time clocks, something anathema to China's notions of labor. Taxi drivers, whenever possible, disdain China's currency and demand Hong Kong dollars in payment instead. **********Although there is much talk in Beijing about of the process of economic change will be stalled, both Shenzhen and Canton officials insist that nothing will change in the south. **********''We will not slow down the economic reform,'' said Xu Zhi, a deputy secretary general for the Canton city government. **********''We have been carrying out correct policies,'' Mr. Xu said.

A spokesman for Pan Am said the company did not comment on takeover efforts. The leaders of the union coalition were in a meeting and could not be reached for comment. **********Mr. Kerkorian, the majority owner of MGM/UA Communications through the Tracinda Corporation, did not return telephone calls to his office. **********The fortunes of Pan Am's stock have been closely tied to takeover rumors. **********Pan Am's stock closed yesterday at $4.50, down 12.5 cents, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock was trading at about $6 earlier this year when takeover speculation was at its height. But after Resorts International sold its 12.2 percent stake in July and Donald J. Trump, the real estate developer who took control of Resorts, also sold a block, the takeover speculation subsided. The price of the stock has sagged since then. **********The talks with the unions will be crucial in determining if Mr. Kerkorian pursues a purchase, the sources said. The unions indicated earlier this year that they would be prepared to offer about $180 million a year in concessions over three years. **********In return for the concessions, they said they wanted to increase the 7 percent stake that workers now have in Pan Am. The coalition also wants to control the board and gain other safeguards of employee interests. **********After months of trying to find an financial angel, however, it was unclear what the coalition's position would be in the upcoming talks. The coalition, known as the Joint Labor Council of Pan Am, represents about 20,000 of the airline's workers and is made up of four of the five unions at the company. **********The leaders formed the group to seize the initiative and protect the interests of its members if any attempt was made by management to find a buyer for the airline. The group at first hired the investment banking firm of Rothschild Inc. and then added Drexel Burnham Lambert. **********In August the unions held talks with Sir James Goldsmith, the financier, who also had a team of experts look at the airline. A source close to that effort said the Goldsmith exploration broke down when the team said the labor coalition would have to make much deeper wage cuts than the $180 million a year they had proposed. **********Although Pan Am has shown some recovery because of heavy traffic to Europe this summer, managment considers its costs too high to assure long-term survival. The company earned $10.5 million in the second quarter, in contrast to a loss of $152.4 million in the second quarter of 1986. **********The increased European travel is lasting longer lasting than expected. The airline reported yesterday that its traffic was up 14.4 percent in September, compared with last year. Its load factor, which measures how full planes are, was 62.2 percent for the month, compared with 54.1 percent in September 1986. **********The carrier has had much better results all year and may reach its goal of showing a profit this year, company officials have predicted, after many years of losses. **********Even if Mr. Kerkorian and his staff work out an agreement with the labor coalition, there remains a major hurdle - Pan Am's strongest union, the Transport Workers Union, which is not part of the labor group. Presumably an agreement would have to be worked out with the T.W.U. for a smooth takeover. **********Pan Am's board is scheduled to have its regular October meeting today, but it is not expected to consider any Kerkorian or union proposals. **********The union coalition has put Pan Am management in the unusual role of reacting to the coalition's drive to find a buyer for the company. Just as in the case of the takeover of Trans World Airlines by Carl C. Icahn, the switched roles at Pan American are another indication of how unions have been able to use their ability to give concessions as a way of playing a major role in any takeover of their airline."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/21/world/critics-of-gandhi-reportedly-uniting.html": {"writer_name": "Sanjoy Hazarika", "pub_date": "1987-07-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 557, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CRITICS OF GANDHI REPORTEDLY UNITING", "print_headline": "CRITICS OF GANDHI REPORTEDLY UNITING", "body_text": " **********Amid reports that Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi is preparing sweeping changes in his party and administration, his sharpest critics were reported today to be planning a series of rallies across India to press for his resignation. **********The critics organizing the effort are led by Vishwanath Pratap Singh, a former Defense and Finance Minister who was expelled from Mr. Gandhi's Congress Party on Sunday. **********Leaders of various opposition groups met with Mr. Singh and his aides today and urged joint action to press for the resignation of Mr. Gandhi.

But the political dispute over the tax was certain to continue. The sales tax is a key part of a planned revision of Japan's tax system, the first in nearly 40 years. **********Several of Japan's trading partners, including the United States, have called on Tokyo to change those parts of its tax system that reward saving and discourage spending, as one way of reducing Japan's huge trade surplus. **********Mr. Nakasone has staked his political credibility on winning passage of the plan, which would cut personal income tax rates, end a tax-free savings account system and impose a 5 percent sales tax. In addition to strong protests from the opposition parties, however, he is facing what amounts to an unusual rebellion from within his own party and from groups that are usually among his main backers. **********Several local chapters of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, including the Tokyo chapter, the party's largest, have publicly pledged to fight the sales tax, fearing that its passage would ruin their chances of re-election. Some politicians have also joined public rallies against the tax, an action for which they were publicly scolded by party leaders. **********Japanese business is also split. Some key supporters of the party, including people involved in small businesses and distributors, have vociferously opposed the sales tax, and some large-scale business organizations, like the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, have also spoken against it. **********The dispute over the sales tax is becoming a barometer of Mr. Nakasone's political strength. Public-opinion polls conducted by the daily Yomiuri Shimbun show that support for his administration recently dropped by 10 percentage points in one month, to 38.1 percent.

Last month, the Government decided to break with a decade-old policy and allow military spending to exceed 1 percent of the gross national product. **********The opposition to Mr. Nakasone's plan contrasts sharply with the victories he won when he obtained the change in military policy and when he was able to include the sales tax and the abolition of tax-free savings in the plan despite fears that these measures would prove unpopular. **********In his tenure as Prime Minister, Mr. Nakasone has tried to forge a new leadership style that would be more direct and more internationally visible than that of many of his predecessors. **********He has sketched out ambitious goals for change, including the privatization of several Government-owned companies like Japan National Railways and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, as well as changes in Japan's educational system. **********In many cases, he has gone over the heads of other politicians and the powerful Japanese bureaucracy by creating what he calls independent advisory commissions. These have been filled with people whose professional qualifications are excellent but who could also be counted on to make proposals that reflected Mr. Nakasone's position. **********Although the public has usually applauded Mr. Nakasone's leadership style, some of his fellow politicians have found him to be abrasive and arrogant. Some of the opposition to the sales tax, then, may also reflect politicians' desires to weaken Mr. Nakasone's influence and pave the way for a successor. Mr. Nakasone's term officially expires in October. **********It is not clear whether the protest over the sales tax will force changes in the tax proposals. Mr. Nakasone and other leaders of the ruling party reaffirmed their support of the plan Monday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/22/business/consumer-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONSUMER RATES", "print_headline": "CONSUMER RATES", "body_text": " **********In percent"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/27/business/prospects.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 655, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PROSPECTS", "print_headline": "PROSPECTS", "body_text": " **********Boom Times for the Fax. . . **********Facsimile machine sales are humming these days. Unit sales of the devices, which transmit copies of documents over telephone lines, will reach 225,000 this year, and grow to more than 900,000 over the next five years, according to a recent study. **********''This is the next boom market in low-end telecommunications technology,'' said Casey Dworkin, general manager of Personal Technology Research in Boston, which conducted the study. Mr. Dworkin predicts that the use of facsimile machines by small companies will triple over the next five years until nearly half of small businesses are using them. **********Prices of facsimile machines have already dropped substantially, he said, and they will come down even further. ''Basic units that are now retailing for $1,299 will soon be selling for less than $500,'' he said. ''This means that new buyers will be entering the market by the tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, quite soon.'' **********While lower prices may be a boon to the majority of small businesses, they could mean an end of the store-front facsimile service centers springing up in so many office complexes. The centers allow their customers, usually small businesses, to send or receive documents at prices of up to several dollars a page.  . . .and the MIDI **********What's MIDI? It's an acronym for Musical Instrument Digital Interface and - among musicians - a verb. ''To MIDI'' is to interconnect musical synthesizers, sequencers, drum machines and even personal computers. It's the technology that allows performers like Peter Gabriel to play, simultaneously, on more than one keyboard at live concerts. **********MIDI is also big business: Sales of computer hardware and software based on this technology have shot to an estimated $500 million since its introduction four years ago, according to Craig Harkins of Hamlin Harkins Ltd., a San Jose, Calif., consultant. **********''We are sure the market will at least double by the end of the decade,'' Mr. Harkins said. Already, MIDI technology, now sold mostly to professional musicians, is coming down in price. ''It's only a matter of time before this moves into the consumer market,'' Mr. Harkins added. **********Indeed, the five top manufacturers of musical synthesizers, which created MIDI - Yamaha, Korg, Roland, Kawai and Sequential - are including the musical-interface system with all but their lowest priced-instruments. And the latest generation of personal computers from I.B.M., Apple, Atari and Commodore can all accommodate the technology.  An Eatery's Image **********Restaurants with a certain ''look'' may now be able to stop copycats, thanks to a recent decision by a Federal appeals court in San Francisco. **********The decision in the case - Fuddruckers v. Doc's B.R. Others - extends the doctrine of ''trade dress,'' which usually applies to product packaging, to include ''the total visual image'' of a restaurant as well as its services. **********Fuddruckers, a chain of 107 upscale hamburger restaurants based in Texas, filed suit after Doc's, based in Pheonix, came up with an almost identical menu and decor, which includes glassed-in butcher shops and bakeries, serve-yourself melted cheese and sauerkraut cauldrons and cartons of supplies stacked between the tables. **********''To determine what a restaurant's trade dress is, you consider a lot of tangible things that aren't entitled to trade mark protection individually, but create an intangible whole that is,'' said Paul D. Gutierrez, a San Francisco attorney specializing in trade mark law. Predicting far more confrontations among similar businesses, he added: ''The law is going to be wide open for restaurants to make life difficult for their close competitors.'' **********Others question the significance of the ruling. ''People will continue to 'borrow' ideas for their operations,'' said Joan Lang, executive editor of Restaurant Business, an industry publication. ''It's an interesting development, but it won't stop Fuddruckers' problems or anyone else's.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/27/business/rules-changing-in-takeovers.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1987-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1718, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rules Changing in Takeovers", "print_headline": "Rules Changing in Takeovers", "body_text": " **********Almost every major takeover deal that was in the works before the stock market began its slide has been drastically revamped or canceled. Several other major deals still alive are regarded as all but dead. But arbitragers and others emphasize that, on the flip side, lower stock prices present some unusual opportunities for new deals. **********As stocks plummeted, Jardine killed a tender offer for up to 20 percent of the stock of Bear Stearns, Dart abandoned its efforts to acquire Dayton Hudson, a GAF management team said it was reconsidering its $2.3 billion acquisition proposal and Revlon let expire its $5.41 billion proposal to take over Gillette. **********As the reports of failed deals litter Wall Street, though, some investors are trying to divine new ones. **********''A lot of people are buying things,'' said a leading corporate raider, ''and a lot of others are thinking of it.'' Sense of Caution Prevails **********Still, with the Dow Jones industrial average having dropped nearly 28 percent in the past two weeks, there is a sense of caution in the marketplace. **********''If you believe the market is going lower,'' said another corporate raider, ''then nothing is a bargain. There are no buyers for this stuff. I thought the market drop was a big opportunity to buy, and I still do, but it looks as if there could be a lot more blood before things get better. If I had a deal on the table, I'd lower my price.'' **********Among those showing particular caution is Irwin L. Jacobs, a major corporate raider based in Minneapolis. He sold Gillette, McGraw-Hill and Burlington Northern ''weeks ago,'' he said, and his group was ''not a buyer last week or Monday in what you'd call takeover stocks.'' He added, ''We're monitoring the market on a day-by-day basis.'' **********Carl C. Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines, which has a $1 billion bankroll, also wants to sit out this part of the market action. ''Tremendous opportunities might be developing,'' he said, ''but I'm sitting on the sidelines.'' Question of Current Value **********Another cautious corporate raider who asked not to be identified said that while he thought he could get financing for a raid and could succeed in a takeover, he was not sure that the individual parts of an acquired company would maintain their current value. **********''People are getting very ugly in this market,'' he remarked. **********Still, some people have been looking for - and finding - what they consider good opportunities. Among them are Asher B. Edelman, the Manhattan arbitrager, who said that in the last two weeks he had been actively involved in the market. Mr. Edelman said he had spent $72 million for 11 1/2 percent of the Foster Wheeler Corporation. He said he said he bought half of it during the market slide. **********''I have confidence in the future of undervalued stocks,'' he said. ''I have been accumulating other stocks in the last week, too.'' Some of the Pending Deals **********Even if several may be in serious danger, here are some of the major deals that arbitragers feel are still alive: *********** The Bank of New York made a $1.4 billion bid for the Irving Bank Corporation on Sept. 25. This is considered one of the more important of the deals still on the table. Bank of New York confirmed yesterday that it was still very much interested -but left often the door to change its mind. Even as Irving's stock slid $9 yesterday, to $41.75, from $78 when the offer was made, J. Carter Bacot, chairman, said, ''We're still moving forward.'' He added, ''While there are no plans to change the terms, we reserve the right to do so.'' *********** Mr. Edelman announced a $876 million tender offer for the Telex Corporation on Oct. 8. Yesterday he said that not only was he ''still interested'' but had a $65-a-share tender offer under way even after Telex's stock sank $13.25, to $37.50. Telex stood at $61 when the offer was first announced. *********** Owens-Illinois Inc. announced on Sept. 17 a $750 million tender offer for Brockway Inc. Owens-Illinois, owned by an investor group headed by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, announced on Oct. 21 that it was extending its $60-a-share tender offer for Brockway until Oct. 30. The stock, then $58.375, stood yesterday at $36, down $1.875. *********** The Utah Power and Light Company and Pacificorp, in a complex stock swap, signed a $1.9 billion definitive merger agreement on Aug. 13. In a deal that could give Utah Power stockholders between $32.25 and $38 in Pacificorp stock, Utah Power has the option to withdraw if the offering price falls below the $32.25 minimum. Utah Power stood yesterday at $24.50, down $1.125. Moreover, seven or eight states where the companies operate have to grant regulatory approval. *********** The Charter Medical Corporation got an $890 million buyout offer on Sept. 28 from a group headed by William A. Fickling Jr., its chairman. When the bid was announced, Charter was trading at $38.375, but by yesterday it had fallen to $26.25, down $3.125. *********** The Ford Motor Company and U.S. Leasing International reported on Oct. 12 that Ford was planning a $503 million tender offer. U.S. Leasing, at $67.25 at the time of the announcement, stood yesterday at $65, down $1. *********** The Gelco Corporation agreed on Oct. 2 to a $250 million merger with the General Electric Credit Corporation. Gelco stock traded at the time at $33.25, and by yesterday it had slipped to $30.50, off $1.25. *********** Hanson Trust P.L.C. agreed on Aug. 5 to buy Kidde Inc. in a $1.8 billion cash and securities deal. After rising to $66.125 at the time, Kidde's stock had slid yesterday to $50.125, down $4.25. Warrants to buy Hanson stock as part of the transaction tumbled from $4 then to less than $2 yesterday. And shares in the Interim Systems Corporation, which Kidde stockholders would also receive, have fallen from $3 then to about $2 now. A Setback for Some Deals **********Others deals that are either dead or uncertain include these: *********** Bear Stearns Companies and Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd. of Hong Kong announced on Sept. 30 that Jardines would buy 20 percent of the investment firm for $390 million. At the time Bear Stearns stock stood at $20, but by yesterday it had fallen to $10, down $2. Jardine, 46 percent owned by Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd., announced on Oct. 23 that it had terminated the proposal. Bear Stearns said it was pursuing its legal options. *********** The Haft family of Washington proposed on Sept. 18 to pay $6 billion for the 95 percent of the Dayton Hudson Corporation it did not own. Dayton's stock immediately jumped to $60 but by yesterday stood at $26, down $2.50. On Oct. 20 the Hafts said they were selling their stock and would abandon the deal, taking a loss on Dayton stock estimated then at some $20 million. *********** The GAF Corporation announced on Sept. 8 that it had received a $2.3 billion buyout proposal from a group headed by Samuel J. Heyman, its chairman. Outstripping Mr. Heyman's $66.50 offer, GAF stock soared $13.25, to $67.75, with arbitragers speculating that the offer might be sweetened. By Oct. 19 the Heyman group said it intended to reconsider. GAF shares stood yesterday at $40.50, down $2.50, making the current deal unlikely. *********** Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of Revlon Inc., offered on June 17 to pay $4.8 billion for the Gillette Company. Under an agreement with the razor blade company, Revlon is not allowed to attempt a takeover for 10 years, but it sought permission, first to pay $40.50 a share and finally as much as $47 a share, or $5.4 billion. Gillette showed no interest. Gillette's stock initially jumped to $40.25 and reached a high of $45.875, but it stood yesterday at $23.50, down $4.25. Mr. Perelman, recognizing that his request was not getting anywhere, let the idea expire on Oct. 15. *********** Mr. Icahn, the head of T.W.A., offered on Oct. 16 to buy the 27 percent of T.W.A. he did not yet own. The $45-a-share offer, made at a time when the stock stood at $31.75, was withdrawn four days later as the stock tumbled $12, to $14. By yesterday T.W.A. shares were $16.50, off $3.125. Mr. Icahn, now watching the market, might try again later, arbitragers said. *********** T. Boone Pickens heads a group with 9.1 percent of the Newmont Mining Corporation. Newmont rose to $77 on Aug. 13 when the Pickens group first entered the picture and then to $92 when he offered on Aug. 31 to pay $95. With the approval of Delaware Chancery Court, Consolidated Gold Fields P.L.C. now owns 49.7 percent of Newmont, and Mr. Pickens is appealing the ruling to the court. Newmont stood yesterday at $30.375, off $2.625. **********Corporate raiders, meanwhile, are closely watching a market in turmoil.

W. Botha and apparently establishing the extreme right-wing Conservative Party as the official opposition in the white house of the segregated Parliament. **********As about two million whites cast their votes amid tight security, nearly 1.5 million black workers and students observed a nationwide work stoppage to protest the whites-only vote. **********President Botha's National Party was expected to increase its 127 parliamentary seats to 132. Its gains were at the expense of the relatively liberal Progressive Federal Party, which was expected to win 19 seats, down from 26. Conservatives Gain 6 Seats **********President Botha, whose campaign stressed resistance to Western pressures for racial liberalization and resentment of American sanctions, is expected to claim a strong mandate for his brand of cautious change. **********The four-year-old Conservative Party was projected to win 22 seats, all in Transvaal Province, a gain of 6, and it reduced the National Party majority sharply in 40 constituencies in all four provinces. The party urges more rigid racial segregation and territorial partition. **********In an unexpectedly high turnout, approaching 70 percent, English-speaking voters, who traditionally have voted for the opposition, switched to the National Party and Afrikaner nationalists flocked to the Conservative Party. **********Young urban Afrikaners, whom the Progressive Federal Party had hoped to attract, stayed with the National Party or voted for independents. Incidents of Unrest **********Political analysts said a combination of external and domestic pressure on white South Africans and a relentless law and order campaign by the National Party drove traditional opposition supporters into the Nationalist fold. **********In isolated incidents of unrest, white youths who marched on two polling places in the Transvaal and Natal Province were dispersed by the police, a suspected guerrilla of the African National Congress was arrested at a roadblock in the Western Transvaal, and firebombs were thrown at a school in the key Cape seat of Helderberg. **********But the heavy guard at voting booths insured that the white election went ahead in relative peace. **********The black protest, lead by trade unions, was one of the biggest in the country's history and indicated both the level of black anger at exclusion from Parliament and growing black solidarity. **********Murphy Morobe, publicity secretary of the anti-apartheid United Democratic Front, said the successful protest would show the Government that ''when they return to power on May 7, they will find us more determined and more united against apartheid and National Party rule.'' An Eerie Calm in Soweto **********In the sprawling black satellite of Soweto on Wednesday there was an eerie calm as hundreds of thousands of black workers relaxed at home and soldiers on motorcycles and security forces in armored vehicles patrolled the streets. **********South Africa's 25 million blacks have no vote in the Parliament, which has segregated chambers for the country's five million whites, three million people of mixed race and one million Indians. **********There are 3.03 million registered white voters, representing about 9 percent of the total population. This is 735,000 more voters than were registered in the last white election in 1981 when 770,000 people, 2.3 percent of the population, voted for the National Party and thus chose the Government that rules 34 million people. 'Vote Against Apartheid' **********The two-day black boycott gained momentum Wednesday after more than 500,000 workers and students stayed at home on Tuesday. **********Although black leaders have declared the whites-only election to be both an insult and of ''little interest'' to blacks, anti-apartheid leaders said they would be closely watching the results for signs that the dominant Afrikaners are prepared to break with apartheid. **********In an unexpected move on the eve of the election, Winnie Mandela, wife of the jailed African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, said the Congress's message to whites was to ''vote against apartheid.'' **********But Mrs. Mandela said Wednesday that the protest by black workers and students would show that it was the black nation rather than white opposition parties that was the barometer by which the Government should measure the real opposition. Mock Election Held **********In a mock election conducted by the white-owned black newspaper The Sowetan, Mr. Mandela came in first, the exiled African National Congress president, Oliver Tambo, second, and the Anglican Archbishop, the Most Rev. Desmond M. Tutu, third. **********The large-scale defection of Afrikaner intellectuals and the entry of three National Party defectors as independent candidates, challenging the Government on the pace and content of its liberalization program, intensified interest in the results of the election. **********The three defectors ran strongly. Wynand Malan, who quit the governing party in January in protest against laws enforcing segregated residential areas, retained his Transvaal seat of Randburg with a comfortable majority. Dr. Dennis Worrall, a former South African Ambassador to Britain. came tantalizingly close to victory in the key Helderberg seat and Esther Lategan sharply reduced the National Party in Stellenbosch, the center of the Afrikaner intellectual rebellion. **********Mr. Botha's personal position was strengthened by the election results, which dramatically weakened the position of the two men most likely to succeed him as President and party leader. **********F. W. De Klerk, leader of the National Party in the Transvaal, lost nearly a third of the province's seats to the Conservatives and saw his own majority cut sharply. And Jan Christiaan Heunis, Cape leader of the National Party and architect of the Botha program of cautious change, scraped home with 39 votes against Dr. Worrall, The extreme right-wing Herstigte Nasionale Party forfeited its only seat and the New Republic Party lost 4 of its 5 seats. **********There are a total of 164 contested seats in the 178-seat white house of Parliament. The 12 seats not up for election are filled by presidential and party appointment. Of these, the National Party holds 10 and the Progressive Federal Party and Conservative Party one each. Record Number of Candidates **********A record 480 candidates contested all but two of the 166 elected seats in one of the most acrimonious and keenly fought elections since the National Party came to power in 1948. **********The National Party reached its most powerful in 1977 when it won 135, or 82 percent, of the elected seats and 66 percent of the vote. **********In 1981 this fell to 131 elected seats and 57 percent the vote when the Progressives gained seats and the Herstigte Nasionale Party dramatically increased its share of the national vote. **********When the Conservative Party broke away in 1983, the National Party total fell by 16 seats and has leveled off to its present 117 elected seats."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/07/business/us-petroleum-data.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 231, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. PETROLEUM DATA", "print_headline": "U.S. PETROLEUM DATA", "body_text": " **********In millions of barrels except refinery utilization"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/14/business/international-report-iran-minister-to-take-opec-plan-to-teheran.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-12-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1052, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iran Minister to Take OPEC Plan to Teheran", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL REPORT; Iran Minister to Take OPEC Plan to Teheran", "body_text": " **********The oil minister of Iran, Gholam Reza Aghazadeh, said tonight that he was leaving a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to consult with his Government about a potential agreement that would allow its enemy, Iraq, the freedom to produce as much oil as it wishes. **********Iran had strenuously opposed allowing Iraq to continue its uncontrolled production of oil. **********The agreement would also allow OPEC's present production and pricing structure to remain unchanged until June at least, another development that Iran had opposed. **********Ministers said OPEC will suspend its official gathering to await the Iranian answer to these proposals, which the minister said in an interview he would ''recommend to the Government.'' Significant Defeat for Iran **********The surprising development marks a significant defeat for Iran, if it goes along with these recommendations. For this reason, there is some speculation here tonight that despite the Iranian minister's recommendation, the Government in Teheran might reject it. **********A senior Iranian source, who asked not to be identified, suggested that even if Iran goes along with this accord, the Government will issue a strong statement outlining its views on what he said were the political maneuvering mounted by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Iraq here to isolate and corner Iran. **********Iran had objected to the present OPEC pricing and production structure, arguing that overproduction by several members has weakened prices by about 10 percent over the past few months. Iran has also demanded that Iraq be forced into accepting a production quota like all other 12 members of OPEC. And, it asked that the official OPEC price, set currently at $18 a barrel, be raised to $20.70. **********None of these demands are taken into account in the proposed accord, however. Total Output Levels Set **********As it stands now, the agreement, if accepted by Iran, would set total output for 12 members of OPEC at 15.06 million barrels a day, leaving Iraq's additional output of 2.8 million barrels outside the accord, free of restraint. **********In addition it also exempts a gift of oil from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait of another 300,000 barrels a day - given as a form of financial support for its war with Iran - outside the quota system, making Iraq's share 3.1 million barrels a day, the second highest in OPEC after Saudi Arabia. **********This makes total OPEC output about 18 million barrels a day without counting the ongoing excess output by the United Arab Emirates of around 800,000 barrels a day and excesses by other members of the group of about 500,000 barrels a day. **********Many oil experts argue this is far too much for world oil markets where demand for OPEC oil for the first quarter is estimated at 17 million barrels a day at most. The excess oil will weaken prices much further, they say. Prices now hover at an average of $17 a barrel. **********''This is a dissappointment for the market. If they cannot come up with a communique after five days of talks and after a weekend of protection from market forces, then there is going to be a negative reaction,'' said Peter Gignoux, manager of the international energy trading desk at Shearson, Lehman Brothers in London. **********''Even without cheating, this is substantially more than the market requires in the first quarter,'' said John H. Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Research Industry Foundation in New York. **********A senior Arab minister who asked not to be identified said Iran had no choice but to accept this accord. He said the oil minister was ''totally isolated here''. He said the Iranian official is going back to Teheran to personally deflect responsibility for accepting such an obvious political defeat for Iran. He said even Algeria, a traditional ally, has abandoned Iran here. **********''He wants to make sure they won't blame him for this. He is going to get the O.K. from higher-ups there so no one can say later he fumbled this alone,'' the Arab minister said. **********Iranian sources here said they only considered this defeat to be a ''first round'' of an ongoing battle, suggesting that the bitter vendetta between Iran and its Arab enemies inside OPEC will go on in the future to bedevil OPEC. **********The episode, and the failure of OPEC here to address its production and pricing problems, marks the degree to which the seven-year-old gulf war has firmly installed itself as a spoiling factor in OPEC.

Kessenich Jr., the former head of Citicorp's North American investment banking operations who joined Hutton last year, bringing several other key Citicorp officials with him. **********Which approach Hutton chooses depends on which buyers step forward and how much of Hutton they want, the professionals said. **********The most serious potential bidders at this time are said to be the Transamerica Corporation, an insurance and financial services company; Dean Witter Reynolds, a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Company, and Shearson Lehman Brothers, which is controlled by the American Express Company. **********Shearson said on Monday that it had been contacted by Hutton and was keenly interested in a possible acquisition. L.F. Rothschild Also Seen on Block **********Hutton is not the only weakened brokerage house considering a dismembering of itself. L. F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin is also looking for a buyer or a substantial infusion of capital, Wall Street officials have said, in the wake of the problems that hit Wall Street after the stock market plunge last month. **********L. F. Rothschild had earlier asked its investment bank, Salomon Brothers, to explore the sale of all or part of the firm, and that search has advanced to the point where a deal could be announced within days, according to the officials. **********One avenue that has been explored is the sale of the firm's retail brokerage division, which has about 240 brokers. **********A number of brokerage houses, including Bear, Stearns & Company and Gruntal & Company, have been approached about their interest, the officials said. **********As for Hutton, Transamerica has previously been a major shareholder.

P. Morgan & Company and the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company came six weeks after Brazil suspended interest payments on $68 billion of its debt and demanded a new solution to the debt crisis. **********Negotiations between Brazil and its creditors are scheduled to begin next Friday in New York, bankers said today. The banks said they expected to reach an agreement under which interest payments would resume. **********Many major banking companies have previously indicated that they might reclassify their Brazilian loans, but these are the first to do so. Analysts said other banks were likely to follow. **********''I would be quite shocked if they did not follow suit,'' said Douglas Stone, a banking analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities. ''I don't see how they couldn't.'' Recording of Interest Changed **********When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, a bank recognizes income from it when interest payments are received. Normally, a bank records income when the interest is due, regardless of whether the payment actually comes in. **********The moves were announced too late to affect trading on Wall Street, but caused a sharp drop in Treasury bill rates in the credit markets, in what one market expert described as a ''mini-flight to quality.''  [ Page D25. ]  BankAmerica said the action would reduce its first-quarter net income by $40 million. If the deferral of interest payments continued, the bank said, the reduction in income for the whole year would amount to $140 million. The San Francisco-based banking company, which has been trying to recover from heavy losses, said about $1.9 billion in Brazilian loans would be affected by the decision. **********BankAmerica also said it was putting on nonaccrual status about $180 million of medium- and long-term loans to Ecuador, which is recovering from a severe earthquake. That action would reduce first-quarter earnings by $5 million and earnings for the year by $15 million. A 18 Percent Reduction **********Manufacturers Hanover said its action would affect $1.4 billion of medium- and long-term loans and would reduce its net income for the quarter by $18 million and for the year by $72 million. Those figures are about equal to 18 percent of the company's quarterly and annual earnings in 1986. **********J. P. Morgan, whose main unit is the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, said its net income for the first quarter would be reduced by $20 million and its income for the whole year by $72 million. Such a reduction would be equivalent to about 8 percent of Morgan's 1986 net income of $872.5 million. Morgan has $1.3 billion in medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. **********Several other banks said they were studying the situation. **********Citicorp, the largest lender to Brazil, said in mid-March that it might take such an action, which would reduce its net income by $50 million in the first quarter and $190 million for the year. The bank has lent $4.6 billion to Brazil. #90-Day Deadline Banks technically do not have to place loans on a nonaccrual status until the interest payments are 90 days late. However, the banks said today that it appeared that negotiations on rescheduling Brazil's debt would not be completed until after the 90-day periods had expired, so they decided to act now. **********Some banking sources said placing the loans on a cash basis could also give the banks a stronger bargaining position against Brazil because they would have already been hurt by Brazil's action. **********BankAmerica's move was somewhat surprising because it is the least able among the major banks to handle the reduction in earnings. **********BankAmerica recently succeeded in fighting off a takeover attempt by the First Interstate Bancorp and has said it was on the path to recovery from two years of losses from bad loans. The problems with Brazil could set back the recovery and perhaps even make the bank susceptible to another takeover attempt, some analysts have said. **********Recently, Moody's Investor Services downgraded the debt of BankAmerica, citing its Latin American loans and doubts about improvements in earnings. Gain From Schwab Sale **********However, BankAmerica said it still expected to record a profit for the first quarter because of gains from the sale of assets, such as Charles Schwab & Company. The sale of the discount brokerage was completed Tuesday. **********BankAmerica also said that ''barring substantially increased instabilities in developing countries'' it continued to anticipate an operating profit for all of 1987. **********Mr. Stone of Prudential-Bache said he had been expecting BankAmerica to record a net profit of 60 cents a share in the first quarter, equivalent to about $90 million in net income. He said he expected the bank to record a gain of $140 million from the sale of assets counterbalanced by an operating loss of $50 million. However, with the Brazil reduction, earnings will drop to about 30 cents a share, or $46 million, he said. **********Donald K. Crowley, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said the actions by the banks would not have much effect on stocks because the market had already factored in the Brazil situation. He said he expected BankAmerica to have an operating profit for the year only if the Brazil situation was resolved. **********BankAmerica also said the special gain it expected from the previously announced sale of its consumer trust division to Wells Fargo & Company would be only $75 million pretax, instead of the announced $98 million, because BankAmerica would end up keeping certain accounts it had planned to sell. Its gain on the deal, which closed today, will not be recognized until the second quarter instead of the first."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/19/business/company-news-ncr-dismisses-13-for-trading.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 191, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NCR Dismisses 13 for Trading", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; NCR Dismisses 13 for Trading", "body_text": " **********Thirteen employees have left the NCR Corporation, apparently because of their involvement in an effort to profit from trading in the company's stock options. **********NCR said that the employees had left ''in connection with activities which it deemed inconsistent with certain policies and practices.''

First Fully to Use 80386 Chip **********By running both MS-DOS and Unix at the same time, the A.T.&T. machine is the first computer to make full use of the 80386 chip, the most powerful microprocessor in the PC market.

These machines are used mainly to run airline reservation systems and automated teller systems. **********In its largest version, the 3B4000 can handle more than 43 million instructions per second and support up to 300 users at a time, A.T.&T. said. Its price starts at $187,000.  However, some analysts questioned the price performance of the 3B4000, and they noted the limited software applications available for Unix-based machines. Criticism of Sales Structure **********Although they lauded the technological advance of the new computers, analysts attributed A.T.&T.'s poor performance to the lack of a separate computer sales force reporting directly to the head of its computer division. Vittorio Cassoni, A.T.&T.'s senior vice president, Data Systems division, was recruited from A.T.&T.'s computer partner, Ing. C. Olivetti & Company, to turn the division around. **********In an interview at A.T.&T.'s computer products center in Parsippany, N.J., Mr. Cassoni said that the company had 600 field representatives devoted to selling computers and that the number would be increased to target specific customers. He also said that A.T.&T. recently received a contract from the McDonald's Corporation to place the 6386 system in its restaurants. **********Mr. Cassoni said that A.T.&T. expected to make at least two major computer announcements a year because of technological developments. **********''One announcement does not make a computer company,'' Mr. Grubman said, ''but it's a step in the right direction.

The negotiations are termed proximity talks because Pakistan has refused to meet Afghanistan face to face since Soviet troops joined the fray in 1979. **********Mr. Cordovez said he believed that earlier progress at the talks, including a narrowing of differences over the timing of a troop withdrawal had helped touch off discussions in Afghanistan over the formation of a provisional, reconciliation government, and that he hoped this process would continue. **********The two sides had agreed to continue the talks, he added, but had set no firm resumption date. **********''They will reconvene when they are ready,'' Mr. Cordovez said.

One day earlier, the Budget and Planning Minister, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, had been named as the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in next year's presidential elections, and the market surged 7.5 percent in the first 90 minutes of trading. **********The National Securities Commission said it had been forced to halt trading briefly twice that day to prevent ''disorderly conditions'' that ''could lead the price index up to undesired levels.'' But market analysts said the action set a precedent that may have led some major players to reconsider their positions. **********''By intervening, the Government signaled to speculators that they could no longer automatically count on quick and gigantic increases,'' said one broker, who asked not to be identified. Overvaluation Noted **********Market analysts also acknowledged that investors were beginning to realize that many issues were overvalued. By early October, some issues were trading at a price-to-net-worth ratio of well over 1-to-1 and a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 30, which brokers said was far outside the historical range of 10 to 12. **********In addition, there have been accusations in the press and by some brokers that a ''black hand'' is manipulating the market. In a cover story this week, the news magazine Proceso charged that both the rise and the fall of the Mexican market have been ''artificial,'' the deliberate product of maneuvering by a few powerful investors. **********A spokesman for the Mexican Stock Exchange denied those accusations today, saying that manipulation of the market ''does not exist, and if it did, it would be hard to measure.'' Nevertheless, brokers said the controversy had adversely affected confidence, especially among small investors who recently entered the market. **********By international standards, the exchange here is a small one, dominated by a half-dozen major brokerage houses and trading less than 200 issues. On an average day, about 50 million shares are traded here. Only 500,000 Investors **********No more than 500,000 Mexicans are estimated to own shares, compared with some 50 million Americans who invest in United States stocks. **********Mexican investors need not look back as far as 1929 to be chastened by the prospect of a market crash. In 1979, a spectacular stock-market surge fueled by the country's oil boom came to an abrupt end, pushing the index down by more than half and ushering in a period of stagnation that began to lift only in 1982. **********Outwardly, officials here are minimizing the significance of the Wall Street plunge. In a news conference last week, Manuel Somoza Alonso, president of the Mexican stock exchange, acknowledged the ''psychological effect'' of events in the United States but argued that the impact was unwarranted."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/21/business/court-to-weigh-liability-of-sellers-of-securities.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Taylor", "pub_date": "1987-04-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 584, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Court to Weigh Liability Of 'Sellers' of Securities", "print_headline": "Court to Weigh Liability Of 'Sellers' of Securities", "body_text": " **********The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether a person who buys securities he knows are unregistered and who brings other buyers into the deal may sue the seller for his own losses and avoid liability for the losses of the other buyers. **********The most significant issue in the case is whether a buyer who actively recruits other buyers can avoid the liability imposed by the Securities Act of 1933 on ''sellers'' of unregistered securities if he received no direct financial benefit from his promotional activities . **********The case is an appeal by Billy J.

A three-judge panel of the appeals court upheld, by 2 to 1, a Federal District Court decision that Mr. Pinter must reimburse Mr. Dahl and his relatives and associates for their losses, and that Mr. Dahl, who was not sued by the others, was not liable to share in Mr. Pinter's liability to them. The panel said both Mr. Pinter and Mr. Dahl were apparently unaware that the securities had to be registered, but that while this did not provide a legal defense for Mr. Pinter, it did for Mr. Dahl. **********The full United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit voted, by 8 to 6, not to reconsider the ruling in the case, Pinter v.

Instead, it was said to have been the Austrian Government that was most active in beseeching the Vatican to receive Mr. Waldheim. **********While the full nature of the exchanges between Vienna and Rome are still unclear, some Vatican officials believe that Austrian officials and in particular leaders of the Christian Democratic Party in Austria interceded on behalf of Mr. Waldheim, their standard bearer. **********In seeing the Pope, Mr. Waldheim will be on his first trip out of Austria since he was elected President a year ago. In April the United States Justice Department barred him from entering the country. **********Vatican officials have expressed concern in recent days that the audience could undo some of John Paul's many efforts to improve relations with Jews, based on a decision by the Second Vatican Council in 1965 to increase dialogue between the church and Jews. **********The statement issued today recalled John Paul's frequent condemnation of Nazi crimes against the Jews, and it specifically notes his repeated statements against the persecution of the Jews that he made on a trip to West Germany last May and his comments to leaders of Warsaw's Jews last Sunday, when he spoke of the ''terrible reality of the extermination.'' **********Perhaps more than ever before, the statement says, ''the nation of Israel finds itself at the center of the attention of the nations of the world above all because of this terrible experience.''

The Vatican rarely offers official comment on the motives for a papal decision. **********The statement notes that Austria, ''an old and noble Catholic nation,'' is linked to the Holy See by ''cordial relations,'' and it says the Austrians democratically elected Mr. Waldheim a year ago.

Clashes in 6 Other Cities **********According to South Korean press reports, similar clashes occurred in six other cities, involving more than 60,000 students at 45 colleges. Battles reportedly raged in the streets in the central city of Chonan and the southern city of Chinju. **********But as the country's political crisis deepened, demonstrations became increasingly dominated by ordinary South Koreans expressing frustration with the Government, its suppression of dissent and its overall timetable for democratic development. **********About 10,000 people, of widely varied backgrounds and ages, held a candlelight vigil in the capital Monday night following religious services at a Roman Catholic Cathedral that has been the focus of recent anti-Government opposition. The rally was one of the largest held in downtown Seoul in years, and it seemed certain that almost everyone there had gone as an act of protest. Cathedral Is Filled **********Men, women and children filled the Myongdong Cathedral and spilled over onto a flagstone plaza, where they stood in prayer or sat on the ground despite a drenching rainstorm. **********When the rain stopped, the crowd surged into the street outside, holding candles aloft and singing hymn-like songs of protest. They were held back by thousands of a police officers with riot shields stretched before them. **********In the front ranks, demonstrators were mostly students who shoved menacingly against the police, forcing them to step back and to make more room for the surging crowd. **********But for the most part, the rally was peaceful, reflecting a growing middle-class component to protests that the Government has characterized as an attempt at ''violent revolution.'' 'A Democratic Government' **********''We want the Government leaders to realize what the people want,'' said Im Jin Chang, a college professor who attended the Myongdong service. ''This is a time when the people unanimously want a democratic Government.'' **********The demonstrations and street violence began to reach new peaks last week after President Chun Doo Hwan and his ruling party formally designated Roh Tae Woo as their choice to succeed Mr. Chun. Mr. Roh - a former general, like the incumbent President - is all but certain to be chosen by an electoral college next December, and will take office in February. **********But protest was building even before last week, fed by disclosures of police torture of dissidents and cover-up attempts, and by Mr. Chun's abrupt cancellation in April of an ongoing debate over how to make the process for selecting a national leader more democratic. Opposition politicians charge that Mr. Chun's true objective is to perpetuate his behind-the-scenes power in a Government that they denounce as a ''military dictatorship.'' Cardinal Urges Reversal **********The overwhelming importance of this issue for many South Koreans was underlined at the Myongdong prayer service when Stephen Cardinal Kim Sou Hwan, Roman Catholic primate of South Korea, called on the President to withdraw his April decision. **********Protests spread Monday on a day of rapidly shifting moods, when it first seemed that the authorities had succeeded in ending the crisis, only to have it flare again. **********Late Sunday night and early Monday, the police cleared central Seoul's streets in an attempt to ease tensions by inviting a band of 220 radicals to end a tense six-day occupation of Myongdong without being arrested. Despite a brief clash between street demonstrators and policemen at midday Monday, the tactic seemed to work, for the dissidents finally agreed to leave. **********Their takeover of the cathedral had become the focus of the recent clashes as students and other sympathizers staged forays through downtown streets to express support. **********Myongdong is the center of South Korean Catholicism and an important national symbol. Although Catholics account for only an estimated 5 percent of the population of 41 million, they include many of the country's educated elite and wield an influence disproportionate to their numbers. **********Under a deal arranged by Catholic priests, the students left the cathedral in three buses with a promise of safe passage to their campuses. According to Seoul's police chief, Cho Chong Suk, no arrests will be made, a decision that represents a significant retreat by a Government that had promised to deal sternly with the dissidents. **********''The most significant thing about the situation,'' Cardinal Kim said later, ''is that it restored the trust of students in the Government. It is a step forward.'' **********It did not, however, stop the protests. Crowds surged through downtown streets into Monday night and early today, many of them people well beyond student age and seemingly without any specific political loyalty. **********At one point, more than 5,000 South Koreans - office workers, shopkeepers and strollers - held a spontaneous anti-Government rally in narrow streets near the cathedral. As they chanted slogans with growing exuberance, others waved from office building windows and threw flowers down to the demonstrators. **********Suddenly, without warning, helmeted policemen surged into the crowd, firing tear gas and sending people scattering amid shrieks of pain and surprise. The police action angered many bystanders. One elderly woman grew so incensed that she struck an officer on the head with her pocketbook. **********''There's a mood change under way,'' a foreign diplomat said. ''The Government has always tried to portray the students as radical, but it's not working. The people are not buying it this time.'' **********National police officials announced that 6,094 people had been taken into custody since the surge of protest began last Wednesday. Most were quickly released, but hundreds still face criminal charges. **********In addition, the Chun Government is weighing possible emergency measures should the situation deteriorate, but South Korean news reports said no action was contemplated now. **********It appeared that the Government wanted to see first if the protests would peter out on their own. Officials, including Mr. Chun, have warned repeatedly that they would be tough on dissidents, but they have held back, apparently for fear of further inflaming anti-Government sentiment. **********The major response has been to contain demonstrations through a heavy firing of tear gas. Thus far, the police have not carried firearms. Nor have they been seen using the sticks they carry on their hips."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/14/business/japan-rebuts-foes-of-sale.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 218, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japan Rebuts Foes of Sale", "print_headline": "Japan Rebuts Foes of Sale", "body_text": " **********A Foreign Ministry official today rejected as groundless arguments made by senior American officials who are trying to block the sale of an American microchip maker to a Japanese company. **********''They appear to be linking completely unrelated issues,'' said Shuichi Takemoto of the Foreign Ministry's North American division.

It also follows by three months a ruling by a divided Supreme Court that has had the effect, in many instances, of closing the courtroom door to disgruntled clients. The ruling leaves arbitration at the leading stock exchanges as the principal means of redress for allegations of ''churning'' - excessive buying and selling on a client's account to increase commissions - or other malfeasance. **********''It's my sense that there was a perceived problem of fairness,'' said Aulana Peters, a commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission. ''The system in general has been working pretty well. But there are certain aspects of it, such as the ties of some arbitrators to the securities industry, that give it the appearance that it may not always be fair.'' **********For the first time in a decade, the S.E.C. has proposed broad changes in the rules governing arbitration panels appointed by the National Association of Securities Dealers and the New York and American stock exchanges. **********Officials of the exchanges say they have begun to make a number of changes and are studying the S.E.C. proposals. ''We're working toward their implementation,'' said Ed Morris, head of the arbitration division of the New York Stock Exchange. ''But there are things in there that you can't do overnight.'' The exchanges are expected to respond formally to the proposals by December. **********There were 2,828 securities-related arbitration cases at the exchanges last year, up from 830 in 1980, said Robert Love, special counsel at the S.E.C.'s division of market regulation. Complaints against brokers lodged with the S.E.C. more than doubled in five years, topping 15,000 in 1986. **********Arbitration experts predict the number of cases will increase from 25 percent to 50 percent next year, in part because of the Supreme Court's June decision in Shearson-American Express v. McNulty. The decision upheld a customer agreement providing for arbitration of any controversy arising from an account rather than a hearing before a Federal judge. **********But of the four dissenting justices, three expressed the opinion that arbitration has an image problem. ''Because of the background of the arbitrators, the investor has the impression, frequently justified, that his claims are being judged by a forum composed of individuals sympathetic to the securities industry and not drawn from the public,'' wrote Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun, speaking for himself and Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr. Some lawyers agree. ''The situation before the proposed reforms has been very troublesome from the point of view of the public interest,'' said Sheldon H. Elsen, chairman of the American Bar Association's task force on securities arbitration. **********Mr. Elsen pointed out a number of problems with the old rules. They do not prevent all of a panel's arbitrators - even those who were supposed to be independent of the industry - from being employees or lawyers of a brokerage house or relatives of someone in the securities business. No careful background checks are required on arbitrators to determine whether they have criminal records or have been disciplined. **********Moreover, Mr. Elsen said, the voting records of arbitrators in past cases have been known to many in the securities industry but not to the customers who bring the action. Relevant records subpoenaed by a party need not be disclosed until minutes before a hearing. And there has been no formal requirement of any knowledge of the law, meaning that arbitrators could be ignorant of legal trends. **********The S.E.C.'s proposals would change much of this. Arbitration panels would still include representatives of the securities industry, but the required representatives of the public who typically form the majority of the panels would not be allowed to have ties to the industry. **********More extensive checks would be made on arbitrators' backgrounds, and their voting records on all cases would be available to both sides in a dispute. (Both sides are allowed peremptory challenges to exclude an arbitrator from a case.) In addition, arbitrators would get involved in the discovery process at an earlier stage in the dispute so that records would be available to both sides earlier. The reforms also include uniform guidelines for the training of arbitrators and circulation of pamphlets on emerging developments in the law. **********The S.E.C. has also recommended that all contracts between customers and brokerage houses include a clause that permits disputes to be decided by independent arbitration panels, such as the American Arbitration Association. This nonprofit group last year heard 119 securities disputes involving a total of more than $15 million in claims. **********The association announced this month that it too had changed its rules so that fewer arbitrators would have securities industry affiliations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/11/business/company-news-ford-to-close-plant.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-03-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 87, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ford to Close Plant", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Ford to Close Plant", "body_text": " **********The Ford Motor Company said it will close the coke ovens at its Rouge Steel subsidiary here next month after 68 years of operations, forcing 390 employees out of work.

Chemical Weapons Threat **********The Iranian official was said to have catalogued an array of arms, including ''sophisticated offensive chemical weapons,'' produced in Iran. He was quoted as saying that Iran would not use the chemical weapons, which are prohibited under a 1925 treaty signed at Geneva, ''as long as it is not forced to.'' **********Prime Minister Mousavi also said Teheran had begun shipping domestically produced ballistic missiles to its front with Iraq, strengthening speculation that Iran plans a renewed push to break the stalemate since its last major offensive almost a year ago. **********''Shipment of these missiles to the war fronts started last week,'' Mr. Mousavi said. He was quoted as saying that the war would get priority in Iran's new austerity budget, which is expected to total about $30 billion next year. Reconciliation With Egypt **********The militant Iranian posture has provoked increasing alarm among many Arab nations, particularly the moderate sheikdoms and kingdoms that face Teheran's Islamic revolutionary government across the waters of the Gulf. **********The situation has produced a wide consensus of opposition to Iran, which was reflected in a meeting of Arab nations in November. The talks, in Amman, effectively permitted Egypt, which had been ostracized for making peace with Israel in 1979, to re-enter the Arab fold as a demographic and military counterweight to Teheran. **********King Fahd, the Saudi monarch, sounded his warning today about Iran's intentions at a meeting in Riyadh of Arab Persian Gulf states grouped in the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates as well as Saudi Arabia. The meeting opened Saturday and is expected to last four days. **********Iran's war effort was designed ''to expand and control and export ideas strange to our Arab Islamic society,'' King Fahd said. He apparently referred to the Shiite brand of Islamic Revolution practised in Teheran and perceived as a threat by the Sunni Islamic Arab leaders of the Gulf, who rule over Shiite minorities. **********The monarch's statement seemed also to reflect the deep religious rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Saudis have accused Teheran of instigating riots last July in Mecca, Islam's holiest city, where hundreds of people died in the disturbances during the Moslem annual pilgrimage. Saudi leaders are the traditional custodians of some of Islam's holiest shrines, which lie inside Saudi Arabia, though Teheran disputes their right to this title. **********King Fahd blamed Iran for continuing the seven-year war with Iraq, charging that Iran had ignored ''every Arab and Islamic mediation effort.'' The war started when Iraq attacked Iran in September 1980. **********Some analysts believe the gathering is moving toward adopting its most unambiguous condemnation yet of Teheran's refusal to accept United Nations Security Council Resolution 598, which demands a cease-fire in the war. Positions on Resolution **********Iraq has said it accepts the resolution in full, while Iran wants Iraq branded the aggressor before making its position clear. The Riyadh summit meeting is expected to press Teheran to agree to the United Nations blueprint for an end to the war. **********Some Arab Persian Gulf states, notably the United Arab Emirates and Oman, are nervous about the loomimg power of Teheran just across the gulf from their more fragile regimes, and have urged that the Arab gulf nations should maintain a dialogue with Teheran. **********''Talks between gulf countries and Iran are essential,'' said Sheik Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan, President of the United Arab Emirates, shortly before the summit opened. Both his country and Oman have maintained good trading links with Iran. **********The Gulf Cooperation Council summit meeting followed several weeks of increasing violence in the so-called ''tanker war'' between Iran and Iraq. Both sides have attacked commercial shipping despite the presence of more than 80 United States and other foreign warships to protect vessels in the gulf. **********The most recent known attack came last Friday when Iranian veseels fired on a Saudi tanker off the coast of the United Arab Emirates in what some analysts saw as a signal to the Gulf Cooperation Council to refrain from attacking Teheran. **********Syria, Iran's strongest Arab ally, was reported to have mediated between Iran and Saudi Arabia in an effort to halt Teheran's attacks on Saudi and other vessels owned by member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/28/business/no-adverse-effect-seen-at-citicorp.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Bennett", "pub_date": "1987-07-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 529, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Adverse Effect Seen at Citicorp", "print_headline": "No Adverse Effect Seen at Citicorp", "body_text": " **********Between April and June, Citicorp's Investment Bank ran a series of full-page advertisements in a number of publications featuring huge photographs of Thomas C. Theobald, the vice chairman who headed the unit. Apparently, the ads were as much intended to promote the 50-year-old Mr. Theobald as the bank itself. **********The campaign seems to have worked. Yesterday it was announced that Mr. Theobald would leave Citicorp to take over as chairman and chief executive of the Continental Illinois Corporation, in Chicago. **********Although Mr. Theobald spent 27 years at Citicorp, his departure is not expected to have an adverse impact on the mammoth bank holding company. ''It will continue to be business as usual,'' said Carol Berger, a banking analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc. Room to Move Up **********Some analysts think Mr. Theobald's departure will benefit Citicorp by making room for other executives to move up and by putting an officer in charge of the investment banking unit who is likely to attract more enthusiasm from his staff. **********Sources within Citicorp said Mr. Theobald did not want to head the Investment Bank when he was asked to do so by John S. Reed, Citicorp's chairman, in 1985. For a dozen years Mr. Theobald had headed Citicorp's Institutional Bank, which conducts traditional banking business with companies and governments around the world. **********There had been great antagonism between officers of the Institutional and Investment Banks, in part because many investment bankers earned far more than officers of the Institutional Bank. The shift of Mr. Theobald to the Investment Bank was intended to reduce those tensions. **********That strategy seems to have succeeded to a degree. But the commercial banking mentality that Mr. Theobald brought with him to the Investment Bank, especially his reluctance to provide huge compensation to important employees, created resistance to him among his troops. A Successor Is Named **********As a result, many top officers left. Last year, for example, Mark Kessenich, who headed the Investment Bank's North American activities, quit to join E. F. Hutton & Company. **********Citicorp's depth of management is so great that practically anyone can be quickly replaced from within. Along with the announcement of Mr. Theobald's departure, Citicorp said that Michael A. Callen would succeed him. Mr. Callen, the 46-year-old group executive in charge of North American institutional banking, has been a rising star within Citicorp and many believe he will generate more enthusiasm among the investment bankers, even if he follows Mr. Theobald's policies. **********Mr. Theobald's departure from Citicorp took longer than many in the banking world had expected. Most thought he would leave shortly after he lost the race to succeed Walter B. Wriston as chairman and chief executive in 1984.

At various times, they have been single-minded about the money supply figures, the price of oil and, recently, the trade deficit figures. **********Since the stock market's plunge in mid-October, their obsession has been with ''cyclicals,'' the stocks of companies in such industries as chemcials, paper, steel and copper whose profits are more dependent on up-and-down economic cycles than, say, stocks geared toward consumers. ''Cyclicals are in vogue,'' said Harvey P. Eisen, president of Integrated Resources Asset Management. **********To be sure, strategists on Wall Street continue to be extremely skittish about the stock market in general. They are reluctant to pound the table in favor of any stocks. ''We're not wildly enthusiastic about stocks,'' said John D. Connolly, chief strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. But his firm is recommending that customers emphasize cyclical groups, instead of consumer-oriented issues. **********The earnings of many of these basic-industry companies, the strategists say, will benefit from the corporate cutbacks made in recent years, the recent pickup in capital spending and the expected increase in overseas sales resulting from the devalued dollar. The strategists agree that the continued economic expansion favors the producers of goods, instead of companies dependent on the consumer. The consumer, they add, was overextended even before the market crash in October. **********''Once in a blue moon they do well, and this is a blue moon,'' Suresh Bhirud, chief investment strategist at New York's Oppenheimer & Company, said of cyclical stocks. **********Analysts believe that the stocks of companies dependent on the consumer, like retailers, automobiles and housing, will continue to suffer. Strategists are not recommending many of these consumer-oriented stocks because they think individuals will cut back on spending. **********Greg A. Smith, chief investment strategist for Prudential-Bache Securities, is one who argues the case for cyclical stocks. By the beginning of next year, after more evidence on the economy is available, the stocks of these companies should become market leaders, he said. He favors such groups as the chemicals, papers and industrial metals. **********Because many of these stocks are selling at low prices, Mr. Smith said, they have little downside risk. Many are selling at price/earnings ratios equal to or lower than the overall market's multiple of 17. Thus, if the market drops again, he believes sellers will pound the high-multiple issues harder than lower-priced securities. ''It's easy to take a 16 multiple to a 13,'' he said. Mr. Smith also thinks a recession would hurt the stocks of consumer-oriented companies even more than the cyclicals. **********But a recession is unlikely, said Michael H. Sherman, chief investment officer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. He added that the Government's policy continued to be ''geared toward expansion.'' In a continued expansion, the cyclical companies will do well, he said. **********And now that many cyclical stocks have fallen to the levels where they were one year ago, Mr. Sherman finds them ''cheap.'' Those he likes include Alcoa, Alcan, Reynolds Metals, Champion Paper, Georgia Pacific, Inco and Scott Paper. **********Strategists have to discuss something with their institutional clients, and cyclical stocks, along with the budget and trade deficits, are the hot topics at the moment. **********But portfolio managers at banks, insurance companies and mutual funds are not jumping on the bandwagon. According to a flow-of-funds analysis by Salomon Brothers, institutional investors continue to be net sellers of cyclical stocks, as well as those of other groups. **********Laszlo Birinyi, a Salomon Brothers vice president, said money managers were focusing on specific stocks, such as Dow Chemical and International Paper, but were not enamored of cyclicals as a whole. **********Mr. Eisen of Integrated Resources is one portfolio manager who is not placing on bets on cyclical stocks. He does not like most basic industry companies, he said, because they are capital-intensive and people-intensive, poorly managed, have little control over their markets and are simply terrible businesses. But Mr. Eisen concedes that the particular circumstances of strong commodity prices and a weak dollar make it a spectacular time for these companies. **********Steven A. Kroll, executive vice president of E.F. Hutton, also thinks Wall Street is overstating the case for the cyclicals. The increased overseas sales, he says, will not make up for the amount of business these companies will lose in what he thinks will be a much weaker economy. And he thinks stock prices are reflecting that fear. ''I.B.M. did not go from 170 to 116 because it's going to pick up market share overseas,'' he said. **********The portfolio managers at First Boston Asset Management are not going along with the cyclical scenario either. The economic expansion that began in 1982 is ''a little long in the tooth,'' said Michael F. Holland, the president. And if the economy goes into a recession, he said, the stocks of basic industry companies will not make good investments. What will? For his part, Mr. Holland owns high-yield utility stocks, which, he believes, provide a potential cushion against any economic downturn."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/29/business/company-earnings-mcdonald-s-up-9.8.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-01-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 188, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "McDonald's Up 9.8%", "print_headline": "COMPANY EARNINGS; McDonald's Up 9.8%", "body_text": " **********The McDonald's Corporation said today that it earned $113.6 million, or 89 cents a share, in the final quarter of 1986, up 9.8 percent from $103.5 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier.

But as Texaco executives flew back to New York this evening for a weekend of strategy meetings at the company's White Plains headquarters, both companies filed legal documents suggesting that there was still a wide gulf between them and that a bankruptcy filing by Texaco remained a distinct possibility. **********Texaco contended in documents filed today with the Texas appeals court here that it could not afford to pay more than $1 billion of the $12 billion bond required for it to appeal a 1985 jury verdict against it. Being forced to post a bond or other security of more than $1 billion, Texaco said, would create further difficulties in obtaining financing and might force it to seek bankruptcy protection. 'Full Security' Sought **********But Pennzoil, in its filing, said it still wanted ''full security.'' It suggested as ''one possible approach'' that Texaco pledge an amount equal to half of a $10.3 billion damage award in collateral and promise to reduce the level of dividends paid to stockholders and to restrict the creation of new liens on its assets. Pennzoil contended that Texaco could provide the ''full security'' without be forced into bankruptcy. **********Pennzoil also asked that the Texas appeals court to delay a ruling on how much of a bond Texaco should post until Texaco submits a detailed proposal of how it would provide for Pennzoil's security. The appeals court is scheduled to hear arguments on the bond issue Monday, and Texaco has said that an unfavorable outcome could lead it to seek bankruptcy protection immediately. **********The companies are fighting about Texaco's acquisition of the Getty Oil Company in 1984, after Pennzoil had reached what it contends was a binding agreement to acquire three-sevenths of Getty. **********A Texas state court jury ruled in Pennzoil's favor in 1985 and awarded Pennzoil $11 billion in damages. A Texas appeals court upheld the verdict in February, but reduced the damages by $2 billion. Still, with interest, the damage award now totals $10.3 billion. **********Today's court filings came after a week of feverish activity here, with teams of executives, lawyers and financial advisers for both sides gathered for what could be a crucial turning point in the high-stakes case. **********James W. Kinnear, Texaco's chief executive, and Alfred C. DeCrane Jr., Texaco's chairman, met several times face-to-face with J. Hugh Liedtke, Pennzoil's chairman and chief executive, and Baine P. Kerr, the chaitman of Pennzoil's executive committee. Compromises Discussed **********During the meetings, held at Pennzoil's headquarters building here and at a Texaco office, the executives discussed possible compromises both on the bond issue and on an overall settlement of the dispute, according to participants in the case. **********No details of the settlement discussions were available. But people familiar with the talks said that Texaco had made several proposals and that Pennzoil was considering possible counterproposals. **********The threat of bankruptcy and the exchange of proposals have turned this latest round of negotiations into a high-stakes poker match. Pennzoil, which would become just another of Texaco's unsecured creditors in the event of a filing under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, must decide if Texaco is bluffing with its bankruptcy threats. **********For its part, Texaco must decide whether it is really willing to become the largest company ever to file for bankruptcy in order to escape the bond provisions. In bankruptcy, Texaco would risk the wrath of shareholders and creditors and suffer limitations on its ability to operate. **********Texaco is already under severe and increasing financial pressure. On Wednesday, according to court documents filed today by Texaco, the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company canceled a credit line with Texaco because of the uncertainty over the company's future. **********Texaco is said to be studying its financial situation to determine how long it can continue to operate without bankruptcy protection. While creditors are becoming more and more jittery, Texaco is believed to have created a cushion for itself by drawing down several hundred million dollars from its credit lines earlier this year. **********In New York Stock Exchange trading today, Pennzoil's stock jumped $5.25 a share, to $92.25. Texaco, which was the most active issue, with almost 5.8 million shares changing hands, dropped 37.5 cents, to $31.875."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/30/business/business-digest-wednesday-september-30-1987.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 676, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1987", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1987", "body_text": " **********International **********President Reagan told Japan and West Germany they needed the ''gumption'' to take unpleasant economic medicine for the benefit of a debt-burdened, sluggish world economy.

Civil servants fainted at their desks from hunger. An army private confessed to joining a coup attempt because the plotters promised him food for his children. South Korea started to send aid. Inflation Down, Exports Up **********Today, Ghana is climbing back. The difference appears to be four years of economic initiatives combining free enterprise and austerity that aid experts are closely watching as a test case for the revival of other stagnating, state-dominated African economies. **********Since the program was adopted in April 1983, inflation has dropped from 123 percent to 25 percent, and exports have climbed by 76 percent, to $773 million last year. After shrinking from 1981 through 1983, the economy expanded at an average of 5 percent a year from 1984 to 1986. **********The economic measures, largely drawn up by the World Bank, have been tough. In four years, Ghana's national currency, the cedi, has been devalued by 5,600 percent. It has dropped from a fixed rate of 2.75 to the dollar to a floating rate, currently 158, that is set by a weekly foreign-exchange auction. **********The Civil Service, which in the late 1970's was growing four times as fast as the population, has been trimmed and is scheduled to be cut by 15,000 workers, or 5 percent, in each of the next three years. **********The Ghana Cocoa Board has cut its ranks in half, from 92,000 workers in 1982 to 48,000 today. Some 10,000 more workers are to be let go this year. **********Thirty state enterprises are to be identified this year for liquidation or sale to private interests. The Cocoa Board plans to sell half of its 92 plantations. **********To cut cocoa smuggling to Ghana's free-enterprise neighbors, Ivory Coast and Togo, the Government has doubled real prices paid to cocoa farmers, the source of two-thirds of the nation's foreign exchange. **********Finally, in this city where African socialism was the unquestioned credo for so long, the Government is to inaugurate Ghana's first stock exchange next month. **********To ease Ghana through these changes, Western governments are committing increasing amounts of aid to Ghana, a nation of 13 million. Last year, donors made aid commitments of $391 million. This month, donors gathered in Paris to review Ghana's request for $575 million in aid for 1987.  [ They pledged to meet the request. ]  ''Ghana is beginning to pull in more and more because, frankly, most Western governments are looking for an African success story,'' an American economist here said. The Changes Are Startling **********The changes in this pleasantly laid out capital are startling. Beeping lines of passenger cars and brightly painted mammy wagons - small open-sided buses or trucks - clog the thoroughfares, a contrast with the empty boulevards of four years ago when drivers were allotted a monthly gasoline ration of six gallons. At the Makola Market in Accra, stalls are stacked with pyramids of tomato paste, bushels of rice and glinting displays of galvanized buckets. **********The bustling market symbolizes the ideological turnaround of Ghana's leader, Flight Lieut. Jerry J. Rawlings, 39 years old. When he seized power in 1979, he warred with Accra's formidable market women. He placed controls on food prices and had violators flogged and their shops bulldozed. In a losing battle with the laws of supply and demand, he eventually razed the market. **********After a hiatus of civilian rule, he seized power again on Dec. 31, 1981. After two years of indecision, he lifted price controls, and the stalls filled up with goods again. Last December, a new market hall with a metal roof and a concrete floor was inaugurated with great fanfare by Mr. Rawlings. **********Despite the crowded markets, many Ghanaians complain that they cannot afford the goods on sale. In the market, four tomatoes cost 25 cents. A bottle of beer costs 75 cents. ''Living conditions were better under the British - everyone knows that,'' said Augustus Yankey, secretary general of the Trade Union Congress. Despite his dissatisfaction, Mr. Yankey said he saw ''no alternative'' to the current economic program. **********But many Ghanaians say they resent the behind-the-scenes power of foreign economic experts here. University students, many of whom are studying for nonexistent jobs in the Civil Service, were cheered this month by the news that President Kenneth D. Kaunda of Zambia had bowed to popular pressure and abandoned an economic austerity program similar to Ghana's. 'Beggar Status' Charged **********But many of their elders seem to be traumatized by the last 30 years, and they are slow in responding to the old nationalist fire bells. **********The current issue of Christian Messenger, one of the few independent voices here, carries a somber editorial titled, ''Thirty Years After Ghana's Independence.'' **********''Our once-rich and prosperous nation, which boasted of substantial revenues from exports of our abundant natural resources which in the past earned us the name Gold Coast, has now been reduced to beggar status, subsisting almost exclusively on foreign loans and aids,'' the editorial read. **********On March 6, the 30th anniversary of Mr. Nkrumah's proclamation, Ghanaians gathered once again around the huge black stars of the Independence Arch in Accra. **********''I think we must admit that independence has not brought to fruition the great hopes and dreams of our people,'' Mr. Rawlings told the subdued crowd. ''March 6, 1957, gave birth to political freedom. When are we, as Africans, going to translate this political freedom into economic freedom? When? That is the question that I want to leave to you tonight.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/21/business/yen-rise-cuts-sony-s-profit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 169, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yen Rise Cuts Sony's Profit", "print_headline": "Yen Rise Cuts Sony's Profit", "body_text": " **********The Sony Corporation, a leading Japanese maker of video equipment, said today that the rise of the yen had cut its profit by more than half. **********Earnings of the parent company and its worldwide subsidiaries plunged 56 percent in the five months ended March 31, to about 13 billion yen, equal to $93 million.

Fidel V. Ramos, has warned that the current cease-fire, while bringing a temporary halt to the fighting, has allowed the rebels to openly step up their propaganda work. It is an assessment that the rebels seem to share. **********Christine, who uses the revolutionary title Ka for ''kasama,'' the Tagalog word for comrade, moves from village to village, sometimes alone and sometimes with a partner. She introduces farmers to the concepts of feudalism, imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, and teaches them to sing her revolutionary songs. **********''The revolution will not succeed through armed struggle alone,'' Christine said. ''The people must understand why armed struggle is necessary.'' **********One of her superiors, a veteran of 14 years who calls himself Ka Joe, agreed, saying: ''We are a political army. We are not only engaged in fighting.'' **********It is primarily the underground organizers like Christine, backed by force or the threat of force, who have spread the influence of their movement into what Joe said was more than 40 percent of the towns and villages of Pangasinan. 'A Victory Already For Us' **********Ka Levie, one of only two men from the original 60 New People's Army fighters who are still in the field after 18 years, said he believed that the 60-day cease-fire, which may be extended next month, was a ''big step forward'' for the insurgency. **********''Both on the local level and on the national level, and even overseas, we can present our programs openly,'' he said. ''No matter how the cease-fire comes out, it is a victory already for us.'' **********Noting that the ousted Defense Minister, Juan Ponce Enrile, had used much the same reasoning in condemning the truce, he said, ''Enrile is a very realistic person.'' **********During the first month of the cease-fire, which began Dec. 10, the Communists held 200 ''mass meetings'' with the people in Pangasinan, Joe said. The meetings were far more open and more frequent than those held before the cease-fire. A Dramatic Expansion **********The armed insurgency, which began not far from here in Tarlac Province in 1969 with 60 men and 35 weapons, now fields a regular fighting force estimated by American analysts at 16,000 to 23,000 troops. **********The rebels say they have 12,000 well-armed guerrillas and 20,000 part-time fighters, backed by thousands of active organizers like Christine. **********According to the military, the insurgency has extended its political influence into 62 of the nation's 73 provinces. **********Western analysts and Philippine military leaders say the insurgency's dramatic expansion in recent years is based on its political work at various levels as much as on military action. **********Indeed, since 1980, when the Communists brought their insurgency to this province in central Luzon, a three-hour drive from Manila, they have fought just 15 small engagements here with the armed forces, Joe said. **********And when military action is considered, he said, ''we are always thinking in terms of a political gain.'' **********In agreeing to let a reporter move about with them through several villages not far from the main highway, the rebels specified that the precise locations should not be identified. Discussion of Rebel Program **********Sitting in the living room of a sympathetic village chief one recent morning, Joe listened intently to a 10-minute interview on the Government radio station with Carolina Malay, one of the insurgency's leading spokesmen. **********As she answered the interviewer's respectful questions, it became clear that for the first time, the rebels' political platform was being seriously discussed as an alternative for the nation. In the interview, Ms. Malay discussed rebel proposals for land redistribution, economic restructuring and an eventual sharing of power between the rebels and the current Government. **********Pangasinan Province is a difficult challenge for the insurgency, Joe said, because most of the province is in a flat plain covered by a network of roads. **********For this reason, the rebels have been able to consolidate only a few areas that they fully control and can defend against attack. For the most part, they live in a shadow world just beneath the surface, relying on sympathetic villagers for food and lodging. 'It's All Mobile' **********''It's all U.G.,'' said Joe, using the insurgent jargon for underground activities. ''There is no physical base. It's all mobile.'' **********He said local residents provide information and protection against military patrols. **********''Before the military can reach this place,'' he said as he ate lunch at a farmer's house with his unit's weapons and communications equipment in full view, ''the masses will do their part in security, and we will be gone.'' **********That morning, Joe had been among the first to rise, drawing water from the village pump and sweeping the dirt floor as his hostess heated the wood stove for breakfast. **********Later, as the workday began and the family headed out of the house, Joe set to work in the front room, his radio transmitter beside him, his aides resting nearby. **********Messengers began to arrive, bringing dispatches on folded onionskin paper, and Joe, a ranking local rebel leader, scribbled replies that he then sealed thoroughly with tape. Plans A, B and C if Truce Falters **********He said his current assignment involved monitoring the cease-fire in Pangasinan. The rebels, he said, were prepared for a military offensive if the truce comes to an end. **********''There is a Plan A, there is a Plan B, there is a Plan C,'' he said. ''If the cease-fire breaks down, every unit will know what to do.'' **********In Pangasinan, Joe said, the rebel troops are organized mostly into compact platoons with some small assassination squads whose task is to seize arms from soldiers and policemen. **********There are also village militia units that enforce local control and can be mobilized as a reserve. **********At Christine's side as she walked through the rice fields the other day was her husband, Ka Bong, a soft-spoken 25-year-old soldier in the New People's Army. **********Bong is one of the elite regular troops, armed with automatic weapons, who Joe said may begin to carry out larger-scale engagements in the province in the next stage of fighting. 'Revolutionary Justice' **********Though he said he had taken part in few battles, Bong is experienced in carrying out ''revolutionary justice'' -reinforcing his wife's classroom lessons with selected ambushes and assassinations. **********Christine and Bong said they had not seen each other very often since their marriage a year ago, as they pursued their separate roles in the insurgency and made dates to meet every month or two. **********Christine, who comes from a farming family in Pangasinan, won a scholarship to study accounting in Manila, but left college in her final year to join the underground movement. **********Bong, who did not finish high school, began his work with the movement as a labor organizer before joining the New People's Army four years ago. **********Today, as they walked across the sun-baked rice fields, he was on a short furlough to be with her during the birth of their child, which they expected within days. Neither was armed. Leaving Baby 'With the Masses' **********Once the baby is born, Christine said, they plan to ''leave it with the masses'' to be reared by villagers sympathetic to their cause. **********''The revolution can handle the care and teaching of the baby as a revolutionary baby,'' said Joe. **********''I know it will be hard,'' said Christine, ''but I will do it for the sake of the people.'' **********One recent evening, a local mayor visited one of his distant farming hamlets, where Christine and her husband were spending the night. **********He seemed, in talking to a reporter, to be unaware that the hamlet had been thoroughly infiltrated and that most of the residents appeared to be supporters of the insurgency. **********When he had left, a group of local rebel supporters gathered openly with Christine for a discussion of their activities. **********Talking with a visitor during this discussion, their answers to questions had a well-drilled uniformity rarely encountered in this lively and opinionated country. Some Gains for Peasants **********According to Joe, the rebels have succeeded in many cases in winning lower farm rents, increased wages for labor and reduced interest rates on loans. He said some farmers have been organized into work collectives. **********In return, villagers offer logistical support and are urged to join revolutionary organizations and to make ''voluntary contributions'' to the rebels, he said. **********The social and agrarian benefits have been gained by organizing farmers to demand better conditions and by backing their demands with an implicit threat of force, and sometimes with force itself, Joe said. **********''If the landlord uses force against the peasant, the N.P.A. will use its political power against the landlord,'' he said. **********Christine said: ''The N.P.A. talks to the landlord three times. Then the military component takes over. This is something the landlords know.'' **********Within the local population itself, party control is maintained by a ''revolutionary committee.'' A List of 12 Victims **********In the thatched, dirt-floored house of a farmer where he and his wife were spending the night, Bong spoke in the light of an oil lamp about his work in carrying out ''revolutionary justice.'' **********On a scrap of paper he wrote the names of 12 men who had been killed after a revoutionary committee had determined that they had been involved in land-grabbing, usury, banditry, theft of animals or the brutal killings known as ''salvagings.'' **********Walking through the sunny fields the next morning, Christine said she had encountered a new difficulty during the past year in recruiting young men, who had begun asking why they should take up arms against President Corazon C. Aquino. **********And with the cease-fire, Christine said, she had a new task, revisiting a few of her own recruits who had chosen to accept Mrs. Aquino's invitation to surrender and return to their homes. A Welcome From a 'Rich Peasant' **********She told of one soldier named Janet whom she had persuaded to return to the hills, arguing that, good-hearted though Mrs. Aquino might be, ''nothing has changed in our lives since she became President.'' **********This morning, Christine and Bong visited another village where a well-to-do farmer classified by the revolutionaries as a ''rich peasant'' welcomed them to join his breakfast. **********''My home is open to them, day in and day out,'' said their host, who also works as a government official. ''In this area I think all of us are sympathizers. There are three or four houses whose sincerity we doubt.'' **********He said he held his government job to help support both his family and the rebels. ''Without my government work I would not be able to support the movement the way I do,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/22/business/maxwell-could-issue-stock-to-buy-harcourt.html": {"writer_name": "Edwin McDowell", "pub_date": "1987-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 564, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Maxwell Could Issue Stock to Buy Harcourt", "print_headline": "Maxwell Could Issue Stock to Buy Harcourt", "body_text": " **********Robert Maxwell, the British publisher who has made a $2 billion takeover offer for Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., says that his British Printing and Communication Corporation may issue stock to help pay for the acquisition. **********''Whatever financing is required is available,'' he declared in an interview on Wednesday in his suite at the Waldorf-Astoria. **********Mr. Maxwell flew to New York on Wednesday aboard the Concorde to be here during today's scheduled meeting of Harcourt's board.

At the same time, interest in alternative fuels has waned. **********But in Africa, experts say, an energy crisis could cause problems by the end of the next decade. **********The consumption of wood in Africa, which has the fastest growing population of any continent in the world, is expected to double by the year 2000, compared with 1975. **********''You have very high population growth rates and very rapid rates of deforestation occurring at the same time,'' said Kjell A.

Perelman, chairman of the Revlon Group Inc., made his third offer in less than a year for the Gillette Company. To some, his quest is beginning to seem obsessive. **********Especially to Gillette, which thought it had bid good riddance to Mr. Perelman in November by paying greenmail - a premium for his stock - and having him promise not to buy any more Gillette stock for 10 years or ''seek control or influence'' over the company without its consent. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Perelman is once again seeking control - having asked Gillette's board this week for permission to make a formal offer. Obviously, the company underestimated his tenacity. While some analysts assume Mr. Perelman is merely trying to put Gillette in play so he can capture a $300 million raider consolation prize (which he'll get if Gillette is acquired by anyone else before Nov. 24), others believe he truly covets the company. ''Ron really wants Gillette,'' said Nancy Hall, an analyst with Smith Barney Upham & Company. ''It's exactly the kind of company Ron likes to buy. It has excellent cash flow, strong brand names and a lot of distinct pieces that can be sold off easily.'' **********But that's not all. With a little imagination, it is possible to concoct some other, deeper explanations for the remarkable doggedness of Mr. Perelman's pursuit, such as the following: **********The ad play. Under Mr. Perelman, Revlon's ads have become a lot more risque (the ice cube seduction commercial for Revlon's Intimate perfume is the best example) and he believes Gillette could profit from a similar infusion of tastelessness. He thinks the old Noxzema shaving cream campaign (''Take it off; take it all off'') was a model of personal care product advertising, although he reportedly considers it ''insufficiently flagrant.'' If done with style and genuine salaciousness, a new ad campaign, contends Mr. Perelman, could encourage men to shave two, three or even four times a day. **********The dental floss play. Gillette's crown jewel, as Mr. Perelman's sees it, is really the Oral-B unit, which controls 28 percent of the American toothbrush market. He wants the division for its astonishing advances in dental floss technology. He dreams of producing a scented, colored, flavored and completely edible floss that would finally eliminate the awkward disposal problems. He also wants to introduce $25 gourmet dental floss under the Claudia label (named after his wife). Supporting this theory is the fact that for years Mr. Perelman has given dental floss to friends on their birthdays. ''Ron thinks gum care is very important,'' said one acquaintance. **********Theme and variation. Mr. Perelman, a creative financier, needs another household name like Revlon to develop a unique kind of synergy. After taking Gillette private, his next task would be to bring Revlon public once again. A year later Gillette would reemerge as a public company, and Revlon would go private. The next year Gillette would go private and Revlon would come public. Divisions would be shuffled between the two companies so that laggards are sold to the public at a high multiple, while thriving units are taken private at a steep discount. ''It'll be like three card monte - with class,'' said a Perelman colleague approvingly. **********The trend play. There are various projects in the works at Gillette to design better razor blades, and some might be on the market in a couple of years. Mr. Perelman, however, is taking an even longer view. He believes that a current trend - the earlier onset of puberty -will accelerate rapidly in the future. One Revlon research scientist has convinced Mr. Perelman, who secretly prides himself on being a long-term investor, that by the year 2300, most five-year-old boys will be shaving regularly. ''Gillette,'' said a Revlon official, ''represents an entirely new investment concept - hormonal leverage.'' **********Lack of Growth. Richard Arbitrage, a psychotherapist specializing in takeover-related ailments, said that Mr. Perelman is going after Gillette because he's bald. ''Gillette has a strong position in male hair care products with The Dry Look,'' said Dr. Arbitrage, ''and that tells you all you need to know. Perelman's pursuit of Gillette is purely compensatory.'' **********Consistency. Mr. Perelman does not actually want Gillette, but he will keep pursuing it until his death anyway. The reason? He yearns to remove the one flaw in greenmail - the fact that it doesn't provide a predictable revenue stream. He seeks to achieve something no other raider ever has, a state of perpetual greenmail. If he succeeds, Gillette will pay him $30 million to $40 million dollars every year for not acquiring the company. ''Frankly,'' said one Perelman aide, ''we think 'tribute' is a much nicer word than 'greenmail.'

Will this thriving center of trade, manufacturing and finance wither away in the Communist embrace - or will it help to liberalize and invigorate the economy of China? **********Those were key questions when a group of Western economists organized by the American Committee on Asian Economic Studies recently visited Hong Kong, Shanghai, Wuhan and Beijing. **********Despite deep anxieties about what happens after 1997, Hong Kong is still booming. On the Communist mainland, one hears constant complaints about ''Chinese laziness,'' but in Hong Kong this myth is put to rest; laziness and zip are clearly functions of economic systems, not ethnicity. **********''There is a bustle, an energy, a sense of hard work and productivity that goes beyond even the obvious prosperity,'' Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said of Hong Kong. She called it a transportation planner's dream, with its trams, buses, clean taxis and harbor ferries, not to mention its new subway. She found no poverty of public service in this bastion of free enterprise: ''The new Harbor Tunnel was built by the private sector, as will be the next, and possibly the new airport.'' **********But private capital is poised for flight. Many business people say they are planning to leave for other countries; what is holding them now, some say, are aged parents whom they are unwilling to leave. A Chinese builder, whose home is in Singapore but who has projects going in Hong Kong, said everyone he knows is holding as much money as possible in foreign currency, ready to leave Hong Kong quickly. **********James T. H. Tsao of the United States International Trade Commission, who traveled with the group, said that several countries had already revised their investment laws to ease the inflow of capital from Hong Kong. Much of it is flowing to Singapore and Taiwan. China has its heart set on regaining Taiwan, but it will be much harder to acquire than Hong Kong, where the population of 5.5 million is dependent on the mainland for the bulk of its food and nearly half its water. **********China has 1.1 billion people, but its trade with tiny Hong Kong still matters greatly. Since 1951, China's trade balance with Hong Kong has always been in surplus. For the last 34 years, Hong Kong has been China's second-biggest trading partner, except for three years, 1965, 1968 and 1969, when Hong Kong held the No. 1 position. **********A Japanese economist, Miyohei Shinohara, chairman of the Institute of Developing Economies in Tokyo, startled the Chinese Prime Minister, Zhao Ziyang, at a meeting in 1982 by telling him that about one-fourth of China's exports were via Hong Kong and about one-third of the foreign exchange earnings came in through Hong Kong. **********He also warned Mr. Zhao that ''if China treats Hong Kong the same as China proper, Hong Kong business interests will flee to Taiwan and Singapore, taking with them their capitalist dynamism, with the result that Chinese exports via Hong Kong will sharply decline, causing the Chinese economy to fall into stagnation.'' He asked Mr. Zhao what he would say to that. The only answer he got from the Prime Minister was: ''The figures of one-fourth and one-third that you gave are overestimates.'' **********Nevertheless, the Chinese are highly aware of the danger of hurting themselves by hurting Hong Kong. On Sept. 26, 1984, Britain and China initialed an agreement permitting Hong Kong to keep its free-market economy for 50 years beyond 1997. Negotiations are now going on over civil liberties, freedom of the press and other legal and economic matters. **********Still, this has not quelled anxieties as ideology within China zigs and zags. The silencing of student protests in Beijing and elsewhere last year disturbed Hong Kong. And just last month, Chinese officials upset many people in Hong Kong by saying they would not interfere in Hong Kong before 1997 ''unless the British Government takes any measure which can influence events after 1997 or impede the smooth handover of Hong Kong.'' **********But China's concerns about the dangers of capital flight from Hong Kong and the crucial importance of keeping open this window to the capitalist world are reinforcing Deng Xiaoping's pragmatic and reformist course. The question is whether China is prepared to go far enough, both politically and economically, to avoid choking Hong Kong off and seriously damaging the development of China. The Chinese leaders, including Mr. Deng, are anything but closet capitalists. They insist they are searching for ''socialism with Chinese characteristics.'' And Hong Kong still feels itself menaced."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/09/world/amid-anger-turkish-chief-defers-us-visit.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1987-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 550, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMID ANGER, TURKISH CHIEF DEFERS U.S. VISIT", "print_headline": "AMID ANGER, TURKISH CHIEF DEFERS U.S. VISIT", "body_text": " **********Spurred by opposition and press criticism, President Kenan Evren of Turkey has postponed a visit to the United States this month in what diplomats describe as a display of anger at recent Congressional actions. **********The Turkish leader's decision, announced this week, underscores the unsettled nature of Washington's relationship with both Greece and Turkey, fractious neighbors within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. **********Greece has yet to commit itself publicly to renewing an agreement on American bases and, during a crisis with Turkey earlier this year, briefly ordered the closing of a United States naval communications facility. **********Some Western diplomats, moreover, fear the upset with Turkey might deepen long-term misgivings about the United States in the region.

Equity funds, by comparison, were up 116.2 percent. **********The fixed-income funds stumbled in the first quarter, rising slightly more than 3 percent, far below the 19.8 percent gain posted by equity funds. **********''It is no longer a one-way street'' in the bond market, Mr. Lipper said. **********Through a combination of luck and foresight, a number of money managers sensed that rates might bounce up, and made or saved lots of money by selling or shifting their portfolios early. **********''A number of portfolio managers seem to have shortened maturities going in to the collapse,'' said Paula Treneer, a senior vice president and director of fixed-income research at the Frank Russell Company, a leading pension fund consulting firm that monitors more than 300 institutional money managers on a monthly basis. **********''But several of the leading investment firms I have talked to this week view current yields as a buying opportunity,'' she said. **********One professional who decided to lighten up on bonds in advance of the selloff is Fred Zuckerman, treasurer of the Chrysler Corporation and manager of its $3.5 billion pension fund. **********Early last month, Chrysler startled some in the investment community when it sold half of its $1 billion dedicated bond portfolio and moved the money into stocks.  * * * **********''We were directionally correct, and I wish we could have sold them all,'' Mr. Zuckerman said in a recent telephone interview, ''But we still have some bonds, and those are tucked away. A lot of forces have driven rates up to what I think are intellectually unsupportable levels. Six months from now, I have to think that rates will be a lot lower.'' **********Nonetheless, Mr. Zuckerman said that within the next year he wants the pension fund's portfolio mix to be half bonds and half stocks. Right now, Chrysler's bond portfolio has an average maturity of about 17 years. **********''When the bond market gives us the opportunity, I would like to cut the average maturity in half,'' Mr. Zuckerman said. William R. Buecking, senior vice president and director of fixed-income investments at Kemper Financial Services, which has more than $30 billion in fixed-income securities under management, said that ''about a month ago we shortened the average maturity of our funds by about 2 years, to between 5 years and 12 years, and that saved us a lot of money.'' **********''We also went short bond futures or bought put options,'' he added."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/20/business/prospects.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 670, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PROSPECTS", "print_headline": "PROSPECTS", "body_text": " **********Soviet Signs Read 'Slow' **********Will Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost translate into many more Soviet-American business dealings? Not anytime soon, according to a recent political-risk study by consultants Frost & Sullivan. **********The reform policies of the Soviet leader - along with last week's Soviet-American pact to limit the risks of nuclear war and an imminent treaty eliminating some land-based missiles - may be signals that bode well for foreign business ventures in the Soviet Union. But progress will be slow, the study concluded. **********''No one knows how much of their own decisions Soviet enterprises can make,'' said Ronald H. Linden, Frost & Sullivan's senior adviser on the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. ''Can they use foreign suppliers? Where will they get hard currency? It's only recently they've been able to engage in foreign trade.'' **********On the American side, the business community is likely to proceed cautiously because of negative experiences, Mr. Linden said. ''There is a lot of reluctance in the American business community because it was fairly badly burned after the invasion of Afghanistan,'' when trade with the Soviet Union collapsed. **********He added, however, that some high-tech companies in the United States could find a market now in the technology-starved Soviet Union, even with goods considered outmoded here. With the loosening of trade restrictions, he said, ''there's a wonderful opportunity for manufacturers like I.B.M - they could have a great market for previous-generation personal computers.''  Job Seekers Stay Put **********Fewer people are moving to find new jobs these days: The percentage of job seekers who are relocating reached its lowest point in six years in the second quarter of this year, and is likely to drop further, says John Challenger of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago-based outplacement firm. **********About 32 percent of job seekers are relocating, Mr. Challenger said, down from a high of 45 percent for first-quarter 1986 and an average of about 40 percent for the past few years. **********The economy's extended recovery, he said, is one reason people are staying put. ''In bad times, when there are fewer positions available, people have to expand their searches geographically.'' **********But there are sociological reasons, too, Mr. Challenger said - the number of two-income couples, for example. ''It's hard to take a new job out of town when the other member of a couple has a good position,'' he said. And increasingly, ''people want to put down roots in their community, rather than move around the country from position to position in order to get promoted.''  Dockominiums **********With each year bringing the manufacture of more pleasure boats, some private marina owners are turning bigger profits on boat slips by converting their rental slips to long-term leases - or by selling the spaces as ''dockominiums.'' **********The dockominium trend is most popular along the East Coast: ''In 15 years, in some areas, you will find a minority of marinas offering slips on a rental basis,'' said Edward Dougherty, president of the Marina/Consult Corporation of Cataumet, Mass. **********Marina operators may have little choice but to go condo, Mr. Dougherty said. Though they sit on extremely valuable assets - all that waterfront property - many have paltry profits, just 2 percent on sales. They need the up-front income from dockominium sales to maintain their marinas. ''It's very difficult to finance modernization of a marina because it's hard to demonstrate the ability to pay back the loan,'' he said. **********Boat owners, initially hostile to slip prices of $20,000 and up plus annual maintenance fees, are now snapping up dockominiums at a surprising pace. When Colton Homes Inc. offered 117 slips on the New Jersey shore, it anticipated the spaces would take five years to sell out. Instead, Colton says, it has sold nearly 50 slips within four weeks at prices from $22,500 to $58,250.

Mr. Sobhita is now in hiding from the police, who arrested more than two dozen priests after the day's violence. More than 60 people were killed, most of them apparently shot by the police. **********One of the younger monks clustering close to the speakers said, ''If we are not militant, and if the country is not protected, then there will be no more Buddhism.'' **********S. P. Senaratne, a layman who helped organize the demonstration, said of the young monks, ''It has come to a point where they are uncontrollable.'' **********Asked if he favored violence, the young monk, a member of the militant Inter-University Federation of Students, said: ''Why not? We are being provoked. We are being shot. We cannot stand any more.'' **********At that moment, without warning, a small tear-gas canister arched its way into the crowd, leaving a fragile contrail under the leaves of the bo tree. **********More tear gas followed, and although most of the monks broke and ran, some charged toward the police line, shielding their faces from the gas with their saffron robes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/22/world/syrian-armored-force-is-reported-outside-beirut.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 697, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Syrian Armored Force Is Reported Outside Beirut", "print_headline": "Syrian Armored Force Is Reported Outside Beirut", "body_text": " **********About 4,000 Syrian troops dismantled their camp near Beirut today and, according to unconfirmed radio reports, scouts from the force were in a suburb of the capital. **********The reports of movement were seen here as indications that Syria might be moving in to quell a week of fighting among Moslem factions in West Beirut. **********Moslem leaders in the Lebanese Government and chieftains of the feuding militias had requested such intervention during a meeting Friday with Syrian officials. **********Early today, a report by a Lebanese source in Damascus that the Syrian forces ''are already rolling'' was misinterpreted to mean that their troops and tanks had begun moving into West Beirut, the Moslem sector of the capital.

They said the Bank of Japan might have bought about $200 million through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Such actions would temper the dollar's decline but not prevent it. **********Some forecasters are predicting much lower levels for the dollar during 1987. **********''We are looking for another pretty healthy decline in the dollar this year,'' said Jonathan Francis, managing director of the world economics group at Wharton Econometrics, an economic forecasting firm. **********By the end of this year, he said, the dollar should be 14.5 percent lower against the yen than it was at the end of 1986 and might fall 14 percent more against the mark. Various Choices Loom **********West German officials are not likely to take any additional monetary steps before their nation's elections, but several policy options are available to prevent the mark from rising further. **********The most widely discussed possibility is a cut in Germany's discount rate, a move the Bundesbank has been reluctant to take because of a rapidly expanding money supply and an abiding fear of inflation. **********Such a move by Bonn would win favor in Washington.

''These scandals are going to be numerous before the presidential elections.'' **********Lionel Jospin, the Socialist Party's first secretary, said today that he ''denied totally these accusations, these fabrications and what is even necessary to call calumnies.'' **********The arms sales to Iran, which took place from 1983 to 1986, came to light in February 1986. The sales were disclosed by La Presse de la Manche, a small newspaper based in Cherbourg, western France. It reported that in 1985 two ships registered in the Bahamas carried more than 140,000 shells supposedly destined for Portugal, Brazil, Thailand and Pakistan. Instead, the 155- and 203-millimeter shells were shipped to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. **********Socialist officials were not linked to the sales at the time. The Socialist Defense Minister who succeeded Mr. Hernu, Paul Quiles, began an investigation that has focused on Luchaire, an arms maker that said it needed the sales to stay in business. Secret Army Report Is Disclosed **********Little more was heard until two magazines, L'Express and Le Point, ran articles this week about the contents of a secret report by the French Army's comptroller general, Jean-Francois Barba. **********The magazines reported that Daniel Dewavrin, Luchaire's president, told investigators that the Defense Ministry, including two generals, helped keep the sales secret. **********Pierre Joxe, leaders of the Socialists in the National Assembly, said today that he wants to question the Defense Minister, Andre Giraud, on Wednesday to determine how the allegations surfaced. **********An investigating magistrate, Michel Legrand, is expected to ask Mr. Giraud to declassify the report. Report Outlines Diversions **********According to the Le Point article, the army report says that 3 to 5 percent of the sales revenue went directly to the Socialist Party. The magazine added that the funds were diverted through intermediaries, private bank accounts, and foreign companies and could have totaled $7 million. **********The articles in L'Express and Le Point also said that Admiral Pierre Lacoste, former head of France's intelligence service, reported the sales to President Mitterrand and Jean-Francois Dubos, a technical counselor to former Defense Minister Hernu. **********According to newspaper report today in Beirut, the sales of the artillery shells were tied to talks with Iran on Teheran helping help win the release of French hostages in Beirut. **********The newspaper, As Safir, a leftist publication in Beirut that disclosed the American arms sales to Iran, also said the talks fell through at the last minute because the negotiations were disclosed or because France was unable to make a decision. **********Supporters of the Iranian revolution are believed to be holding five Frenchmen seized in Lebanon and to have executed a sixth. **********France severed diplomatic ties with Iran last July after an official in the Iranian Embassy here refused to appear before a French judge to answer questions about terrorist attacks in Paris."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/07/business/argentina-gets-waiver-for-emergency-loan.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1987-11-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 819, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Argentina Gets Waiver For Emergency Loan", "print_headline": "Argentina Gets Waiver For Emergency Loan", "body_text": " **********Argentina yesterday was granted a a waiver from meeting economic performance targets set by the International Monetary Fund, Treasury and international monetary officials said. , The waiver would allow Argentina to receive a $500 million emergency loan from governments around the world. The loan had been contingent upon continued compliance with the I.M.F. targets on inflation, interest rates, government spending and currency exchange rates. Argentina had met virtually none of those goals but has adopted new policies intended to bring it into compliance. **********The waiver should go far toward quelling rumors that have swept the financial markets in recent days that Argentina was preparing to suspend interest payments on its foreign debt. The nation owes more than $8 billion to United States banks alone. 'No Interest Moratorium' **********''There will be no interest moratorium,'' one international banker said. **********The waiver for Argentina and a debt accord between a bankers' committee and Brazil ''are positive developments of key importance for world financial markets,'' David C. Mulford, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, said yesterday. **********For some time, bankers had held special hopes for Argentina. It was the first country to arrange new financial assistance after the decision last spring by the world's major banks to set aside reserves for loan losses equal to 30 percent of their third world loans. Bankers have hoped that disbursement of the new money will go smoothly, and the waiver means that it should. **********Meanwhile, a plan by Brazil and its leading creditor banks to pile new loans on top of old will face stiff opposition as they seek approval of the plan from banks around the world, banking analysts said. Terms of Brazil Plan **********The plan calls for Brazil to contribute $1.5 billion from its foreign-exchange reserves - and for commercial banks to contribute $3 billion -into a short-term loan fund for the country. The money will be used to pay off $4.5 billion in past-due interest that has been accruing since Brazil decided last February to suspend interest payments on most of its $100 billion debt. **********The plan also provides for the banks' contribution to be replaced quickly with longer-term bank financing, so it amounts to the banks' providing new loans to pay the interest on old loans. **********It is this aspect of the plan - formally known as interest capitalization - that has the investment community distressed. They consider the Brazilian package little different from the established pattern in debt talks on making new loans that are recycled as interest. 'This Is Not Prudent' **********''If you talk to any banker, he'll tell you that you shouldn't be lending interest to a delinquent borrower,'' said George M. Salem, the senior banking analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ''This is not prudent banking practices, and I don't think other banks will like it.'' **********But bankers involved in the talks defended the plan. **********''This preliminary understanding is the first step on the road back to creditworthiness for Brazil,'' said William R. Rhodes, chairman of Brazil's 14-member bank advisory committee. He declined to comment further, but international-banking sources said the plan had a number of positive elements from the banks' perspective. **********For example, they noted that at the meeting of the I.M.F. in Washington in September, the Brazilians told the bankers they would contribute nothing toward payment of the $4.5 billion of overdue interest. Under the plan announced yesterday, they will pay $1.5 billion. Payments May Start This Month **********Additionally, the bankers noted, because of the mechanics of the plan, the banks will receive a $500 million cash payment as early as later this month. Most importantly, Brazil has told its bankers that it hopes to use money from the I.M.F., the World Bank and governmental creditors to resume paying interest in full, starting Jan. 1. **********''All of those are major steps,'' said one banker who participated in the talks. **********Debt experts had feared that the stalemate between Brazil and its bankers might continue into 1988. What brought the two sides together was a threat that banking regulators in the United States might force the banks to write down the value of their Brazilian debt. **********Asked if the regulators had forced a deal, one banker said, ''It's a fair statement.'' He added that, in recent days, top bankers had been in touch on the matter with Michael Bradfield, the Federal Reserve's general counsel; Edwin M. Truman, director of the division of international affairs at the Fed, and Mr. Mulford of the Treasury."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/09/world/the-summit-excerpts-from-protocol-how-the-missiles-will-be-eliminated.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1055, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Excerpts From Protocol: How the Missiles Will Be Eliminated", "print_headline": "THE SUMMIT; Excerpts From Protocol: How the Missiles Will Be Eliminated", "body_text": " **********Following are excerpts from a protocol to the arms treaty signed today, governing the elimination of missile systems:  Items of Missile Systems Subject to Elimination **********The specific items for each type of missile system to be eliminated are: **********For the United States of America: **********Pershing II: missile, launcher and launch pad shelter; **********BGM-109G: missile, launch canister and launcher; **********Pershing IA: missile and launcher; and **********Pershing IB: missile. **********For the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: **********SS-20: missile, launch canister, launcher, missile transporter vehicle and fixed structure for a launcher; **********SS-4: missile, missile transporter vehicle, missile erector, launch stand and propellant tanks; **********SS-5: missile; **********SSC-X-4: missile, launch canister and launcher; **********SS-12: missile, launcher and missile transporter vehicle; and **********SS-23: missile, launcher and missile transporter vehicle.

Simple cartoon animation is even cheaper, about $40,000 to $60,000 for 30 seconds. But the price range is higher when cartoon characters appear next to real products or in real places - about $50,000 to $100,000 to produce a 30-second spot. **********But perhaps most important, industry insiders say that animated commercials stand out in a cluster of TV ads, and viewers are likely to pay attention to them.

The bills had an average discount rate of 5.82 percent at last week's auction. **********The six-month bills were sold at their lowest rate in more than three months, bringing an average discount rate of 5.68 percent. On April 6, six-month bills sold at an average discount rate of 5.63 percent. Last week the bills were auctioned at an average discount rate of 6 percent. **********Evidence that a stronger dollar is building confidence among foreign investors in United States debt securities appeared in Tokyo yesterday, where the Ministry of Finance announced that Japanese investors bought $14 billion worth of foreign bonds last month. **********In its report, the Ministry of Finance did not break down how many of those bonds were issued by the United States. But the figures came as something of a surprise. **********''The numbers surprised us a little bit,'' said John J. Niehenke, a senior vice president in the government securities department at Nomura Securities. ''We won't know until later in the month what securities those funds were invested in, but my guess is that more than half of the total is in dollar bonds.'' **********Donald E. Maude, chief economist at Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc., said that ''as long as perceptions are there that the dollar is stable at these levels, the Japanese will be buying Treasury bonds.'' **********Secondary trading in taxable corporate and tax-exempt municipal debt securities closely tracked the Government markets yesterday, with prices ending slightly higher. **********Although corporate bond traders say that interest in issuing new debt securities seems high, only a few new issues were priced yesterday. **********Among those was a $300 million public offering of 11.45 percent first-mortgage bonds by the Americold Corporation, the nation's largest supplier of public refrigerated warehouse space. **********The bonds, which mature in 2002, were priced at par. **********The First Boston Corporation acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which was rated B-1 by Moody's Investor Services and B-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. The bonds are secured by liens on 35 refrigerated warehouse properties. **********In the tax-exempt market, Kidder, Peabody & Company bought a $49.4 million issue of King City, Wash., general obligation bonds at competitive bid. **********The serial bonds carry maturities ranging from 1988 to 2007. Coupons range from 4 7/8 percent for the 1988 issue to 7.70 percent for the bonds maturing in 2007. **********The issue has been rated AA-1 by Moody's and AA by S.&P. **********Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:  (000 omitted in dollar figures)       $      3-Mo.

Mr. Hamill said he was confident the deal would go through. ''We feel the consumer has so many choices, especially by using the new minilabs.'' he said. ''We can show to the regulators that in no way is what we're doing going to reduce options for the consumer.'' **********The minilabs to which he referred are photofinishing machines installed in retail stores, a development that has put pressure on such wholesale photofinishers as Colorcraft and idled parts of their processing plants. **********The result has been a consolidation in the industry that has squeezed the smaller wholesale photofinishers, Mr. Hamill said. Kodak, which has operated its own processing lab, began to acquire some of these independents about a year ago. **********Mr. Hamill is familiar with the Kodak style because he started out with the Rochester company in 1954, after graduating from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and worked there for five years. **********Then he joined another company in Rochester that was subsequently taken over by the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company. Mr. Hamill became manager of the plant for 3M and worked there until he moved to Colorcraft in 1968 as vice president for operations. **********Colorcraft had been taken over by Fuqua Industries a year earlier. Under Fuqua, Colorcraft, based in Durham, N.C., has grown from a company with $3 million in annual sales to a $300 million operation. Sales are expected to double again with the addition of the Kodak units.

Using the symbols is a significant advantage in a nation with a literacy rate under 50 percent. **********This week's issue of the Islamic Banner, the party's own Islamic newspaper, was devoted almost entirely to the annual hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca. It also had an article explaining that women should not have the same right to divorce as men because women are more emotional. **********''This is the paper issued by the party of Mubarak,'' said Dr. Nawal el-Saadawi, one of Egypt's leading feminists. ''Who is paving the ground for these Islamic groups? It is the Government itself, and the first victim will be the Government.'' An Ambiguous Approach **********Other secular-minded Egyptians and some foreign diplomats say that Mr. Mubarak's regime has adopted an ambiguous and possibly risky policy of repressing violent Islamic fundamentalists while also trying to take advantage of Islam's growing popular support. **********''Clearly there is a two-track policy,'' said a Western diplomat. ''I don't think they make any bones about it. There is an attempt to bring responsible Islamic figures into the system and a very clear policy that fundamentalists who engage in violence are going to get clobbered.'' **********The security forces have rounded up hundreds of people suspected of membership in underground Islamic extremist groups. But the Government, cloaking itself in Islamic symbols, also has allowed the Moslem Brotherhood, which is still officially banned, to become the major opposition voice in Parliament. **********Government officials say the President, by offering a place in the Government to the Brotherhood, which was banned for its suspected involvement in a 1954 assassination attempt on President Gamal Abdel Nasser, hopes to drive a wedge between it and such clandestine fringe groups as the organization Holy War, or Jihad. That group assassinated Mr. Mubarak's predecessor, President Anwar el-Sadat, in 1981. Tactic Raises Questions **********But others question whether the ''Islamic trend,'' as it is called here, can be split. They see the various groups as generally united in purpose as well as religious belief. **********''Some in the Government say, 'Look, the tactic is working; The mainstream Islamic trend has renounced violence,' '' said a diplomat. ''But there's another theory that has a lot more doubts about the Moslem Brotherhood, the Islamic charities and so forth, that they are really a front, that in the end, the Islamic movement is all one and the same thing.'' **********Their tactics are different, he said, but the goals the same: the imposition of sharia, or strict Islamic law. **********The fundamentalists can point to some victories in their efforts to make Egypt more Islamic. A clause in the 1971 Constitution saying Islamic law was ''one of the sources of legislation'' was changed in 1979. It now reads, ''Islam is the religion of the state, Arabic is its official language and principles of Islamic laws are its main sources of legislation.'' Victories of Islam **********In the spring of 1985, Egyptair, the national airline, stopped serving alcoholic drinks after complaints from Islamic fundamentalists. **********A 1979 decree by Mr. Sadat, which required a husband to get his wife's consent before taking a second wife, was struck down in court in 1985. It was replaced by a watered-down version that did not give women the same protection. **********Last May, at the end of the Ramadan, the Moslem month of fasting, the Government lifted a long ban on public prayer rallies. **********The party members in Parliament who nominated Mr. Mubarak for another six-year term in October elections recently sprinkled their speeches with Islamic references. A deputy from the Moslem Brotherhood even chimed in and compared the President with the Caliph Omar, the second successor to Mohammed in the early days of Islam. Challenge Remains **********But it is the Government's television station that plays perhaps the strongest role in promoting Islam. Beside several general Islamic announcements each day, the station carries a weekly sermon by the charismatic Moslem preacher, Sheikh Metwali el-Sharawi, who mixes classical and colloquial Arabic and gives down-home examples of injunctions from the Koran. His popular hourlong sermon is watched by tens of millions each Friday afternoon, Even so, the Government is still challenged by underground Islamic terrorist groups that were blamed for recent assassination attempts on Hassan Abu Basha, a former Interior Minister who directed the roundup of fundamentalists after President Sadat was killed, and Makram Ahmed, an editor critical of the rise of fundamentalism. **********The key man in the Government's fight against the underground cells is the tough-talking Interior Minister, Maj. Gen. Zaki Mostafa Ali Badr, who cracked down on the city of Asyut in Upper Egypt after fundamentalists rioted there following Mr. Sadat's assassination. **********The other day at a police exhibit, General Badr took aside several reporters from the opposition press, which has been highly critical of him. 'I'd Arrest 20,000' **********''If the safety of Egypt was at stake,'' he snarled, ''I'd arrest 20,000 in an hour.'' **********Some diplomats are concerned about the general's tactics. **********''The instinctive response of the security people is not to do any investigative or police work, but just to pull the book out and round up the first 500 names and start roughing them up,'' one said. ''If they weren't Jihad when they started on them, they will be by the time they come out of jail.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/19/business/company-news-texas-nuclear-plant-s-cost-is-up.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 201, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Texas Nuclear Plant's Cost Is Up", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Texas Nuclear Plant's Cost Is Up", "body_text": " **********The cost estimate for the South Texas Project, a 2,500-megawatt nuclear power plant under construction near Bay City, Tex., has been raised 5 percent, or $300 million, the project's owners said.

Since May 20, when the average reached 2,215.87 - the lower end of a trading range it had been stuck in for six weeks - the blue-chip index has moved relentlessly higher. Some market analysts are beginning to talk about a 2,500 Dow. **********The stock market was bolstered yesterday, as in recent days, by gains in the bond market and by the firmer dollar. Receding inflation fears, underscored by a sharp drop in the Commodity Research Bureau's index, also contributed to a growing confidence on Wall Street. **********And analysts said that the continued weakness of the Tokyo and London stock exchanges might bode well for Wall Street, as foreign funds are funneled into American stocks and bonds.Trend Found Impressive **********The Dow's gains during its recent climb have not been spectacular, but the overall market trend is beginning to impress the experts, especially since many people had given the five-year-old bull market up for dead when the dollar plunged in mid-April and American interest rates started moving higher. **********But the dollar has rebounded modestly, to a level that analysts say should help American industry compete better. That, in turn, has raised hopes that the American trade deficit will become manageable. The bond market took its cue from that, and interest rates fell accordingly. **********''This market has good underlying strength; people just didn't believe it,'' said Laszlo Birinyi, head of research at Salomon Brothers. He noted, however, that the current Wall Street rally was still a blue-chip rally.

Yesterday's decline was the third-largest ever. The London market has also been sliding. The Financial Times index of 100 leading shares fell 21.5 points, to 2,244.6; it lost about 55 points in the two previous sessions. **********Analysts said the declines in London and Tokyo, where stock market records were recently set, was the result of profit taking and investor concern over the diminished chances for interest rate cuts in Britain and Japan. **********Many analysts now expect the Japanese to start putting more money into American stocks. **********''Where else can you buy a market at 17 times earnings?'' said Bernard J. Spilko, a managing director at Julius Baer Securities. He said many foreign investors ''feel that the U.S. is very undervalued'' compared with other markets where price/earnings ratios are much higher.Some Are Cautious **********Still, some analysts are holding up a caution flag. Jack Solomon, a technical analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company, said the Dow ''could probably go to 2,475, but that's it.'' **********Mr. Solomon added, ''The market didn't come up with the same breadth and the same volume that it has in the past.''

''They'll cream the market.'' Yesterday on the Big Board, 907 stocks rose and 692 fell.

Not anymore. ''Bargains abound,'' said Charles E. Cardwell, the letter's editor, in his November issue. **********Mr. Cardwell, a private investor who has published the newsletter for six years from Kingston, Tenn., describes himself as ''sort of a disciple of Benjamin Graham,'' the father of value-oriented securities analysis. The newsletter publishes several lists identifying stocks selling below book value (net worth) and below net current assets (a company's working capital minus all liabilities). **********Mr. Cardwell said his own preference was a list of stocks trading under net current assets with profitable operations. In that category, the newsletter pointed to, among others, Glenmore Distilleries, selling last week on the American Stock Exchange at about $25, with $30 in net current assets and $38 in book value, and Oak Hill Sportswear, trading over the counter at $4.25, with $5.39 in net current assets and $6.30 in book value. **********Another Astute Investor list identifies more speculative stocks selling for at least 30 percent less than their net current assets. A third list picks stocks selling below book value with an earnings yield - earnings per share divided by the stock's price - of at least 16 percent. **********Mr. Cardwell believes in buying attractive values, particularly ''when everybody is scared silly.'' The Astute Investor's emphasis on bargain-hunting may have guided Mr. Cardwell in setting a price for subsciptions to the monthly publication. At $24 annually, the letter is among the lowest-priced in the industry."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/29/world/an-official-s-role-in-an-unofficial-war-a-former-ambassador-s-account.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2287, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AN OFFICIAL'S ROLE IN AN UNOFFICIAL WAR: A FORMER AMBASSADOR'S ACCOUNT", "print_headline": "AN OFFICIAL'S ROLE IN AN UNOFFICIAL WAR: A FORMER AMBASSADOR'S ACCOUNT", "body_text": " **********At the Congressional hearings on the Iran-contra affair yesterday, Lewis A.

Tambs appeared before the joint committee to discuss his role in Central America while he was United States Ambassador to Costa Rica. Here are excerpts from his testimony:  A 'BROAD MISSION' **********MARK A. BELNICK, EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT TO STAFF COUNSEL. The instruction from North, as you've testified to it, was to open a military front against Nicaragua, the Sandinista Government, in the south, from Costa Rica, right? **********A. Yes. **********Q. Sir, that's not a typical ambassadorial function, is it? Opening military fronts? **********A. Well you must understand that ambassadors have a very, very broad mission. One of them, of course, is to defend the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic. And you're undoubtedly aware that the second stanza of the Sandinista hymn opens with the phrase declaring that the United States is the enemy of humanity. So one might suspect they have a certain position regarding the United States.  * * * **********Q. Do you recall in June or July of 1986, when a plane got stuck in the mud at the airstrip? **********A. Well, but that's why I suggest to you - **********Q. Yes sir. **********A. Mr. Belnick, that perhaps the field was not completed, because they had at least, was it three or four aircraft eventually stuck in the mud there. **********Q. All right, sir. And do you recall that in the specific occasion that I'm referring to, June or July of 1986, the plane which landed there and got stuck there was carrying military cargo? **********A. It was, indeed it was. **********Q. All right, sir. What happened to that cargo, do you know? **********A. What happened to the cargo? **********Q. Yes, sir? **********A. Well, eventually it was lifted out. **********Q. Did there come a time in the same period - **********A. May I - may I also pause here a moment? **********Q. Yes, sir. **********A. And that is that the agreement we had with the Costa Rican Government was that the airfield would not be used either for storage of supplies or provisions. And that any aircraft landing there would have already completed its mission. And that it would land empty and it would be refueled. And so I was consequently somewhat surprised to find out that the aircraft was stuck in the mud. That's probably why it was stuck in the mud, because it was loaded and I guess it was an emergency.  NOT JUST BAND-AIDS **********Q. Were you surprised also to find out that it was carrying military cargo? **********A. Well, it did not really, you know, I never saw a manifest. But I did not certainly assume they were only dropping - **********Q. Do you want to finish the sentence? **********A. No, not really. **********Q. You didn't assume they were only - **********A. Band-Aids, how's that? **********Q. Band-Aids? Right? **********A. Band-Aids, how's that, okay? **********Q. So it didn't surprise you that military cargo was involved? **********A. No. **********Q. All right, sir, did you speak to Colonel North, or any other official of the United States Government about your concern that the plane being loaded, period, violated the agreement you had negotiated with the Government of Costa Rica? **********A. Oh, I believe I fumed around but I don't recall calling Colonel North. **********Q. All right, did you speak to Tomas Castillo about that? **********A. Yes, you must understand one thing, Mr. Belnick, we're dealing with American lives. And if American pilots, private American pilots, are on this aircraft and there is an emergency, obviously you must choose to - in my opinion, right - I would choose to save American lives, rather than have the aircraft crash. **********And also, a downed aircraft in Costa Rica would certainly be a greater embarrassment than even one stuck in the mud.  A TALK WITH SINGLAUB **********Q. Sir, you know General John Singlaub? **********A. Yes, indeed I do.  * * * **********Q. He came to Costa Rica in the spring of 1986 and you saw him there, right? **********A. That's correct, yes.  * * * **********Q. Tell me what the discussion was. **********A. Is that General Singlaub came to Costa Rica and called the embassy and asked for the courtesy of the mission. All right? And consequently, as an old friend, we invited him over . . . So Tomas Castillo and I sat down and gave him an unclassified briefing . . .  * * * **********Q. Did you discuss also Eden Pastora? **********A. We discussed Eden Pastora, as we did the other forces down there.  * * * **********Q. All right, sir. Now after you had your discussion with General Singlaub, did he contact you again and tell you that he had seen Commander Pastora? **********A. . . . Let me make this clear to you . . . No one in the mission had anything to do with arranging a meeting between him and Comandante Zero.  * * * **********Q. Did you speak to him about his meeting with Commander Pastora? **********A. Yes, he called up and said that he had seen Pastora, and since my mission was always to try and find out what was going on and tell our friends up here in Washington, I said, ''Why don't you come over for dinner?'' And I remember we had tacos that night. Okay?  'UNITED STATES-IANS' **********Q. Aside from the tacos, did he give you a copy of an agreement - that is, General Singlaub - give you a copy of an agreement that he had entered into with Commander Pastora? **********A. Yes.  * * * **********Q. All right, sir. Now, the agreement provided as set forth in your cable - quote - the United States will provide food, ammunition, medicine, maps, military needs for Pastora's troops, including new men who join his army, training advisers. Correct? **********A. Yes, and when I saw that I said, ''You cannot negotiate for the United States Government.'' He said that does not mean the United States Government. He said that means we private United States-ians - huh? **********Q. United States-ians? **********A. That's right. That's a good Spanish word, right?  * * * **********Q. Sir, did you record in your cable - **********A. Well, I . . . Obviously, I have to send the text as given to me. I can't change the text. **********Q. I understand, sir. Did you make comments at the end of this cable . . . ? **********A. Well, the fact is that the comments were given verbally to the deputy C.I. **********A. representative in Costa Rica, right? And he took them down and sent it out and I did not review the cable. Right? May I read the comments? **********Q. Yes, sir. And let me read it because the copy is somewhat blurry. Ambassador's comments: In spite of written agreement, we have reservations that Pastora will comply. However, since Singlaub is envoy of Senator Helms and will report to him his observations, and his own reservations upon return to Washington, Senator Helms may re-evaluate his position regarding Pastor **********A. Singlaub and his colleague, Barbara Studley, assisted - assured Ambassador, rather - that Pastora agreed that all supplies, equipment, training, will be delivered, provided, via UNO, the United Nicaraguan Opposition. Nothing will be delivered until Pastora's men are moved inside Nicaragu **********A.  'NOT EVALUATING' **********A. Well I was reporting, not evaluating. **********Q. But that is the report you made concerning the agreement? **********A. Yes, but that's a report. That's what you get paid to do. **********Q. All right. Now sir, did you receive a quick response from the State Department to this cable? . . . A cable signed by Deputy Secretary Whitehead, but coming from and through Assistant Secretary Abrams to you, dated March 29, 1986? **********A. Yes. **********Q. . . . Assistant Secretary and Deputy Secretary said, among other things: I was astounded by the report of the agreement concluded between General Singlaub and Eden Pastor **********A. I fail to understand how you and the C.I. **********A. representative could associate yourselves with an agreement which purports to commit the United States to provide military materiel and advisers in exchange for a series of undertakings on Pastora's part. **********Now sir, did you understand from the text of the agreement how the State Department might have concluded that this was an agreement that purported to bind the United States of America? **********A. Well, first of all, we did not associate ourself with the agreement; we were reporting on an agreement between two private individuals.  * * *  A QUESTION OF USE **********Q. It did not occur to you that despite disclaimers of U.S. Government involvement, somebody might be able to use the text of that agreement to indicate that the United States, through the embassy, had committed itself to supplying military needs of Eden Pastora? That was not your view? **********A. My view was that we should report to Washington what we had found out. And that's what we did. **********Q. Sir, would you look at LAT Exhibit 4, which is a cable that you then received from the Secretary of State, in which he told you that in his request the State Department legal adviser had reviewed the legal issues raised by the agreement and the secretary continued - quote: Based on his review, the legal adviser concludes that it is impossible to rule out the possibility that your disclaimers of U.S. Government involvement notwithstanding, Pastora might attempt to use the Singlaub agreement to pressure or embarrass the United States Government. You are therefore instructed to inform Pastora that Singlaub is not authorized to negotiate on behalf of the United States, that the United States Government does not consider itself bound by Singlaub's agreement and that U.S. Government policy remains as stated to Pastora on March 7 by me, Secretary of State Shultz and Assistant Secretary Abrams, etc . . .  * * * **********Q. Sir, did you carry out the instruction to inform Eden Pastora that the United States Government did not consider itself bound? **********A. We did.  * * * **********Q. Did you . . . convey the information that the United States Government disclaimed that agreement? **********A. Well, I wasn't going to talk to him anyway - because I never talk to him. **********Q. So you didn't speak to him about that? **********A. No. **********Q. And did you speak to General Singlaub about that? **********A. No.  WHO KNEW OF STRIP?  * * * **********SENATOR DANIEL K. INOUYE. Would you be surprised if you were told that Secretary Abrams has testified that he was not aware of the construction of the airstrip before it was started? **********A. Well, I can't speak for Secretary of State Abrams. I would be somewhat surprised, but - **********Q. Is his memory failing him? **********A. Well, he might have been distracted. . . . I can't speak for him.  * * * **********Q. Secretary Abrams has testified that he does not recall discussing this assignment with Ambassador Tambs during the September 1985 Central American chiefs of mission conference. **********A. I did not know, sir, that he testified that. **********Q. But you are convinced that at that time he did discuss it with you, as you've testified? **********A. Yes, sir.  * * * **********SENATOR WARREN B. RUDMAN. Did you feel you were being kind of hung out to dry? **********A. No, the fact is that, as Ambassador I am responsible and was responsible. What I find to be disconcerting, to put it mildly, is to see officers who were carrying out what they believed to be orders from their legitimate superiors now in effect seeing their careers sacrificed. . . .  ACTING ON ORDERS **********Q. But everything you did in relation to the southern front and all of the things involved even with General Singlaub were essentially a result of directions that you got from relatively high ranking officials in the White House, the Agency and the State Department? **********A. That's correct sir. **********Q. And you assumed that they had authority to give them? **********A. Yes. **********Q. And you carried out their orders to the best of your ability? **********A. Yes sir. **********Q. And now that you did, and you're no longer part of the establishment -now you're off in Arizona teaching -people are kind of suggesting in their testimony that Old Tambs did it all by himself. That outrage you? **********A. Well, it's very complimentary in a way . . . I thought they were doing a splendid job and I was delighted to be working with them because they wanted to win. **********Q. And they ought to stand up and tell us what a splendid job they were trying to do, shouldn't they? **********A. Well, I can't speak for them, but - **********Q. But you would advise that? **********A. Yes.  * * * **********REPRESENTATIVE DANTE B. FASCELL. And if you were doing something that was constitutional, and within the law, and certainly a worthwhile objective - keeping the Communists out of Central America - why would guys cut and run at this point and leave you hanging out there in the wind, with regard to this issue? **********A. I don't know, sir; you'd have to ask them. **********Q. But you do feel that way, don't you? My perception of what's happened is correct, is it not? **********A. Well, I do feel that the field officers have not - who went forward, right, are not being backed up by the superiors who gave them the orders."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/07/business/norway-hints-oil-delay.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Norway Hints Oil Delay", "print_headline": "Norway Hints Oil Delay", "body_text": " **********Norway said today that some of its proposed North Sea oil and gas projects might have to be postponed because it does not want to make excessive investments.

Col. Oliver L. North's description of his secret meetings in bathrooms, his purchase of leotards for his daughters, the poison pill he took along with him to Teheran provided another day of drama in the Senate chamber today. **********Colonel North held his ground, presenting himself as a man sure of his objectives and not at all displeased wth his own ingenuity. **********''I saw that idea, of using the Ayatollah's Khomeini's money to support the Nicaraguan freedom fighters as a good one,'' he told the Congressional committee and the nation at large. ''I still do. I don't think it was wrong. I think it was a neat idea.'' **********Such homespun touches as calling a scheme to use funds from an Islamic revolution to finance a Central American insurgency ''neat'' seemed to work in the colonel's favor. **********''I'd say it was a powerful performance,'' said Senator Paul S. Trible Jr., a Virginian Republican. **********But some members of the committee and spectators were dismayed by what they viewed as his disregard for the law and his contemptuous attitude towards the Congress.  A Question of Pride **********For a covert operative, Colonel North also appeared to take peculiar pride in the way his fame had spread. He recounted how the Iranian middleman Manucher Ghorbanifar told him, '' 'I have read about you, you have been in the papers' - in fact, by then I think I'd even been in Izvestia -'And I know what you really do in your spare time. You support the Nicaraguan resistance, don't you?' '' **********''Among other things,'' the colonel said he answered. **********''All our enemies knew it,'' replied John W. Nields Jr., the House committee counsel, ''and you wanted to conceal it from the United States Congress.'' **********The two men, both boyish in appearance, both projecting intensity and commitment, both leaning forward on the edges of their seats in the crowded, ornate hearing room, seemed to personify a generational cleft tracing back to the 1960's. The dichotomy was most sharply drawn in the split-screen television images: Colonel North in his crisp uniform, his thick, dark hair closely cropped, his face baleful; Mr. Nields, a battered tan briefcase by his side, his thinning blonde hair falling over his ears and collar, his expression suggesting restrained and righteous anger.  Close to Contrite **********Questioned about a security system installed at his Virginia home by others involved in the operations and for which he submitted phony bills, Colonel North came as close as he has so far to sounding contrite. ''I did probably the grossest misjudgement that I have made in my life,'' he said. But he added that the Government should have paid for the system because it was his service to the nation that had placed his life and those of wife and children in jeopardy. **********Colonel North also displayed strong emotion when he turned to the subject of his purchases, with money earmarked for the covert operation, from a store called Parklane Hosiery. **********''You know that I've got a beautiful secretary, and the good Lord gave her the gift of beauty, and the people snicker that Ollie North might have been doing a little hanky-panky with his secretary,'' he said in dead earnest. **********He then went on to testify, ''Ollie North has been loyal to his wife since the day he married her. And the fact is I went to my best friend'' - he said, referring to Mrs. North - ''and I asked her, 'Did I ever go to Parklane Hosiery?' **********''And you know what she told me?'' he continued. '''Of course you did, you old buffoon, you went there to buy leotard for our two little girls.''' **********He wrote the check on an operation account, he said, because he was owed money for ''what I spent in pursuing that covert operation.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/21/business/advertising-gsd-m-wins-coors-beer-job.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1987-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 256, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; GSD&M Wins Coors Beer Job", "print_headline": "Advertising; GSD&M Wins Coors Beer Job", "body_text": " **********After a creative shootout among its three agencies in the last six weeks, the Coors beer account has been awarded to GSD&M Advertising of Austin, Tex., which has generally been known as a specialist in the Hispanic market. **********The account for the nation's fourth-largest-selling beer, which is spending an estimated $40 million for advertising, had been at Foote, Cone & Belding in Chicago.

Gorbachev next week could turn out to be vital for a withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. **********''This certainly could be a turning point toward an Afghan settlement,'' said Edward P. Djerejian, Senior Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs. ''But that depends on the Soviet Union translating its state of intent to withdraw into actual facts on the ground.'' **********Another senior State Department official confirmed that the Afghan war would be ''a major topic of discussion.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev said in an interview with NBC News this week that he would discuss a timetable for withdrawal of Soviet troops with Mr. Reagan. Arms Embargo on Iran **********In other regional issues, Washington is expected to press Moscow to support a United Nations resolution imposing a global arms embargo on Iran for refusing to accept a cease-fire and settlement with Iraq in their seven-year-old war. President Reagan has also said in recent statements that he would bring up problems in Central America. **********But the officials acknowledged that despite the heightened expectations here, there is a strong possibility that no progress would be made on Afghanistan, on other regional issues, or on scientific and cultural exchanges and similar topics, which are referred to as bilateral issues. **********Arms control dominated the summit meetings between the two leaders in Geneva and Reykjavik, despite predictions that regional issues would be high on the agendas. **********The United States has been heartened by indications from Moscow that it is dropping its insistence that the composition of an Afghan coalition government has to be decided before agreement can be reached on a withdrawal timetable. The indications were relayed by First Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli M. Vorontsov to Under Secretary of State Michael H. Armacost in Geneva last month. **********''They sure as hell are talking a different game,'' a State Department official said. Afghan Withdrawal Date **********The United States is pressing the Soviet Union to set a date for withdrawal from Afghanistan. An Administration official said today at a White House briefing that the United States wants a withdrawal of Moscow's 115,000 troops before the end of 1988. **********The Russians have hinted that they are willing to withdraw if the United States cuts off military aid to the Islamic guerrillas and helps set up a coalition government that will prevent the killing of Afghan officials who have supported the Soviet presence. **********''We want to avoid a situation where after the forces pull out there will be bloodshed, which may result in the deaths of thousands of people, maybe millions of people,'' Yevgeny M. Primakov, a Soviet specialist on the Middle East and head of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, said at the Brookings Institution today. **********As for the withdrawal timetable, Mr. Primakov said: ''I believe the force will be withdrawn next year. This is my personal point of view.'' Can't 'Leave Them Prey' **********This week the Afghan leader, Najibullah, said the withdrawal of Soviet troops could be completed within 12 months. **********Under accords already signed by Pakistan and Afghanistan at United Nations-sponsored talks in Geneva, the withdrawal process must begin and all outside aid to the Afghan insurgents must end 60 days after an agreement on a timetable is signed. In a television interview Thursday, President Reagan said the United States would not make a commitment to suspend aid to the guerrillas for a year if the Russians agreed to withdraw within that time. ''You can't suddenly disarm them and leave them prey to the other government,'' he said of the guerrillas. **********Trying to clarify the President's remarks, an Administration official said in today's briefing that ''noninterference presumably would begin'' after the 60-day period, ''as well as Soviet withdrawal.'' Impasse in Gulf Talks **********Moscow sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1979, saying it had been asked to help the Government put down domestic resistance. At the same time, the Afghan leader was overthrown - in the third coup in less than two years - and Mr. Najibullah's predecessor, Babrak Karmal, was installed as the leader. **********On the Persian Gulf, the United States is said to believe that the arms embargo against Iran is even more urgent since efforts by the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, to persuade Iran to accept a cease-fire reached what seemed to be an impasse Thursday. **********''We will be asking the Soviets to come forward with their position during the summit,'' Mr. Djerejian said. **********Thus far, the Russians have refused to begin discussions at the United Nations on an arms embargo, indicating that they prefer that Mr. Perez de Cuellar continue his negotiating efforts. **********''I don't think that any resolution on an end to supplies of arms to Iran will stop those supplies, because the main source of supply is a free market,'' Mr. Primakov said today. Arab-Israeli Conflict **********Other regional issues that could be raised at the summit meeting include the Arab-Israeli conflict, and other areas where Soviet or Soviet-backed troops are involved, such as Nicaragua, Angola, Cambodia and Ethiopia. **********In addition, President Reagan is expected to raise with Mr. Gorbachev the impasse between the two countries over new embassies in each capital. **********The United States is considering whether to raze part or all of its new embassy in Moscow, which is riddled with Soviet electronic eavesdropping devices. The United States has refused to allow the Russians to occupy a new diplomatic compound in Washington. **********Additional issues likely to be discussed include improving access for American officials to the Soviet public, scientific agreements on ocean study and sharing of basic science, and cultural exchanges. **********The plight of Eskimos living on the American side of the Bering Strait, who are separated from their families on the Soviet side, may also come up. Administration officials have assured Senator Frank H. Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, that they will discuss helping the American Eskimos visit their Soviet relatives."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/24/business/real-estate-connecticut-busy-area-for-offices.html": {"writer_name": "Shawn Kennedy", "pub_date": "1987-06-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 799, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Real Estate; CONNECTICUT BUSY AREA FOR OFFICES", "print_headline": "Real Estate; CONNECTICUT BUSY AREA FOR OFFICES", "body_text": " **********IN some real estate circles the conventional wisdom has held that when a New York company relocates to the suburbs, it moves near the top executives' homes. **********As skilled lower-rank workers get harder to find, however, more companies base their decisions to move on the housing needs and commuting convenience of all their employees. **********For this reason, in the past few years the eastern part of Connecticut's Fairfield County - where the average cost of a house is only about a third as much as in the Stamford-Greenwich area - has emerged as a fair-sized commercial office center. Black & Decker, Chesebrough-Pond's, ITT, Tetley Tea, TIE Communications and Richardson-Vicks are among the companies that have built or leased office buildings there. **********According to Richard F. Gretsch Jr., a senior vice president and broker with the Stamford office of Albert B. Ashford Inc., a real estate brokerage company, there is now a total of more than four million square feet of new office space in eastern Fairfield County, which includes the towns of Trumbull, Shelton, Bridgeport, Stratford and Fairfield. Most of it has been built in the past 10 years. **********Among builders who have responded to the stepped-up demand for office space in the area is Robert D. Scinto. Since 1978 he has put up more than one million square feet of office space in 16 buildings in Trumbull, Shelton and Fairfield. His development company has approval for the construction of an additional one million square feet of space in the area. **********''This office market is definitely driven by the affordability of the area's housing,'' said Mr. Scinto, who started in the construction business as a plumber. ''Also, the area was the next logical location for a major development push after Stamford. The land was available, the appropriate zoning was in place and the utilities could support the growth.'' **********The expansion of Route 8 three years ago, which provided easier access to Bridgeport, Stamford and Waterbury, was another factor in the area's commercial growth. **********Two years ago Christopher McLeod, a senior vice president of Comp-U-Card, a computerized buying service with headquarters in Stamford, started seaching for expansion space for the company. But what it would have to pay for new offices was not his primary concern. **********''Comparative rents were not the most important consideration,'' said Mr. McLeod. ''In our serivce-oriented business, labor costs are the dominant figure. In order to hire and keep the type of people we need, we wanted to be in a location that was most convenient for them.'' **********Recently 300 Comp-U-Card employees moved into a new building in Trumbull, a town that is no more than 15 minutes from home for most of the company's employees. **********So far much of what has been built in eastern Fairfield County has been relatively modest in size, compared with new office structures in Stamford and nearby Westchester County. Mr. Scinto's buildings, for example, have averaged less than 80,000 square feet. But last month the developer broke ground for his largest project to date: a 10-story, 291,000-square-foot office tower in Shelton. Mr. Scinto said his new building would be the largest speculative office structure to be built in Fairfield County outside Stamford. **********The new building is part of a 50-acre office complex at the intersection of Bridgeport Avenue and Commerce Drive. Known as Enterprise Corporate Park, it already holds two 140,000-square-foot office buildings. Among the tenants are Olivetti USA's Bunker Ramo banking division. **********The office building, which will be the first of two towers planned for the complex, will have floors that average 28,620 square feet in size. The facade will be of red granite and silver reflective glass, and there will be a parking garage for 990 vehicles. **********Mr. Scinto said he also plans to build a 250-room hotel in Enterprise Corporate Park. **********Despite the pace of development and the continued demand for space in eastern Fairfield County, not all office buildings have found tenants quickly. According to Mr. Gretsch, the vacancy rate for the region is about 22.3 percent. Of the 4.5 million square feet of office space, a little more than one million square feet stands empty. **********To set his buildings apart, Mr. Scinto said he tries to offer unusual design and top quality materials. ''These kinds of things are loss leaders,'' said Mr. Scinto. **********Space in the new office tower will average $17 a square foot, excluding utilities.

But he added that they contain ''some hopeful elements.'' **********''There are efforts to expand communications between the races,'' he said, ''and there is evidence that those efforts can bear fruit.'' **********Mr. Shultz avoided any mention of the trade sanctions enacted by Congress nearly a year ago over President Reagan's veto. But he rejected the notion that American business could better influence South Africa by leaving. **********''It would be counter to the objective of ending apartheid if we were to isolate South Africans and withdraw our influence from that society,'' he said. **********''That is why we strongly support the continued presence of American business in South Africa. American companies have been in the forefront in the business community in promoting equal opportunity for their employees and in developing the managerial skills of blacks.'' Gloomy Report Is Hinted **********President Reagan is scheduled to send Congress a report this week on the impact of the sanctions. Mr. Shultz gave no hint of what the report would say. However, a State Department official said, ''Since last year's bill was passed by Congress, apartheid is still there, reform is stalled, violence and repression continue, negotiations have not yet begun.'' **********Nevertheless, Mr. Shultz cited some hopeful signs, including a meeting last July in Dakar, Senegal, between dissident Afrikaners and officials of the outlawed African National Congress, the principal group fighting to overthrow the apartheid system. The meeting was strongly criticized by South Africa's President, P. W. Botha. **********Mr. Shultz added: ''I emphatically reject the fatalistic notion that the country's future has already been written, that it is too late for accommodation. I know that there is hope for the future.'' **********He said that because many South Africans had urged the United States to state clearly not only what it opposed, but what it was for, Mr. Shultz had decided to spell out, in some detail, his vision of the kind of society that should emerge after the apartheid system of racial separation is ended. **********This included ''a new constitutional order,'' he said, ''establishing equal political, economic and social rights for all South Africans without regard to race, language, national origin or religion.'' He also called for ''a democratic electoral system with multiparty participation and universal franchise for all adult South Africans.'' Human Rights 'Guarantees' **********Mr. Shultz also urged ''effective constitutional guarantees of basic human rights,'' including ''the right to liberty and security of persons; the right to freedom of speech and the press, peaceful assembly and association, and practice of religion.'' **********He also cited the ''right of labor to organize and pursue peacefully its economic objectives; the right not to be deprived of property except by due process of law and upon payment of just compensation; the right of movement within the country, emigration and repatriation, and the right of individuals and communities to use their own languages and develop their cultures and customs.'' **********In addition, Mr. Shultz called for an independent judiciary, a division of power between the national Government and local authorities and an economic system that ''enables all South Africans to realize the fruits of their labor, acquire and own property and attain a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.'' **********''I particularly feel the frustration,'' he said, ''of having only limited influence, of not being able to make things right down there.'' **********However, he added: ''It is not within the power of the United States or any other country to impose a solution to South Africa's problems.

C. Clark, a lawyer who formerly worked in New York, on 55 felony counts in an extension of the insider trading case centering on R. Foster Winans, the former reporter for The Wall Street Journal. **********The indictment accused Mr. Clark, 37 years old, of participating in the insider case and evading income taxes in 1980, 1981 and 1982, according to Howard Wilson, the chief of the criminal division of the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan. **********Mr. Clark was also accused of embezzling $3.7 million from clients at Appleton, Rice & Perrin, the law firm where he worked, and of failing to report it as income. **********Carl H. Loewenson Jr., the assistant United States Attorney in charge of the case, said Mr. Clark, if convicted, could be sentenced to as much as five years in prison on each of 53 of the counts and also fined ''hundreds of thousands of dollars.'' **********Mr. Clark's attorneys, F. Lee Bailey and Kenneth Fishman, both based in Boston, did not return telephone calls to their offices. Mr. Bailey was understood to be in Florida, where Mr. Clark now lives. **********Two years ago Mr. Clark was named in the civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission that charged Mr. Winans with ''fraud and deceit,'' accusing him of trading in stocks on the basis of advance knowledge about articles in The Journal. Mr. Winans and three other defendants in the civil case were subsequently indicted on criminal charges as well. But criminal charges were not filed against Mr. Clark. Mr. Loewenson said he would not comment on why Mr. Clark was not indicted until yesterday. **********The other defendants in the case were David J. Carpenter, Mr. Winans's roommate and a former clerk at The Journal; Peter N. Brant, a former stockbroker at Kidder, Peabody & Company, and Kenneth P. Felis, also a former Kidder broker. **********Mr. Brant pleaded guilty to three counts, agreed to cooperate with the investigation and is awaiting sentence.

At the same, continued declines in commodity prices helped reduce fears of future inflation, which also propped up the bond market. **********Although analysts are not sure about the extent or longevity of the Fed's moves toward an easier monetary policy, the belief is widespread that the Fed has already eased policy modestly. **********Besides acting early and often to add funds to the banking system this week, the central bank has acted behind the scenes to defuse the crisis atmosphere by eliminating its limits on the amount of Treasury issues that government securities dealers may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 7 Percent Range Seen ''The Fed has not eased in a broad-scale public sense by reducing the discount rate,'' noted Robert H. Ried, president of Ried, Thunberg & Company, a Westport, Conn., economic advisory firm. ''But we think they have eased enough so that Federal funds will fluctuate around 7 percent.'' **********The overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market was around 7 1/2 percent earlier this month and late last month. **********In London, the largest world's largest market for wholesale bank deposits, the perception that short-term rates would decline led to a sharp drop in rates on three-month deposits, to about 8.06 percent, down from about 9 1/4 percent on Monday. **********Elsewhere in the short-term market, Treasury bill rates continued to plummet, helped by strong demand from investors who want to avoid the risks of the stock or bond market until conditions are more stable. **********By late in the day, three-month bills were about 5.33 percent, down from 5.61 percent and well below the 6.66 percent rate for similar issues as recently as last Friday. #1-Year Bills Off Sharply At yesterday's auction of new one-year Treasury bills, the average rate of 6.45 percent was down nearly a percentage point from the previous auction in late September and was the lowest rate since July. **********In the long-term bond market, securities dealers said demand for Treasury, corporate and mortgage issues remained strong. Besides the demand from investors who have recently pulled funds out of the stock market, the appetite for debt issues has been greatly improved by emerging forecasts of a weak economy and low inflation, they said. **********Many mathematical models of the economy sugggest that consumer spending will decline by $5 billion to $10 billion within a year after a $100 billion decline in wealth. At the steepest point in the stock market's selloff on Monday, wealth had fallen by an estimated $1 trillion this month, causing some economists to predict a sharp slowdown in economic growth, or even a decline in gross national product for a quarter or more. **********Today, the Commerce Department is expected to announce a growth rate of about 3 percent for the G.N.P. after inflation during the third quarter. **********''The economic models all say that consumer spending falls in response to a drop in wealth, but it's a treacherous thing to forecast,'' said Fred J. Levin, chief money market economist at Citicorp Investment Bank. Wealth Measures Fluctuate **********Besides the difficulty of trying to measure how consumer psychology will change, he noted that wealth measures are still fluctuating as the stock market moves up and down. Mr. Levin also noted that economic forecasts must consider the stimulus from lower interest rates and the effects of changes in Government spending. **********Although securities dealers have been glad to see the revival of activity in the long-term bond market, many are amazed that investors have been so quick to set aside the fears of inflation, large budget deficits and interruptions in the investment of foreign capital that plagued the market earlier this year. **********One dealer with close ties overseas noted that some major European accounts were extremely wary of the sharp rise in Treasury bond prices, and that they are not convinced that the problems of inflation and the weak dollar are solved. **********''Some time down the road the market might wake up and realize that the old problems still exist, but for now the scenario people are looking at is a drop in consumer confidence and a weaker economy,'' said Bruce R. Lakefield, executive vice president in the Treasury securities department at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. **********That sentiment was powerful enough yesterday to lift the 8 7/8 percent Treasury bonds due in 2017 by about 3 3/8 points to an offered price of 97 23/32 to yield 9.10 percent. **********As recently as early Monday, that Treasury issue was traded at 85 3/4 to yield 10.45 percent. In the Treasury note market, the 8 3/8 percent issue due in 1992 rose more than 1 1/4 points to a price of 99 14/32 to yield 8.50 percent, down from about 10 percent early Monday. Corporations Jump In **********Corporations have been quick to take advantage of the renewed investor demand for notes and bonds, offering nearly $1.7 billion of new issues yesterday, on top of the $1.1 billion offered Wednesday. **********Strong demand for Treasury securities has helped create a problem for some dealers who have sold securities they did not own and were not able to find elsewhere. **********To alleviate the problem of ''fails,'' or incomplete trades that make dealers nervous about the financial condition of their trading partners, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York told dealers early yesterday afternoon that it was temporarily lifting its $150 million limit on the amount of Treasury securities any single firm can borrow from the Fed, as well as the limits on borrowing single issues. **********Experts in the Treasury market said the shortage of some securities had been aggravated recently by constant rumors of financial problems among dealers that have made many institutions unwilling to continue lending Treasury issues to securities houses. **********The only sector of the bond market not to benefit recently are high-yielding ''junk bonds.'' Those issues, particularly the more recent offerings, have been battered by a perception that companies will have difficulty selling assets at high prices, as well as a downturn in economic activity could hurt earnings enough to raise doubts about some companies'' ability to pay interest and principal on their bonds. **********In yesterday's trading, dealers said prices of junk bonds were mixed, with some issues rising, but others falling, depending on investors' perception of the particular company involved. **********Following are results of yesterday's auction of new one-year Treasury bills:  (000 omitted in dollar figures)          Average Price    93.478        Discounted Rate    6.45%        Coupon Yield    6.90%        High Price    93.529        Discounted Rate    6.40%        Coupon Yield    6.84%        Low Price    93.448        Discounted Rate    6.48%        Coupon Yield    6.93%        Accepted at low price    83%        Total applied for    $21,946,575        Accepted    $9,257,955        N.Y. applied for    $19,559,000        N.Y. accepted    $8,343,750        Noncompetitive    $268,110       The one-year bills mature Oct. 27, 1988."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/03/business/key-rates-490687.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-04-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 200, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEY RATES", "print_headline": "KEY RATES", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/25/world/mexico-city-journal-and-where-are-the-bureaucrats-gone-fishing.html": {"writer_name": "Larry Rohter", "pub_date": "1987-08-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mexico City Journal; And Where Are the Bureaucrats?

But according to a recent study, no one in Mexico does it better, or more often, than the country's two million bureaucrats, most of whom live and work here in the capital. **********When the Mexican Labor Congress recently took a look at the work habits of Mexicans, it concluded to its surprise that the average Government employee spends only 196 days a year on the job. The labor group's study found that every year the bureaucrats get two vacations of 15 days each and 12 days of paid personal leave, in addition to benefiting from 22 days of so-called ''bridge holidays.'' **********The ''bridge'' days are additional time off granted by the Government to extend a patriotic or religious holiday falling on a Thursday or Tuesday through the weekend. Holidays Cost Billions **********Economists say that President Miguel de la Madrid's austerity program, which has limited wage increases for workers in and out of public service, has made such paid days off more highly valued than ever before. **********The subject has a particular resonance now, as Mexico is experiencing its worst economic crisis in half a century and the Government is calling on all Mexicans to help the country get back on its feet. The newspaper El Financiero, which specializes in business news, estimated that the bridge holidays alone cost the country at least $1.5 billion a year and are a major contributor to low productivity. **********''If days in red appear on the calendar for January, February, May and December, plans are made to take some sort of trip,'' the newspaper complained, noting that many bureaucrats say they suffer from ''boredom'' on the job.  Raffish Street Life **********In recent years, jugglers, clowns, acrobats and especially fire-breathers have become one of the most familiar sights at any major intersection here. Men and women entertain motorists waiting at traffic lights with magic tricks, hoping to amuse them enough to receive a few pesos in return. **********This month, however, the Government decided to try to put a stop to the practice by offering the entertainers alternative employment: selling books to the commuters from the same street corners. Some 300 people immediately signed up, attracted by promises of commissions of up to 50 percent, and the intersections are now clogged with book salesmen. **********As part of the same program, the Government said it would soon offer scholarships to three-month job training programs for the fire-breathers and their colleagues. The goal, the Education Ministry said, is to enable the entertainers to have ''a dignified and active participation in the social and productive life of the country.'' **********The street corners continue to be the workplace of itinerant vendors trying to eke out a living by selling roses, windshield wipers, maps and chewing gum. They are clamoring to be made eligible for the program, but the Government has not made a decision.  Eros via California **********Telefonos de Mexico, the Government-run telecommunications company whose inefficiency and atrocious service make it a favorite target for abuse among Mexicans, is basking in some unexpected praise these days - not for something it did, but for something it has moved to prevent. **********Earlier this year, several hundred families here began receiving monthly phone bills including hundreds of dollars in long-distance charges. Assuming the utility must be at fault, the subscribers complained to TelMex, as the company is called, and on checking it found that many of the calls being challenged were to a single telephone number in Los Angeles. **********Further investigation revealed that the number in question belonged to a Spanish-language ''Dial-a-Porn'' service aimed at the Hispanic population in Southern California. Students from several schools and apartment complexes here had obtained the number and were making the long-distance, direct-dial calls to hear sexually explicit two-minute messages, sometimes several times a day. **********TelMex has now programmed its equipment to prevent callers here from dialing any pay-by-the-call public information exchange in the United States, and the complaints from parents have stopped. A company spokesman, Alejandro Hernandez Murillo, said the action ''demonstrates to subscribers that the charges on their bills are not the fault of the company and that the calls were indeed made.'' **********It is not yet clear, however, what is to be done about charges already incurred. Several dozen cases have been taken to the Consumers' Court here, including those of about 40 people whose phone service has been suspended after they refused to pay for calls to what has been dubbed ''the Los Angeles hot line.''  There Goes the Block **********When the offices of the city attorney and the judicial police were destroyed in the 1985 earthquake and law enforcement officials moved into temporary quarters in the Acacias district of the capital, residents of the area were sympathetic. But now that it appears prosecutors and the police are settling in permanently, people in the neighborhood have adopted a different view. **********''We demand that you go away!'' one shouted at a heated conference with city officials that was widely reported in newspapers here. ''We want to live in peace!'' **********Residents of the middle-class neighborhood in the south of the city are enraged by an increase in crime on their streets that they attribute to the police presence. They accuse the lawmen of assaults, shakedowns, theft of car parts and drunken behavior at a neighborhood cantina. **********Expansion of the building occupied by the officials and continuing shipments of office equipment have convinced residents that the police do not intend to move anytime soon. That impression was strengthened when the community association, whose membership has tripled since the uproar began, said it had learned that only $11,000 has been allotted for construction of a new headquarters. **********At a recent public meeting, Chief of Police Jesus Miyazawa promised to investigate the complaints and said he would assign a special police unit to the area to make sure order is kept. That suggestion, needless to say, did not exactly go over well with those present. **********''We don't want another police force just to watch the police,'' newspapers quoted one resident as replying angrily. ''All we want is for you to get out of here.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/06/business/business-digest-tuesday-january-6-1987.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-01-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 683, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: TUESDAY, JANUARY 6, 1987", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: TUESDAY, JANUARY 6, 1987", "body_text": " **********Markets **********Wall Street enjoyed one of its best days in history as the Dow Jones industrial average surged within reach of the vaunted 2,000 mark.

''We can not carry on one-sidedly.'' **********Officials close to talks last weekend between the Vietnamese and an American team led by President Reagan's special envoy, Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., say that the American side balked at agreeing to a future meeting on strictly Vietnamese concerns. Action 'Is Important' **********''In negotiations sometimes there is only one word in the text and it can take hours to remove it and replace it with another word,'' Mr. Nien said when asked about the American attitude toward talks on Vietnam's human casualties. ''But I told the American side that the important thing is action.'' **********''We would like to close this chapter as soon as possible,'' he added. He recalled that in January 1986, Vietnam set a two-year timetable to resolve the issue. He declined to comment on what might happen when that period ends. **********The Foreign Ministry official said that Vietnam, one of the world's poorest countries, had limited expectations about what assistance it could get from the United States.

He called this a political issue that was related to internal policies of Vietnam, Three years ago, Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, had challenged the United States to empty the camps.

First Republicbank also said that its directors voted today to halt payments on the company's quarterly dividend of 25 cents per common share, but to continue payments on four series of preferred shares. **********Joseph C. Bowles, a First Republicbank spokesman, said the company could experience additional losses from falling real estate values in 1988 because ''Texas real estate markets have not yet stabilized.'' $33.6 Billion in Assets The projected fourth-quarter loss would also be larger than any ever experienced by the two bank holding companies, the Republicbank Corporation and the Interfirst Corporation, that merged last June to create First Republicbank. The merged company's assets totaled $33.6 billion at the end of September. **********When the merger was completed, First Republicbank's chairman and chief executive, Gerald W.

He declined to estimate the amounts of the write-downs or increases in the reserves. **********First Republicbank's primary capital, including $1.4 billion in equity and $1.1 billion in loss reserves, amounted to 7.4 percent of the bank's total assets at the end of September. **********Nonperforming assets, including real estate foreclosures, were $3.1 billion, or 12.4 percent, of the total loans.

Ayer, the nation's oldest agency, had its 1,000 troops at the Sheraton Center. Before the festivities they heard from Louis T. Hagopian, the chairman, who reported that it wasn't a banner year but it had its high points, like the winning of the $200 million Burger King account and the acquisition of Cunningham & Walsh, which added to its packaged-goods strength. **********The folks at FCB/Leber Katz Partners did not get a Christmas party this year. But don't feel sorry for them. To make up for it they are getting next week off. Indeed, three agencies in the top 20 are doing the Christmas to New Year's bit, according to the American Association of Advertising Agencies. The others are Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn, which started the practice last year, and DDB Needham, its sister company in Omnicom, which is initiating it this year. **********''It is a tremendous morale builder,'' said John O'Connor, public relations director of B.B.D.O. **********At its 23d Street headquarters, Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt staged a ''Holiday Fest'' yesterday that departed from the standard boozy event - it was for employees and their kids and started at 9 A.M., running until 3 P.M.

His view is a dark one. **********''It is probably the bleakest period in my memory,'' he said the other day. For some years he was public relations director of the J. Walter Thompson Company, the problems of which, starting with an unfriendly takeover, are well known. **********''There is fear and apprehension about the future among people in the business and a real concern about consolidation,'' he said, adding, ''The business is imploding.'' **********Employees know that the acquirers of agencies have promised to improve the margins, he said. ''But since there is no great potential for explosive growth, the only way to improve margins is to cut personnel. And that usually hits the people over 40. Then as the demand arises they bring in younger people.'' **********A similarly gloomy view is held by Judy Wald, a headhunter for 21 years and head of the well-known advertising personnel firm that bears her name. **********''I hate to be doom and gloom all the time, as I have for the last two years,'' she said.

Mr. Artiano, who now practices law in Washington, was a staff assistant to Mr. Reagan in 1975 and 1976 and worked briefly at the State Department in 1982. No Evidence of Illegality **********There is no evidence that Mr. Artiano did anything illegal in return for the payments. Mr. Fischer, who is 39 years old, has been granted total immunity by the special prosecutor in the Iran-contra affair in exchange for his cooperation. **********Mr. Artiano was working as a private lawyer in Washington when he and Mr. Fischer received the payments.

(Spitz) Channell and Richard R. Miller. Mr. Channell and Mr. Miller have pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in connection with fund raising for the Nicaraguan rebels. Mr. Artiano and Mr. Fischer each received about $300,000 last year for arranging meetings between the President and wealthy conservative donors, the officials said. **********Although Mr. Artiano was paid for helping schedule those meetings, the full nature of his actual involvement is not clear and still is being explored by investigators. **********Mr. Fischer, who occupied a cubbyhole adjacent to the Oval Office until he left the White House in the spring of 1985, is much more widely known in the Administration than Mr. Artiano. **********Mr. Artiano declined to discuss the matter and referred calls to Richard A.

Mr. Hibey said Mr. Artiano received the money for ''consulting'' work, but he would not be more specific. **********''I don't know that there was anything special by the fact that it was Marty or Dave Fischer or any other of these officials in a private role to aid the contras,'' he said. **********''Whatever the arrangement was between him and David Fischer, it was strictly a private arrangement,'' said Mr. Hibey, whose clients include Jonathan Jay Pollard, the convicted spy for Israel, Ferdinand Marcos, the former President of the Philippines, and Mr. Marcos's wife, Imelda. **********Dan Howard, a White House spokesman, said today that Mr. Artiano ''never ever worked'' at the White House ''in any capacity,'' and that he had ''no idea about his dealings with David Fischer.''

Work, declined to comment on his client's relationship with Mr. Artiano.

Regan, the former Chief of Staff who has had dealings with Mr. Fischer, said he had never heard of Mr. Artiano and speculated that he received the funds because of his friendship with Mr. Fischer. ''Fischer didn't need any one to help him try to set up a meeting,'' he said. **********Although Mr. Artiano never worked in the White House, his resume reads much like Mr. Fischer's: They both operated Mr. Reagan's advance operation in the 1980 campaign. Both hold law degrees, and both have worked in California for Mr. Reagan. President's Regard **********''They've known each other for a number of years,'' Mr. Hibey said. ''Mr. Artiano was very active in the early days of the effort to test the waters and bring on the candidacy of President Reagan dating back to 1976. I think the President has a good regard for Marty.'' **********In addition to working on the Reagan advance team in 1980 and transition team in 1980 and 1981, Mr. Artiano was acting deputy assistant secretary of the State Department's Bureau of International Organization Affairs for five months in 1982.

It is the first time in more than decade that Grumman has cut its Long Island work force. **********The reduction is part of a company-wide move to trim costs. The cuts will involve about 1,200 layoffs, the company said, with the remainder coming through attrition. The dismissed employees were not likely to be rehired later, officials added. **********''We are on a weight-reduction and muscle-building program,'' said John O'Brien, Grumman's president and chief operating officer. **********''The moves are necessary,'' he said, ''because of increasing pressure on defense budgets and increasing pressures on defense companies to be more competitive.'' The military contractor said the cutback would save it $50 million this year. **********Grumman, with a worldwide work force of 33,000, employs about 25,000 people on Long Island. Company officials said that although they were cutting the Long Island rolls by 6 percent, they expected to increase their work force in other parts of the country, including Melbourne, Fla., and Montgomery, Pa. Over all, they said, corporate employment should increase slightly or remain stable this year. **********In an interview at the company's headquarters here, Mr. O'Brien said that most of the job cuts would come in the corporation's Aircraft Systems division, which is building five types of planes, including the F-14, the Navy's principal fighter plane. **********The cuts are largely the result of a decrease in production of the F-14, to 8 planes this year from 24 in 1986. Mr. O'Brien said the sharp reduction was expected and resulted from an upgrading of the F-14, with electronic technology and a more powerful engine. **********Most of the job losses, the company said, would occur on the production lines at the company's Calverton, L.I., plant. But Mr. O'Brien added that cuts would also be made in the aircraft support services. He said he could not provide a breakdown. **********More broadly, Mr. O'Brien described today's actions ''as part of the transition of the Grumman Corporation from an airframe manufacturer to a company that focuses on outgrowths from that business,'' such as electronics and data services.

Those dismissed will receive severance pay based on their length of service. They also will get ''preferential consideration'' for openings elsewhere, the company said. **********But given the company's reputation for paternalism, Mr. O'Brien said the layoffs - the first since 1975-76, when the company cut nearly 2,000 workers - were ''particularly painful.'' **********Wall Street seemed noncommittal about the cutback.

Gorbachev made a new offer to have Soviet troops refrain from offensive combat operations during any period that is agreed upon for their withdrawal from Afghanistan. **********The official, Michael H. Armacost, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, called the offer ''positive'' and portrayed it as a step toward a formula for withdrawal that the United States would consider acceptable. Other unresolved issues include the length of time the pullout would take and the phasing of the departure of various military units, Mr. Armacost said. **********Another Administration official said the significance of Mr. Gorbachev's suggestion was not fully grasped during the summit meeting by tired Americans, who were concentrating on resolving differences in the language of a joint Soviet-American statement, which dealt mainly with arms control. The offer was not pursued.  The official said that only after notes of the conversations between Mr. Gorbachev and President Reagan were reviewed after the summit meeting did officials conclude that the Soviet leader had taken a conciliatory step. **********Still, Mr. Armacost took a cautionary tone on the implications of what Mr. Gorbachev had said. **********''He said that they would not engage in military operations, other than self-defense,'' Mr. Armacost explained. ''It's the latter, of course, that needs to be defined fairly carefully, since we all know that there's a very high level of military activity generally in Afghan society; and therefore if one's looking for an excuse, then there's always an incident to which one can refer.'' **********Nevertheless, ''I would regard it as positive in that it was something that, as far as I'm aware, they had never said before,'' Mr. Armacost said. ''It stands to reason that only a withdrawal of that kind would have any appeal, that one couldn't stand by and simply observe a withdrawal during which the Soviets attempted to use their residual power to go after the resistance.'' Protection for Soviet Units **********By the same token, other officials have portrayed the Russians as acutely interested in a commitment from the rebels not to attack withdrawing Soviet troops. **********Mr. Armacost said that there would have to be ''a detailed understanding of what is involved on their side'' before the United States could agree to put into effect its commitments under the proposed Geneva understandings. These, which are being negotiated by the United Nations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, provide for a cutoff in American aid to the Afghan rebels simultaneously with the beginning of a Soviet troop withdrawal. **********Mr. Gorbachev has spoken of a withdrawal period of 12 months or less, which the Reagan Administration feels is too long. **********''We think the withdrawal can be carried out much more promptly than that,'' Mr. Armacost said. **********In addition, he said, the United States would look at a schedule of withdrawal for various types of military units. Officials have said they do not want to see elite units left there months after the rebels' military supplies are cut off. **********Mr. Armacost's news conference was held to present a State Department report, ''Afghanistan: Eight Years of Soviet Occupation,'' that described a situation that is worsening from the Soviet viewpoint. **********''The military, political and diplomatic trends have changed in significant ways,'' Mr. Armacost said in introducing the report, ''which generally compound Soviet policy dilemmas in Afghanistan.'' **********Mr. Armacost also said that as far as American officials could determine, the proposed withdrawal would not be linked to arrangements for an interim, coalition government in Afghanistan. **********''The Soviets, in their discussions with us, did not insist upon a direct linkage between national reconciliation and withdrawal,'' he said.

An adjustment in Japanese rates could be contentious because American officials have been advocating for the last two years that Japan and West Germany adopt more stimulative monetary and fiscal policies. Trade Deficit Is a Factor **********The hope of American officials has been that faster growth in those two nations would increase the demand there for domestic and American products, helping to reduce the American trade deficit. But recent developments suggest that the Japanese authorities believe that the threat to their economy from inflation is of more concern than the American trade deficit. **********''If the report is true, it will invite a tremendous amount of criticism from U.S. authorities,'' said David Ressler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International, the New York affiliate of Japan's largest securities firm. **********Reports of the Bank of Japan's policy shift were carried by the electronic news wire service of Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a widely read and highly credible Japanese business newspaper. Stock Market Affected **********Translations of the report quickly spread through the credit markets in New York, and prices fell sharply in light trading. The bond market's weakness undermined stocks, ending the market's strong two-day rally. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 19.25 points yesterday, closing at 2,566.42.  [ Page D4. ]  Higher interest rates in Japan could lead to higher interest rates in the United States as the American financial markets strive to maintain the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments. **********Analysts said the Bank of Japan's willingness to encourage higher short-term interest rates stems from its concerns about inflation. The inflation rate last year was zero, but consumer prices have been rising in Japan for the last five months, capped by a sharp rise of eight-tenths of 1 percent in August. Bank of Japan officials are also worried that rapid money supply growth - at a rate of 10 percent in recent months - brings with it the potential for inflation. **********Economists noted that earlier efforts by Japanese officials to encourage economic growth through stimulating domestic demand seem to be bearing fruit. The Japanese housing market is in the midst of a boom, with housing starts rising at an annual rate of more than 25 percent from April through July. **********Although overall growth of Japan's gross national product was zero in the second quarter of this year, Robert Brusca, an economist at Nikko Securities Company International, noted that domestic demand grew at an annual rate of more than 4 percent in the quarter. Need for Move Is Doubted **********Mr. Brusca and his counterpart at Nomura, Mr. Ressler, both agreed that the move to tighten monetary policy might not be needed. **********''Worldwide, I still see a situation of not much inflation, not much growth and a lot of idle resources,'' Mr. Brusca said. ''I don't see much reason to raise real interest rates, which are already high.'' **********Mr. Ressler acknowledged that domestic demand in Japan is improving, 'but not to the point where it threatens an inflationary spiral.'' **********He said the strength of the yen suggested that the world's financial markets do not see much risk of excessive inflation in Japan. He said that acceleration in Japan's money supply growth need not be inflationary, pointing to the United States' experience in 1985 and 1986, when the money supply grew by more than 13 percent annually but has not yet produced sharply higher inflation. Methods Are Detailed **********According to reports in Japan, the first step in the Bank of Japan's tighter monetary policy will be the imposition of stricter limits on growth of commercial lending, and a sharp decline in long-term lending. Coincidentally, a half-point increase, to 5.7 percent, from 5.2 percent, in the long-term prime rate of Japan's Long Term Credit Bank was announced yesterday, effective Oct. 1. **********The central bank will reportedly also tolerate an increase in short-term interest rates that is expected to occur next month with a large public stock offering by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company. The purchase of that stock, combined with seasonal drains on bank credit in the last quarter of the year, is expected to pull about 10 trillion yen from the Japanese banking system, putting upward pressure on short-term interest rates that the Bank of Japan will not offset. **********Already rates on one-month and two-month discount bills in the Japanese money market have increased, rising about one percentage point yesterday, to about 3.8 percent. **********In the American market, the bellwether 8 7/8 percent Treasury bond due in 2017 fell more than 1 1/4 points, to 92 3/32, to yield 9.69 percent. **********''Higher rates in Japan are the last thing the U.S. markets wanted, because on top of all the other worries about the dollar and inflation, they now have to worry about narrowing interest-rate differentials,'' said Anthony Karydakis, a money market economist at the New York branch of Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. **********Another cause for worry about higher interest rates emerged early yesterday when August trade data for Britain showed a record visible trade deficit of more than $:1.5 billion. **********''The trade data suggest strength in the U.K. economy,'' noted Joseph Liro, an economist at S. G. Warburg Securities Inc. Signs that the economies of the United States, Britain, and Japan are strengthening in tandem ''add to the fears of more inflation worldwide,'' he said. **********Higher inflation, or the anticipation of higher inflation, normally brings falling bond prices as investors conclude that the purchasing power of their bonds will be reduced. Offering by Imperial Savings **********Elsewhere in the credit markets, the Imperial Savings Association is offering the first issue of notes collateralized by ''junk bonds.'' The 9 3/8 percent notes, rated triple A and due in 1990, were offered at 99.73 to yield 9.48 percent through Drexel Burnham Lambert as sole underwriter. **********The notes are collateralized by a pool of junk bonds whose market value is estimated at 175 to 180 percent of the new three-year notes. Every two weeks the value of the collateral will be evaluated by Chemical Bank, trustee for the issue. The financing provides fresh cash for Imperial while allowing it to benefit from the difference between the high interest rates paid by the junk bonds and the much lower interest rate on the new notes. **********Another unusual financing announced yesterday was a $200 million issue of 12-year subordinated auction-rate notes for the Chase Manhattan Corporation through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. The 9 3/4 percent notes were offered at 99.84, to yield 9.81 percent for three years, at the end of which a new interest rate will be set."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/01/world/offices-are-bombed-in-lima.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-04-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Offices Are Bombed in Lima", "print_headline": "Offices Are Bombed in Lima", "body_text": " **********Guerrillas bombed the headquarters of Peru's ruling party and eight party offices in Lima today, police officials said.

Kodak's Example Is Noted **********Last fall several major corporations - including General Motors, I.B.M., General Electric, Coca-Cola and Kodak - announced their departure from South Africa, but only one seems to satisfy the new guidelines: the Eastman Kodak Company, which has sold its operations there and has agreed not to supply the South African market through importers. **********Under the guidelines, divesting American companies would have to forgo the franchising, licensing and management agreements that most have arranged with South African local interests. In many cases, such arrangements have been designed to avoid the political stigma of maintaining a presence in South Africa while enabling divesting companies to preserve their market share and a flow of profits from South Africa. **********With its new guidelines, the anti-apartheid lobby is demanding a complete end to arrangements that link departing American companies with their South African spin-offs. **********A number of companies, including the General Motors Corporation, have strenuously objected to the tighter interpretation. Various Remaining Links **********Most of the other companies that have announced disinvestment plans still have operations of one sort or another, such as these: *********** The Coca-Cola Company, the International Business Machines Corporation and G.M. are selling all of their South African assets, but will continue to make their product lines available to the companies buying them out. *********** The Fluor Corporation, an engineering company, has sold its operations to a European trust company, but it negotiated a buy-back clause, and it keeps 30 employees at the disposal of the new company. *********** The General Electric Company says it was ''out of South Africa as of Jan. 1, 1986,'' but says it maintains ''licensing and other arrangements for the sale of products'' there. *********** The Procter & Gamble Company sold its South African production plant and other assets last September, but it continues to ''license products'' and ''receive trademark royalties,'' a P.&G. spokesman said. **********An informal survey of officials in states and cities required by law to hold no interest in companies doing business in South Africa discloses skepticism about divestment plans. Wide Criticism of Plans **********Legislators, members of municipal boards and pension fund managers have described them variously as ''fictional,'' ''incomplete'' and ''unsatisfactory.'' And many of them say they will push the corporations to cut all ties with South Africa. **********Jennifer Davis, director of the American Committee on Africa, one of the principal pro-divestment lobbying groups, said the recent pullouts were a ''response to growing pressures here and in South Africa'' but represented corporate ''restructuring'' and not withdrawal. Ms. Davis also called the divestments an intermediate step ''intended to make a pullout easier in the future, but allowing the companies to carry out their business'' in the meantime. **********Dana Van Gorder, an aide to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, said the recent divestments of major American companies did not go far enough to make them eligible for pension fund investment or procurement contracts. Mr. Van Gorder said the divestment announcements were meant to ''circumvent'' municipal and state laws, such as San Francisco's, which bar city contracts with companies ''doing business with South Africa.'' Deadline in New Jersey **********In other states and localities, the trend is much the same. Roland Mackolin, director of the New Jersey Division of Investment, with responsibility for managing a $13 billion state pension fund portfolio, said, ''We're divesting like crazy to make the August 1988 deadline.'' By that time no state funds may be held in securities of companies ''that do business in or with South Africa.'' **********He said New Jersey had already sold $4.4 billion in securities of companies doing business with South Africa and expected $3 billion more to be sold. **********Citing the Sara Lee Corporation's acquisition of Kiwi Wax, Mr. Mackolin said his task was ''infinitely complicated'' by the takeover boom. He has to sell shares of a corporation if it buys a smaller company doing business in South Africa. **********Companies that sell their assets in South Africa but continue to provide the same goods or services through licensing arrangements are ''trying to appear clean, when in fact they are not,'' Mr. Van Gorder declared. **********More than $18 billion in securities have been sold to comply with state and local divestment legislation. In the last two years 74 United States companies have announced their withdrawal from South Africa, although most have cited declining profits, not political pressures. Pension Fund's Influence **********However, Claire M. Sheahan, a spokesman for the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and College Retirement Equities Fund, called the $52.3 billion pension fund's pressure ''an important factor,'' adding that ''within three and a half weeks of our call'' for corporations to pull out of South Africa, ''General Motors and I.B.M. announced their divestments.'' **********Companies such as G.M. and I.B.M. are stung by criticism that they have not gone far enough. **********George Schreck, a G.M. spokesman, said his company's line of Opal and Isuzu cars will continue to be made available in South Africa through a new, locally owned company out of concern for G.M.'s ''3,000 workers and their 15,000 dependents.'' He called those who say G.M.'s divestment has not gone far enough ''irresponsible and usually not well informed.'' He said G.M.'s critics advocated ''total withdrawal, total suffering and total chaos.'' **********Other companies defend their withdrawal on the grounds that they have sold their assets to companies that have pledged to adhere to principles of racial equality in the workplace. Social Commitments Cited **********Ford Slater, a spokesman for G.E., said that while his company would continue to be linked through licensing agreements with its South African spin-off, Genwest, ''they have guaranteed they would maintain the same social commitments.'' He said that G.E. had always ''operated according to - at least - the minimum requirements of the Sullivan Principles'' and that a condition of the sale of its operations was a committment that ''Genwest continue to be guided by those principles.'' **********The Sullivan Principles are an evolving set of labor guidelines developed in 1977 by the Rev. Leon Sullivan of Philadelphia, a member of G.M.'s board of directors. **********For the last decade many companies doing business in South Africa tried to deflect criticism of their operations there by citing their pledge to follow the Sullivan Principles. As political and economic conditions have deteriorated in South Africa, however, the American anti-apartheid movement has turned to demands for divestment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/25/world/officers-were-not-at-posts-ship-disaster-survivor-says.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 178, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Officers Were Not at Posts, Ship Disaster Survivor Says", "print_headline": "Officers Were Not at Posts, Ship Disaster Survivor Says", "body_text": " **********The coast guard said today that its initial inquiry indicated that some of the officers of the ferry Dona Paz were watching television or drinking beer when she collided with an oil tanker, killing at least 1,600 people. **********A statement said that a surviving passenger said that an apprentice officer was on the bridge alone, taking the inter-island ferry through the busy Tablas Strait, 110 miles south of Manila off Mindoro Island, when the disaster occurred Sunday night. **********Only 24 passengers from the 2,215-ton ferry and 2 of 13 crewmen on the 629-ton tanker Victor were rescued after the collision and the subsequent explosions and fires.

It has transformed itself from an upstart London agency into the world's largest advertising company through a strategy of internal growth and voracious acquisitions, capped by last year's purchase of Ted Bates Worldwide Inc. **********Recently, Saatchi & Saatchi has branched into other business services, led by management consulting. But in the past week, it has become strikingly clear that the Saatchi brothers, Maurice and Charles, have far broader ambitions. They are now interested in buying a major bank or other financial institution. Bids for Banks Spurned **********Last weekend, it was reported that Saatchi had earlier this month discussed merging with Midland Bank P.L.C., Britain's fourth-largest commercial bank. Midland spurned the overture, saying the notion lacked ''commercial or strategic logic.'' **********Then, on Thursday, the Hill Samuel Group P.L.C., a major London merchant bank, said it had rejected an offer from Saatchi, with talks breaking off earlier in the day. Again, the absence of commercial logic to the proposed linkup was cited in declining Saatchi's advance. **********What is Saatchi up to? Its major shareholders are confused by Saatchi's efforts to plunge into the rough-and-tumble world of international banking, and their uncertainty has pushed Saatchi's stock price down 10 percent in the last week, to 590 pence a share. 'It's Just Totally Bizarre' **********In London, the Saatchi moves have been greeted with a mixture of amazement and derision. ''It's just totally bizarre,'' observed A. Gary Klesch, chairman of Quadrex Securities Ltd., a London-based investment bank. ''And the way they seem to be going around from place to place makes them look amateurish.'' **********Even big investors who own Saatchi shares and have a high regard for its chairman and acquisition picker, Maurice Saatchi, are baffled by the recent activities. ''Up to now everything Saatchi has done makes sense and has been successful, but this is highly questionable,'' one fund manager said. **********What bothers investors and analysts is that Saatchi's current business-service operations - advertising, management consulting, market research and others - seem quite different from finance. Both rely on professional skills but, unlike advertising and consulting, international finance is a capital-intensive business where success often depends on risk-taking traders. Leader in 'Globalization' **********Saatchi has been a leader in the business trend toward ''globalization,'' defined as building worldwide economies of scale in one or a few closely related businesses. Yet to many, the company's recent moves seem to stretch that principle past the breaking point. **********''Saatchi and banking do not really fit together,'' said Richard Sanderson, an analyst for Panmure Gordon & Company, a London brokerage. ''It would be a mixture of entirely alien corporate cultures.'' **********Saatchi is not making any official statements about its recent talks with London banks. However, some of its executives replied privately to the criticism. In Saatchi's view, the financial services field offers solid growth opportunites and, broadly defined, fits in with the company's existing operations. During the last few months, these executives added, Saatchi has spoken with ''several'' financial services companies, which they would not name, besides Midland and Hill Samuel. 'Informal Discussions' **********Most of these meetings amounted to ''informal discussions,'' often involving Maurice Saatchi and his counterpart at each financial institution. The talks with Midland fitted into that category, with Mr. Saatchi meeting Sir Kit McMahon, the bank's chairman, during the first week of September. **********The exception - and the only case in which Saatchi's brokers, Phillips & Drew, were involved - was Hill Samuel, with which it began discussions last Friday, shortly after the Union Bank of Switzerland had ended merger talks with the London merchant bank. **********The Saatchi executives said the merger talks with Hill Samuel broke down over the issue of price. They added that, though not engaged in merger talks with other financial institutions at this time, Saatchi would continue to look for acquisitions in banking and finance. **********Still, even people close to Saatchi find its reasoning flawed this time. One former Saatchi executive questioned the wisdom of plunging into a risky business where profits are under pressure even for the strongest, most-seasoned competitors. **********''Saatchi's has a reputation for being ambitious and smart,'' he said. ''But if it jumps into international banking now, it will be ambitious but maybe naive - and then sorry later.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/19/business/advertising-earle-palmer-brown-acquires-spiro-agency.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1987-11-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 204, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Earle Palmer Brown Acquires Spiro Agency", "print_headline": "Advertising; Earle Palmer Brown Acquires Spiro Agency", "body_text": " **********The Earle Palmer Brown Companies, which lays claim to the title of largest independent agency in the Middle Atlantic region, is now even bigger, having acquired Spiro & Associates of Philadelphia. **********E.P.B.'s main offices are in Bethesda, Md., serving Washington, and Phildelphia.

Cut to the studio, where stars crowd around a shiny blue 1932 Plymouth roadster, selling for only 8,269,000 yen. **********The roadster is the first product offered on a flashy satellite home shopping show featuring mostly new American goods. For an hour and a half late this evening, Japanese television personalities pitched products ranging from the gimmicky - a custom-designed loveseat similar to the kind owned by Madonna - to the practical - brand-new Nautica windbreakers. The show's sponsors, Fuji Sankei Communications, hope this and other shows will prod Japanese to buy more foreign goods. **********Two years ago, the Japanese Government began a campaign to make the Japanese market more accessible to imports. And Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone added a personal touch at the time with a television appeal to the Japanese to buy more products from abroad. **********Recent trade statistics indicate the campaign has been succeeding, but only in part. While total imports are up in Japan, such extravaganzas as the home-shopping show may still be necessary to encourage more buying from the United States. Despite a drop in the dollar of more than 40 percent against the yen in the last year and a half, making American goods much cheaper in Japan, the country's imports from the United States have not increased dramatically. **********Imports from Europe and such newly industrializing countries as Taiwan and South Korea, meanwhile, have shown far larger gains, although measured against a smaller base. **********The explanations for the relative lag in American imports vary widely. Some Japanese blame American companies for not trying hard enough to modify their products to Japanese tastes. And yen prices of many imported goods have not gone down substantially, despite the changes in the exchange rate - for which Americans blame Japan's complex distribution system. **********American goods also face a distinct image problem in Japan. Where European goods have an image of luxury and craftmanship and Asian goods have compelling price advantages, surveys have shown that the Japanese suspect the quality of American goods. Moreover, Americans are most competitive in industrial goods, which may be harder to sell in Japan than consumer goods. American officials also say other countries have benefited from American efforts to reduce Japanese trade barriers. Technology-Transfer Problem **********''Most of the European goods are luxury items and the Asian goods are low-price items,'' one United States official in Japan said. ''As for American imports - if they're consumer goods, they don't have a brand-name image, and if they're industrial products, you get into the old problem that the Japanese want you to hand over the technology to a joint-venture partner and produce it here.'' **********Trade statistics released by the United States Commerce Department on Thursday showed that American exports to Japan continued to increase in March, rising to $2.14 billion, from $2.03 billion in February. **********Over all, in dollar terms, Japanese statistics show that Japan bought 12.6 percent more foreign goods from the United States in 1986 than in 1985. But that increase is surpassed by many of Japan's other trading partners. Imports from the European Community were up 57.3 percent, from South Korea 29.3 percent, from Taiwan 38.5 percent and from Hong Kong 39.9 percent. **********An extensive analysis of Japanese imports released this week by the Japan External Trade Organization sheds light on some of these trends. **********The Jetro report focused on manufactured goods imports, where Japan has lagged other industrial nations. Excluding imports of gold, which soared last year because Japan issued a special gold coin commemorating the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito's reign, Japanese bought 5.2 percent more manufactured goods from the United States, 47.7 percent more from the European Community and 37.6 percent from Asian newly industrializing countries, particularly Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong. Far Smaller Percentage Imported **********Although Japan's total imports of manufactured goods increased by a hefty 31.4 percent, the Jetro report pointed out that Japan still imported a far smaller percentage of manufactured goods than other leading industrial nations. While manufactured goods now account for about 40 percent of Japan's total imports, a record level for Japan, they account for 70 percent of West German imports and more than 80 percent of United States imports. **********Because of the dramatic shifts in exchange rates over the last year, import totals calculated in terms of dollars can be somewhat misleading. For example, some of the increase in European goods can be explained in currency terms - the dollar fell against most European currencies, making the European import totals appear larger in dollar terms. In yen terms, imports from Europe increased by 11.9 percent. **********In terms of actual products, Japanese are buying more cars and luxury goods from Europe and more parts and other manufactured products from their Asian industrial neighbors. While imports of American goods have not gone up so substantially, sales of such products as almonds, California wine, tractors and newsprint have picked up. **********Neither the American Chamber of Commerce nor the American Embassy's commercial section, however, could offer an example of an American company where sales had increased dramatically in the last year because of the exchange-rate shifts. Grapefruits and Lemons **********Department store sales also reflect these trends. At Takashimaya, one of Japan's leading department stores, sales of imported goods increased by 30 percent from 1985 and are expected to increase more than 20 percent this year, according to Mitsunobu Ochiai, chief of Takashimaya's foreign department. Customers bought the most products from France, then Italy and then the United States, he said. American goods selling well include grapefruits and lemons, bourbon, chinaware and aluminum cookers. **********But Mr. Ochiai said few foreign companies were willing to modify their products enough to sell in Japan. ''American and European companies do approach us, but when we request a change in goods to match Japanese consumers' tastes, they say their product is original,'' he said. ''For example, American and European companies do not accept our request to change dress patterns in order to make them fit better to Japanese bodies. They say our order is too small for them to increase the steps in the manufacturing process. It is too bad, because their designs are good.'' **********American businessmen here insist they are making enormous efforts to adapt their products to Japanese tastes and point to the success of many American companies - among them, Mister Donut, which has changed its doughnut recipe to make them less sweet here. **********One reason sales of some imports have not shot up may be that retail prices have not dropped dramatically. Wholesale import prices dropped 38.4 percent between September 1985 and this March, according to the Economic Planning Agency. There are no statistics available on average retail prices, but price cuts are thought to be far smaller. **********Foreign exporters blame Japan's distribution system, in which Japanese middlemen keep much of the exchange rate savings. At the same time, however, many foreign companies do not want to cut prices substantially, partly to make up for profits squeezed when the dollar was strong. **********Many importers have found that Japanese expect to pay top prices for foreign goods and fear that cutting prices too much might strip products of their cachet. In one often-cited example, importers of Johnnie Walker Black Scotch whisky, a popular and expensive gift in Japan, found consumers far less eager to buy the less-expensive Johnnie Walker Red whisky. **********There are, nonetheless, some encouraging signs on the horizon. The strong yen, for example, is causing the Honda Motor Company to begin ''reimporting'' motorcycles produced in Italy into Japan and to consider re-importing passenger cars produced in the United States, although no final decision has been made. **********At the satellite home shopping show, within two hours, two of the 11 Japanese cities in which the program was televised had reported sales to phone bidders of more than $1 million worth of merchandise. There were 29 bids for the $59,000 Plymouth roadster - a raffle will later determine the winner."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/22/business/snuffing-out-smoking-in-the-office.html": {"writer_name": "Ann Laforge", "pub_date": "1987-02-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1618, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Snuffing Out Smoking in the Office", "print_headline": "Snuffing Out Smoking in the Office", "body_text": " **********FOR the past 15 years, Charles L. Wrye has kept on his desk a sign that says, politely, ''Thank You for Not Smoking.'' An avid antismoker, he long ago decided that even though he has no right to force others to stop smoking, he does have the right to make his own work space smoke-free. **********This month, as editor and publisher of Successful Meetings magazine in New York, Mr. Wrye went a few steps further. Under growing pressure from many of his 35 employees, he restricted smoking to certain areas of the office - a policy intended to pacify the nonsmokers without overly angering the smokers. **********Mr. Wrye's middle-of-the-road resolution of the problem is typical of the approach taken by a number of companies over the past two years as employee pressure mounted to restrict smoking. Some 38 percent of employers have put smoking policies into place since 1985, according to a survey last year by the Bureau of National Affairs. The ''flexible'' guidelines established a year ago at Eastman Kodak, for example, have been typical of corporate America's solution to the smoking problem. The employees who will be affected vote on whether smoking will be permitted in conference rooms and classrooms. If it's a close call, supervisors help individual work groups compromise. ''Each company unit has the responsibility to designate smoking and nonsmoking areas,'' said Henry Kaska, public information director. ''When the preferences of nonsmokers and smokers conflict, the supervisors must work it out. When that's not possible, the preference of the nonsmoker prevails.'' **********Where smoking is permitted at Kodak, individuals may designate their offices as nonsmoking areas. In the cafeterias and lounges, nonsmoking areas are periodically re-evaluated to make sure they meet demand. The company maintains that these flexible rules have worked just fine: ''In 99.9 percent of the cases we've had no problem,'' Mr. Kaska said. **********Nevertheless, the toleration for smokers among executive policy makers is beginning to fade - particularly since last December when the Surgeon General reported that involuntary inhalation of smoke from other people's cigarettes can cause disease in healthy nonsmokers. That report appears to establish a basis for corporate liabililty, and some companies' policies are shifting from the democratic to the draconian. Last month, prompted by the discovery that materials used in some of its plants could be especially hazardous to smokers, the U.S.G. Corporation announced that workers could be dismissed unless they stopped smoking both on and off the job. IN FACT, the few companies that have tried total bans have sometimes been pleased with the results. James Tiffany, executive vice president of Lovejoy-Tiffany & Associates Inc., said he encountered few problems with the employee-initiated ban on smoking in his Ann Arbor, Mich., office, which has 30 employees. ''I had one person come up to me and say she would never have taken the job had she realized that there would be a nonsmoking policy,'' Mr. Tiffany said. ''But she is still working for us a year and a half later. Recently, I offered a chain smoker a job. When she learned of our policy, she took an extra day to consider the offer, but she did accept it.'' **********One company that has tried both a moderate and a complete ban on smoking - Pacific Northwest Bell, in Washington - says that smoke-free is the only way to go. In 1983, after studying the smoking issue and surveying its employees, Pacific Northwest Bell announced a flexible policy for its 750 office buildings. ''Basically, we said that there would be no smoking in training and conference rooms,'' recalled Leonard D. Beil, director of human resources planning. ''We adjusted the employee cafeteria from 20 percent seating for nonsmokers to 65 percent, and we left it up to individual work groups to determine smoking and nonsmoking areas. We also initiated a smoking cessation program for employees.'' **********But the policy didn't work. Even if the smokers observed the limits, the smoke itself did not. ''If one work group took a vote and 59 percent of the people agreed there should be smoking, you'd still have 41 percent who were bothered by smoke,'' Mr. Beil explained. ''Then there was the problem of smokers who bordered nonsmoking districts. Their smoke would drift over.'' **********After studying the problem further, the company decided to go smoke-free in all buildings. ''In addition, we agreed to pay for employees, their spouses and their dependents to attend any program - hypnosis, acupuncture, behavior modification -that would help them stop smoking,'' Mr. Beil said.  He concedes that some smokers do not like the ban, and that many people go outside the buildings to smoke. But of the 15,000 employees affected, not one has quit because of the policy and no lawsuits have been filed. **********The companies most likely to have official policies are in locations where workplace smoking laws are already in effect, according to the Human Resources Policy Corporation. About 10 states, including Connecticut and New Jersey, have some form of no-smoking legislation that applies to the private sector. **********But as complaints from nonsmokers turn into crusades, states and cities are tightening the old rules and issuing new ones. This month, for example, the New York State Public Health Council produced the toughest restrictions yet on lighting up in public. The council's regulations, which go into effect in May, prohibit smoking in any enclosed work area occupied by more than one person unless that area is occupied exclusively by smokers. Further, there will be no smoking in auditoriums, classrooms, meeting rooms, elevators, hallways, restrooms, medical facilities and most areas of public buildings. **********The tough new rules have provoked plenty of opposition. The Tobacco Institute, the industry's trade group, insists that laws that prohibit workers from smoking in offices or factories promote discrimination. Is it fair, the Institute asks, that a person with a private office is allowed to smoke but the typing pool and others in shared work spaces are not? **********But it is not just the tobacco industry that is objecting to the restrictions. Some companies see legislation as unnecessary because they do not perceive a problem in their offices. **********For example, the General Foods Corporation, which has its headquarters in Rye Brook, N.Y., may be forced to issue a smoking policy under the state's new restrictions. But Cliff Sessions, manager of corporate affairs, said there really was no need for one. ''Smoking has never been seen as a problem because of the spaciousness and ventilation of our offices,'' he said. **********Still, the Surgeon General's December report has sharpened corporate fears about health-related suits from nonsmokers. Adin C. Goldberg, a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Spengler, Carlson, Gubar, Brodsky & Frischling, says this concern is justified. ''In terms of limiting liability, setting a corporate policy is probably the best way to go now,'' he advised. Mr. Goldberg cited a recent ruling by the Washington State Court of Appeals permitting a woman to sue her employer for negligence when she developed pulmonary disease after being exposed to what she claimed was environmental smoke from her co-workers' cigarettes. **********The U.S.G. Corporation introduced its absolute ban on smoking after the company discovered that mineral fibers used in nine of its acoustical-products plants could have adverse health effects, especially on smokers. Opponents say the action raises troubling questions about enforcement and smokers' rights outside the workplace. U.S.G. will give pulmonary function tests, electrocardiograms and X-rays to all employees periodically, but the company says the results will not be used to single out cheaters. ''We won't really be able to tell whether someone is smoking outside the workplace or not,'' said Paul Colitti, a company spokesman. ''We will have to rely on the employees' honor and their common sense.'' **********Athena Mueller, general counsel for Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), in Washington, D.C., foresees no adverse consequences to companies that adopt stern measures. ''We have lists of the companies that have instituted partial or full bans on smoking and, to our knowledge, not one has ever been challenged,'' she said. **********Another factor prompting action on the part of corporations is evidence that smokers cost money, Ms. Mueller said. In particular, she cited a Seattle University study reporting that individual smokers cost their employers up to $4,000 a year more than nonsmokers in lost time, absenteeism, medical expenses, insurance and property damage. **********How a company communicates a smoking policy seems to have a great bearing on how well it is accepted by employees. Joe Conlin, a senior editor with Successful Meetings, first heard about the magazine's new smoking policy when a fellow staff member plunked a smoke-absorbing ashtray on his desk. He was not pleased. ''Because of the way I found out, my first instinct was to throw the ashtray in a drawer and defy the rules,'' Mr. Conlin said. ''But then my mature side won out and I decided to use it. I think that most smokers will compromise when approached reasonably.'' **********Ms. Mueller of ASH agrees: ''We've seen quite a lot of support for smoking policies from smokers. We have found that 80 percent of all smokers want to quit. They appreciate it when companies do things to help them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/08/business/corporate-pressures-slowing-gifts-to-charity.html": {"writer_name": "Kathleen Teltsch", "pub_date": "1987-07-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1142, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CORPORATE PRESSURES SLOWING GIFTS TO CHARITY", "print_headline": "CORPORATE PRESSURES SLOWING GIFTS TO CHARITY", "body_text": " **********Corporate giving to charities is leveling off or even declining as oil companies and other traditional big contributors scale back because of restructuring pressures. **********The trend, reflected in two surveys, could be damaging for many of the country's 350,000 nonprofit organizations that look to companies for support of their activites in education, the arts and a range of human services. **********Many beneficiary organizations say they also are troubled by long-term signs of declining support from the business world. Some worry that leaders who were pacesetters in encouraging corporate involvement are being replaced by executives likely to give such programs a lower priority. **********These are uncertain times for fund-raisers as companies reposition themselves in the wake of mergers and buyouts, said Brian O'Connell, president of the Independent Sector, the country's largest philanthropic coalition representing foundations, corporations and national nonprofit organizations. **********''I hear enough concerns about corporate leadership's commitment both from former C.E.O.'s and present C.E.O.'s, so I have to believe something out there needs turning around,'' he said. **********William S. Woodside, executive committee chairman of the Primerica Corporation, formerly American Can, said the new crop of corporate managers was so engrossed in survival issues that ''it becomes positively un-American to look at anything except their own bottom line.'' **********This single-minded drive for profits, he said, was ''one of the negatives that has come out of the dramatic restructuring of American business in the past few years.'' **********In its annual survey, the Conference Board, a business research organization, found that corporate contributions in 1986 declined for the first time in 15 years. On the basis of responses from 439 companies, which represent 40 percent of total corporate giving, the survey, issued late in March, put the drop at 2.5 percent. **********Assessing the responses, Anne Klepper, director of the Conference Board's Contributions Management Institute, said: ''The heavy hitters - the multimillion-dollar givers - may have peaked in their contributions. But some companies, those in food, finance, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications, are riding the up escalator even as oil and steel are on the down. Hopefully, the medium-sized givers hovering around the $1 million mark will expand their programs and make up for the big-bucks cuts.'' 2d Survey Sees Gain A somewhat more positive outlook of corporate philanthropy came from ''Giving USA,'' the annual report by the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel, which agreed that increased support by smaller companies helped offset the losses. According to the Counsel's data, issued in May, the countrywide total of corporate giving actually increased modestly, by 2.5 percent, in 1986. **********Still, both studies suggest that the outlook is no longer as rosy as it was two or three years ago, when many fund-raisers praised corporate giving as the fastest-growing source of philanthropy.philanthropy. **********The fund-raisers, in their enthusiasm to win company support, seemed to forget that corporate giving has never accounted for more than 5 percent of private philanthropy, and that the overwhelming share continues to come from individuals. **********According to data from the Counsel, private donations to charities last year totaled $87.22 billion. Of this total, individuals contributed $71.72 and another $5.8 billion came from bequests. Companies contributed $4.5 billion and foundations $5.1 billion. For years, corporate and foundation giving has been almost equal. In 1986, helped by the bull market, foundations forged ahead. Oil Industry Cutbacks **********For some traditional big contributors, such as the oil producers, retrenchment has meant radical reductions in donations. The Arco Foundation, created by the Atlantic Richfield Company, cut its grant budget from a peak of $36.8 million in 1983 to $11.2 million this year. ''The challenge for us,'' said Eugene R. Wilson, president, ''was to cut but not become trivial.'' **********He said the foundation took a hard look at demographic data in its primary base of operations in the Southwest, taking note of rapid increases in Hispanic and Asian residents and the rising birth rates of minorities, and now concentrates more on education to curb school dropouts, and the improvement of urban schools and specialized job training. **********Analysts at the Independent Sector say it is remarkable that corporate giving has held up as well as it has in the face of declining profits and foreign competition. ''It also is understandable,'' Mr. O'Connell said, that business leaders concerned about staff layoffs, plant closures and other disturbing developments, are giving less attention to philanthropy. ''But there is a real danger that if the new crop of C.E.O.'s concentrates exclusively and too long on these top priorities, company contribution programs will be neglected,'' he said. Social Issues Stressed **********But Mr. Woodside of Primerica cautions against focusing too much attention on the money contributed by the business community while underestimating the impact that corporate leaders can exercise on social issues. ''Concerned leadership can have more impact than a few percentage points' increase in corporate giving,'' he said. **********When he was succeeded by Gerald Tsai Jr. at American Can earlier this year, Mr. Woodside was asked to continue directing the company's foundation. **********''I wish more retiring executives in my kind of position still directed company foundations,'' he said. ''But even then, the C.E.O. has to be at least sympathetic and supportive or nothing happens.'' 'Greed Is In' **********There is no question that there is an altered ''attitudinal atmosphere'' in the country today, says Andrew C. Sigler, chief executive of the Champion International Company. In 1981, he led a Business Roundtable group that produced a landmark - and controversial - policy statement that maintained that corporations, along with providing goods and services for profit, also had a social responsibility toward the community. **********Mr. Sigler said: ''Ten years ago the pressures on me were to see that Champion did more for the community. But the world has changed. Today, greed is in and we are told greed and intolerance are good for the country and for the company. But I don't see it that way.'' He said that company leaders had a stake in speaking out on issues such as housing, education and child care and encouraging their employees to volunteer for community activities. **********The surge of hostile takeovers and leveraged buyouts is one of the ''worst developments I have seen,'' he said. **********T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman who is a leading figure in recent takeovers, said: ''I don't pat myself on the back or build monuments to myself the way others do for giving away the company's money. Company giving has to be related to the company's interests; not be a gift to the ballet because my wife likes ballet.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/11/world/der-erich-welcomed-home-by-a-saar-town.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1987-09-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 950, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "'Der Erich' Welcomed Home by a Saar Town", "print_headline": "'Der Erich' Welcomed Home by a Saar Town", "body_text": " **********Erich Honecker, who has dedicated his major efforts as the East German leader to keeping the two Germanys separate, made an emotional visit today to his dowdy hometown in the Saar Valley. **********Now 75 years old, Mr. Honecker was a Communist youth leader in his 20's when the Nazis entered Saarland and he was forced to flee the country. He eventually made his way to Berlin and was imprisoned soon after by the Nazis. Mr. Honecker was freed by the Russians after a decade in prison. He returned here twice for brief visits after the war, but never after the two Germanys were formed in 1949. **********In comparison with the pomp and formality of his official visits to Bonn and to industrial centers on the Rhine, the visit to the Saar Valley, a former center of mining and steel production that has fallen on hard times, was heavy with sentiment and nostalgia. **********About 200 townspeople, heavily outnumbered by policemen and reporters, broke into polite applause from behind police lines as Mr. Honecker's motorcade pulled up to No. 88 on Kuchenberg Street, a plain green-stucco house built by Mr. Honecker's grandfather, a worker at the now-defunct Neunkirchen ironworks. **********Mr. Honecker's sister, Gertrud Hoppstadter, a 69-year-old widow, still lives there. Mr. Honecker walked through to the backyard, where he plucked an apple and shook some neighbors' hands before going in for a private visit. **********He and his sister then went off to visit the graves of their parents. The cemetery had been sealed off to the public and the press several hours before, and the police took care that Mr. Honecker would be out of range of cameras when he approached the black marble stone, ringed by neatly planted begonias and marked ''Family of Wilhelm Honecker.'' **********In an official visit dominated by the conflicting myths and images of a divided nation, the trip to the Saar region seemed particularly ironic. Here was a Communist leader responsible for throwing up the most infamous barrier between East and West, one moreover who has fervently rejected any notion of ever reuniting Germany, emotionally affirming a most personal link to West Germany. **********His hosts, however, seemed determined to make Mr. Honecker feel at home. On Wednesday night, at a private dinner in Saarbrucken with Oskar Lafontaine, the Socialist leader of Saarland state, Mr. Honecker was treated to Saar specialties and heard the Karlsberg Brewery choir sing the song ''To the Homeland I Return.'' **********To most of the townspeople who gathered outside his house, it was ''der Erich'' or ''Honny'' paying a call home in his old age, like so many others who left the area after its mines and ironworks began to close down. The giant complex in Neunkirchen, where both of Mr. Honecker's grandfathers worked, was shut eight years ago, leaving a ghostly tangle of giant rusted stacks and pipes hanging over the town, which is adjacent to Wiebelskirchen. A Schoolmate Remembers **********One of those who stayed behind was Mr. Honecker's schoolmate Erich Muller, also 75. He had been in the Communist youth organization and remembered Mr. Honecker as a ''good comrade - sincere and loyal.'' **********The small West German Communist Party posted portraits of Mr. Honecker around Wiebelskirchen with the message that has formed something of a refrain in his speeches, ''Never again war from Germany.'' **********A pub and a pizzeria near the Honecker house paid him something of a wittier tribute. The pub offered a ''Honny Special,'' made with Gorbachev vodka, fruit juice and apple wine, while the pizzeria offered a Honecker Pizza with extra red peppers. To make it spicier? the chef was asked. ''No, to make it redder,'' he said. **********Mr. Honecker had begun the day with a visit to the ancient city of Trier, where he laid 50 roses at a bust of Marx and visited Marx's house. In the guest book, he wrote of his sense of pride that Marx's ideas had been ''successfully developed'' in East Germany. **********Several small groups of demonstrators clustered on a square near the house, one holding a banner depicting Marx asking, ''Erich, what have you turned me into?'' Few There to Greet Him **********But as elsewhere along Mr. Honecker's route through West Germany, the ranks of both the demonstrators and the public were thin, especially when compared to the enormous buildup to the visit and the heavy coverage given it by the West German press. Most of the people who turned up, moreover, said they came out of curiosity, and not out of a sense of history in the making or concern over the issues at stake. **********Many of those met in various towns seemed to hope that the visit would bring some improvement in cross-border travel to East Germany and in the lives of the East Germans, but almost no one thought reunification was a practical possibility. A poll on the television program ''Report'' found that of 1,000 Germans questioned about the possibility of reunification, only 8 percent were positive, 58 percent said it was hardly possible, 33 percent said it was impossible. **********The findings seemed to confirm that the visit was less a breakthrough in relations than an affirmation that the relations of the two Germanys, 38 years after they became separate states, had found a practical form that no longer raised potent emotions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/business/the-fathers-of-financial-futures.html": {"writer_name": "Julia Flynn", "pub_date": "1987-11-01", "snippet": "LEAD: ON Aug. 15, 1971, President Nixon announced that the United States would scrap the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, which tied international currency rates to the dollar.", "word_count": 802, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE FATHERS OF FINANCIAL FUTURES", "print_headline": "THE FATHERS OF FINANCIAL FUTURES", "body_text": " **********LEAD: ON Aug. 15, 1971, President Nixon announced that the United States would scrap the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, which tied international currency rates to the dollar. **********ON Aug. 15, 1971, President Nixon announced that the United States would scrap the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, which tied international currency rates to the dollar. **********Almost immediately, three men at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange had an inspiration: If international currencies were going to fluctuate in relation to the dollar, they could be traded on an exchange.in relation to the dollar, they could be traded on an exchange. **********Thus, in the tumultuous commodity pits of Chicago, financial futures were born. **********Leo Melamed, at the time the youngest chairman in the history of the Merc, Everette B. Harris, the Merc's politically astute president and Mark J. Powers, its first economist, quickly grasped that such currency trading could be a tremendous boon to the second-largest commodities exchange. (The Chicago Board of Trade is the biggest.) With a masterful combination of bravado and persistent salesmanship, Mr. Melamed and Mr. Harris spent nine months convincing their skeptical membership that trading money as a commodity was a good idea. Many Merc members passed up the chance to pay $100 for the privilege of trading in this new market-within-the Merc, called the International Monetary Market, or IMM. **********The Merc trio hired Milton Friedman, then an economist at the University of Chicago, to write a study on the subject. Mr. Friedman, report, ''The Need for Futures Markets in Currencies,'' was widely read by exchange officials. Within two weeks of the paper's publication, Illinois regulators gave the Merc permission to trade currency futures in the IMM. The Merc began the trading on May 16, 1972. **********Almost immediately, the currency futures stirred controversy. Large banks and foreign-exchange dealers were stunned by the idea that Midwestern pork-belly traders could buy and sell futures on foreign currencies. Currency trading had been dominated by an international coterie of bankers and dealers. **********Even later, in 1975, when the Chicago Board of Trade followed the Merc with Ginnie Mae futures, traditional currency traders weren't used to the idea. ''They looked at us as a bunch of grain traders,'' said Richard L. Sandor, a former chief economist for the C.B.O.T. and now a senior vice president at Drexel Burham Lambert Inc. ''They didn't believe Chicago's exchanges had the human capital, the talent, to trade financial futures.'' **********Back when the Merc started the IMM, some people simply thought Chicago had pulled a fast one on the financial world. And the man most obviously responsible was Leo Melamed. **********Mr. Melamed, whose family fled Poland in 1939, had joined the Merc in the early 1950's as a $25-a-week runner for Merrill Lynch. Once described as someone who could pass you in a revolving door after you had stepped in first, Mr. Melamed became the leader of a group known as The Young Turks - a group that took control of the Merc's board of directors in 1969. **********Mr. Melamed, who became Merc chairman that same year, was perhaps the most outspoken champion of financial futures, often working the floor of the Merc to push the IMM. ''He had an uncanny ability to persuade people to do something right by persuading them it was in their self-interest,'' said Mr. Harris. Said Mr. Powers: ''He's a master manipulator; he sells hopes and dreams.'' **********Under Mr. Melamed's leadership, the Merc, an ancestor of the Chicago Butter and Egg Board, aggressively challenged its rival, the C.B.O.T., with a dizzying array of new commodities. **********The list kept lengthening. Mr. Powers, who had written his Ph.D. thesis on pork belly futures, helped introduce futures contracts on a range of currencies - everything from British pounds and Canadian dollars to Mexican pesos and Dutch guilders. According to Bob Tamarkin, author of ''The New Gatsbys,'' a book about Chicago's commodity traders, the number of foreign currency contracts nearly tripled between 1972 and 1973. **********In 1974, the day that private ownership of gold was legalized, the Merc began trading in gold futures. In 1975, it initiated trading in Treasury bill futures. **********The same year, Congress set up the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to regulate the industry. The C.F.T.C. was given the job of defining what a commodity was. That set the stage for trading ''intangible'' commodities, such as stock index futures. **********In 1982, the Kansas City Board of Trade petitioned the C.F.T.C. to allow it to trade futures based on the Value Line Index of stocks. Instead of a buyer or seller actually taking delivery of the commodity - the way commodities had been long defined - Missouri exchange officials proposed that trades of stock index futures be settled with cash. Within months, other exchanges seized on the idea.

The brokers seemed to take the idea in stride. **********The Glass-Steagall Act, which has separated banks and brokerages since 1933, has long been a staple on the securities group's agenda. But lately attempts to repeal provisions of the law have gained momentum. **********David S. Ruder, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said that he had not yet taken a final position but that so long as banks engage in brokerage activities through separate affilates subject to S.E.C. regulation, the commission would look carefully at such legislation. Three such bills are before Congress. Fed Official Favors Change **********Later in the conference, E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said he, too, favors change. **********''I do believe the near-term agenda should include repeal or substantial modification of the Glass-Steagall Act so long as it is reciprocal and does contain appropriate supervisory safeguards,'' said Mr. Corrigan, who in general believes brokerages and banks should be treated more consistently. **********In a news conference before his formal address, Mr. Ruder explained that he previously had some concerns about whether allowing banks to engage in brokerage activities might create serious conflicts of interest. For instance, would a bank with a brokerage subsidiary be reluctant to lend money to the subsidiary's competitors. And in a crisis, would the bank withhold credit because it was already losing money in the business. Concerns Alleviated **********''My concerns in that regard have been substantially alleviated,'' Mr. Ruder said. He added that bankers had reassured him that their willingness to lend would be unrelated to their own brokerage activities. **********Many brokers in the past weeks had pointed to First Options of Chicago, an options clearing subsidiary of the Continental Illinois Bank, which lost $90 million in the market plunge in October, saying it showed why banks do not belong in their backyard. But Mr. Ruder indicated that First Options had not changed his thinking. **********Mr. Ruder also said he believed the securities industry was ''healthy'' but proposed that a pool of emergency capital provided by a wide range of parties could address some of the liquidity problems exposed in October. In a crisis, troubled firms could tap the fund. **********But John J. Phelan Jr., chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, said in his own news conference that his constituents would oppose putting money into a pool over which they had little control. Potential Conflicts **********''Most of the member firms do not like that idea,'' Mr. Phelan said. He said these firms would rather buy specialist firms that get into trouble as a way of infusing capital into the system. Historically, investment firms have not owned specialist firms because of potential conflicts between underwriting and market-making functions, as well as large upfront capital commitments. **********''I think it's wonderful idea,'' said Louis Miceli Jr., a specialist on the American Stock Exchange, referring to the pool. ''Will it ever happen? No way. If they do that, I'm going to buy a Ferrari; why worry about capital.'' **********The debate about the need for more capital could not have been less academic. Even while Mr. Ruder addressed reporters, the hotel was buzzing about Shearson Lehman Brothers' imminent purchase of E. F. Hutton and Drexel Burnham Lambert's planned purchase of Carl H. Pforzheimer & Company, a specialist firm. **********Those two deals and this week's announcement by Paine Webber that it had agreed to sell an equity interest to a Japanese insurance company all reflect the continued blurring of lines between classes of financial players as firms hungrily seek capital. Inevitable Mergers **********''Those kinds of mergers are inevitable,'' Mr. Phelan said. **********Though the industry's official position has not changed, many brokers expressed little resistance to talk of change. John S. Chalsty, president of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and a new director of the securities group, said he understood the concern of his peers about additional competition from the banks, but he was not worried about the impact on his firm. **********''We neither welcome nor resist it,'' he said. ''If Glass-Steagall was repealed we'd continue business as usual.'' He cited his firm's ability to find profitable niches in the municipal finance area in the past in spite of competition from larger brokerages and, to a limited degree, from banks. **********Mr. Ruder also urged the conferees not to pare back office operations in their haste to retrench. He said the commission received double the usual number of complaints from investors about market malfunctions in past months. In that vein, Mr. Phelan announced new efforts to upgrade the exchange's ability to handle heavy trading volume like that seen in October. **********''History tells us it will happen again,'' Mr. Phelan said. In addition to the $200 million the exchange has spent over the last five years on capital improvements, the exchange's board has pledged another $200 million over the next five years. **********The Big Board has also formed an advisory committee to coordinate efforts to improve trading and communication throughout Wall Street.

But within five years it had been joined by more than two dozen other advertising agencies. **********Now there are unmistakable signs that the advertising industry is laying claim to another part of Manhattan, an emerging office district on the Lower West Side, which lies at the western edge of Greenwich Village, north of the Holland Tunnel. **********Earlier this month Della Femina, Travisano & Partners signed a deal for 122,000 square feet of space in a building at 350 Hudson Street, between King and Charles Streets, that until recently housed printers and graphic artists. Ephron, Raboy, Tsao & Kurnit Advertising Inc. signed a deal in February for 16,5000 square feet across the street in the former loft building at 345 Hudson. **********Della Femina, Travisano is giving up about 74,000 square feet in the Nabisco Brands building at 625 Madison Avenue at 59th Street, and Ephron, Raboy will leave its 7,000 square feet in 800 Third Avenue at 50th Street.

According to Mitchell Rudin, leasing director for the project, Saatchi & Saatchi has since signed for two more floors in the building, bringing its total there to 510,000 square feet. The company, which expects to move into its space by late summer, will not use all of it immediately, however. It is now negotiating with another advertising agency to take some of the space on a sublet basis. **********The relatively low cost of space in the area is its main drawing card. **********''Madison Avenue is second only to Park Avenue in terms of rents in midtown,'' said Stephen Fredericks of Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate brokerage company. ''Midtown rents are in the high $30's a square foot even in older buildings. Advertising agencies are extraodinarily conscious of operating costs because their revenues are so unpredictable. So they have not been a dominant tenant on Madison for quite some time.'' **********Cathie Payne, director of administration for Della Femina, Travisano, said that if the agency had renewed its lease in the Madison Avenue building the cost of its space would have nearly doubled. **********The asking price for space in the new Tishman Speyer building is in the ''high $20's'' per square foot and Trinity Real Estate is asking $22 a foot for renovated space in its bulding at 350 Hudson Street. But some renovated space in the area, mainly in smaller side street structures below Canal Street, is going for $16.50 a foot. **********Trinity Real Estate, the dominant property owner in the area, started to upgrade its loft buildings a few years ago as it watched SoHo and TriBeCa emerge as strong residential and commercial neighorboods and as the traditional boundaries of the financial district pushed north and west. **********''The location of these loft buildings is their most valuable asset,'' said Walter F. Spardel, managing director of Trinity Real Estate's 27 properties. ''But they have high ceilings and 250-pound floors that allow traditional office use as well as companies that have heavy computer needs.'' **********Trinity, which is calling the new office neighborhood Hudson Square, has already put several office tenants in the building at 345 Hudson Street and is renovating the 275,000-square-foot building at 350 Hudson Street. The modernization of the 1927 building will include new mechanical systems, new windows and a new granite and marble lobby. In addition to the Della Femina, Travisano lease, Trinity has signed a deal with the Athenian West Corporation to operate a restaurant in 4,500 square feet of ground floor space. **********Della Femina, Travisano expects to move 300 people into the fifth through the eighth floors of the building. In addition, Trinity is building a 17,000-square-foot ninth floor penthouse for the company's executive offices. **********Trinity Real Estate and Tishman Speyer are not the only developers in the area.

Bernstein & Company brokerage firm, like many other Wall Street professionals, thought Friday's action was ''absolutely absurd.'' But he was equally surprised at what happened on Monday, when the market reverted to a very lackluster pace. **********''It's amazing what can happen one trading day to the next,'' Mr. Hinkle added. **********Part of the reason for yesterday's slowdown, traders and market analysts said, might have been the winter storm that blanketed the New York area in several inches of snow. Many traders arrived at work late, and this, along with the weekend break, may have relieved some of the tension that had built up in the marketplace. **********''It's been calm,'' said John Havens of Morgan Stanley & Company. ''As a matter of fact, it's been boring.'' **********At least by recent standards, it was. The Dow, which has risen to such lofty levels in recent weeks that profit taking was almost inevitable, fell about a dozen points in the first 35 minutes of trading. That decline, experts said, was due mainly to traders who were selling stocks and reinvesting their funds in stock index futures, an arbitrager action that has become commonplace of late. **********This type of arbitrager activity, because of where the stock and index futures markets closed on Friday, was predictable. And it was also short-lived, with these so-called program traders turning inactive after the opening onslaught of sell orders. **********By 10:30 A.M., blue-chip stocks had already begun to recover and the Dow was ahead about 5 points. From then on it was back and forth, with the Dow reversing direction several times. Secondary stocks, however, remained in arrears all day. **********The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.39, to 153.63; the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 0.49, to 269.61, and the average share fell a dime. Losing issues topped gainers by 968 to 599. **********Other indexes that represented secondary stocks also declined. The American Stock Exchange index dropped by 1.36, to 294.09, and in over-the-counter trading the Nasdaq index fell 4.21, to 387.98. **********Donald Selkin, head of stock index futures trading at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said there was an obvious shift in interest in favor of the blue chips in his market yesterday. He noted that, during most of the day, the Major Market Index futures contract, which closely mirrors the Dow, rose sharply, leaving the other futures indexes behind. **********''The main factor in stock index futures,'' Mr. Selkin said, ''was a continuing move into the indexes whose underlying stocks are the big capitalization issues.'' But the preference of stock index futures traders broadened a bit late yesterday, Mr. Selkin said, when indexes that contain secondary stocks suddenly rose sharply. **********That about-face, the experts believe, might create a situation where the program traders will be buying stocks and selling index futures contracts when trading resumes. Same Optimistic Outlook **********The reasons stock index futures traders became interested in blue-chip issues yesterday were elusive. Generally speaking, however, there was, in those markets, the same optimistic outlook about interest rates, the dollar and the economy that has prevailed on Wall Street recently. **********The stock index futures markets, however, tend to be much more volatile than, say, the Big Board. And like the commodity markets, stock index futures markets often move quickly and without warning on the least bit of news, often pulling the regular cash stock market with them. **********Selling pressure from the program traders on Friday, for instance, came around the time the Federal Reserve's chairman, Paul A. Volcker, was issuing a relatively innocuous statement about dangers to the banking system. While nobody on Wall Street could say for sure that this statement prompted the record selloff, several mentioned the remarks as a possible trigger.

UNDER OLD RULE", "print_headline": "LAST CHANCE TO SET UP I.R.A. UNDER OLD RULE", "body_text": " **********Come April 15, another annual tradition will largely be relegated to tax history: the rush to earn a last-minute tax deduction by putting money into an Individual Retirement Account. **********For millions of taxpayers, the next few weeks represent a final opportunity to claim an I.R.A. deduction because of the new restrictions imposed by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Under the new law, middle- and upper-income individuals who are covered by some sort of retirement plan at work will no longer be eligible for an I.R.A. deduction. **********Although the new restrictions do not apply to 1986 returns, tax professionals have detected considerable confusion among taxpayers as to whether time has already run out to claim an I.R.A. deduction. **********''They're under the mistaken apprehension that the new rules are effective for 1986, when they are not,'' said Sidney Kess, national director of tax policy at the accounting firm of KMG Main Hurdman. **********Part of the confusion stems from the fact that the I.R.A. provision is effective beginning in 1987. However, the new restrictions do not apply to contributions made for the 1986 tax year, which are allowed to be made after the tax year ends. Under both the old and new laws, taxpayers have until April 15 to make contributions for the previous tax year. **********Thus, every worker still has until April 15 to contribute up to $2,000 of earnings to an I.R.A. for the 1986 tax year and claim a deduction - on the 1986 tax return - for the amount deposited. Taxpayers are allowed to file their tax return and claim an I.R.A. deduction before actually making the deposit to the I.R.A. But the deposit has to be made by April 15. **********Only two provisions of the new law directly apply to 1986 contributions. As of Jan. 1, gold and silver coins minted by the United States Government are no longer prohibited investments for an I.R.A. Other collectibles, however, remain off-limits. **********The second change affects the contribution limits for couples in cases where the second earner brings home only a nominal amount of income. As has long been the case, one-income couples can contribute up to $2,250 a year. If both spouses work, each can contribute as much as they earn, up to a maximum of $2,000 each. **********Some couples fell into a crack, however, if the second spouse earned money but less than $250. In this case they were not able to contribute as much as one-income couples. Congress thought this was inequitable and corrected it in the new tax law so that all couples can now contribute at least $2,250. Concerns About New Law **********Even among people who are fully aware that the I.R.A. deduction is still available, many have had reservations about making the investment because of concerns about the future impact of the new tax law on money now placed in I.R.A.'s. Most tax advisers, however, believe it is worthwhile to make 1986 contributions. **********''Once you get into next year, I have strong feelings on I.R.A.'s, and they're all negative,'' said Peter Elinsky, a tax partner at the accounting firm of Peat Marwick. ''But this year you probably want to do it.'' **********In fact, money deposited in an I.R.A. for 1986 will be treated the same as before. Money in the account is allowed to grow and compound tax-free until withdrawn. The only basic change is that the value of the tax deferral will be reduced somewhat because tax rates will be lower. **********Another question arising from the tax law change is whether it still pays for someone who is hard pressed for cash to take out a loan to make an I.R.A. deposit by April 15. **********In the past, many taxpayers found they came out ahead even after paying interest on the loan. The interest cost was more than offset by the benefit of the I.R.A. deduction, the tax deferral on I.R.A. earnings and the itemized deduction for interest paid on the loan. More Things to Consider **********Now the equation has changed somewhat. While all taxpayers can still get a deduction on 1986 returns, the benefit of the future tax deferral will not be as large as before because of the lower tax rates. Furthermore, the new law places tighter restrictions on interest deductions. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Elinsky believes that taxpayers who borrow this year to finance an I.R.A. contribution will still come out ahead. ''It's still an extra cost, but I think that cost is worth it because of the I.R.A. deduction and the deferral.'' In addition, the interest may still be fully deductible. **********While there remains some uncertainty among tax professionals about the exact tax treatment of interest paid on I.R.A. loans, an I.R.S. spokesman said the interest is considered ''investment interest.'' Under the new law, investment interest remains fully deductible up to the amount of the individual's investment income. Keogh Plans **********In addition to contributing to an I.R.A., self-employed individuals can also make a tax-deductible deposit to a Keogh plan. Anyone with self-employment income can set up a Keogh plan, including people with sideline businesses, such as a schoolteacher who tutors privately after school, an office worker who plays trumpet in a band on weekends or an executive who serves on an outside company's board of directors. **********The limit on contributions to a Keogh plan depends on the specific type of plan established. The top limit is 20 percent of self-employment earnings, which applies only to ''money-purchase'' Keogh plans. This type of plan is rigid and requires a fixed level of contribution to be made each year - regardless of whether the business is profitable or not. **********Andrew Zuckerman, a senior tax manager at the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen & Company, said this type of plan is best for individuals who expect their business to be profitable far into the future and can thus afford to put away a fixed percentage of income every year. **********Otherwise, individuals may be more comfortable with a ''profit-sharing'' Keogh plan. The maximum amount that can be contributed to this type of plan, however, is only 13.043 percent of earnings. Flexibility vs. Percentage **********The trade-off is greater flexibility. With a profit-sharing plan, individuals do not have to deposit the same percentage every year. They can even skip years when business conditions warrant. **********Those looking for a way to make the biggest contribution possible but still be able to put in less when they desire can set up both a profit-sharing and money-purchase plan. **********No matter which type of plan or combination is selected, contributions cannot exceed $30,000 a year. The only way to exceed that limit is to establish a ''defined benefit'' plan where contributions can be higher in order to achieve a particular level of benefits upon retirement. **********Contributions to a Keogh plan can be made even later than the April 15 deadline that applies to I.R.A.'s. If a taxpayer requests a filing extension, Keogh contributions can be made any time up until the extended due date of the return. The one catch is that for a Keogh contribution to be deductible on 1986 returns, the plan must have been set up by last Dec. 31. **********For those who missed the Dec. 31 deadline, there is the option of setting up a Simplified Employee Pension plan. While these plans, known as SEP's, play second fiddle to Keogh plans, they do offer a way to get a tax deduction at this late date. SEP as a Temporary Plan **********''If I wanted a Keogh but didn't get around to setting one up in time, I'd set up a SEP and then set up a Keogh plan for next year,'' Mr. Elinsky said. ''In other words I'd use the SEP as a bridge.'' Indeed, many self-employed people use the SEP only for one year and then turn to a Keogh plan on a permanent basis. **********The main attraction of SEP's is that they can be set up any time until April 15 to qualify for a deduction on tax returns due on that date. Unlike a Keogh plan, however, SEP contributions cannot be made any later than April 15 - regardless of whether the taxpayer has a filing extension. **********Many people choose to abandon SEP's after the first year because they find them less attractive than Keoghs in some respects. **********One drawback is that SEP contributions are limited to 13.043 percent of earnings, compared with the higher 20 percent limit with a money-purchase Keogh. **********SEP's also fall short when it comes to the tax treatment of withdrawals. Keogh plan withdrawals are eligible for favorable ''averaging'' treatment. SEP's are not. **********Self-employed individuals with employees have another reason for preferring Keogh plans: Often they have to provide coverage for many more exployees with a SEP than under a Keogh plan.

Suddenly, problems that have been looming for months - giant budget and trade deficits - are being addressed with greater urgency. But there are no easy solutions. Lowering interest rates, for instance, might spur spending in America, but it would cut off much of the foreign funding of this country's budget deficit. Following are objectives and obstacles facing the President and economic policy makers.  RESTORE CALM TO THE MARKETS  Confidence in political and financial leadership has weakened because of stock market collapse. Huge budget and trade deficits could keep interest rates high and hold back U.S. economic growth. Prospects for military conflict in Middle East remain.   Markets will remain jittery until progress is made on budget deficit. Fear of another financial panic will keep President and Congress working toward that end. Greater international cooperation could result from danger of more trauma in foreign stock and money markets.   LOWER INTEREST RATES  Stock market and economy benefit from lower interest rates, but rates are difficult to cut because foreign investors are already skittish about investing in dollar-denominated securities.   Tug of war is under way. Interest rates at present or higher rates might be necessary to attract foreign buyers to help fund budget deficit. But **********Federal Reserve has been pumping money into banking system recently to lower interest rates and keep economy moving.   CUT THE BUDGET DEFICIT  Congress still sharply divided on where to cut budget for fiscal 1988. To make inroads that will help markets, Democrats will have to agree to deeper cuts in social spending, and Administration must agree to spend less on defense and seek more than the $12 billion in tax increases it has recently suggested.   Spending cuts of at least $23 billion are certain by Nov. 20 because of automatic spending cuts mandated by Congress. Renewed dialogue between White House and Congress increases chances for more cuts, perhaps to the $30 million that Wall Street analysts say is needed to help markets. Except for Social Security cuts, all possibilities are on the table, including tax increases.   CUT THE TRADE DEFICIT  Trade deficit should be improving by now. But Americans have developed a taste for foreign products and, with foreign economies sluggish, demand for American exports is weak. Other problems: Major trading partners are reluctant to improve access to their markets for American goods; dollar has not declined against some big trading partners, so their goods remain attractively priced.   Deficit will not change much in near future. Pending trade legislation would force retaliation against unfair practices of trading partners, but it is also widely viewed as protectionist, inviting retaliation against American goods.   STABILIZE THE DOLLAR  Currency markets are nervous, and their stability is necessary for interest rates to decline. Improving trade deficit may require another dollar decline to make American goods cheaper abroad. Coordinated support of dollar by central banks cannot stop slide if currency markets move en masse.   Dollar is likely to fall to help trade deficit. Stabiity will return when currency markets see progress on budget and trade deficits. Otherwise, foreign investors will stay away from U.S. securities and dollar sinks lower.   AVOID A RECESSION  Attitudes toward spending have grown more cautious since market collapse. This could slow consumer purchases and cause businesses to delay or pare back spending on plants and equipment. High interest rates to attract foreign investors might further slow economy.   Danger of recession has increased because of outlook for slower growth than expected. **********Recession not likely to occur if Federal Reserve pumps money into economy, driving interest rates lower and inducing spending."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/01/world/chad-said-to-win-vast-libyan-booty.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1987-04-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 684, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHAD SAID TO WIN VAST LIBYAN BOOTY", "print_headline": "CHAD SAID TO WIN VAST LIBYAN BOOTY", "body_text": " **********Western diplomats said today that military equipment abandoned by Libyan forces retreating from northern Chad was believed to be worth half a billion dollars. **********The Libyans, who were said to have left two more bases without firing a shot, are reported to have lost warplanes, helicopters, tanks, missiles and armored personnel carriers. **********''We have not sat down yet with an adding machine and a catalogue of acquisition costs,'' a diplomat said, ''but it is certainly hundreds of millions of dollars worth of materiel.'' **********According to Chadian military communiques, 3,603 Libyan soldiers have been killed and 1,165 captured this year.

Greyhound had asked for quick approval, warning that Trailways was in poor shape and that if the Interstate Commerce Commission took its time there would be little of value to take over. The Justice Department at first opposed the $80 million bid, saying that combining the nation's only two national bus systems could raise serious anti-competitive problems. Later, however, it found that the acquisition was necessary because Trailways was on the brink of bankruptcy. Fred G. Currey, the chairman and president of Greyhound and a past president of Trailways, discusses the competitive effects of his company's bid. Q. Must Trailways be taken over quickly?  A. According to the affidavits filed by its chief financial officer and its lead bank, which have been concurred in by the Justice Department, Trailways is a failed company. Frankly, without our intervention Trailways's collapse is imminent and inevitable.  * * * **********Q. What would the consequences be if the I.C.C. does not allow Trailways to be acquired? **********A. There would a massive discontinuance of service to hundreds of cities and towns across the United States that have no other form of public transportation.  * * * **********Q. With total ridership of national bus systems so small, couldn't the slack be picked up by smaller bus companies and other forms of transportation? **********A. No way. Because the only form of public transportation that can fill it is a private automobile. The people who would be affected are those who reside in the hundreds of communities that connect up to the thousands of communities that Greyhound serves. There is no alternative. The service can't be duplicated. Bus riders would be forced to spend the money to buy an automobile. Some just can't afford to.  * * * **********Q. Since Greyhound, with the acquisition of Trailways, would be the only national bus transportation company, what would prevent you from acting like a monopoly? **********A. I wish I thought we had enought muscle to set prices. There are three leading competitors and we price against these competitors today. They are the private automobile, the discount air fare and people who stay at home. With only 1.3 percent of the travel market, there is absolute certainty that we cannot raise fares. We have been squeezed down. We have cut fares between thousands of city pairs in the last 90 days and in many we have no competition except the private automobile.  * * * **********Q. How would bus service be affected? **********A. We believe that the impact will be positive. The bus system is like a kind of telephone system - the more places it connects the more valuable it is.  * * * **********Q. Could another national bus company emerge to compete with you? **********A. It's possible. Deregulation has eliminated many of the barriers of entry and the start-up costs are not large.  * * * **********Q. How will the smaller bus companies be affected? **********A. We will honor all the commitments of Trailways lines to the 34 independent bus companies. We will continue to exchange passengers with the independent companies that now interline with Greyhound lines. It should strengthen all those small companies. The small companies that now interline with Greyhound don't have access to the feed from the cities that are served by Trialways and vice versa. **********We see the combination of these two companies fitting hand in glove with using vans to extend service where it has been discontinued by either Trialways or Greyhound."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/12/business/company-news-sec-investigates-harcourt-offering.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 195, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "S.E.C.

Senator Sam Nunn, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, had argued forcefully that the Senate approved the ABM treaty on the understanding that it set severe limits on ''Star Wars'' tests. Adamant U.S. Opposition **********By referring to ratification, the Soviet side seemed to be asking the Administration to agree to Mr. Nunn's view of the treaty. The American side was adamantly opposed to accepting the Soviet language. **********At one point, on Wednesday evening, the American side met by itself to reconsider its position. Hard-line officials urged that the Administration continue to insist on an affirmation of its need for space testing and eventual deployment of ''Star Wars.'' **********The American side returned to Wednesday night's negotiating session at 11 P.M. with its tough position. The result, one Administration expert said, was that the Russians ''gagged.'' The meeting broke up at 12:30 A.M. **********According to American participants, Mr. Shultz and Mr. Shevardnadze met Thursday morning at the Soviet Embassy. The purpose of the meeting was to make one more effort to agree on about a half dozen issues remaining before a scheduled 10:30 meeting between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev. **********But the Shultz-Shevardnadze meeting still left the issues unresolved. Meeting for Final Push **********The Soviet side proposed that a group of high-level experts from each side meet at the White House for a final push to overcome the differences, and the meeting between the two leaders was delayed. **********Marshal Akhromeyev and Viktor P. Karpov represented the Soviet side. The American team consisted of Mr. Nitze; Max M. Kampelman, the chief American arms negotiator; Ronald F. Lehman, the senior negotiatior on long-range arms, and Col. Robert E. Linhard of the Air Force, the principal arms control expert on the staff of the National Security Council. **********In the talks between the experts, the Russians accepted an American demand that conventionally armed cruise missiles on aircraft should be left outside the scope of the treaty. **********On cruise missiles aboard ships and submarines, the two sides patched together a compromise. The United States agreed to a Soviet demand that a new treaty on long-range arms should include a ''ceiling'' on such weapons. But to satisfy the Americans, the Soviet side dropped its demand that the sea-based cruise missile be limited to certain types of vessels. **********That left several key issues undecided, including what limit to set on the number of warheads on ballistic missiles and how to intepret the 1972 defensive treaty limiting anti-ballistic missiles. **********At one point, with time running out, American officials reportedly suggested that they might show some flexibility on language on the ABM treaty if the Russians would agree to a limit of 4,800 on the number of warheads on ballistic missiles. Marshal Akhromeyev is said to have countered that the Russians would agree to a limit of 4,900 to 5,000 if all of the differences over the ABM treaty in the joint statement could be worked out. **********But the two sides were at an impasse on the ABM treaty, and the issue passed for resolution back to Mr. Shultz and Mr. Shevardnadze, who were at the White House. **********Now the final push began. The two men worked with Mr. Carlucci, Lieut. Gen. Colin L. Powell, the national security adviser, and the teams of American and Soviet experts. **********Again the issues were basically the same. The Russians wanted Washington to agree to observe the ABM treaty as ''signed and ratified.'' Washington wanted the Russians to affirm its right to deploy anti-missile systems. **********Mr. Shultz persuaded Mr. Shervardnadze to drop his insistence about including language in the joint statement about adherence to the ''ratified'' ABM treaty. Mr. Shultz reportedly argued that such language would be an inappropriate reference to the political debate over the treaty between the Administration and the Senate. **********The Americans did not get a direct reference to testing in space. Instead, the joint statement included vague language that each side could carry out testing it thought was ''required'' under the terms of the ABM treaty. Demand on Statement Dropped **********The Americans also finally dropped their demand that the joint statement should affirm the right to deploy anti-missile systems. Instead, the statement says that after a period of adherence to the ABM treaty that has yet to be determined, ''each side will be free to decide its course of action.'' **********This is line with an American demand that the United States should be free to deploy after the non-withdrawal period expires. But it also suggests that the Russians may be free to take counteractions to thwart those defenses, if they so choose. **********Mr. Shevardnadze reportedly resisted even this compromise appoach. But Mr. Carlucci is reported to have swayed him by reading from the notes of an earlier meeting between Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Reagan. In that exchange, Mr. Gorbachev reportedly made the point that after the period of observance lapsed, each side could take whatever actions it wished. **********Soon after that, the White House was trumpeting its claim that the Russians had backed off their demand that the ABM treaty be strictly interpreted. And Mr. Gorbachev was saying the two sides needed to take steps to prevent the militarization of space. **********Senior Administration arms control officials, for their part, were saying the two sides had deferred the key dispute over how to interpret the ABM treaty until another day."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/30/business/rise-in-inflation-seen.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 178, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rise in Inflation Seen", "print_headline": "Rise in Inflation Seen", "body_text": " **********The senior economist at the Conference Board, a business information service, said today that he expects the inflation rate to increase this year and in 1988.

Sentences Near Maximum **********The sentences Mr. Andreyev requested - eight years for violation of international flight rules, four years for malicious hooliganism and two years for illegally crossing the border -were all near the maximum allowable for those offenses. Mr. Andreyev said the sentences would run concurrently. **********Mr. Andreyev's remarks showed the somber view Soviet officials have decided to take toward Mr. Rust's flight on May 28, which abruptly toppled Defense Minister Sergei L. Sokolov and led to a shake-up of the Soviet air defense forces. **********''Although he is not yet 20, he understood that he was risking his own life and the lives of others,'' Mr. Andreyev said.

The firms are required to ''settle'' trades - make sure a seller's records and a buyer's records are in accord - within five days. Only then can they properly assess what last week's plunge and partial recovery did to their own finances. **********''The Street is coming out of this pretty well,'' said Max C. Chapman Jr., president of Kidder, Peabody & Company. ''But I think Monday or Tuesday will be critical.'' Reckoning Remains Unclear **********Until then, the reckoning remains unclear. But it appears that the record volume may have been far from a disaster for the big retail houses. They deal with thousands of ordinary investors, who pay higher commissions than the volume discounts given institutional investors. **********In addition, the money that huge firms like Salomon Brothers made on inventories of bonds, which rose in value with the credit market rally, may counterbalance whatever beating they took in their stock holdings. **********Whether and how badly some firms may have been shaken may not be known for weeks. But the stocks of publicly traded brokerage firms were among last week's biggest casualties, a sign that the damage was expected to be serious. **********Three big securities firms - L. F. Rothschild, E. F. Hutton and Paine Webber - were among the 15 stocks hardest hit on the New York Stock Exchange. L. F. Rothschild's shares lost 51 percent of their market value, Paine Webber fell 40 percent, and E. F. Hutton lost 44 percent. **********The Street's strongest firms were hard hit as well. First Boston was down 32 percent, Bear, Stearns 33 percent, Salomon 32 percent, Morgan Stanley 23 percent, and Merrill Lynch 21 percent. **********''It makes perfect sense that they're down more,'' said John Keefe, an analyst who follows the securities industry for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ''If there was fundamental news to pin on any group of companies, it was the brokerage stocks.'' Firms Hurt by Lower Stock Prices **********Though the Wall Street firms routinely sell stock as well as buy it, Mr. Keefe said they are ''a net holder of securities.'' That means when market prices drop as they did last week, they are hurt by the fall in value of their inventories. **********That view was echoed by James E. Cayne, co-president of Bear Stearns Companies. ''Wall Street firms as a rule are 'long' the market,'' he said, using the Street's jargon for owning shares. ''So I would have to say Wall Street firms did not win. As a matter of fact, they lost.'' **********Bear, Stearns will be among the first to disclose the impact on its profits. In a few weeks, it will report its earnings for the three months ending Oct. 30. Most securities firms, in contrast, keep their books on a calendar year and will not have to make similar disclosures until after New Year's. Earnings Estimates Reduced **********Some Wall Street analysts, not taking any chances, are already reducing their earnings estimates for the publicly traded brokerage stocks. Michael W. Blumstein, a First Boston analyst, has chopped his estimate for Bear, Stearns' current quarter to 25 cents a share, from 55 cents - even though the firm is believed to have earned two to three times its usual commissions last week. **********Mr. Blumstein cited losses sustained in the firm's risk arbitrage unit, a department within Bear, Stearns that places bets on the outcome of takeover battles. Last week's tumult caused many takeovers to be scotched at the last moment, much to the dismay of arbitragers who owned the stocks. Bear, Stearns is also expected to sustain losses in its clearing activities, a service it performs for smaller brokerage firms for a fee. **********Mr. Keefe, of Drexel, has not yet downgraded the group, but thinks ''it's inevitable,'' despite the windfall in commissions most firms are expected to earn from last week's torrid trading. **********''Commissions per se won't really matter,'' Mr. Keefe said. ''Commissions as a revenue source are relatively minor these days, certainly relative to trading profits.'' Commission Income Not Vital **********Since May 1, 1975, when brokerage commission rates were opened to competition, commission income has declined in importance, and most Wall Street houses do not depend on that revenue. Firms that serve large institutional clients must be ready to execute the largest block trades for as little as a nickel or a dime a share. **********Merrill Lynch, with its extensive network of branches and huge retail customer base, said yesterday that it had done ''extremely well.'' But generally firms were not crowing about their results last week. Mr. Chapman of Kidder, Peabody said last week ''was a positive week, though certainly not spectacular.'' He said his firm experienced volume and commission revenues two to three times recent levels. **********George L. Ball, chairman of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said the upheaval ''was not devastating'' to his firm's profitability. **********But the brokerages are not yet in the clear. **********As the volatility fuels opportunities for trading profits, it also increases the opportunities to make mistakes, said to Robert S. Salomon Jr., a managing director at Salomon Brothers. A 'Punishing Environment' **********''If someone under pressure gets an order fouled up, by the time you go to correct it,'' he said, ''the market may be extraordinarily different than where the mistake occured, so it is a very punishing environment.'' **********Bear, Stearns is already the target of lawsuits by investors. And other firms acknowledge that they too could face litigation.  How Brokerage Stocks Fared Company Friday's Weekly Close % Chng.

The decline in the bond became pronounced when the bellwether Treasury bond futures contract, the June delivery, closed down 1 1/32, at 99 21/32. The bond futures market closes at 3 P.M., New York time, hours before the cash market closes. Apparently Futile Efforts **********What initially unsettled the bond market were the apparently futile efforts by the Federal Reserve and the central banks of Japan and some Western Europe countries to arrest the dollar's decline. There was also concern in the credit market that American trade sanctions against Japan could create a climate that would inhibit the Japanese purchase of American securities. **********The resumed decline in the dollar also caused the stock market to post a sharp decline, sent the price of gold soaring by more than $10 an ounce and overshadowed improving fundamentals in the bond market, such as the smaller increase in the inflation rate in February reported yesterday. **********''It is bad and could get worse, despite the improving fundamentals,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. ''In fact, the selloff has already broken through critical technical levels and, to make matters worse, spread to all Treasury maturities.'' **********This included the three intermediate Treasury note issues auctioned this week. Late yesterday the 6.375 percent notes of 1989 sold Tuesday sold on a when-issued basis at 99 27/ 32, down 4/32, to yield 6.46 percent. Also on a when-issued basis, the 6.75 percent issue of 1991 sold Wednesday fell 11/32, to 99 24/32, and now yields 6.82 percent, while the 7 percent issue of 1994 that was auctioned Thursday at an average price of 99.772, to yield 7.04 percent, traded late yesterday at 99.60, for a yield of 7.15 percent. **********''While the selling of Treasury issues began in Tokyo and then spread to London, it became more pronounced here as dealers, including those who still hold sizable amounts of notes purchased this week, began to mark down prices in an effort to reduce risk,'' Mr. Sullivan noted. ''About the best news today is that there was very little selling from retail investors.'' Japanese Fiscal Year Cited **********Raymond W. Stone, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, suggested that this week's selling of dollars and its ripple effect on the credit market could be related to the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31. As he explained: **********''It is reasonable to assume that many Japanese institutional investors preparing their annual statements would not like to show too many dollar assets on their books because of the sharp decline in the dollar's value against the yen in their fiscal year now ending.

The American Home Products Corporation first expressed an interest that was later withdrawn. Rorer's bid was made in late March, according to the Robins plan, which was filed last Thursday, and Rorer said it was still interested, although it added that there were no current negotiations. **********Mr. Cawthorn, who was born in Britain, first joined Rorer in 1982 as president of Rorer International. Rorer began as a small family pharmaceutical firm in Fort Washington, Pa., and its major product was Maalox, an antacid. Maalox is still a major Rorer product and the company is still based in Fort Washington. But most everything else has changed. **********Mr. Cawthorn, who became chairman and chief executive officer last May, was not available for an interview over the weekend but in the past the company has spelled out his strategy to make an acquisition that would put Rorer in the ranks of the top 10 to 15 drug companies. **********He has already doubled the company's size by acquiring Revlon's precription drug unit for $690 million, and he has restructured operations, trimmed the number of employees and recruited new executives. One member of the Rorer family, William H. Rorer 3d, resigned as a senior vice president in March to become president of Delaware Valley College. **********Mr. Cawthorn's strategy has been to focus the company's resources. It has taken a hard look at its research program, for example, and trimmed the least promising areas. **********Mr. Cawthorn, a graduate of Cambridge, moved to Canada in 1959 and joined Pfizer Canada.

Ten years ago last Saturday, Treasury bond futures contracts were introduced by the Chicago Board of Trade to a skeptical and cautious investing public. **********''There was a lot of resistance'' to the contract, recalled Leslie Rosenthal, managing partner at Rosenthal & Company, a Chicago futures brokerage house. He served as chairman of the Board of Trade's financial instruments committee 10 years ago. **********''Dealers were opposed because they pretty much had a monopoly in the business,'' Mr. Rosenthal said. ''The contracts meant that they might be losing business, and that their spreads would narrow. A lot of them told us that interest rates didn't fluctuate enough to warrant such a contract.'' **********Such sentiments are long gone. Over the last decade ballooning Federal budget deficits, sharp moves in the value of the dollar and a large increase in the issuance of corporate debt have produced dramatic, daily moves in interest rates. **********Slowly, corporate and government bond holders came to the realization that establishing positions in Treasury bond futures was the most efficient way to protect themselves against those moves or to speculate on where interest rates might be headed. Today, the contract represents about 30 percent of all futures trading in the United States. ''In our first full year of trading, some 220,000 contracts changed hands,'' said Karsten Mahlmann, chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade. ''We now regularly trade twice that volume in one trading session.'' **********The board's bond futures contract requires a purchaser of one contract to take delivery of the equivalent of $100,000 in current United States Treasury bonds with a maturity of 15 years or more at a price set at the time of the purchase. A seller of the bond contract must deliver the bonds. **********Dealers who purchase bonds can hedge against a possible adverse price move by selling bond futures. In so doing, they spread the underwriting risk of Federal debt financing among the participants in the financial futures markets. **********In a classic hedging situation, if bond prices rise, the cash bond position profits and the futures position loses. If prices fall, losses are taken on the cash bond position, but the futures position gains in value. When set up correctly, the losses and profits from the hedge should be equal. **********Treasury securities are not the only cash instruments that can be hedged against with the Treasury bond futures contract. Because of its enormous size, price movements in the secondary market for government securities have a large impact on corporate and tax-free municipal bond rates as well. **********Because of that relationship, and because a corresponding product has not yet been introduced, holders of corporate bonds often hedge their positions in Treasury bond futures. A municipal bond futures contract was introduced on the Chicago Board of Trade in June 1985. The board plans to introduce a corporate bond futures contract this fall. **********''The only thing we lack is in the corporate sector,'' said Richard L. Sandor, director of financial futures at Drexel Burnham Lambert in Chicago. ''What the Treasury bond contract did was show what the potential for financial futures really was.'' Richard M. Kelly, president of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company and Deputy Assistant Secretary for debt management at the Treasury Department in 1978 and '79, said the contract had ''served as a useful hedging vehicle as well as an important speculative tool.'' He added, ''Moreover, as interest rate movements have become so important globally, this contract has been the focal point, along with the Treasury cash bond itself, of United States interest rates.'' **********The contract has also been a boon for the Treasury and, as a consequence, for American taxpayers. Initially, Mr. Kelly said, the Treasury was concerned that a futures market for Treasury securities might increase the volatility of long-term interest rates. **********On some days, experts said, the bond futures market might indeed make interest rates move more sharply than they otherwise would. But there is also little question, according to former Treasury officials, that the ability to hedge positions in a large, liquid market has made it easier for the Government to sell its securities. That, in turn, has lowered borrowing costs by a certain degree. **********''Either explicitly or implicitly, the Treasury bond contract has created a better environment for Treasury debt financing, especially as it relates to longer maturities,'' said John J. Niehenke, senior vice president for government securities at Nomura Securities International Inc. and Deputy Assistant Secretary (Federal finance) at the Treasury during 1984 and 1985. **********''The observable evidence is that the contract has added liquidity to the market, thereby perhaps adding efficiency.'' **********Current Treasury officials responsible for debt management were on vacation and could not be reached for comment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/23/business/reagan-asked-to-name-vigorous-chief-at-sec.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Rasky", "pub_date": "1987-03-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 932, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REAGAN ASKED TO NAME VIGOROUS CHIEF AT S.E.C.", "print_headline": "REAGAN ASKED TO NAME VIGOROUS CHIEF AT S.E.C.", "body_text": " **********Members of Congress and the securities industry today urged President Reagan to nominate a Securities and Exchange Commission chairman who would continue to take a tough line on law enforcement and help restore investor confidence at a time when Wall Street is reeling from its biggest scandals since the 1920's. **********Their comments follow the White House announcement late Friday that John S. R. Shad, the former vice chairman of E. F. Hutton & Company who has headed the commission for the last five years, had been named Ambassador to the Netherlands.

Mr. Fleischer said that, in addition to enforcement activities, the new S.E.C. chairman would probably face the even more challenging task of helping to rewrite the nation's securities laws. **********Raymond E. Miles, dean of the Business School at the University of California at Berkeley, said the new S.E.C. chairman should be someone who has enormous public acceptance and who Wall Street views as a person of integrity.

Mr. Proxmire's committee will have to confirm the Administration's nominee for the S.E.C. post.

National Sovereignty Cited **********''The church's idea of a multi-ethnic society is that the Indians should be treated as independent nations,'' said Julio de Mesquita Neto, editor of O Estado de Sao Paulo, a conservative newspaper that has played a central role in the battle. ''That is an attack on Brazil's national sovereignty.'' **********The dispute itself is not new, but it has become heated in recent weeks as a special assembly nears completion of Brazil's new constitution. With the constitutional rights of both Indians and mining companies soon to be defined, every imaginable intrigue has been tried to influence the assembly's 559 members. **********The Indians themselves have been losing the battle against development at an accelerating rate over the last 20 years as first highways and hydroelectric dams and then peasant migrants, freelance gold prospectors and mining companies have encroached on once-impenetrable Amazonian refuges. **********The church has been almost alone in defending their rights to preserve their own culture on their own land. ''If the present irrational policy is maintained, no Indian group will survive,'' said Antonio Brand, executive secretary of the Council of Indian Missions. **********The church's lobbying of the Constitutional Assembly appeared to be bearing fruit this year as a majority of members began leaning toward protecting Indian lands against ''invaders.'' Soon afterward, the offensive against the church and its Council of Indian Missions, or CIMI, began. **********In August, O Estado do Sao Paulo charged that the council was trying to prevent commercial mining on Indian lands on behalf of powerful foreign mining interests that feared Brazil's low-cost production could further undermine world commodity prices. To support its claim, the daily presented four ''exclusive'' documents - two letters purportedly written by Mr. Brand, a letter from a so-called Christian Church World Council and a report of a purported meeting of Catholic and lay workers -along with extracts from available church documents. It also reprinted a map published by the Council of Indian Missions showing the location of both Indian tribes and gold, tin, bauxite and iron ore deposits. **********The church was outraged, charging that the ''exclusive'' documents were forgeries and that even the map had been altered. **********A special 18-member congressional committee was formed to investigate the charges, although political infighting between supporters and critics of the church have prevented it from completing its work. The writer of its report concluded that the documents were not authentic, but the committee's president refused to put the report to a vote, apparently preferring to leave the issue unresolved than to accept a defeat. **********Then, in early November, O Estado do Sao Paulo returned to the fray by publishing secret analyses of the role of the church and of the Council of Indian Missions prepared by the country's army-dominated National Secrity Council. The documents accuse the church of promoting Indian separatist movements, of having contacts with the Association of Tin Producing Countries and of campaigning against an army program to occupy Brazil's northermost borders. Justice Minister Complains **********Publication of these documents added to the controversy by demonstrating that the Government of President Jose Sarney also viewed the Catholic Church with hostility. Mr. Sarney denied to Bishop Almeida that he knew of the documents. But, in a separate meeting, Justice Minister Paulo Brossard complained at length to the Bishop about the Council of Indian Missions. **********While Brazilian mining companies view the church as their main enemy, the political heat generated by the Indian issue also reflects a more widely held view that this country must occupy the Amazon Basin to forestall expansion of foreign economic interests. **********Foreign criticism of deforestation and water pollution caused by migrants and miners is also seen by some officials to be part of a campaign to suggest the Amazon is the patrimony of mankind rather than exclusively Brazilian. **********In its lobbying of the Constitutional Assembly, Mr. Brand said the church was insisting that it did not oppose Brazil's development but believed mineral resources outside Indian lands should first be exploited. Mr. Mesquita, however, remained unconvinced. **********''We have discovered that all mining areas have Indians on top of them,'' he said.

Weakness in the dollar, in turn, discouraged the bond market because it creates losses for foreign investors at the same time as it puts upward pressure on inflation as prices of imports rise. Concern About Inflation **********Although one month of statistics is not enough to eliminate concerns about inflation and the effects of large trade deficits are far from gone, they have subsided enough for the yield of 30-year Treasury bonds to fall from more than 9 percent three weeks ago. The drop in Treasury bond yields has been in a period when the dollar has stabilized, a trend that continued yesterday. **********Yesterday prices of Treasury bonds began rising quickly when traders learned that the May Producer Price Index rose only three-tenths of a percent, or about half as much as expected, and the April trade deficit declined to $13.3 billion in April from $13.6 billion a month earlier. **********In London, the 8 3/4 percent issue due in 2017 jumped a point in a few minutes. When trading began in New York, those gains were extended, and the newest 30-year Treasury issue ended the day at 102 26/32, up 1 7/8 points, to yield aobut 8.49 percent. A day earlier, the closely watched long-term bond ended with a yield of 8.66 percent. The Note Sector **********In the note sector, the 8 percent issue due in two years rose more than 1/4 point, and was offered at 101, to yield 7.44 percent. **********''There was some good investor demand early in the day,'' said Robert Schumacher, a Chicago-based Treasury bond trader for Nomura Securities International. He added, however, that the investors who joined securities dealers in adding to their holdings yesterday, were primarily ''the market timing-type accounts'' who often add to their positions at the same time as securities dealers. **********''There was some sentiment that perhaps the bond market and the dollar have stabilized for a while,'' said Stephen Behnke, head of trading at Midland Montagu Government Securities Inc. While that sentiment clearly buoyed demand yesterday, he cautioned that confidence was not high enough to suggest that the market is on the verge of extensive price gains. **********''There are too many balls in the air about the economy, the dollar and the change in leadership at the Fed, which is keeping people cautious,'' he said. **********Other market sources said that many other potential bond investors remain on the sidelines. ''You could not describe this as a buying panic,'' one institutional salesman said. ''It was far more selective,'' he added, with many buyers preferring intermediate-term corporate issues to long-term Treasury bonds. **********Higher prices for Treasury bonds quickly led to new financings and plans for new financings in the corporate market. Besides yesterday's two large issues by the General Motors Acceptance Corporation and Chemical Bank, totaling $600 million, many more companies are considering note or bond sales next week, investment bankers said. **********The G.M.A.C. $300 million issue of 8 5/8 percent notes due 1992 was offered at 99.70, to yield 8.70 percent, through Salomon Brothers.

But now it requires a heavy dose of new math to compare the costs of different funds. Apart from the customary operating expenses and management fees, fund managers have devised a farrago of other charges - high or low loads imposed when you buy, exit fees when you sell and some hard-to-find fees levied while you hold the fund. **********''There are too many different types of charges today, and it's getting too confusing for the investor'' to sort through them all, said Kathleen Quigley Lantero, editor of Wiesenberger Investment Company Services. Of the 1,000 mutual funds the company monitors, about half impose front-end sales loads. About the same number have so-called 12b-1 plans, which were authorized by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1980. **********These plans, named for the regulation that permitted their creation, let funds deduct up to 1.25 percent of their assets to cover advertising and other marketing expenses. Investors must typically plow through the fine print of a prospectus to find out if the fund has a 12b-1 plan; then they must check the most recent accounting statement to see what percentage of assets the plan absorbed. With 12b-1 plans, mutual funds ''can levy pretty much what the devil they want, and the only way you can find out is in retrospect,'' said Gerald W. Perritt, editor of The Mutual Fund Letter. **********Norman Fosback, president of the Institute for Econometric Research, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., dismisses 12b-1 charges of less than three-tenths of 1 percent as a ''minor consideration.'' Charges of more than 1 percent he calls ''clearly abusive.'' **********Apart from 12b-1 charges, some funds impose redemption fees when investors sell their holdings. These may be levied as a flat percentage of the share price or on a sliding scale, ranging from 6 percent, say, if you sell in the first year, to zero if you hold your shares six years or more. **********All of this leaves investors in a dilemma. They cannot rely on funds advertised as no-load to be free of sales costs. And how do the various charges and fees stack up over the long term? If you plan to keep your funds invested until you retire in six years, for example, are you paying more in expenses if you buy the fund with the 8.5 percent sales load or the fund with the .75 percent 12b-1 charge and the sliding-scale exit fee? John Markese, director of research for the American Association of Individual Investors in Chicago, has come up with a possible solution: a series of formulas that convert the various expenses into equivalent charges. Using his formula, the investor can convert a front-end load into an equivalent annual percentage 12b-1 plan, or find the 12b-1's equivalent in a front- or back-end load. Many shareholders are surprised by the results, he said. **********Mr. Markese's first formula converts front-end loads to their 12b-1 equivalents for various holding periods. In this case, the 12b-1 charge equals the front-end load, stated as a percentage, divided by the investment holding period stated in years. For example, suppose a fund has a 3 percent front-end load and you hold it for four years; if you take .03 and divide it by 4, the answer is three-fourths of 1 percent - and that percentage would be the equivalent 12b-1 charge. **********This approach also lets you compare costs of no-load funds that have 12b-1 plans with an equivalent front-end load fund. For example, a no-load fund with a one-half of 1 percent 12b-1 plan held five years is cheaper than a 4 percent load fund, which over the same time period is equivalent to an eight-tenths of 1 percent 12b-1 charge. **********To compare a 12b-1 charge to its equivalent front-end load, multiply the 12b-1 annual charge, stated as a percent, by the number of years the investment is held. So, for example, an investor who holds shares in a no-load fund with a three-fourths of 1 percent 12b-1 plan for five years has paid the equivalent of a 3.75 percent front-end load. **********Investors who are not sure how long they intend to hold their mutual fund shares can compare charges by finding the break-even point at which the charges become equal: To do so, divide the front-end load by the 12b-1 annual charge, both stated as percentages. For instance, a one-quarter of 1 percent 12b-1 charge becomes equals to a 3 percent front-end load after 12 years (3 divided by .25 equals 12). Because annual charges build up over time, investors who expect to hold securities for longer than the break-even point would be better off with a one-time sales charge; those who expect to sell more quickly would find a 12b-1 plan the cheaper option. TO convert a back-end load into its 12b-1 equivalent, first multiply the number of years the investment is held (n) by the sum of 1 plus a discount rate (Mr. Markese uses 10 percent), raised to the nth power. Then divide the back-end load by the result. For example, a 4 percent back-end load for fund shares held four years converts to a .68 percent 12b-1 charge (Raise 1.1 to the fourth power and multiply by 4; take the product, 5.8564, and divide it into 4 for a result of .68 percent.) Some funds with front- or back-end loads also have 12b-1 plans, Mr. Markese pointed out. In these cases, you must add the annual 12b-1 charge to the 12b-1 equivalent for the load fees, to get the total fund expenses. Say you are considering a fund with a 3 percent back-end load plus an annual .5 percent 12b-1 charge. For a three-year holding period, the back-end load converts to a .75 percent 12b-1 equivalent; add to this the .5 percent 12b-1 charge, for a total annual cost of 1.25 percent. **********There are two reasons why it is worth the trouble to compare these costs. First, when you are talking about a long-term investment, particularly an Individual Retirement Account, cumulative deductions can make a big difference. **********''Small annual charges can significantly reduce your pot of retirement dollars,'' Mr. Perritt said. ''For example, over 15 years, a one-half of 1 percent 12b-1 charge equals a front-end load of about 7.5 percent.'' If you move your account around and each place siphons off a fee, he added, ''over time it adds up to a lot of money.'' **********The second reason is that the tax act has made these charges more expensive for the investor. The itemized deduction for miscellaneous business expenses will be harder to obtain, since only expenses in excess of 2 percent of adjusted gross income will qualify - and this means that most investors will have to pick up the tab for investment advisory fees paid on their behalf by the funds. Beginning in 1987, mutual funds must add these fees to dividends and other payments that are considered taxable income for the shareholder."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/16/world/moscow-confirms-gas-leak-during-nuclear-weapons-test.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 393, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Moscow Confirms Gas Leak During Nuclear Weapons Test", "print_headline": "Moscow Confirms Gas Leak During Nuclear Weapons Test", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union revealed today that gas had leaked during an underground nuclear test earlier this month, but said there was no radioactive fallout. **********The announcement came after a report from Norwegian officials four days ago of a small increase in the level of radioactive iodine in the air of Norway, Sweden and Denmark. **********Officials from Norway's national radiation control authority said at the time that the increase might have been caused by a Soviet nuclear test but that it was in such small quantities that it presented no health hazard. **********The official press agency Tass, in an announcement, said an inquiry into the gas leak was begun because of ''incoming queries'' and ''claims circulated by the Western mass media, with the Americans being especially zealous in the effort.'' **********It said the leak occurred inadvertently during a nuclear test for military purposes on Aug. 2 on Novaya Zemlya island, north of the Arctic Circle. **********''Competent organizations of the U.S.S.R. have carried out an extra and all-round check, which has showed that after the explosion there took place the leak of an insignificant amount of gaseous products, which have not led to the formation of radioactive fallout,'' Tass said. **********''This excludes the possibility of radioactive fallout in any state as a result of the underground nuclear explosion on Novaya Zemlya island.'' **********The message also said, ''The population was not subjected to any danger of radiation effects.'' **********The Soviet Union has conducted 15 underground nuclear tests since Feb. 28, when Mikhail S.

But the dollar weakened when trading began in the United States. **********''Before our New York market opened, nervous traders in Asia and later in Europe bid the dollar up by covering what was substantial short positions,'' Mr. Cheverall said.

The 17-year rescheduling accord would also set the interest on most of the loans at a more favorable interest rate. Something for Both Parties **********The agreement, therefore, apparently satisfied the needs of both parties. From a political point of view, Jaime V. Ongpin, the finance minister under President Corazon C. Aquino, will be able to argue that he kept the bank's spread to roughly what Mexico achieved in a debt accord last year, while at the same time preserving his nation's hard-currency reserves and winning investments in the Philippine economy. **********As for the banks, the accord was designed to allow them to book far higher returns on their Philippine debt than they do on their Mexican loans. In addition, Brazil's recent suspension of its interest payments had made them more concerned about reaching an agreement with Manila. **********''All parties can go home saying they got something,'' said Paul Sacks, president of Multinational Strategies Inc., a New York-based consulting concern. ''It clearly represents something of a compromise.'' **********Until now, the banks, which include Manufacturers Hanover, Citicorp and other money center institutions, have steadfastly refused to take ''paper'' for interest payments. They feared that such a practice might set a dangerous precedent, with many developing countries clamoring to settle their interest payments in i.o.u.'s. However, it had been anticipated that the new loan accord, reached late Thursday night, might represent a reversal of that position. **********At a news conference in New York yesterday, Mr. Ongpin said the bank creditors would take their interest in cash or in ''Philippine Investment Notes,'' issued by the central bank of the Philippines. Specifically, according to Mr. Ongpin, the restructuring agreement envisions three possible outcomes, all aimed at preserving the dollar reserves of the central bank and bolstering the troubled Philippine economy. **********Under the first, the central bank would periodically sell Philippine Investment Notes, or P.I.N.'s, through Wall Street firms. The notes, which are dollar-denominated obligations of the central bank, would be bought by foreign investors, such as multinational corporations. Then, the Philippines would use the dollar proceeds to pay interest to the banks. Incentive Plan **********The notes will be structured so that the multinational corporations that buy them would have an incentive to exchange the notes at the Philippine central bank for pesos, which in turn would be invested in the Filipino economy. **********A second possibility is that banks themselves would accept the notes. In this case, the banks would then sell the notes at a profit in the financial markets, much like banks trade in Government securities. **********The third eventuality calls for the banks to act like the multinational corporations in the first scenario. After buying the notes, the banks would redeem them for pesos, then use this money to buy a stake in financial institutions in the Philippines. **********In both the second and third cases, the plan's intent is for the notes to wind up in the hands of corporate investors who would want to exchange them for pesos and take equity positions in the Filipino economy. Similar Plans in Mexico, Chile **********Such a ''debt-for-equity swap,'' an approach involving substitution of outstanding debt principal for equity investment, is already under way in Mexico and Chile. **********''We will not pay interest out of reserves,'' Mr. Ongpin said at the news conference. ''We will sell P.I.N.'s.'' **********With the program, he added, an estimated $1 billion of foreign exchange outflows would be conserved over the 17 years during which the loans are to be restructured. **********While the restructuring could benefit the economy, the Philippines' bankers could also benefit. **********The reason is this: While the seven-eighths of a percentage point ''spread'' on the restructured loans is just a hair more than the 13-sixteenths spread that Mexico is paying on its new loans, the banks stand to earn much higher returns by trading the central bank's notes for a profit in the financial markets, or by redeeming them at the central bank for pesos. Guarantee of a Profit **********The Philippine Investment Notes will be structured so that banks will have an incentive to take the notes as interest payments in lieu of cash. Moreover, if the banks do exchange the notes for pesos, the Filipinos have agreed to guarantee a profit on the swap. **********In the view of many experts, however, the agreement also represented an exercise in obfuscation, although the parties hailed it as a historic first for the management of global debt. **********While the Philippines' creditor banks will be recording the same interest each quarter - seven-eighths of a percentage point over Libor - no one will ever know how much total return the banks really earn on their loans. The banks' trading in the investment notes, or any exchanges they make of notes for pesos, will be kept secret by the central bank. **********''The fundamental importance of the settlement is that all parties have agreed to something that is obscure,'' said Mr. Sacks of Multinational Strategies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/30/world/us-step-in-deaver-case-angers-canada.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1987-05-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 799, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. STEP IN DEAVER CASE ANGERS CANADA", "print_headline": "U.S. STEP IN DEAVER CASE ANGERS CANADA", "body_text": " **********The attempt by the special prosecutor in the Michael K. Deaver case to compel Canada's Ambassador to the United States and his wife to testify in Mr. Deaver's trial has angered the Canadian Government, which had hoped that the diplomatic and political ramifications of its involvement with Mr. Deaver were at an end. **********The political storm that burst when Mr. Deaver's $105,000 contract with Canada became public last year subsided rapidly after a House of Commons committee held an inconclusive hearing on the affair. But after process servers arrived at the Canadian Embassy in Washington earlier this week with subpoenas for the Ambassador, Allen E. Gotlieb, and for his wife, Sondra, the issue was thrust onto the public agenda once more. **********In the House of Commons, there have been renewed questions about the propriety of hiring Mr. Deaver to assist Canada in its effort to obtain United States controls on acid rain. But on the narrower issue of the Gotlieb subpoenas there has been virtually no dissent, with opposition politicians backing the Government's stand that the Ambassador and his wife are protected by diplomatic immunity from any requirement to appear in court. State Dept. Supports Stand **********The Government's stand was outlined in two forcefully worded statements by the External Affairs Minister, Joe Clark, and was supported by the State Department, which sent lawyers to court in Washington Thursday to argue against the subpoenas. In Ottawa, a senior official in Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's office, Bruce Phillips, said today that no legal maneuvering by the special prosecutor, Whitney North Seymour Jr., would have any effect. **********''They're not going to be in court, no matter what,'' said Mr. Phillips, who served until recently as minister for public affairs in the Canadian Embassy in Washington. **********Mr. Phillips, who is now director of communications for Mr. Mulroney, said the Government was particularly incensed by Mr. Seymour's statement that Canada was guilty of ''duplicitous behavior.'' In fact, Mr. Phillips said, the truth was exactly the reverse, since Mr. Seymour had been told at the outset of his contacts with the embassy last year that there was no question of Mr. Gotlieb's waiving his diplomatic immunity. **********''I don't know, maybe he feels he has a weak case, and that's why he's coming down the pike with a totally different approach, and a totally different tone, than he employed last year,'' Mr. Phillips said, referring to Mr. Seymour. Planning Strategy **********Mr. Phillips said the embassy had planned its strategy in the Deaver affair with care from the onset of its contacts with Mr. Seymour last summer. The Canadian official, who took part in discussions at the embassy at the time, said it had been made clear to Mr. Seymour that the embassy's cooperation - in the form of written answers provided by Mr. Gotlieb to written questions from Mr. Seymour - in no way constituted a waiver of Mr. Gotlieb's diplomatic immunity. **********''As a responsible and friendly neighbor, it was our view that it would not be seemly for Canada not to cooperate with a legal inquiry in the United States,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''But right from the outset the No. 1 question for us was how to do that without eroding our sovereignty. We explained to Mr. Seymour that we were not going to cooperate at the expense of losing our diplomatic immunity. No country would do that, least of all the United States.'' 'Breach of Faith' **********At the External Affairs Ministry, officials said that the first they had heard of Mr. Seymour's plan to get the Gotliebs to testify was when the process servers arrived at the embassy on Tuesday. It was this peremptoriness, as well as what Canadian officials say they consider a ''breach of faith'' after the cooperation with Mr. Seymour last summer, that explained the angry tone of Mr. Clark's public statements on the affair this week, the officials said. **********Among opposition politicians, there has been a suspicion that some of the Government's anger derived from its chagrin at seeing an embarrassing issue revived. A legislator for the opposition Liberal Party, John Nunziata, used the controversy over the subpoenas to renew a demand in the House of Commons that Mr. Gotlieb be brought back to testify before the External Affairs Committee on the contract with Mr. Deaver. Mr. Clark refused that demand last summer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/business/prospects-battling-the-budget-deficit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 640, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prospects; Battling the Budget Deficit", "print_headline": "Prospects; Battling the Budget Deficit", "body_text": " **********America's stubborn budget deficits - roughly $150 billion in the last fiscal year - are widely blamed for contributing to the Crash of '87.

Niskanen  Member of the council, 1981-85. Now chairman of the Cato Institute. **********Though I don't think that Federal budget conditions contributed to the recent collapse of stock prices - the budget news was favorable, and an autumn budget confrontation has become routine - a reduction continues to be important. **********But it is important, too, to look at the means by which the deficit is to be reduced. Economists don't have all the information bearing on this issue - the choice is properly made within the political process. **********My political preference: Reduce the deficit entirely with spending reductions - including those programs that increased most rapidly during the Reagan years. Plus, increase user fees on Federal I favor a proportionate reduction of all programs over a general tax increase. But some tax rise will probably come out of the process. In that case, an economist's advice is more valuable. Here's mine: *********** Continue to broaden the tax base rather than increase rates. Consider such measures as substituting a $300 tax credit for the $2,000 personal exemption. *********** Reject any increase in the taxation of capital, including the ''takeover tax'' proposal. *********** Do not increase tariffs - this includes the several proposals for an oil-import fee. *********** Increase the beer-and-wine excise tax to restore the real value of this tax relative to the spirits tax.  Ezra Solomon  Member of the council, 1971-73. Now Dean Witter professor of finance, Stanford University. **********Decreasing the budget deficit in some credible fashion is the No. 1 item on the agenda. We are entering the sixth year of a peacetime recovery, and still have a deficit. It has no business being there. **********As far as the method of getting the deficit down, I think it's better to do it on the spending side, especially military spending. **********As for a tax increase, if President Reagan chooses to call it ''revenue enhancement,'' that's fine with me. My pet candidate - some sort of levy on oil. This would be a tax not just on imported oil or gasoline, but on all oil, so the burden falls on everybody. A $1 tax on every barrel of oil would raise $6 billion and tie in with long-range energy policy.  William Poole  Member of the council, 1982-85. Now professor of economics, Brown University. **********The case for the deficit's being the main culprit in the crash is extraordinarily weak. America has a deficit, but other countries with small deficits had crashes. This was a worldwide event, so we should be looking for some factor that was a cause around the world. **********Surely, the United States needs to address the deficit problem. Actions that merely alleviate the concerns for this year and next but fail to address the long-term problems will leave us in the same situation. We need some fundamental reforms. **********These days, the discussion is focused on taxes, but we have to look carefully at what kind of taxes. Some are more harmful than others - taxes that depress business activity, for example. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 has already transferred individual liability to business.

While 1984 was a comparatively quiet year, as Wall Street digested its gains, the Dow passed 1,300, 1,400 and 1,500 in 1985. **********And last year, 1,600, 1,700, 1,800 and 1,900 fell victim to the bull market that was fueled, in part, by the lowest interest rates in nearly a decade. **********Wall Street professionals of late seem to have adjusted their thinking, and their celebrating. **********''As long as it keeps going, we're all happy - we don't have to cheer,'' said Rodney Berens, a managing director at Morgan Stanley & Company, who, upon looking around the firm's trading room, reported that he heard ''not a peep'' of celebration. **********The New York Stock Exchange index rose 1.12, to 147.55, yesterday, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 1.95 points, to 257.28. Once again, both were records.  Small Stocks Soar The stocks of smaller companies, meanwhile, continued to show perhaps the best performance of all. In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq index rose 5.05 points, to 377.54. **********On the New York Stock Exchange, meanwhile, advancing issues outpaced losers by a solid margin -1,172 to 515. Trading volume remained strong, with 194.5 million shares changing hands, compared with 190.9 million on Wednesday. **********Since last Friday, the first trading day of the new year, stock prices have marched higher without interruption. Including yesterday's 8.30 gain, the Dow is now up more than 106 points, or around 5 percent, this year. **********And many market analysts are predicting that stocks will go higher before investors start reassessing matters. ''What's important is whether the rally is sustainable on the basis of an improving economy or lower interest rates,'' said Eliot Fried, research director at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ''And I think it is.'' **********Some analysts are predicting that over a long time, the Dow might be able to hit 3,000, or perhaps even 4,000. But most are keeping their estimates more moderate. **********Laszlo Birinyi, head of equity market analysis at Salomon Brothers Inc., for instance, said he has been predicting that the Dow will peak at 2,073. ''Then we have to stop and re-evaluate,'' he added. **********The market, always trying to anticipate developments, has apparently found consolation in the fact that the economy appears to be entering its fifth consecutive year of growth. Even the tepidness of that recovery is positive for stocks, some experts argue. They say that the Federal Reserve Board, which is credited with starting the bull market in 1982, when it rapidly cut rates, will probably keep borrowing costs down until business conditions improve. **********And low rates, aside from the beneficial effect they should eventually have on corporate profits, are also causing investors to pull their funds out of such financial instruments as bank certificates of deposits, where yields have now plunged to under 6 percent. That C.D. money, Wall Street believes, is headed its way. **********Analysts also believe money may flow to Wall Street from overseas. Money that had been invested, say, in Japan, might come back to Wall Street now that the dollar is down and foreign stocks are up sharply. **********Among individual issues, Aetna Life and Casualty led the active list yesterday, gaining 1/2, to 60 1/4, on volume of almost 2.8 million shares. **********The Dow gained despite drops by some of its most prominent members. USX fell 3/4, to 22, after Carl C. Icahn, the investor, withdraw his informal offer to acquire the company and threatened to stage a proxy battle. I.B.M., in active trading, lost 5/8, to 122 7/8. But while it did lose ground over all, I.B.M. was instrumental in pushing the Dow up late in the day. The stock had traded as low as 121 during the session. **********Elsewhere. Texas Instruments rose 4 1/4, to 124. ICN Pharmaceuticals gained another 3 1/8, to 25 1/4. The company is expected to give test results of its new AIDS drug today. Mesa, which is bidding for Diamond Shamrock, fell 1/8, to 3 5/8. **********Colt Industries rose 1 1/2, to 13. The company restructured last year by means of what is called a ''leveraged cash out'' and is now experiencing the popularity of other concerns that have gone this route. **********Litton rose 2 7/8, to 80 1/8. The stock rose, traders said, because of very vague buyout rumors. Litton's stock has occasionally moved higher in the past for the same reason. **********The American Stock Exchange index rose 2.79, to 281.65."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/03/world/sri-lank-president-vows-to-recapture-tamils-stronghold.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 390, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SRI LANK PRESIDENT VOWS TO RECAPTURE TAMILS' STRONGHOLD", "print_headline": "SRI LANK PRESIDENT VOWS TO RECAPTURE TAMILS' STRONGHOLD", "body_text": " **********President J.

Outside his office in Waterville Valley, N.H., a visitor can hear the roar of compressed air and water showering man-made snow onto downhill trails. **********''I can't say that the ski industry has changed much since,'' he said. ''It's a business for entrepreneurs. Large corporations have tended not to do well in it.'' **********Among the corporations that have tried the ski business and then bailed out are 20th Century Fox (Aspen and Breckenridge, Colo.), the Chrysler Corporation (Big Sky, Mont.) and Scott Paper (Squaw Mountain, Me.) Of course, there are exceptions. The Keystone/Arapahoe resort, for example, owned by Ralston Purina and positioned in Colorado, just over the Great Divide, intercepts increasing numbers of skiers before they go on to Copper Mountain, Vail or Aspen. **********But in general, individual entrepreneurs, such as Mr. Corcoran, Alex Cushing of Squaw Valley, Calif. and Dave McCoy of Mammoth Mountain, Calif., have proved to be more successful than the corporate giants. **********''A ski area is not going to produce a stream of uninterrupted earnings that you can rely on for dividends,'' Mr. Corcoran said. ''The business is seasonal. It's a weather-sensitive business, perhaps more so than farming. And it attracts managers who are individualistic and independent, not the kind of people who fit the corporate mold.'' **********Mr. Corcoran is willing to concede that the ski business is perhaps no longer ''an odd little segment of industry,'' as his sign says. Across the country, the resorts have an annual payroll of $350 million. Ski areas are pivotal to the economic health of scores of mountain communities from rural Maine to the High Sierras of California. **********This winter the nation's 600 ski areas are hoping to attract a record number of visitors, surpassing the 1986-87 high of 53.7 million days of skiing. The Winter Olympics - to be held in February in Calgary, Alberta, on the eastern edge of the Canadian Rockies - traditionally help the ski business. **********A growth spurt would be welcome. In the 1960's, the ski industry grew annually by 10 to 15 percent, as the postwar baby boom brought millions of young people to the sport. But in recent years demand has flattened. Nationally, skier visits have hovered just above the 50 million mark for nearly 10 years. And the proportion of frequent downhill skiers - those who ski more than 12 days a season - has declined. **********Those numbers are somewhat deceptive though, masking the fact that the number of ski areas has also declined. Marvin Kottke, who measures skier visits annually for the National Ski Areas Association, said his figures now come from 175 fewer ski areas than existed in 1978-79. In effect, Mr. Kottke argued, the same skier volume shared by fewer suppliers has meant a 20 percent growth in business for ski areas that survived. **********Not surprisingly, the key to running a successful ski area is paying close and continual attention to the quality of the snow. ''Quality snow is what today's customer wants,'' said Jim Branch, president of Sno Engineering, a ski area consultant in Lyme, N.H. ''Areas have to make it, many of them nightly, and they have to groom it once or more than once a day.'' **********But resorts must pay close attention to peripheral details, as well. Tom Leonard, president of Crystal Mountain in the Cascades, outside of Seattle, says he spends a lot of time motivating the employees who put the customers into chairlift seats and serve them food to insure that patrons have ''a fun experience.'' **********At Waterville Valley, Mr. Corcoran emulates the frequent flier programs of the airlines to promote repeat business. A person skiing midweek pays $25 for a full-day ticket and receives a countdown card. On each consecutive day he continues to ski (between Monday and Friday), he pays $2 less until the ticket reaches $10 a day, good for the rest of the season. The discount does not apply on weekends, when areas are often crammed. **********ACCORDING to Mr. Corcoran, a ski resort does not have to be large to make money. The crucial elements, he said, are cost control and marketing, recommending: ''Build and run resorts that attract high attendance and revenues relative to the capital invested.'' **********This formula is getting harder to follow, however, as the cost of improvements increases. Many ski complexes have spent millions of dollars in recent years on snow-making, new lifts, base lodges and wider trails. Many have acquired fleets of $100,000-plus snow-tilling machines that groom the slopes to the creamy, easy-to-ski texture that is so important to customer satisfaction. **********Even more expensive are the recently introduced ''high-speed quad'' lifts, in which the chair detaches from the fast-moving cable and inches along so that four skiers at a time can be seated. The chair then grabs on to the cable again and the skiers are carried uphill at 1,000 feet a minute, or about 12 miles an hour, more than twice as fast as fixed-chair lifts. **********Skiers who ride the new high-speed chairs like them so much that they resent going back to the slower ones. But the high-speed lifts can be more than twice as expensive. One three-quarter-mile-long detachable quad alone can require an investment of more than $2 million. **********Area owners must also widen trails and add snowmaking and grooming to take care of the additional skiers poured onto the slopes by a high-capacity detachable chairlift, which carries passengers at two and a half times the rate of a conventional chair. **********Complicating their financial woes, many areas are still amortizing a huge number of recently built fixed-chair lifts. **********Still, resort operators can't afford to ignore the public's desire to ski more and sit less. One solution may be to devise a premium ''first-class ticket'' to ride the high-speed chairs. **********A long-time industry analyst, Charles Goeldner, of the University of Colorado, believes ski areas need an immediate increase in lift ticket prices of at least 10 percent beyond inflation to compensate themselves for recent investments. **********''The ski areas are delivering a much more valuable product to the skier, but they're not pricing it adequately,'' Mr. Goeldner said. **********The Aspen Skiing Company, for example, has invested $33 million in new facilities over the last four years. After it raised the one-day ticket price to $35, though, townspeople marched in protest last summer. **********The Aspen company ''greatly improved the value of the skiing experience,'' Mr. Goeldner said. ''The hullabaloo about the price increase was totally unjustified.'' **********Vacationing skiers usually buy tickets for five or more days of skiing, and this can lower their costs significantly. A six-day pass at Aspen, for example, means the customer pays just $30 a day to ski. **********Elsewhere this season, daily lift passes are up by about $2 from last winter. Mr. Goeldner estimates the average cost to an American skier for an adult one-day weekend lift pass this winter will probably be $22 to $23. **********STILL, the industry is nervous about raising prices too much, so many resorts are looking at other ways to raise revenues. ''Our real future is in becoming four-season resorts,'' Mr. Corcoran said. ''At one time, ski areas could shut down in the spring and let the staff go. But as the investments have become bigger, the costs can only be recovered with year-round revenue.'' **********As a result, ski resorts are building conference centers and small convention facilities; indoor sports centers; covered ice rinks, golf courses and tennis courts. Construction activity has been hectic in and around ski areas in New England, particularly at Sunday River and Sugar Loaf in Maine, and at Okemo in Vermont. **********South of Loon Mountain, Mr. Corcoran is greatly expanding Waterville Valley, which started in 1966. In the last three years alone, more than $40 million has been spent on new inns and apartments at Waterville. **********Mr. Corcoran and his associates have just broken ground on a new $18 million condominium lodge, the Golden Eagle. Its 138 one- and two-bedroom units sold out in eight days. **********''With time and the evolution toward four-season activity, who knows?'' Mr. Corcoran said. ''We may even be able to make the bottom line of skiing more predictable.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/19/world/papers-on-barbie-called-authentic.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Bernstein", "pub_date": "1987-05-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 433, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PAPERS ON BARBIE CALLED AUTHENTIC", "print_headline": "PAPERS ON BARBIE CALLED AUTHENTIC", "body_text": " **********A senior official in the West German Justice Ministry testified today that documents used by the prosecution in the trial of Klaus Barbie, the wartime Gestapo chief of Lyons, are authentic. **********The official, Alfred Streim, told the court that the documents showed direct responsibility by Mr. Barbie in two mass deportations of Jews from Lyons to eventual death in Nazi camps.

Still, in a small but vivid way, his decision to impose another day of confinement on himself underlined an inescapable reality in South Korean politics: Just when things seem to change, they don't. **********In fact, Mr. Kim found himself under house arrest once more today to prevent him from attending protest rallies planned by the opposition. **********Through the last two weeks of political turmoil here, nothing has proved more unchanging than the raw fact that the Government and the opposition do not trust each other, never have and probably never will. Closer to the Edge **********That point was reinforced by a closely watched attempt at crisis control on Wednesday, the first meeting ever held between President Chun Doo Hwan and another key opposition figure, Kim Young Sam. Afterward, the two sides talked as though they had attended separate events. The ruling party saw the Chun-Kim meeting as a signal for ''grand compromise.'' The opposition called it a failure. **********Setting aside the questions of whose view was right, the result for now was to push the country closer to the edge. The possibilities for a swift end to the South Korean crisis have shrunk. Worse, there is the bleak prospect of renewed street disturbances today after they had begun to subside in the last few days. **********At Wednesday's session at the Blue House, the presidential residence, Mr. Chun agreed to let National Assembly discussions resume on the central issue in this crisis - how to change the constitutional method for choosing a new national leader. Because the President suspended those talks two months ago, his reversal was a major concession, Government officials said. The opposition did not see it that way. First, its leaders argued, why should they give Mr. Chun credit for undoing an action that in their view should never have been taken in the first place? **********Second, there were never substantive talks because the two sides could not agree even on how to sit at the same table. **********Finally, the opposition said, the passage of time has altered bottom-line demands. Kim Dae Jung insisted Thursday that Mr. Chun now had to declare not only that he was willing to talk about constitutional revision but also that he would not hold elections under the exisiting electoral college system. Anti-Government forces say that system is stacked against them and call for direct Presidential elections. **********That means they want Mr. Chun to drop his cherished plans to hand over the Government next February to his designated successor, Roh Tae Woo, an old ally and a fellow ex-general. ''Unless Chun Doo Hwan makes such a promise, we cannot trust him,'' Mr. Kim said. **********Some analysts saw a measure of posturing in the opposition stand. They argued that all the tough talk did not necessarily eliminate the possibility of later compromise. Brinkmanship, it was noted, is a basic component of Korean politics. Sensitivity Over His Resolve **********In particular, Kim Young Sam may have felt he had to stand firm against Mr. Chun, for his anti-Government resolve has sometimes been questioned in hardline circles, including allies of Kim Dae Jung. ''I think there's great sensitivity about Kim Young Sam being labeled a Government patsy,'' a foreign diplomat said. **********Even if there is an element of posturing on both sides, it is hard to imagine Mr. Chun readily giving up plans to transfer power on his own terms. He has never been interested in revising the system, a point reinforced by a public transcript of what he told Kim Young Sam on Wednesday. **********For its part, the opposition would find it difficult to accept Mr. Chun's political timetable without appearing to be in full retreat. **********Almost immediately after the Blue House meeting, each side began a campaign for public sympathy. The two Kims are counting on widespread dislike of Mr. Chun among South Koreans and their desire for a faster pace of democratic development. The ruling camp is hoping that Koreans will view the President's offer as reasonable, and it has begun to portray the anti-Government forces as being obstructionist at a dangerous moment. **********It is too early to say which way the general public is leaning. But political opinion can be fickle. Many of the same people who were out in the streets a week ago, denouncing the Government as a military dictatorship, could easily turn to accusing the opposition of standing in the way of progress. Students in Spearhead **********Nor are university students, who have spearheaded the recent wave of unrest, immune to public reaction. **********Students, increasingly bold and sensing their power, do not much care about what politicians on either side have to say. But they have shown many times that they are not oblivious to popular moods. **********Perhaps of more immediate concern is whether the army will grow tired of the protesters before the general population does. On the eve of today's scheduled street protests, the question again is how long the Government is prepared to tolerate unrest before it sends in troops to take over from the police. **********Gaston J. Sigur Jr., a high-ranking State Department official sent on a special mission to study the crisis here, left Thursday saying the United States opposed martial law and believed that ''any use of armed forces is unwarranted.'' Another State Department official who was here this week, Edward J. Derwinski, said Wednesday that South Korean officials had assured him the military would not intervene. **********Some experts also question how much stomach the army would have to be called out against South Koreans. Agonized memories of Kwangju, where soldiers gunned down 200 people as then-General Chun consolidated power in 1980, are as fresh as yesterday. Threat From the North **********According to a knowledgeable diplomat, many military men feel that Kwangju ''tarnished their prestige,'' and they do not want that to happen again. They also do not wish, he said, to be distracted from their main duty of defending the country against possible attack from North Korea. That threat is always considered genuine here and is emphasized on a day like Thursday, the anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. **********Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that troops would not be used if disturbances grow and if the Government believes it can convince most South Koreans that it offered fair concessions only to have them rejected by an intransigent opposition. Mr. Chun alluded to possible use of force in his conversation with Kim Young Sam. **********Two weeks ago, Mr. Roh called unrest part of the ''growing pains'' that South Korea must endure on the road to democracy. On Thursday, a Western diplomat agreed, saying he believed the country was headed toward a more open society in a few years. **********But, he added, ''I think we're in for a troubled tomorrow.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/11/business/canada-s-economy-up.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 60, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CANADA'S ECONOMY UP", "print_headline": "CANADA'S ECONOMY UP", "body_text": " **********Canada's leading composite indicator rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in Au-gust, mainly because of manufactur-ing, after a July gain of eight-tenths of 1 percent, the Government said to-day."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/business/personal-finance-teen-agers-now-need-tax-planning-101.html": {"writer_name": "Carole Gould", "pub_date": "1987-07-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1238, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Teen-Agers Now Need Tax Planning 101", "print_headline": "PERSONAL FINANCE; Teen-Agers Now Need Tax Planning 101", "body_text": " **********STUDENT wage earners who plan to spend the summer flipping burgers or bagging groceries will find their finances have been complicated by the new tax law: More of them may be subject to tax, and the tax bite may be bigger. **********''Students must consider tax planning, which has never been a major factor before,'' said Kevin F. Roach, partner in charge of executive financial services with Price Waterhouse in New York. **********Under the old law, you needed $1,080 of investment income or $3,560 of gross income before you had to file a tax return. Now, dependent children with gross income that exceeds the standard deduction of $2,540 in 1987 ($3,000 in 1988) or who have more than $500 of investment income must file a Form 1040 - even if they ultimately owe no tax. **********While Congress lowered the tax rates and increased the standard deduction for all taxpayers, it changed the law so that children who can be claimed as deductions on their parents' returns cannot take a personal exemption for themselves when filing their own returns. As a result, ''you can't generalize about the overall consequences'' of the new rules for youngsters, Mr. Roach said. **********Once teen-agers are put on a payroll, income tax is automatically withheld from their paychecks unless they claim they have the right to be exempt. **********To be exempt, they must meet two tests. First, they must not have owed any Federal income tax and must have been entitled to a full refund of any tax collected last year. Second, they must not expect to owe any tax this year. If they qualify, they check line six on Form W-4 or W-4A. **********But the recent Tax Act may prevent large numbers of teen-agers from checking that box, because they can no longer claim a personal exemption on their tax returns. Under the old rules, families got two cracks at the personal exemption: Parents claimed their children as dependents on their tax returns and children counted themselves as exemptions on their own returns. To prevent double-dipping, the new law eliminates the exemption -worth $1,900 this year - for dependent children who may be claimed as dependents by their parents. **********At the same time, the Tax Reform Act hedged the standard deduction with new limits, so many youngsters may find it ''more difficult under current law to be exempt from withholding than under prior law,'' said Richard J. Shapiro, national director of taxes for Oppenheim, Appel, Dixon & Company. **********For children who are eligible to be claimed as dependents by their parents (whether they actually are or not), the standard deduction is limited to the greater of two figures: either $500 or their earned income up to the maximum amount. They (or their parents) must struggle with complex calculations that allocate the deduction between earned and unearned income. The allocation is required for two reasons: Only $500 of the standard deduction can be used to offset unearned income, and unearned income of a child younger than 14 in excess of $1,000 is taxed at the parents' higher rate. **********For example, a teen-ager who has $850 of earned income and $950 of unearned income claims a standard deduction of $850, of which $500 is allocated to unearned income and the $250 balance to earned income. This leaves net unearned income of $450 and earned income of $500 subject to tax. **********To illustrate the interplay of the new rules, assume that a student earns $1,500 in trust income and $4,000 from a summer job, for a total adjusted gross income of $5,500. Under the old law, he could claim one personal exemption, reducing his taxable income to $4,420 ($5,500 minus $1,080). The $2,480 standard deduction or zero bracket amount reduced his income even further, leaving him with a $221 tax liability under the old rates. **********Under the new law, however, he cannot claim a personal exemption. So his taxable income equals $2,500 - $4,000 earned income plus $1,500 unearned income, less the $3,000 standard deduction. (The rates for 1988 are used to avoid the problems of ''blended'' rates in 1987, but the results differ by only a few dollars.) Only $1,000 of the unearned income is taxed because the remainder is offset by $500 of the standard deduction; the $2,500 balance of the standard deduction reduces his taxable earned income to $1,500. **********His total tax bill equals That is the sum of $225 tax on earned income ($4,000 less the $2,500 standard deduction, taxed at the 15 percent rate); plus $150 tax on $1,000 of unearned income, according to Mr. Roach. If the child is younger than 14, however, $500 of his unearned income would be taxed at his parents' rate, assumed to be 28 percent; this would raise his total tax bill to $440. **********Besides income tax, students must pay Social Security tax on their summer earnings. This year's rate is 7.15 percent, and the tax is due without exception on all earnings up to $43,800. **********ONE way to reduce taxes is to put children on the family business payroll for the summer. **********Tax revision took the shine off most other family income-shifting devices, so ''I've been receiving more calls than ever before from people who want to know how to put their kids to work in the family business,'' Mr. Roach said. **********Say you need someone to fill in for vacationing workers, and you offer your teen-ager a job at the rate of $6 an hour for 40 hours a week during July and August. The bulk of the teen-ager's $1,920 of earnings is taxed at the 11 percent rate, and you can deduct that amount as a business expense. Children under 21 who are employed by parents who operate their business as a sole proprietorship or partnership reap another benefit: Their earnings are exempt from Social Security tax.  FRILLS FOR THE HOME OFFICE **********The Internal Revenue Service has repeatedly tightened up on the popular home-office deduction. A welcome change for taxpayers is a recent ruling that broadens the scope of that deduction. **********In the ruling, a taxpayer, a dentist whose home office occupied one-sixth of the square footage of his residence, was permitted to depreciate that fraction of the purchase price and deduct a portion of the monthly maintenance cost of his new home security system - expanding the definition of ''ordinary and necessary'' business expense. (A taxpayer who used his home office to manage his investment portfolio was denied the same deduction, however, because his activities were not a ''business'' for purposes of the home office deduction.) The ruling is a reminder that ''anyone with a deductible home office should look for other items'' such as central air-conditioning or fire alarms that might also be partly deductible or depreciable, said Gene Linett of Deloitte, Haskins & Sells.  That is the sum of $225 tax on earned income ($4,000 less the $2,500 standard deduction, taxed at the 15 percent rate); plus $150 tax on $1,000 of unearned income, according to Mr."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/12/business/not-only-the-budget-worries-money-managers.html": {"writer_name": "Anise Wallace", "pub_date": "1987-11-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 820, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Not Only the Budget Worries Money Managers", "print_headline": "Not Only the Budget Worries Money Managers", "body_text": " **********Even if the budget negotiators in Washington agree to a compromise, the stock market may only get a temporary lift from the money managers whose purchases had been such a propellant this summer. **********While they have said for weeks that the budget deficit is the stumbling block to a rebound in stock prices, many of these managers are now citing other reasons for not buying stocks. Beneath it all is a more wary attitude after watching their clients' portfolios decline sharply since mid-October. **********Money managers have billions of dollars in cash waiting to be invested. There is no precise number, but the average cash position of 600 money management firms representing $131 billion was 7.7 percent at the end of last week, according to the Indata Corporation, a division of Gordon, Haskett & Company in Stamford, Conn. **********That is roughly one percentage point higher than the average cash position this year, but it is still well below the level before the bull market began in 1982, when the cash level was 14 percent, said Larry A. Ciccarelli, manager of equity research at the firm. Trade and Dollar Are Factors **********While the budget deficits have become an obsession with some portfolio managers, there are additional factors keeping them away from stocks. They are nervous about the trade figures the Government will release today. Additionally, many fund managers will not move their clients' assets into stocks until they see evidence that the dollar has bottomed. **********They are also nervous that an international event, such as a collapse of the Japanese stock market, could lower the value of stocks sharply. And some portfolio managers believe that by December there could be heavy tax-related selling by individuals. Managers expect that the stocks of small-capitalized companies that fell the hardest in October will be sold as individuals take capital losses. **********Furthermore, some portfolio managers are waiting to buy stocks until they see the Federal Reserve Board cut the discount rate. These managers believe that the economy is weakening and that the Fed should not wait for more evidence before it lowers rates. Pointing to ''lousy home sales, lousy auto sales and a worldwide correction in stock prices,'' Steven A. Kroll, executive vice president of E. F. Hutton & Company, said, ''That's about as much evidence as you need.'' Waiting for Bargains **********Moreover, some managers such as Michael Holland, president of First Boston Asset Management, are not buying stocks because they do not think prices are cheap enough. They want bargains. **********''We don't feel we have to use up that cash in a week or two,'' said James H. Farrell Jr., a partner of Cashman, Farrell & Associates, a Wayne, Pa., investment firm that has $200 million of its clients' funds set aside in short-term investments. ''Bear markets generally don't bottom in a few weeks.'' **********As a result, his firm is barely nibbling at stocks. **********A move to cut the budget deficit obviously would be encouraging. But some money managers would like to see budget cuts larger than the $25 billion to $30 billion now under discussion. One of them is Mario Gabelli, head of Gamco Investors, which has $450 million of its clients' $2 billion parked in money market securities. But he doubts deeper cuts will be made because he does not think the budget negotiators have the ''guts'' to do so.

''When they raise our taxes, they expect us to adjust our personal budgets, but they're unwilling to cut spending enough. Obviously they're unwilling to address the problem.'' **********Many portfolio managers privately argue that Congress should make cuts ''across the board.'' They want to see cuts in Social Security, the military budget and the cost-of-living adjustments in Federal pension funds. 'No Time to Be a Hero' **********Money managers are also skittish about buying stocks because of concerns about their own business. If they spend what little cash they have on stocks and the market drops further, they worry that their clients will accuse them of being risky and dismiss them. **********''We don't have enough confidence to take action,'' said the head of one firm that manages several billion dollars. **********Conversely, if money managers sell stocks in their portfolios and the market moves higher, their clients will dismiss them and hire better-performing money managers. **********''This is no time to be a hero,'' said one manager."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/12/business/executive-changes-179687.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 320, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** Burnham Service Corp., Columbus, Ga., an electronics and household mover, named Calvin J.

The decision is part of an effort to head off mounting American protectionist sentiment. **********Hajime Tamura, the Minister of International Trade and Industry, said that the quota for auto exports would be 2.3 million cars, the same level as in the previous two years. He added that the ministry believed that, without restraints, auto exports to the United States would have increased and exacerbated trade frictions. **********The car exports accounted for more than a third of Japan's trade surplus with the United States, $16.8 billion out of a total of $43.3 billion in the fiscal year from April 1985 to March 1986, the trade ministry said. **********The Reagan Administration's official stance has been that, in keeping with its free-trade philosophy, it would not ask the Japanese to extend the quotas. But some American auto makers and the United Automobile Workers union, pointing to the $51.5 billion trade deficit with Japan, had called for a cut in the number of cars shipped to the United States. **********This proposal set off a heated debate within the Tokyo Government, according to reports here, with some officials arguing that a cut in auto exports would be a dramatic gesture that might avert further friction and others arguing that to do so would hurt the auto industry, which is already suffering from a strong yen. **********Mr. Tamura said that a reduction had been considered but rejected. **********''Japan is neither a subject country nor a colony of the United States,'' Mr. Tamura added. ''Considering that the Japanese economy is in a recession because of the strong yen and foreign cars are entering Japan, I am sure that the United States Congress and the United States auto industry will welcome this decision.'' Desire to Act Quickly **********The announcement that the restraints would continue came early this year - the ''voluntary'' restraints do not actually expire until March 31. The timing of the announcement shows the Government's desire to act quickly to put a difficult issue behind it. Two years ago, the announcement that Japan would allow auto exports to grow by 24.3 percent touched off what may have been the most severe trade crisis between the two nations since World War II. **********''We have decided to expedite the whole process since it would be counterproductive to both our countries if rumors and speculation should arise,'' Mr. Tamura said. **********The early decision also reflected a broad agreement among Japanese auto makers that continuing restraints were not only inevitable but in some ways desirable. Even before the decision was made, a number of top auto executives said they believed it would be impossible to end the restraints this year, in light of the large American trade deficit with Japan and a Democratic majority in Congress resolved to pass some kind of trade legislation this year. 'It Can't Be Helped' **********''There is nothing that can be done,'' Kenichi Yamamoto, president of the Mazda Motor Corporation, said a few days ago, using a traditional Japanese phrase indicating resignation to fate. ''I don't want to accept it, but it can't be helped.'' **********Indeed, those familiar with the negotiations between the trade ministry and the auto industry said that, this year, some auto makers actually supported continuing the restraints. **********In the past year, the rapid rise of the yen against the dollar has sharply reduced the profits of several auto makers. Profits at Mazda, for example, dropped more than 70 percent from last year, and Nissan reported its first loss since World War II in the first half of this fiscal year. **********Japanese auto makers have been forced to raise prices in the very year that they faced new competition from South Korea, which began shipping cars to the United States last year. In recent months, inventories of Japanese automobiles in the United States have been increasing. Fears of Smaller Makers **********Japan's smaller auto makers, in particular, feared that without quotas, in which the number of cars each company can sell in the United States is set by the trade ministry, they might suffer from severe competition from their Japanese counterparts for the United States market. **********For many auto makers, the quotas have proved profitable. While they restricted total sales in the United States, they allowed auto makers to sell higher-priced, more profitable models. Analysts believe that, except for Toyota, Japanese auto makers rely on exports for profits and do not make money on sales within Japan. **********One executive familiar with the positions of the major auto companies said he believed that the trade ministry would change the allocation of exports this year to include exports from Daihatsu and that it would increase the allotment for smaller companies. He added that he expected that the Honda Motor Company would probably give up some of its share of the quotas because it is producing the most cars in the United States.  COOL U.S. RESPONSE  WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Special to The New York Times) - American officials responded coolly today to Japan's decision. **********They noted that it would neither deflect Reagan Administration pressure on Tokyo for more market-opening moves nor influence the course of trade legislation this year. **********Senior American trade officials are in Tokyo this week pressing Japan to allow American companies to bid on construction work for the Kansai Airport project in Osaka Bay and taking up pharmaceutical, semiconductor and other sectoral trade disputes. **********American automobile industry officials said they were disappointed that Japan kept the limitations at 2.3 million units. Harold A. Poling, president of the Ford Motor Company, had urged Japan to cut shipments to below two million units as well as to increase the percentage of American product content in Japanese vehicles built in the United States. **********The United States trade representative, Clayton K. Yeutter, said the United States had not asked Japan to extend the restraints.

But officials were reluctant to break diplomatic relations or take other steps that some fear could lead to conflict between the two countries. **********''Haiti is our only neighbor,'' Foreign Minister Donald Reid Cabral said in an interview today. ''Any problem in Haiti affects us in many ways. Up to now, however, we see no reason to break relations.'' Outside Intervention Opposed **********Mr. Reid said that while the Dominican Republic favored democracy in all countries, it opposed calls for outside intervention in Haiti. ''The Dominican Republic does not interfere in the affairs of other nations because we do not want others to interfere in our affairs,'' he said. **********Emotions ran high in some circles, however, fueled in part by outrage over the killing of a Dominican television cameraman, Carlos Grullon, by anti-election terrorists in Haiti.

''We had a very clear experience when Trujillo fell.'' Stronger Action Urged **********Jacobo Majluta Azar, a leader of the opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party, was among politicians calling for stronger action against Haiti. **********''If this inhuman and criminal barbarity is not condemned by all countries, and especially by our country since we share the island, we will not only be denying justice to the Haitian people but also encouraging tyrants who rule other nations,'' he said. **********In Santo Domingo's central market area, there were far fewer Haitians on the streets than usual. Many traveled home to vote and have been unable to return. **********Several hundred thousand Haitians are believed to live in the Dominican Republic, many of them working as street merchants, field hands and factory laborers. Most are here illegally, but they are tolerated and generally get along well with the Dominicans. **********Stores that sell goods to visiting Haitians reported business down by 50 percent or more. Brightly painted buses owned by Haitian peddlers stood in parking lots; they have remained idle for days. **********''No one likes to live in a foreign country, but what is happening in Haiti is so sad we cannot go back now,'' said Louis Antonio Simeon, 31, a Haitian who does odd jobs in Santo Domingo and sends money home to his family. ''We have had dictatorship for too long, and we want to be free. When will God let it happen?'' **********Newspapers in Santo Domingo this week strongly condemned the Haitian Government. ''The general impression is that what happened was not anarchy, but terror organized by the authorities themselves,'' said an editorial in Listin Diario. Effects Across Border Feared **********The tabloid El Sol warned that the Dominican Republic could not hope to remain unaffected by turmoil in Haiti. ''If there is no democratic outcome in Haiti, we will have to prepare ourselves to expect revolutionary outbursts that will have incalculable consequences for our country,'' it said. **********Although Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the same tropical island, the presence of so many Haitian refugees here attests to the different fortunes of the two countries. While Port-au-Prince is perhaps the most wretchedly impoverished capital city in the Western Hemisphere, much of Santo Domingo is modern and bustling with commerce. The levels of health care and education are much higher here, life expectancy is considerably longer and employment opportunities are far greater. **********The current crisis seems likely to widen the gap even further.

Aquino said in the early days of her Government, is the plural for ''mediocre.'' **********Right from the start, something seemed to go wrong in relations between the palace and the local press, which was glorying in its newfound freedom, sometimes with more exuberance than accuracy. **********The number of daily newspapers in Manila jumped to more than 20, and political columnists became celebrities as they stirred fact, gossip and rumor into a colorful daily mix. **********''If you want unverified gossip passed on as truth, it is there,'' wrote one of the more careful columnists, Francisco S. Tatad. ''If you want a person's private fault reported as public fact, it is there, too. If you want the most inconsequential nonsense blown up into an earthshaking event, you will find no shortage of it.'' **********Another columnist, Sylvia Mayuga, said the press had come to deal in ''political pornography,'' offering perverse thrills that distort realities and values. Censorship Is Charged **********Now, as the Government tightens its grip before a constitutional plebiscite, the press has put itself in the spotlight, accusing the Government of censorship. **********When the Government television station refused last week to broadcast a discussion forum with an opposition figure, former Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, journalists who had been jailed or dismissed during the martial law he administered rose angrily to his defense. **********''Can one no longer criticize the Government?'' wrote Ninez Cacho-Olivares, who was one of the most daring critics of President Ferdinand E. Marcos in the final months of his rule. **********The Aquino Government, she wrote, ''seems to have gone the way of Marcos and has violated the constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press.'' **********Both the writers and the readers of such criticism are aware that the Aquino Government is far from duplicating the press censorship of the Marcos years, when all but a few ''crony'' newspapers were closed and hundreds of journalists were jailed. **********The stridency of the criticism illustrates both the degree of freedom that is permitted today, and the flamboyance with which it is often exercised. Dress Code for Reporters **********The Government has often reacted with what its critics like to call ''onion skin,'' only to provide new grist for Manila's hungry newspapers in their circulation war. **********At one point the palace banned a photographer who had violated guidelines by photographing Mrs. Aquino in the act of eating. **********At another it issued a dress code for reporters covering the President that required them not only to look presentable but to smell good. **********Most delicious for her press critics was the President's own joke, received by political columnists with high dudgeon, that ''perhaps it was my mistake that I restored the freedom of the press.'' **********Mrs. Aquino had to back down a few days later, saying, ''From now on I just have to keep reminding myself that now that I am President, I am not supposed to give jokes.'' Press 'Is Too Free' **********But genuine irritation did seem to be behind her quip. **********Her former spokesman, Rene Saguisag, the man who said he found the media mediocre, seemed to reflect her views when he said last summer, ''We are for a free press, but it is too free.'' **********''Every day when I read the papers, I find out that I did or said or thought things that I did not do, say or think,'' he said. **********Of the President, Mr. Saguisag said, ''I don't think she jumps for joy'' when she reads the morning papers. **********Her problems with the press have come not only from the wild competition among the proliferating newspapers, most of which analysts here believe will eventually lose the war for readership and close down. **********She has also lived for nearly a year with several hostile newspapers that remain in the hands of close Marcos associates, and with dozens of radio stations that broadcast strident pro-Marcos propaganda. **********Now, Ms. Cacho-Olivares suggested, the Government ''seems to be bent on doing away with the opposition media.'' **********Last week, the National Press Club expressed ''grave concern over the deepening involvement of the Government in the media.'' Newspaper to Close **********There are reports that the Government may not renew the licenses of several radio stations, and it has announced the closing at the end of this month of The Philippines Daily Express, which is owned by a close Marcos associate, Roberto Benedicto. **********The Government says the newspaper, which was taken over by a commission investigating Mr. Marcos's holdings, is being closed because it is losing money, and not for political reasons. **********The commission has also assumed control of two other pro-Marcos newspapers, and there are reports that the Government is supervising two independent television stations. **********In addition, the President has not dismantled Mr. Marcos's propaganda apparatus as she promised to do during her campaign, but has attempted to improve and reorganize it. **********The Government television station, once named for Mr. Marcos's World War II guerrilla unit and now renamed People's Television, frequently broadcasts film montages and other programs that celebrate the new Government. Broadcast Is Canceled **********Months ago, it committed itself to broadcast a weekly coffee-shop forum at which opposition figures often took part even during the later months of Mr. Marcos's presidency. **********But last week it canceled its broadcast of the forum at which Mr. Enrile was the guest. Both the cancellation and the Government's explanation for it have disturbed several Philippine journalists. **********''Do not confuse a Government entity with the private and commercial media,'' said Mr. Saguisag's successor as spokesman, Teodoro Benigno. ''Freedom of the press is very much in practice in the commercial media.'' **********If given air time on People's Television, he said, Mr. Enrile would simply ''rant, fume, rage and criticize the Government without giving the Government a chance to present its side.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/31/business/business-forum-why-a-low-savings-rate-isn-t-all-bad.html": {"writer_name": "John Makin", "pub_date": "1987-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1212, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WHY A LOW SAVINGS RATE ISN'T ALL BAD", "print_headline": "BUSINESS FORUM; WHY A LOW SAVINGS RATE ISN'T ALL BAD", "body_text": " **********PERSONAL saving is the part of your paycheck that is left over after taxes and all the bills are paid. For most Americans struggling to make ends meet, it will come as little surprise that saving amounts to a small share of income. But the 2.5 percent of after-tax income it represented in 1986 was well below the average of 6.6 percent for the last five years and the lowest level in the postwar era. **********This abysmal performance, especially in comparison with Japan's saving rate of more than 25 percent, has raised serious questions about our national policy on saving. Should we save more? Why does a country like Japan save so much, and should we be more like it? The answers are far from clear cut. **********The American attitude about saving is schizophrenic. Saving is considered a virtue, so failing to save must somehow be unvirtuous. Then again, we are subjected daily to a barrage of ads claiming, ''You can have it all, now,'' suggesting that somehow our every need and wish should be instantly gratified. **********Historically, the United States achieved enormous gains in living standards without a high level of raw saving and capital accumulation. It did this by avoiding major wars on its soil (except, of course, the Civil War) and through technological ingenuity that raised the productivity of the resources already at hand. Still, unless we want to gamble on some new frontier to sustain our living standard, the low savings rate should concern us. **********There is one bright spot: The stock market boom of recent years has probably distorted the measured saving rate, making it look much lower than it is. Technically, the savings rate also includes corporate contributions to pension funds, which make up a large part of personal saving. Funding formulas for defined benefit pensions call for reduced contributions when the stock market and real interest rates are high. Both events have coincided in the 1980's and probably have had a significant negative impact on the measured personal saving rate. (See accompanying chart.) We should not find absolute solace in this pension-related drop in personal saving, however. When the market drops, the same pension-funding formula would call for increases in pension contributions. While those additional payments would show up as a sharp increase in the personal saving rate, many companies would find themselves strapped for cash to meet the contributions. **********Moreover, we should not lose sight of a major cause of the low savings rate - the effort to maintain a high level of consumption during the 1980's, a period of sluggish growth that averaged 2.5 percent or below instead of the 4 percent we had counted on. This living beyond our means finds its most obvious expression in the Federal budget deficit, which continues to draw down savings. **********But none of this weighs particularly heavily on Americans, perhaps because they continue to prosper despite a low savings rate, conventionally measured. Accordingly, economic policies seem to be contemptuous of the notion that saving ought to be encouraged. **********Our tax policy, which subsidizes borrowing and penalizes lending, is the reverse of that in high-saving countries like Japan. The rush toward consumption accelerates in inflationary periods, when borrowing expands because inflation-bloated interest rates are fully deductible for borrowers but fully taxed for lenders. This effect was only mildly muted by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. **********A look at nations with high rates of personal saving is informative, but is also a little discouraging. Japanese real per capita income was halved by World War II. The result was a ferocious commitment to elevating future consumption by saving one-quarter to one-third of income, rather than leaving things to chance or technological breakthrough. **********Although contemporary Japan is a newly rich country, its citizens do not enjoy a rich standard of living. The Japanese work six days a week and save nearly a third of their income. That pool of savings is augmented by the ingrained saving habits of Japan's elderly and the scarcity of leisure time. ALSO, instead of using its limited areas of open land for ample and comfortable housing, Japan has chosen to allow farmers to use the land to grow rice, even though the direct cost of growing rice in Japan is eight times the world price. The indirect cost is far higher.  Agricultural protection forces Japanese consumers to spend an extra $60 billion yearly on food and to pay dearly for substandard housing. The average Japanese spends 10 times annual family income for housing, compared with an already hefty four times income spent by Americans. Most of the difference is due to the astronomical cost of land in a mountainous country that devotes most of its habitable terrain to agriculture. **********The recent link-up between Tokyo and the international capital markets produced a mutual attraction between Japan's megasavers and America's superconsumers far stronger than anyone had imagined. But now that America's Japanese-financed spending spree has been under way for a few years, there are signs of strain in the marriage. Americans are increasing their debt to Japan at a rate of $60 billion a year and running a $60 billion trade deficit in the process. **********Before long, both America's extravagant spending and Japan's high saving rate will have to change. Americans are already getting nervous about debts to foreigners, while the Japanese, especially those who have seen the homes and life styles of Americans, are beginning to wonder what they are saving for. **********A major inhibitor of saving in the United States is the tax system, which taxes saving twice - when the money is earned and when it pays interest. A consumption tax or national sales tax, in place of income taxes, would eliminate that bias and encourage more saving. **********If Japan changed land use and tax policies to increase the supply of land for housing, the resulting surge in housing construction would fuel an economic boom. Japanese producers could turn their attention to supplying the builders who would rehouse the nation, instead of producing exclusively for export. Trade tensions would be sharply reduced. **********We are a rich nation, well able to afford a consumption binge. But at current saving rates and barring major technological innovations, the living standards of our children and grandchildren will at best only match those we are now enjoying. While this would be no great hardship by historical standards, it would be the first time a society has chosen to lower the living standards of subsequent generations. If that is what we propose, perhaps we should warn our children and ask ourselves why America in the late 20th century should be different from most other societies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/10/business/concern-about-takeover-bill.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-07-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 228, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Concern About Takeover Bill", "print_headline": "Concern About Takeover Bill", "body_text": " **********Three of New York's most prominent securities lawyers told a panel of the House of Representatives today that proposed tender offer legislation would have small effect on hostile takeover activity. **********The proposed legislation, which would restrict a number of tactics frequently used in hostile takeovers, including ''greenmail'' and ''golden parachutes,'' is being considered by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance. **********''I think all of the bills as presently drafted will essentially have no impact on hostile takeover activity,'' said Martin Lipton, a partner in the New York firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.

Rudman of New Hampshire, the Republican vice chairman of the Senate committee, said that for months the White House had depicted Colonel North as ''the evil wizard,'' and he was often portrayed that way in news accounts. One reason for the favorable response to his testimony, Senator Rudman suggested, was that the public was surprised to find him such an attractive and sympathetic witness. **********''I am totally convinced,'' the Senator continued, ''that when this all sinks in, the American people will have a lot to be concerned about.'' **********Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, agreed with that assessment. ''This week was overshadowed by the force of his personality,'' he said. ''But in the long term, the focus will be on the policy.'' **********Many lawmakers today were preparing questions they intend to ask Colonel North on Monday, and the staffs were preparing for the appearance of Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter on Tuesday or Wednesday. **********Democrats and Republicans alike said Admiral Poindexter, the former national security adviser who was Colonel North's immediate superior, would be the crucial witness of the investigation. He is the only one with intimate knowledge of what was being done on Iran and Nicaragua who met regularly with the President. **********''All roads now bypass North and lead to Poindexter,'' said Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois. ''What he is going to say now is the mega-question.'' **********Republicans and Democrats both said they had been impressed by Colonel North's sincerity and believed his testimony that the secret operations he ran from the White House were conducted only under orders from his superiors. But they said they were skeptical of many aspects of his testimony. **********None of the more than a dozen lawmakers interviewed supported the central point in Colonel North's testimony - that it was acceptable to lie to Congress and others in the Government to protect clandestine foreign policy initiatives and to finance those operations with secret funds raised outside the Government. Some Testimony Not Believed **********Moreover, many of the senators and representatives said they found particular elements of the colonel's testimony unbelievable. For example, they said they doubted that he shredded his files last fall because, as he said, he knew he would be leaving the White House and feared his successor would not have his ''same values'' or ''perspective.'' Surely, they said, the main reason for the shredding was to hide from Congress and perhaps from prosecutors what had happened. **********Another part of the testimony many found unbelievable was the Marine colonel's assertion that he needed to use money from the Iran arms sales to pay for a security system for his home because the Government would not provide him with protection. They said they would try to show on Monday that he had not made a serious effort to obtain official protection. **********But the legislators said the testimony would be valuable in the attaining their main goal of determining and explaining to the public, in the words of Senator George J. Mitchell, a Maine Democrat, ''what happened and how and why these policies developed.'' **********Colonel North, for instance, was the first witness to describe the influence in the Administration of William J. Casey, then the Director of Central Intelligence, and Mr. Casey's interest in having a secret fund he could draw on that was not accountable to Congress or the rest of the Government. What Mr. Casey wanted, Senator Rudman said, was ''a C.I.A. outside of the C.I.A., thus avoiding the oversight any democracy has to have.'' **********The lawmakers were also especially interested in his testimony that top Administration officials like Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger were muted in their opposition to trading arms to Iran for American hostages. Mr. Shultz and Mr. Weinberger, who have said they argued strenuously against the deals, will testify later. **********Representative Ed Jenkins, one of only two legislators who questioned Colonel North this week, made a point of criticizing the secret fund. ''There is not a single official elected by the people of this great nation that had any knowledge of that,'' he declared. **********When Mr. Jenkins asked the colonel if that statement was correct, he replied that it was. ''That is current knowledge, Congressman,'' he said. Respectful Challenging **********In his questioning, Mr. Jenkins, a Democrat from rural north Georgia, politely challenged the colonel on such matters as his lying to Iranians with whom he was trying to arrange a long-term understanding and his justification for the profits Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and his business partner, Albert Hakim, stood to make from the arms deals. **********Mr. Jenkins's demeanor and line of questioning were ''masterful,'' Senator Rudman said. Others said that if that caliber of interrogation was maintained, it might somewhat diminish the public's perception of the colonel. **********''Remember,'' said Representative Les Aspin, Democrat of Wisconsin, ''General Secord looked pretty good at first, but at the end, he didn't look so hot.'' **********The legislators have no doubt that Colonel North did himself a great deal of good with his testimony this week. Senator Howell Heflin, a Democrat who was once Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, said, ''He has such a winning way that it will be very difficult for any jury to convict him.'' **********Senator James A. McClure, an Idaho Republican, said he was advising people not to form conclusions yet. ''Every witness,'' he said, ''shifts the focus to someone else.'' **********The investigation, he added, would not ''run off its track and blow up,'' and people should let it ''run its course'' before reaching judgments."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/23/world/lebanese-hijacking-suspect-is-denied-bail-at-hearing-in-us.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 517, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lebanese Hijacking Suspect Is Denied Bail at Hearing in U.S.", "print_headline": "Lebanese Hijacking Suspect Is Denied Bail at Hearing in U.S.", "body_text": " **********Appearing with both his forearms encased in plaster, Fawaz Younis, a Lebanese terrorist suspect, was denied bail today at a pretrial hearing. He was charged last week with hijacking a Jordanian airliner in 1985. **********The casts were placed on Mr. Younis several days ago because he had suffered ''small fractures in each wrist,'' said Pat Korten, a Justice Department spokesman. Mr. Korten said law enforcement officials had not yet determined whether the fractures occurred while Mr. Younis was in their custody. **********Francis D. Carter, the Washington lawyer who is representing Mr. Younis, said the fractures ''definitely'' occurred after he was trapped in a sting operation while on vacation in Cyprus. **********Officials from the F.B.I. and the Justice Departments have refused to give details of the operation that led to the arrest, in which the suspect was lured into international waters by American authorities. Arrested by F.B.I. Agents **********But one Government official said of Mr. Younis's fractures, ''It appears that it could only have been accidental.'' He said he was not aware of any struggle. **********This official added that after Mr. Younis was captured on board a private yacht off Cyprus where he was arrested by F.B.I. agents, he was transferred to a Navy vessel where he was interrogated for three days. **********''When he was brought aboard the U.S. naval vessel, his wrists were swollen,'' the official said. **********Much of today's hearing was taken up with a video-tape recording of a speech given by a man whom Government prosecutors identified as Mr. Younis. He gave the speech while standing on the steps of an airliner. **********In a four-page transcript provided to reporters, the man identified as Mr. Younis said the hijacking was undertaken as an expression of protest over an Arab League meeting that week. The Arab nations adopted a resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in and around the Palestinian district besieged by Shiite militiamen on the outskirts of Beirut and for the withdrawal of the Shiites. 'We Are Not Terrorists' **********''We would like to clarify,'' the transcript recorded Mr. Younis as saying, ''we are not terrorists, killers or criminals, nor are we shedders of blood.'' **********He continued: ''We would just like, through our operation, to make it clear to the people and to world opinion as a whole what is really going on within some of the repressive right-wing Arab regimes - especially in the Arab League conference, that was held to save Yasir Arafat and his acts and to save his false slogans.'' **********Mr. Younis, who is a Shiite Moslem, was arraigned last Thursday in Federal District Court here on charges that he was a leader of the 1985 hijacking of a Jordanian airliner with four Americans aboard.

'Very Close' to Using Troops **********What was contemplated on June 19, the politicians and diplomats said, was not martial law but a lesser action known as a garrison decree. It would have authorized the use of soldiers to maintain order, but would also have left the Government and all its agencies in civilian hands. **********The country, several well-informed people said, had come much nearer to military intervention than most South Koreans realized at the time. ''We were very close,'' a diplomat said. **********But a few hours before troops were set to move, Mr. Chun suddenly shifted direction, as he often had done in his seven years in power. His instinct is to deal quickly and forcefully with dissent, people familiar with his thinking say. But he is also prepared to sheath his temper, they add, if that seems the wiser course. **********From moderates within his Government and ruling party, Mr. Chun heard warnings that military action would jeopardize the 1988 Summer Olympic Games in Seoul, would anger the United States and other countries important to South Korea, and perhaps would even have made it impossible for the President to transfer power next February, as planned, to his hand-picked successor, Mr. Roh. **********Besides, several officials said, many commanders did not want to get involved, in the belief that the military's reputation had been sullied whenever it was called out against South Koreans in the past. **********Instead of immediate action, Mr. Chun pulled back and settled for a stern warning. On the night of June 19, his figurehead Prime Minister, Lee Han Key, went on television to threaten unspecified ''extraordinary'' measures if the protests did not end. Drastic Compromises **********That decision, well-placed analysts said, may have turned the tide in South Korea's political crisis, for it affirmed the Government's commitment to seek a political solution to end the most sustained street violence in seven years. It led senior officials and ruling-party leaders to consider drastic compromises that they had rejected out of hand before. **********Ultimately - although it took 10 days - it produced the decision by Mr. Roh to capitulate to major opposition demands for direct presidential elections, release of political prisoners and restoration of civil rights to dissidents, including the best-known political figure, Kim Dae Jung. Two days later, on July 1, Mr. Chun gave his approval. **********Suddenly, Mr. Roh must run for a presidency that he had expected to have handed to him. Just as suddenly, the opposition is forced to prepare not only for an election that had seemed improbable but also for the possibility that it might actually take office next year. **********How Mr. Roh reached his decision is still not fully clear. Although he said in an interview on Saturday that he had discussed the political situation with many Koreans of varied backgrounds, he made his intentions known only to close advisers. **********Even before then, pressure for decisive action had been building within the governing Democratic Justice Party. Still, when his final announcement was made to the party's executive council, it was a true bombshell. **********He was looking, Mr. Roh said in the interview, for ''sweeping, epoch-making, bold measures.'' **********It appears that he had no face-to-face meetings with President Chun between June 24, when he says he made up his mind, and June 29, when he publicly disclosed his plans. In the interview, Mr. Roh would not directly discuss any conversations that may have taken place at the Blue House, the presidential residence.  A Pair of Old Allies, But Sometimes Also Political Rivals **********But party officials and diplomats say they believe that Mr. Roh kept Mr. Chun fully informed through third parties about his thinking. The President may not have known in advance about every detail of what would become an eight-point plan, these officials said, but he understood the critical details, especially those involving direct presidential elections and political freedom for Kim Dae Jung, a man openly loathed in the Blue House. **********''Mr. Roh knew the President's mind,'' a National Assembly member from the Democratic Justice Party said. **********Some analysts also discerned a calculated attempt to enhance Mr. Roh's political stature, which had begun to wilt in the crisis. This maneuvering was not without complications. **********On one hand, Mr. Chun and Mr. Roh are old allies, fellow graduates of the Korea Military Academy, class of 1955, and partners in a mutiny of generals that brought them to power in late 1979. But they have also fallen into rivalry on occasion. This may have been one of those times, political analysts said. **********Mr. Chun had announced publicly that he was leaving all political matters to Mr. Roh, concentrating himself on defense, economics and national security. As the crisis wore on, some analysts said, the President grew increasingly irritated with his friend. **********There were reports that Mr. Roh might even be sacrificed as his party's presidential candidate, the hope being that that would be enough of a conciliatory gesture to the opposition to ease tensions. At one point, Mr. Roh himself implied that he was prepared to give up his ambitions for higher office if that was what it would take. **********But when the decision was finally reached to offer concessions, several knowledgeable people said, it was also agreed to protect the Roh candidacy. Only the boldest possible move would work, Mr. Roh and his advisers. **********Among Mr. Roh's problems was that many South Koreans regarded him as a phlegmatic carbon copy of the President. During recent protests, some of the attacks were brutal. In one chant, Mr. Roh was called ''the bald man with a wig,'' meaning Mr. Chun in disguise. **********''By taking these steps he shatters his image as an indecisive man,'' a diplomat said of Mr. Roh. ''My hunch is that they agreed in principle to some sort of dramatic gesture to establish a break with Chun.'' **********There is no evidence that Mr. Roh cleared his proposals with senior military officers, to check whether the prospect of a wide-open presidential campaign would make them nervous. Twice in the past - Park Chung Hee in 1961 and Mr. Chun in 1979 - South Korean generals have stepped in when free-for-all politics became too disorderly to their liking. **********Still, as a former general, Mr. Roh is widely presumed to have taken informal soundings from the army. Several politicians said they had heard that he had help in this effort from his brother-in-law, Kim Bok Dong, also a retired military man. The purpose, they said, was not so much to obtain the army's approval as to determine if there was active disapproval. **********For his part, Mr. Roh said in the interview that ''consulting with active-duty military officers on this political subject would be inappropriate.'' Nevertheless, he added, ''I also felt quite confident that the military would fully support my proposal.'' **********The wave of protests began on June 10, a few hours after the ruling party certified Mr. Roh as its presidential candidate before a much-criticized electoral college that is now to be discarded. **********It had been generally assumed that street rallies scheduled for that day by a coalition of anti-Government groups would be large but easily contained, like others that had come before. There was ample precedent to show that riot policemen were capable of stopping demonstrators cold before they could even gather. **********This time, things were different. It was not just that the rally was bigger than previous ones. For the first time, there were also undeniable signs of solid middle-class support for college students, who by long tradition are the shock troops of protest in South Korea. **********People of all ages and backgrounds were obviously dissatisfied with the slow pace of political development. All they had was Mr. Chun's promise that he would step aside next February, thereby becoming the first South Korean leader to leave the Blue House voluntarily. The President had argued that his departure, of itself, would be the single greatest stride toward democracy in the country's 39-year history. **********It quickly became clear that South Koreans wanted more. **********Their protests reached a fever pitch the night of Thursday, June 18. Downtown Seoul looked like a war zone as tens of thousands of demonstrators took control of the streets, overpowering entire units of riot policemen who had run out of tear gas. **********Battles erupted in cities across the country, including places not accustomed to street fighting, such as Taejon, 85 miles south of the capital. That night in Taejon a protester, who turned out to be a drunken ex-convict, commandeered a bus and drove it into a line of police officers, killing one of them. **********From that moment, the mood of the police turned dark. They were overworked and undermanned, and discipline was in danger of breaking down. ''There were police units that began to ask for military help,'' a Western diplomat said. **********They were turned down the next day, however, as Mr. Chun reportedly first endorsed involving the army, then backed away. ''In a sense,'' the diplomat said, ''that has been Chun's saving grace - his unpredictability. That's part of his mystique. You don't know what he'll do.'' **********Even before the June 19 decision to withhold military force, a political solution was being demanded in many quarters. Religious leaders, notably the influential Roman Catholic Primate, Stephen Cardinal Kim Sou Hwan, called for direct election of the next president. **********That same week, President Reagan sent a letter to Mr. Chun, urging discussions and cautioning the South Korean leader against an overreaction to the protests. **********In the meantime, adverse reaction overseas to the civil unrest raised serious questions about whether South Korea could hold a trouble-free Olympics next year; this created its own pressures for a peaceful settlement. **********Few things are more important to South Koreans -supporters and opponents of the Government alike -than the 1988 Games. For them, the Olympics amount to a coming-out party attesting to their arrival as a global economic force.  In the National Assembly, The Ruling Party Suddenly Switches **********Perhaps the surest sign that change was afoot came from National Assemblymen in the ruling party. Suddenly, they were clamoring for concessions to the opposition, arguing that democratic changes were long overdue anyway. And some of these Assemblymen, such as Lee Jong Chan and Hyun Hong Choo, were advisers to Mr. Roh. **********The turnabout of the politicians was startling. For seven years most of them had served as unquestioning minions to Mr. Chun, providing him with a political framework that he lacked as a career army officer. Now, worried about their country's future and no doubt their own as well, they became vigorous advocates of reform. **********A caucus of party lawmakers held on Sunday, June 21, showed the depth of feelings within the Democratic Justice Party, especially among politicians from Seoul and other big cities. Their remarks were reported in uncommon detail by the South Korean press, which has long been shackled by the Government but which in recent weeks has gone out of its way to test the outer limits of official tolerance. **********One Assemblyman, Hong Sung Woo, a former television actor, was quoted as saying: ''People want direct elections. People are fed up with the military running politics.'' **********Other comments from unidentified lawmakers were, ''We should get rid of the smell of military barracks from our party,'' and, ''We should regain the confidence of people to escape from being an object of hatred.'' **********People who were on hand said that the overall anti-Chun tone was even harsher than the newspapers suggested. **********According to Korean officials familiar with Mr. Roh, opinions of this sort had already begun to influence his thinking. **********They say that six years out of the army - and after more than two years as chairman of the ruling party -he has become ''civilianized.'' Forced into the rough and tumble of politics, colleagues say, he has learned to respect diversity of opinion, especially when compared with Mr. Chun, who went straight from the barracks to the Blue House and is said to have minimal patience for disagreement. **********In conversations, if not in print, Korean journalists who follow political affairs have raised the possibility that Mr. Roh's surprising announcement was an attempt to strike at Mr. Chun. They say he had been unhappy over reports that his presidential candidacy was in jeopardy, and in effect tried to save himself with a bold move that would back the President into a corner, leaving him no alternative but to go along.  Growing Signs of Change: Hard Line Eases in the Blue House **********But it seems more likely that there was some sort of coordination between President Chun and Mr. Roh. **********In late May, even before the crisis began, Mr. Chun bolstered his old friend's standing by reorganizing his Cabinet and removing two serious rivals - the Prime Minister, Lho Shin Young, and Chang Se Dong, head of the National Security Planning Agency, formerly known as the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. **********Moreover, President Chun, having abandoned his initial hard line, suddenly showed little public hesitation himself about accepting changes. **********An important sign was his willingness to meet for the first time with Kim Young Sam, head of the main opposition force, the Reunification Democratic Party. At that meeting - held on June 24, the day Mr. Roh said he had made up his mind to act - Mr. Chun reversed an order he had announced in April, and agreed to a resumption of talks on amending constitutional provisions for electing the president. **********That was not good enough, Mr. Kim said later, and he announced that his party would join new street rallies scheduled nationwide for June 26. Once more, the mood turned ominous. Many Koreans approached June 26 with unmasked dread, for it seemed that troops might be summoned if the violence of June 18 was repeated. **********While the numbers of protesters were large, sweeping across more than 30 cities, the rallies were peaceful for the most part. It was increasingly evident that the momentum of conciliation was well under way. **********By then, demands for change were louder than ever within the ruling camp. On June 26, the Democratic Justice Party's Secretary General, Lee Choon Koo, said openly that it was now impossible for Mr. Chun to transfer power to a designated successor using the existing Constitution and its electoral college. **********Still, most party members were talking about relatively moderate overtures to the opposition, such as holding a national referendum on a new form of government, or calling quick elections for the National Assembly, with the winning party having its way on constitutional revision. A few people called for direct elections, but they were a distinct minority. **********Almost no one in the party - or in the Government, for that matter - was prepared for how far Mr. Roh would go when he walked into the party's executive council session last Monday with a text that had been written over the weekend by an aide, Lee Byong Ki. **********He asked reporters and photographers to stay, and then, for 17 minutes, he laid out his plan for direct elections and other changes. As he spoke, some party members closed their eyes and concentrated. **********''This country belongs to us,'' Mr. Roh said. ''It is our historic duty to both exert our efforts and exercise restraint and wisdom to more successfully develop the country, which was founded and nurtured with the blood of our forefathers and the lives of the patriots, and to proudly hand it over to the next generation.'' **********He added, ''I sincerely hope that national wisdom will be pooled to demonstrate to the world that the Korean people will not go backward, but will go forward to make a contribution to world history.'' **********At that, the room burst into applause. Mr. Roh shook hands with senior party officials, apologizing for not having provided advance warning. **********''What do you think of my plan?'' he asked a Korean reporter as he left. ''You have done well,'' the reporter replied. ''You saw that I have abandoned everything,'' Mr. Roh said. And then, using a Korean expressing for taking a big gamble, he added, ''Now, I am really naked.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/25/business/advertising-new-monthly-is-aimed-at-owners-of-vcr-s.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1987-06-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 200, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; New Monthly Is Aimed At Owners of VCR's", "print_headline": "Advertising; New Monthly Is Aimed At Owners of VCR's", "body_text": " **********Some experienced magazine and direct-marketing people are involved in the planning for a new monthly, controlled-circulation magazine that will bring readers news of the world of video cassettes and advertisers an opportunity to sell the readers those cassettes by mail. **********The publication is V, The Mail-Order Magazine of Videocassettes, which will bow in January with a circulation of 400,000 taken from a list of affluent VCR owners compiled by the publisher, the Fairfield Publishing Company of New York.

Both men are dead. **********The 8,178 files, collected by the United Nations War Crimes Commission and closed for more than 40 years, include harrowing litanies of World War II atrocities against Jews and others by German forces and their collaborators, including Italians, from fjords in Norway to mountain villages in Yugoslavia. The files also include accusations against 363 Japanese. Files Mirror Cold War Tensions **********The files, stored in a Manhattan office building and recently opened for the first time to outside researchers, also shed new light on some of the cold war tensions that split Eastern and Western members of the commission, impeding efforts to prosecute some of the accused. **********Historians say it would require extensive research to determine how many the accused have not been previously linked to war crimes or, for that matter, how many are still alive and can be found nearly half a century later. **********Some historians have also compared the archive to raw police files, replete with inaccuracies and untested allegations. In one case, a renowned anti-Nazi writer and resistance figure, Eugen Kogon, who had been forced to work in the human experiments laboratory at the Buchenwald concentration camp, has been listed as wanted for mass murder, with no further details. **********Hermann Langbein, a co-author and longtime associate of Dr. Kogon, said from Vienna this week that Dr. Kogon had saved many prisoners at Buchenwald at great personal risk, and that the commission's listing was a tragic error. Dr. Kogon, who is 85 years old and has Alzheimer's disease, is the author of ''The Theory and Practice of Hell,'' a classic treatise on the concentration camps, and many other writings on the evils of Nazism. He lives in West Germany. **********The United States and the 16 other nations that made up the commission agreed in October to open the files after a long dispute following the disclosure that the former United Nations Secretary General, Kurt Waldheim, was listed as wanted for murder by Yugoslavia. Mr. Waldheim, who had served with a German Army intelligence unit and was elected President of Austria last year, has denied taking part in any atrocities. His wartime role is being studied by an international commission of historians. No New Data on Waldheim **********Beyond what has already been disclosed, there is no further information on Mr. Waldheim in the United Nations war crimes files. **********Earlier this month, The New York Times became one of the first news organizations permitted to review the files, stored on two floors of a 12-story commercial building at 345 Park Avenue South, at 25th Street. The files were turned over to the United Nations in 1949, a year after the London-based War Crimes Commission voted itself out of business after four years of work and as the cold war made adversaries of wartime allies. The Soviet Union never joined the commission. **********The commission did not have investigators or hold trials. It also did not list citizens accused by their own government of aiding the Nazis. **********The files show that Mr. Kopf was listed by the commission for having served during the war as chief of the Nazis' ''trusteeship'' office in Chorzow, confiscating Polish property for the Third Reich. Allegations From Poland **********Witnesses alleged in statements submitted by the Poles that Mr. Kopf, backed by the Gestapo, had taken over their homes and shops and had been seen with furniture taken from deported Jews. One account said he had struck or beaten a farm worker. The Poles also said they had a German photograph showing Mr. Kopf in command of a deportation transport in Krzepice. **********After he was listed by the commission in 1947, Mr. Kopf was identified through a newspaper photograph as the British-appointed head of Hanover Province who became the first Premier of the new state of Lower Saxony. **********Embarrassed by the disclosure, the British and the Americans moved in the commission's last days in 1948 to remove Mr. Kopf from the war crimes list, on the ground that he had already been investigated by the British. **********In his statement, Mr. Kopf said: ''Naturally a normal day's work was expected and action was taken against idleness, cruelty to animals and theft. In some cases I boxed the ears of anybody caught red-handed, whether a Pole or a German.'' **********The panel's deputy chairman, Sir Robert Craigie of Britain, commented: ''It was characteristic of the Germans as a whole that they do box the ears of young people at slight provocation. That, however, was not a war crime.'' The dismayed Poles were outvoted and Mr. Kopf's name was taken off the list. He died in 1961.  Dispute on Slovak Official A similar dispute engulfed the case of Dr. Durcansky, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Nazi puppet state of Slovakia in 1939 and 1940. According to Czechoslovak charges accepted by the commission in 1946, he had been on the payroll of the Nazi secret services and had promulgated anti-Jewish laws in Slovakia. Most of the country's 88,000 Jews perished. Slovakia's President, Josef Tiso, a Roman Catholic priest, was later hanged as a war criminal. **********The commission listed Dr. Durcansky in 1946, and the Czechoslovak Government tried him in absentia the next year and sentenced him to death. But the Czechoslovaks said they learned that he had escaped to the French zone in 1945 and, with a suspicious freedom of movement through the West, remained at large plotting against postwar Czechoslovak leaders. **********Dr. Durcansky turned up in the United States in 1959, speaking to anti-Communist Slovak groups.

All other companies reported lesser drops, except Honda of America, which gained. **********On a seasonally adjusted basis, sales ran at a 6.8 million rate, well below the 9.1 million rate in the 1986 period and the 7.8 million rate in the first 10 days of February. Bad Weather a Possible Factor **********Analysts said bad weather may have been a factor in the most recent period, but they added that the apparent inability of incentives to spur sales could mean production cuts and layoffs for the Big Three companies. **********''There are substantial incentive campaigns out there to move the market,'' said John Hammond, a sales analyst with J. D. Power & Associates. ''If they are not enough, what do the manufacturers have left for the spring selling season that begins in mid-March?'' G. M. is offering a variety of incentives on about half its model lineup, and other manufacturers have competing programs. **********Others noted that the 1986 period was very strong, distorting year-to-year comparisons. But they pointed out that G. M. has been losing market share almost since the beginning of the model year last October. #10-Point Loss Seen for G. M. ''They've lost about 10 percentage points of market share in that time,'' said David Healy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. **********Mr. Healy estimated that G. M. dealers would have a 100-day supply of cars by the end of March if sales continue at the present rate and production schedules do not change. Since a 60-day supply is considered the most desirable, G. M. will have to decide whether to cut production and make layoffs or offer incentives like the 2.9 percent financing program that started last August but that contributed to an operating loss in the third quarter. **********Aside from cars, sales of light trucks also fell sharply at G. M., while the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation had slight increases. G. M. sold 23 percent fewer light trucks, at 36,987 units, in the 10 days. That drop pulled the industry down 10 percent from last year, to 96,774 units. Ford Off 7.9%, Chrysler 14.8% **********Ford's car sales in the mid-February period totaled 59,225, down 7.9 percent, while Chrysler's were 26,716, off 14.8 percent. **********The American Motors Corporation was down 64 percent, to 725, and Volkswagen declined 23.5 percent, to 1,522. Honda of America, however, was up 55.4 percent, at 6,208, and the Toyota Motor Corporation, which had no domestic cars last year, reported sales of 684. Sales of the Nissan Motor Corporation, which had reporting difficulties, were estimated at 2,100 based on previous periods, down 25 percent. **********G. M.'s domestic car market share in the period declined to 48.7 percent from 58.3 percent. The beneficiary of the slippage was Ford, which gained to 31.4 percent, from 25.3 percent. Chrysler was up to 13.8 percent, from 12.1 percent, but A.M.C. declined to three-tenths of 1 percent, from eight-tenths of 1 percent, and Volkswagen of America was constant at eight-tenths of 1 percent. Jump in Honda's Market Share **********Rising production at its Marysville, Ohio, plant increased Honda's market share to 3.3 percent, from 1.6 percent, while Nissan was constant at 1.1 percent. Toyota accounted for three-tenths of 1 percent of the domestic market. **********The mid-February sales slump further sank sales for the calendar year, to 26.5 percent below the 1986 period, at 786,122. Once again, the largest decline was reported by G.M., whose sales of 414,875 are down 33.5 percent. Ford's totaled 213,890, down 16.6 percent, while Chrysler's total of 101,327 is off 22.6 percent.

Instead, they preferred to absorb costs resulting from a strong yen and even sell at a loss, rather than lose market share. **********This is the first time Washington has moved in a significant way to penalize Japan for following this course. Higher Duties Possible **********The yen has risen against the dollar by more than 60 percent since February 1985, which should mean that Japanese products would cost much more in the United States than before. **********But some bearing prices failed to rise at all during the investigation period, between March 1 and Aug. 31 of last year. **********Should the ruling be affirmed, it would result in higher customs duties on the imported bearings, which have a variety of industrial uses, especially in transportation equipment. **********But many analysts said the case could set a precedent for other industries in which the dollar's decline has failed to improve their ability to compete against the Japanese. **********The decision comes as the trading relationship between the United States and Japan has been strained by the Toshiba Machine Company's sale of sensitive military goods to the Soviet Union and a disagreement between Washington and Tokyo, now partially settled, over the dumping of computer chips. Looking for 'Fair Value' **********Koichi Haraguchi, information counselor at the Japanese Embassy, said it was ''not appropriate'' for his Government to comment because this was an ''internal action taken in accordance with U.S. dumping law.'' **********The duties are intended to raise the Japanese selling prices to what the Commerce Department has determined to be ''fair value.'' This is computed on the basis of the exporters' home market price, his selling price in other markets outside the United States, his cost of production and other factors including a margin of profit. **********The department singled out two Japanese companies for sales of tapered roller bearings. It said that the Koyo Seiko Company was selling bearings at 70.44 percent below the computed fair value and that the NTN Toyo Bearing Company was selling bearings for 47.05 percent less. **********The decision, which was announced late Wednesday, came on a complaint filed by the Timken Company of Canton, Ohio, the leading maker of bearings in this country. It involves imports valued at more than $100 million last year. Commerce 'Is Waking Up' **********''This is a shot across the bows of the Japanese that currency changes ultimately have to be reflected appropriately in product prices,'' said Representative Nancy Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, whose district contains companies making roller bearings, machine tools, computers and other products affected by Japanese competition. **********Representative Helen Delich Bentley, Republican of Maryland, who is a member of the Congressional steel caucus, said she was happy the Commerce Department ''is waking up and starting to pay attention to dumping resulting from currency changes.'' **********The finding will become final if the International Trade Commission, another Federal agency, determines that the domestic roller-bearing industry has suffered from low Japanese pricing. The I.T.C. has already made a preliminary finding of injury. Its final ruling must come within 45 days.  If the I.T.C. makes an affirmative finding, the Commerce Department will issue an order instructing the Customs Service to collect duties determined by the dumping margins announced yesterday. **********Commerce Department officials declined to speculate on which industries might be the next to seek higher dumping margins. 'Likely to Be More Cases' **********S. Bruce Smart Jr., the Under Secretary of Commerce for international trade administration, said only that ''given the major shift in exchange rates and the lesser shift in prices of Japanese goods in the U.S. market, there are likely to be more cases of dumped goods than we are accustomed to seeing.'' **********The ruling drew reaction from the steel industry. A spokesman for the American Iron and Steel Institute, Sheldon Wesson, said, ''The steel industry has expressed concern over the fact that the lower value of the dollar has not been reflected more than slightly in the prices of imported steel, leading to the conclusion tht a very large proportion of the steel sold in this country is at dumping prices.'' **********Auto industry officials have also been following the case closely. **********Robert A. Perkins, vice president of the Washington office of the Chrysler Corporation, observed, ''This will be a strong indication to the Japanese, and anybody else, that if they're selling below cost they had better look to their pricing.'' **********Some analysts suggested that Japanese pickup trucks might become one of the next targets. On top of the currency changes, they have had to absorb a 25 percent duty imposed as an offshoot of a trade conflict in the mid-1960's. Inflationary Impact **********If Japanese companies, which account for about 20 percent of the total imports of the United States, dramatically raise the prices on their products, that could result in considerable inflation. **********Barry N. Bosworth, senior fellow at the Brookings Institutition and one of the top economists of the Carter Administration, said he expects prices of imported goods from Germany and Japan will rise by 20 percent by the end of next year. **********Already, he said, import prices are having an effect on the Consumer Price Index, which measures the rate of inflation. His studies show that while domestically produced costs are rising by 4 percent annually, the overall index this year will show a rise of 5 to 5 1/2 percent because of import price increases. **********As for the roller-bearing decision, Mr. Bosworth said, ''this sort of thing will put pressure on the Japanese to get their prices up.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/12/business/company-briefs-758687.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 324, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** AVX Corp., Great Neck, L.I., a maker of multilayer ceramic capacitors, said it had completed the purchase of the multilayer ceramic, glass and tantalum capacitor operations of Corning Glass Works for $66 million.

Some businesses have closed their economics departments, partly for such failures. **********Yet, with a new round of predictions upon us - it is the season of computers spewing out ever-increasing quantities of numbers - this judgment seems harsh. Professional score-keepers say that forecasters have performed relatively well of late. **********''Contrary to the popular opinion that forecasting has deteriorated, it has not,'' said Victor Zarnowitz, a professor at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business and research associate for the nation's semi-official business-cycle arbiter, the National Bureau of Economic Research. In his view, forecasters have managed to more or less keep pace with a job that in the 1980's has grown progressively harder because of frequent economic swings. **********Professor Paul A. Samuelson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a close student of forecasting, agreed. ''I think that the general state of the art has improved a little but at the same time the world that needs to be forecast has deteriorated,'' he said. ''You used to be able to be pretty sure of getting things qualitatively right,'' even if the magnitudes were wrong, he added, ''but even that has disappeared.'' **********Last year's forecasts, in fact, seem to have been respectable. ''I think we hit it pretty well on the head,'' said Robert J. Eggert, who edits Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a monthly newsletter of economic forecasts. He estimates that his consensus of about 50 economists is likely to be within one tenth of a percentage point of actual 1987 gross national product and inflation. The prediction for unemployment, however, is likely to be too high by about half a percentage point. The Zarnowitz group also seems to have performed well. Of course, the tallying of 1987's economic activity will continue for months after year-end. **********If forecasts have their limits, they can nonetheless help in thinking about the economy. Specialists such as Professors Zarnowitz and Samuelson, along with Lawrence R. Klein of the University of Pennsylvania and Stephen K. McNees of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, offer some propositions to help in evaluating the crop of forecasts for 1988 listed in the accompanying table. ***********The consensus of a group of forecasters will, by mathematical certainty, be more accurate over time than the predictions of most individuals. ***********Forecasts of physical outputs tend to be more reliable than forecasts of prices or markets. ***********Full-time and long-established forecasters do better than newcomers and those who forecast only periodically. ***********Predictions for full years tend to be more accurate than for shorter periods. ***********Errors at the peak of a business cycle tend to be greater than those at the bottom. **********Some of today's frustrations over the limits of forecasting date back to the early 1960's, a period in which the economy seemed to behave according to the rule books. That created unrealistic expectations. Economists have worked at improving their forecasting skills, but have found that simply adding computer power to macroeconomic models does not necessarily improve results. Moreover, even the best economic insight is no match for a single bad assumption about policymaking in Washington. **********What should nonprofessionals do when confronted with the latest array of forecasts, which this year reflect an unusually high degree of uncertainty because of the stock market plunge? **********''For most households and businesses,'' Mr. McNees said, ''I'd advise them to pay attention to the consensus so they will have some idea about employment and spending prospects.'' **********But investors stand to gain much less from the forecasts, Mr. McNees added. ''There's very little evidence that anyone can give you or sell you useful financial advice.''

At that time, the two sides agreed not to withdraw from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty for 10 years and to eliminate all ballistic missiles during that period. **********But under the latest American posture, Mr. Shultz is expected to suggest that each side promise not to withdraw from the treaty only until 1994. **********Explaining the shift, Mr. Carlucci said the 10-year period was in connection with reducing ballistic missiles to zero, which he said the Soviet Union had opposed. Without the total ban, he said, the United States favored a shorter period of adherence to the ABM treaty and would focus on a 50 percent reduction in ballistic missiles. **********Mr. Carlucci said the Administration was still insisting that any accord on medium-range nuclear weapons also deal with constraints on shorter-range forces. He said any freeze that did not give the Americans the right to build up to the Soviet level of 133 shorter-range missiles would be unacceptable. **********But displaying some flexibility, he said the United States could accept either parallel or follow-up negotiations on the shorter-range issue, so that it would not block an agreement in terms of medium-range forces. **********In a speech in Prague on Friday, Mr. Gorbachev proposed a freeze on shorter-range nuclear systems and an immediate start of negotiations aiming first at reduction and ultimately at elimination of these systems. **********Mr. Shultz is expected to travel here this week to report to the President on the Moscow talks, Mr. Baker said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/07/business/company-news-deere-job-cuts.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-04-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Deere Job Cuts", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Deere Job Cuts", "body_text": " **********Deere & Company announced it would reduce its work force by 6 percent, or up to 700 people.

To placate stockholders interested in a profit on their shares, Dayton Hudson is expected to devise some alternative plan. **********In a move to gain sympathy in Minnesota, Herbert H. Haft, the 67-year-old chairman of the Dart Group Corporation, and his son, Robert M. Haft, 34, who is president, said they would donate any profits they made on their stock to Minnesota charities if shareholders rebuffed them. The Hafts - among the original discount store operators - are thought to have a net worth of $400 million. The Value to Shareholders **********The Hafts propose to pay $65 a share for 95 percent of the shares, and stock worth an estimated $3.25 in the new Dayton Hudson in exchange for the other 5 percent of the shares. They said stockholders would get 20 percent of the new company under the proposal. **********The offer came after the 4 P.M. close of the New York Stock Exchange, where Dayton ended the day at $52.875, up only 50 cents. But Jefferies & Company of Los Angeles, dealing in the stock after hours, said last night that the stock was trading at $60. **********The move by the Hafts had been in the works for some time. In late July the company said it had received a letter from the Hafts disclosing their intention to buy as much as 50 percent or more of the company. Anti-Takeover Law Passed **********To help Dayton Hudson fight off the Hafts, whose interest in the company was widely known, Minnesota had already passed an anti-takeover law preventing the payment of greenmail to buy off an unwelcome suitor after next March and prohibiting for five years the sale of any assets to pay off debt. The law also requires that shareholders approve anything proposed by a stockholder with more than 20 percent of the stock. **********Robert Haft said last night that Dart now owns about 4.9 percent of Dayton Hudson, at a cost thought to approach $250 million. **********He said that the shares were not for sale and that Dart had ''no intention to sell them to the company or anyone else,'' maintaining that the Hafts ''will make every effort to purchase the company.'' **********In the past, analysts have sometimes suggested that the Hafts might be more interested in making a profit by putting a company in play than in actually buying the company. **********Mr. Haft noted that last fall, when Kenneth A. Macke, chairman of Dayton, introduced a poison pill plan to make the company extremely expensive, Mr. Macke stressed that the plan was not intended to prevent all takeovers. **********Mr. Haft said that the pill was, in Mr. Macke's words, ''to encourage a potential acquirer to negotiate with the Dayton Hudson board.'' **********''This,'' Mr. Haft said, ''is an effort to do that.'' **********Analysts said they thought that the Hafts were interested in Dayton Hudson primarily for its value if broken up and sold in pieces. But under Minnesota's new law, this could not occur for five years. **********Dayton Hudson's Target discount chain, with more than $4 billion in sales; its Mervyn's apparel chain, with sales of $2.8 billion, and its Dayton's and Hudson's department stores, with sales of $1.6 billion, are all imposing subjects for divestiture. **********Unlike other chains that have sold weak divisions only when they became takeover targets, Dayton Hudson took the initiative by selling B. Dalton, its book chain, to Barnes & Noble; closed its faltering Plum's discount division, and sold other stores. **********The offer - proposed to Mr. Macke and other Dayton Hudson directors -was conveyed in a letter dated and hand-delivered by a Haft attorney yesterday. Late yesterday Dayton Hudson said that it had received the letter and that the proposal would be ''considered by our board of directors in due course.'' **********The letter noted that Dart, known since the 1950's for its Dart Drug stores, since sold, has been in the retail business for more than 30 years. **********The younger Mr. Haft said in an interview that through Dart and a real estate company the Hafts operate they would put up $750 million for the deal, with unidentified bank lenders arranging senior bank financing amounting to about $3 billion. **********In their letter, the Hafts told the company that their financial adviser, Paine Webber Inc., had assured them that if Dayton Hudson approved their offer and senior bank financing could be arranged, it was ''highly confident'' it could arrange the balance in unsecured and subordinated debt. Mr. Haft said this might be in junk bonds. **********Based on its past opposition to the Hafts, Dayton Hudson is expected to resist the takeover, possibly by buying back stock or selling the company to someone else. **********The Hafts' letter argued that their offer represented a 50 percent premium over the stock price less than six months ago and about 2.8 times the company's book value. **********In a special plea to the residents of Minnesota, the Hafts said they would continue the company's current policies, including those with the community and charities. They said they would not only keep current management but would give it an ownership interest, and would keep Dayton Hudson's headquarters in Minneapolis. The offer, they said, was subject to the board recommending it to stockholders and to the elimination of the poison pill plan. **********The Haft family made nearly $160 million last year in an unsuccessful takeover bid for Safeway Stores and an estimated $40 million this year in a bid to buy the Supermarkets General Corporation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/05/business/tax-watch-fighting-irs-uneven-match.html": {"writer_name": "Gary Klott", "pub_date": "1987-05-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1007, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tax Watch; Fighting I.R.S.: Uneven Match", "print_headline": "Tax Watch; Fighting I.R.S.: Uneven Match", "body_text": " **********THIS is the time of year when many taxpayers begin to worry that the income tax return they just filed will come under scrutiny and someday bring the Internal Revenue Service knocking at their door. And there is reason to worry: Disputes between the I.R.S. and a taxpayer are not an even match. **********With fresh allegations of I.R.S. abuses pouring into Congressional mailboxes, lawmakers are beginning to question whether the revenue service has too much unchecked power and taxpayers too few protections. The dilemma Congress faces is whether it can afford to give taxpayers greater rights at a time when it is raising I.R.S. collection quotas to help reduce the Federal deficit. **********The I.R.S. is empowered to take extraordinary measures to go after money it thinks the Government is owed. Yet taxpayers lack some of the same basic rights of due process that the judicial system affords accused criminals. **********The burden of proof in most types of tax disputes is on the taxpayer, not the Government. Revenue agents are not required to read taxpayers their rights before interrogating them. When taxpayers are represented by an attorney or accountant, the I.R.S. still reserves the right to question the taxpayer directly. And with little notice, or in some cases no notice, the I.R.S. can seize a taxpayer's bank accounts, car, house and other assets to cover the taxes owed. **********This situation, in the view of some members of Congress, has left taxpayers vulnerable to abusive tactics by overzealous collection agents and victim to the honest mistakes that a mammoth and overburdened tax bureaucracy can sometimes make. **********Taxpayer ''horror'' stories of run-ins with the I.R.S. are nothing new. But Congress has grown concerned about the continuing flurry of documented cases in which an I.R.S. agent has used aggressive collection tactics even before the taxpayer has had a chance to work out a settlement, to raise the necessary funds or to prove that the revenue service made a mistake. **********While lawmakers are convinced that such instances are isolated, they worry that, without a legislative remedy to give taxpayers greater due process rights, the situation will get worse as the I.R.S. enforcement arm undergoes a rapid expansion. In the next few years, the I.R.S. is to hire thousands of new enforcement and collection agents with orders from Congress to collect billions of dollars more in delinquent taxes. **********Not surprisingly, the taxpayer rights legislation, known as the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights, has been politically popular. After all, no taxpayer ever liked a tax collector. The taxpayer horror stories recounted at recent Senate hearings were widely publicized on nightly news broadcasts. Both Democrats and Republicans are co-sponsors of the legislation, which has been introduced in both the Senate and the House. **********But some legal experts fear that some of the provisions contained in the bill could seriously undermine the nation's tax-collection system, as well as prospects for passage of the bill itself. Of particular concern is the proposal to shift the burden of proof in civil court and administrative proceedings from the taxpayer to the I.R.S. **********Such a shift might seem long overdue in a country where a person is considered innocent until proved guilty. But Michael Graetz, a professor at the Yale Law School, said civil tax cases had to be treated differently because the tax system was structured as a self-assessment system where only the taxpayer had access to all the information to show whether the return was filled out correctly. **********''Under the self-assessment system, the taxpayer's duty is to report to their best judgment the taxes they owe the government,'' he said. ''And in a self-assessment system it doesn't seem to me unreasonable for taxpayers to show that their assessment is correct.'' **********If the burden of proof was shifted to the I.R.S., he said, taxpayers would feel comfortable taking more aggressive positions on their tax returns, feeling the I.R.S. would have difficulty proving them wrong. **********Also controversial is a proposal that would require the I.R.S. to offer most delinquent taxpayers an opportunity to pay in installments. Installments are appropriate in hardship cases, Mr. Graetz said, but providing others an opportunity to defer taxes is likely to be perceived as unfair by taxpayers who pay on a timely basis. **********Gerald Portney, a former associate chief counsel at the I.R.S. who is now a principal at Peat Marwick Main, thinks the legislation would help prevent collection agents from rushing too quickly to seize a taxpayer's property. The bill would extend to 30 days, from 10 days, the waiting period before the I.R.S. could seize property after notification to the taxpayer was made. (The I.R.S, however, will still have the authority to seize property without notice in extraordinary cases where it suspects the collection may be in jeopardy. Jeopardy assessments are common in cases involving taxpayers suspected of being drug dealers, taxpayers about to flee the country or those suspected of preparing for an imminent sale of their property.) The legislation would also provide taxpayers with channels for appeal on such collection actions. Under current law, Mr. Portney said, taxpayers have avenues for appealing a proposed determination of how much is owed, but not for appealing a decision on when or how it is to be collected. **********Regardless of legislative prospects, Mr. Portney said, improved relations between the I.R.S. and taxpayers will require a change in attitude by revenue agents. ''The attitude of revenue officers is that the people they deal with are all deadbeats,'' he said. ''They just can't differentiate between the person that is a deadbeat and other people.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/15/world/aide-says-us-planes-carried-contra-arms.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 328, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Aide Says U.S. Planes Carried Contra Arms", "print_headline": "Aide Says U.S. Planes Carried Contra Arms", "body_text": " **********The official who headed the United States humanitarian aid program for the rebels in Nicaragua said today that he twice ordered his planes to shuttle weapons for the contras in Central America at the direction of Elliott Abrams, an Assistant Secretary of State. **********The shipments involved weapons the contras had stockpiled in the region that needed to be transported to their troops, said the official, Robert Duemling, former head of the State Department's Nicaraguan humanitarian assistance office. **********He said the flights took place early in 1986, when the Government was giving nonmilitary assistance to the contras but when a Congressional ban on military aid was in effect. **********The office was in charge of buying and delivering such goods as food and nonmilitary supplies.

Mr. Mulroney, who had been in the worst slump that opinion polls have recorded for a Canadian leader, saw his standing begin to rise. **********And then something happened that few had foreseen. **********On Wednesday, Pierre Elliott Trudeau ended the three-year-long silence on public affairs he had maintained since retiring as Prime Minister in April 1984. With a newspaper article that described the accord as a ''total bungle'' and Mr. Mulroney as ''a weakling'' for agreeing to Quebec's demands, he sent the kind of shock waves across the country that characterized his 15-year tenure as Canada's leader. 'Balkanized' Country Feared **********Mr. Trudeau, 67 years old, said he had stepped back into public debate because he despaired of anybody else's ''sounding the alarm.'' He has kept campaigning against the accord with radio and television interviews. His theme has been that Mr. Mulroney is turning away from the Trudeau vision of a strong federal state, with equal rights for French- and English-speaking Canadians, and moving toward a newly ''balkanized'' country with an ''impotent'' national Government, in which French Canadians would have to look to Quebec as their homeland. **********Since his article was published in La Presse of Montreal and The Toronto Star, the former Prime Minister has insisted that he has no intention of returning full time to political life. ''I'm an elder statesman now,'' he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, with what sounded like a self-mocking laugh. But Mr. Trudeau, once known as the the man with the shaprest tongue in Canadian politics, has become the most talked-about figure in the country all over again. **********Mr. Mulroney has called his predecessor's invectives ''a bit of low-level comedy'' and predicted that Mr. Trudeau would change his stand on the Meech Lake accord, named for the placed in Quebec where it was worked out. ''In about six months he's going to be saying that the Meech Lake accord was terrific, he's been in favor of it all along, and I'm a great Prime Minister just like him,'' he said. **********Other critics have been less sparing. Lise Bissonnette, a Quebec-based columnist for The Globe and Mail of Toronto, described Mr. Trudeau as a ''sore loser'' raging against ''his vanishing dreams.'' Marcel Prud'homme, a Montreal politician who was made a Cabinet minister by Mr. Trudeau, drew a withering analogy to another powerful figure. ''John XXIII was a great Pope, but he's dead too,'' he said. **********Behind the polemics, however, there was a widespread sense that Mr. Trudeau had done the country a service by provoking a debate about a deal that might have proceeded to ratification in virtual silence. Newspapers this weekend were packed with articles examining the accord, and influential voices were demanding that its adoption be delayed to permit a full examination. Liberal Split Develops **********In Mr. Trudeau's Liberal Party, now in opposition, a split has developed that threatens to undermine John Turner, Mr. Trudeau's successor as party leader. Mr. Turner has given qualified approval to the agreement. **********The country's foremost constitutional expert, Senator Eugene Forsey, has called for a delay in ratification. So has a group of leading artists and intellectuals, among them Farley Mowat, the writer, and Ramsay Cook, a noted historian. While these and other opponents share Mr. Trudeau's concern that the agreement may have laid the groundwork for a renewed separatist drive in Quebec, nationalists like Pierre-Marc Johnson, leader of the Parti Quebecois, once the standard-bearer for separatism, have condemned the pact as not going far enough. **********Undaunted, Mr. Mulroney has scheduled a meeting with the premiers for Tuesday to sign the agreement. If they can resolve last-minute problems in the wording, the pact will go forward for ratification by Parliament and the provincial legislatures. Mr. Mulroney has said he would like to have the process completed by the fall. **********Having accomplished his purpose in stirring a debate, Mr. Trudeau has said he intends to return to his former, almost invisible life as a partner in a Montreal law firm, as a world traveler and as father to his three sons, the oldest of whom is now 15. **********''I'm like Garbo,'' he told a CBC interviewer.

Carbide says these indicate that several employees at its Bhopal pesticide plant knew about the start of the accident earlier than they have acknowledged, and then tried to cover up this knowledge. **********Company representatives say Union Carbide has scientific proof that the gas leak could not have happened the way the Indian Government says it did, which is that water from the washing of a pipe 350 feet away got into a tank containing the lethal chemical methyl isocyanate and caused a toxic chemical reaction. **********The disaster, the worst industrial accident in history, occurred the night of Dec. 2-3, 1984, when clouds of toxic gas spread through the central Indian city of Bhopal, killing at least 2,000 people and injuring another 200,000. Indian Government Disagrees **********Indian officials and former Indian employees of Carbide's Bhopal plant vehemently dispute the company's assertions of sabotage. These officials and former workers say the company has failed to offer any proof of its charges and is maligning the people on whom it once relied to run the plant. **********Talk of sabotage has figured in talk about the Bhopal disaster almost from the moment it started. Legal experts have been highly skeptical about the Carbide's claim because the company's legal strategy has been to try to avoid paying hundreds of millions of dollars in damages by proving that the gas leak was caused deliberately. **********But in recent interviews, company representatives said that much of the evidence had only recently come to light and that it buttressed the case for sabotage in a way that has not been disclosed in public. Company officials, however, repeatedly refused to allow themselves to be quoted by name. **********India is suing the Union Carbide Corporation of Danbury, Conn., for $3.3 billion in damages, charging that the plant was badly designed and that its managers were negligent. The plant was run by the company's Indian subsidiary, Union Carbide India Ltd., 50.9 percent of which is owned by the American corporation. Question of Liability **********Union Carbide says that the subsidiary is solely liable for damages, that its plant was well-designed and managed, but that no plant can be protected against employee sabotage. **********''We are 100 percent certain that this accident was caused deliberately,'' said a person close to the company's investigation. ''The problem is that people don't believe our story because it is highly complicated. But when you look at the evidence, you can come to no other conclusion.'' **********The company also maintains that 10 to 15 employees, including three to five supervisors in the Indian subsidiary, are conspiring to cover up details of the case in cooperation with Indian Government investigators. Most of these employees have left Carbide and are working for the state government of Madhya, of which Bhopal is the capital. **********As for who might have sabotaged the plant, Union Carbide representatives say they think they know but are not prepared to identify him yet. A source said suspicions rested on a plant operator on duty that night who was unhappy with a transfer to a separate part of the plant. Confession Might Not Help **********The representatives said they recognized that even a confession would be greeted with skepticism and that the company would have to make its case using documents, logic and evidence, rather than on personal testimony. **********India denies all of the Carbide charges, including any suggestion that it is helping to cover up details of the investigation. **********''The whole talk of sabotage is impossible,'' said an Indian official involved in the case, adding that specific company findings were suspicious because they been raised only recently. He said Union Carbide might be fabricating the evidence. **********India maintains that even if the disaster was caused deliberately, Union Carbide would still be liable for damages. Indian officials say sabotage is enough of a ''foreseeable'' act that the corporation must still be held responsible. Safety Mechanisms at Issue **********India also insists that the plant's safety mechanisms were either poorly designed or not working the night of the gas leak, turning what could have been a minor accident into a catastrophe. In fact, India is hoping to win its damage claim without even proving how the gas leak occurred. **********The lawsuit over the Bhopal disaster has been bogged down in Indian courts since September 1986, when India first filed the claim. **********In Bhopal, thousands of gas victims are receiving Government subsistence help and medical care, but they have not been compensated for lost income or other damages. Experts say it could take years for them to win any major compensation in court. **********India has rejected Union Carbide's offers to settle out of court for $300 million to $350 million. Meanwhile, with the Government suit taking precedence, lawyers representing individuals are still pressing for their right to sue. One Point of Agreement **********The only assumption on which Union Carbide and the Indian Government agree is that the disaster happened when a half ton to a ton of water got into one of three tanks containing methyl isocyanate, a chemical used to make a pesticide known as carbaryl, marketed under the brand name Sevin. **********The water is believed to have started a chemical reaction that raised the temperature and pressure in the tank. That reaction is said to have caused particles of iron from the tank to break off, mix with the chemicals inside, and create a second violent reaction, sending toxic gas past safety devices into the atmosphere. **********Indian Government analysts have concluded that the disaster started when workers were washing some equipment 350 feet away from the tank, and that the water leaked through one or two feeder lines into the tank. Most independent investigations, including one by The New York Times in 1985, reached the same conclusion. **********In making a case for sabotage, the Carbide experts are trying to prove that this could not have been the cause, partly because of evidence that the feeder lines were sealed off and partly because of the pipes' configuration. 'A Theory It Can't Prove' **********''There are only two theories, and the Government is wedded to a theory it can't prove,'' said a person close to the Carbide investigation. ''We can disprove the water-washing theory seven different ways from Sunday.'' **********The company maintains, for example, that when Indian investigators opened the feeder lines to the tank, they were ''bone dry.'' **********A lawyer for the Indian Government said that even so, Carbide could well have tampered with them itself. He said there were other reasons India was certain of the water explanation, but he declined to detail them. **********The Carbide investigators also calculated that given the amount of water flowing in from the washing, it would have taken 12 hours for the 6,000 to 7,000 pounds of water in both the methyl isocyanate tank and the feeder pipes to accumulate, making it impossible for the accident to happen when it did. Water in Only One Tank **********The company investigators are also said to insist there is no physical explanation of why the water leaked into only one of the three tanks. **********The company investigators said there was minor sabotage at the plant before the gas leak. For example, during some labor troubles in 1982, they said, nuts and bolts were thrown into some reactors, and four employees suspected in the incident left the plant. **********The company also says logs had been tampered with before the gas leak to cover up mistakes at the plant. **********The company says that plant employees knew that water mixed with methyl isocyanate would create a solid mixture that would damage the plant. But, it said, no one knew this would also create the reaction with iron particles and that the action would create such havoc. Pressure Gauge Called Key **********According to company sources, among the most significant evidence of sabotage is testimony that Union Carbide says it has about a pressure gauge that was missing the night of the disaster. The gauge was supposed to be on the tank containing methyl isocyanate. **********The company says the missing gauge left an opening through which the water was deliberately put into the tank. The company also says several people recall seeing a water hose near that opening the day after the accident. **********In interviews last year, former plant employees told The New York Times that Union Carbide lawyers had questioned them closely about a hose near the tank, and whether they suspected sabotage. They said they had seen no hose and suspected no one, and accused the company of fabricating the sabotage story. **********But the Carbide investigators maintain that one employee, Sunder Rajan, told them casually in February 1986 -nearly 15 months after the accident -that he had noticed the pressure gauge was missing but had never mentioned it to investigators. **********Carbide maintains he did not think it was important at the time, and that he simply replaced the gauge the morning after the accident. Worker Files a Complaint **********In a statement filed in a Bhopal court, Mr. Rajan accused Indian investigators of trying to intimidate him and make him change his story. **********The company sources also showed what they said were altered logs and documents. They said these were proof that the supervisors and employees at the plant were aware of the start of the accident earlier than they have said. **********The evidence, according to the company, is that initially the employees tried to drain off water from the tank.

But a close analysis suggests that, except for some extreme cases (Bolivia, for example), such relief is not needed and actually would be counterproductive. **********The best single measure of the debt burden is the ratio of interest payments to exports. In part because of the decline of world interest rates, this ratio has fallen from 47 percent to 34 percent since 1982 for non-oil exporting countries in the region. After a setback from lower oil prices last year, the oil exporters should resume their improvement this year. Since 1982, debtor countries have sharply cut their external deficits, reduced their budget deficits and devalued their exchange rates to spur exports. After a severe recession in 1983, the countries re-established positive economic growth, and last year growth in non-oil Latin countries averaged 6.5 percent. **********None of the four key debtor countries - Mexico, Brazil, Argentina or Venezuela - can be described as insolvent and in need of bankruptcy treatment. Brazil's current suspension of bank payments results not from external shock but from internal mismanagement last year. Exports are now recovering and new economic measures taken in June will reduce the budget deficit. Mexico has shown a dramatic external-sector recovery after last year's collapse of oil prices. The banks have just completed a new lending package for Argentina, and Venezuela has large foreign reserves. **********Smaller countries such as Chile that have adopted proper policies have achieved impressive results in growth and exports. Most of the countries in the region can manage their debt and still achieve politically acceptable domestic growth of some 4 to 5 percent annually or higher. **********International economic conditions must of course be adequate for continued progress. A threshold of perhaps 2 1/2 percent annual growth in industrial countries is required for sufficient expansion of debtor-country exports. In addition, a new explosion of interest rates and new trade restrictions in industrial countries must be avoided. Commodity prices have been an area of disappointment, although there are emerging signs that they are recovering, particularly in the metals. The partial recovery of oil from its 1986 low is helping to stabilize conditions for Mexico and other oil exporters. **********Not only is there no immediate need for widespread debt relief, but its long-term benefits are also doubtful. Debt forgiveness is incompatible with improving the debtor country's creditworthiness and returning the country to normal access to international capital markets. Any improved capacity to service reduced debt would tend to be more than offset by the deterioration in creditors' perception of the country's willingness to pay - especially if they thought the country was capable of meeting its obligations while achieving satisfactory growth. Credit reputation is crucial in sovereign borrowing, where physical collateral is absent. **********Forced forgiveness would tend to isolate the country not only from capital markets but also from export markets, because the two go hand in hand. Peru illustrates the point. Its exports and foreign reserves have fallen as foreign banks have cut off trade credit in response to President Alan Garcia's unilateral ceiling on payments, and its favorable growth of last year is unlikely to be sustained. **********SENATOR Bill Bradley has proposed that banks forgive three percentage points annually on both interest and principal - over three years - with agreed policy reform. For Mexico, this program would raise national income by at most one-half percentage point annually during the period. This benefit would seem too small to risk the potentially large long-run costs associated with impairment of creditworthiness. **********Another proposal in Congress would create a new debt entity to buy bank debt at the secondary market price and convey the discount to the countries. If such a program is voluntary, few banks would enlist. If forced on the banks, such mechanisms would severely damage the long-term credit relationship between the banks and the countries. **********It is true that the risk to the international banking system from developing country debt is much lower today than in 1982 because of increased bank capital and the sizable loan-loss reserves set aside after Brazil suspended bank payments in February. The central point, however, is that even judged solely by the debtor country's own interests (especially longer term), arrangements for new borrowing usually will be superior to forced forgiveness of debt. President Miguel de la Madrid reached this conclusion one year ago at the depths of Mexico's crisis. **********The proper policy on debt remains a strengthened Baker Plan, which envisions coordinated resumption of capital flows to the debtor countries in return for policy reform. Renewed capital inflows will be necessary for investment revival and sustained growth, especially as export expansion begins to exhaust idle capacity. The banks must fulfill their part of the Baker Plan, and will come closer to doing so this year with large new lending to Mexico, Argentina and possibly Brazil. The Export-Import Bank should expand lending more rapidly, as a positive way to harness Congressional concerns about export recovery. Lending through the World Bank and the regional banks should rise faster than under Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d's original formulation. **********But the fundamental premise of the Baker Plan remains sound: It is far better for the debtor countries themselves - and for the international financial system - to keep debt management on a track that points back to re-establishment of normal access to capital markets. Forced debt forgiveness would jettison the hard-won progress in that direction that has already been achieved."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/05/business/company-news-orders-fall-4-at-us-factories.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-03-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 483, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ORDERS FALL 4% AT U.S. FACTORIES", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; ORDERS FALL 4% AT U.S. FACTORIES", "body_text": " **********Orders received by American factories in January fell 4 percent, the steepest one-month decline in almost seven years, the Commerce Department reported today.

Minah is an African steeped in the Western traditions of law. **********He trained in law at King's College, London. When he came home to this former British colony, he donned the black robes and white wig of a Sierra Leone solicitor and argued cases in the grand Edwardian-era Law Court Building here. **********Soon, the young lawyer was elected to Parliament, the first step in a political career that led to the nation's second-highest post, First Vice President. Feeling passed over for the presidency, he is said to have resorted earlier this year to a traditional African route to the top - a coup. Prosecutors say that Mr. Minah was the primary instigator of a plot to overthrow the Government, and that other men carried out the specific actions. **********About half of Africa's leaders owe their jobs to coups. Many others, fearing that they will be overthrown, minimize their international travel. The latest coup victim was Jean Baptiste Bagaza of Burundi, who was overthrown while attending a conference in Quebec in September. **********Those who are victorious in their coups rarely divulge their secrets. Those who fail rarely live to tell the tale. **********But hewing to their legal tradition, Sierra Leoneans are putting the coup plotters on trial. The testimony - the A B C's of a coup plot - has captivated this intimate capital on the west coast of Africa - an overgrown town that was the setting for Graham Greene's novel, ''The Heart of the Matter.'' **********The heart of a successful coup is often murder. **********Everyone in town knew that every weekday morning, Sierra Leone's President, Joseph S. Momoh, drove down the Hill Cot Road from his official residence to his office. **********Gabriel T. Kaikai was particularly aware of this fact. The chief of presidential security until Mr. Momoh demoted him last year, Mr. Kaikai is thought to have taken part in the coup by planning the killing of Mr. Momoh. **********Mr. Kaikai's memory appears to have focused on a hairpin turn where cars have to slow down to pass over a bridge. Prosecutors say he selected a weed-choked, red clay bluff as the spot to ambush the presidential motorcade. **********The hairpin turn had another advantage. From there, a fast driver could arrive in five minutes at the broadcast studios of the national radio station -another key element in a successful coup. In African countries, where few people read newspapers, the success or failure of a coup can depend on the impression created on national radio. Prosecutors say Mr. Kaikai spent several hours at home with a tape recorder, polishing his coup speech. ''My dear people, you can safely call this coup as your coup, 'the peoples' coup,' '' his recorded voice was heard to say in the courtroom. **********The plotters were actually limited to a small group of Government employees - largely from Mr. Minah's Pujehun district - who lost influence when Mr. Momoh became President in November 1985, the prosecutors said. **********Without access to the army arsenal, the plotters won backing from Jamil Said Mohamed, who was then the richest man in town, court documents say. Mr. Jamil, who now lives in London, denies any involvement. **********The conspirators' downfall came when they tried to enlist the help of a man whose brother had been dismissed from the army because of a denunciation by Mr. Kaikai. On March 23, the night before they were to act, the police raided Mr. Kaikai's two residences. **********They uncovered large weapons caches, including two AK-47 rifles, one Uzi submachine gun, six cases of bombs, two rocket launchers, 12 cases of ammunition, 19 submachine guns, six rockets and 12 hand grenades. **********The trial of the 18 co-defendants is expected to go to the jury for a verdict in late December. **********''The whole thing is pretty hollow,'' Garvas Betts, one of Mr. Minah's defense lawyers, said.

The demonstration was called to commemorate the 22d anniversary of the founding of Al Fatah, the main guerrilla group operating under the umbrella of the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********Since it is technically against Israeli law to express support for the Palestine Liberation Organization, the demonstration today was highly unusual. It was also something of a challenge to the Israeli authorities, who have been tacitly working with Jordan to erode Mr. Arafat's widespread backing in the West Bank, particularly among educated youth, and to build support for the more conservative King Hussein. Warning From Rabin **********Last week, Mr. Rabin warned the heads of Palestinian universities and colleges that he would not tolerate their schools' becoming centers of Palestinian activity. **********Beginning last month, when Israeli troops killed three Palestinian students who threw stones at them during demonstrations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the tension between the Israeli occupation authorities and Palestinian youths has been steadily increasing. In recent weeks, there have been several confrontations between the Israelis and Palestinians. **********An Israeli Army spokesman announced today that a senior officer had been ordered to investigate allegations that two Israeli officers and eight soldiers had beaten and degraded Palestinian prisoners at the Ansar-2 prison camp outside of Gaza last month. **********The commander of Israel's southern front, Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, dismissed the allegations when they were first brought up last month by Palestinian lawyers. The army spokesman said grounds have now been found for an inquiry. Allegations of Ill Treatment **********The Palestinian prisoners were arrested during a demonstration. One of them, Suhayl Abdel Ata, 21 years old, said at a news conference that he and two colleagues were forced by Israeli soldiers to strip, salute an Israeli officer and then kiss each other's buttocks. Later, he said, the three of them were bound and beaten and given virtually no food for three days. When they requested water they had to drink it from their shoes, he said. **********Last week, Mr. Rabin barred a former Hebron Mayor, Mustafe Natshe, and a Palestinian lawyer, Faiz Abu Rahme of Gaza, from attending an international conference in San Diego on the Arab-Israeli conflict. The two Palestinians are known for their relatively moderate views and had planned to go to the conference with Israeli peace campaigners, such as Abba Eban, a member of Parliament. The conference was called off because of the travel ban, which baffled even many Israelis. **********''There is no escaping the conclusion that Rabin's decision is emblematic of an unnecessary and inexplicable act of oppression,'' wrote Zeev Schiff, the widely respected military editor of the Haaretz newspaper. ''The truth is that in everything regarding the Palestinian issue, Rabin holds extremist positions and follows a zig-zag policy.'' **********In the last two years, the Israeli Government has revived the practice of expelling Palestinians suspected of supporting the P.L.O. No trials are held and lawyers trying to appeal the deportations cannot see most of the evidence against their clients because the information is gathered by security services through covert means and from informers. **********On Monday, Mohammed Dahlan, 26, of the Gaza Strip, was expelled to Jordan after being accused by the Israeli authorities of leading Al Fatah's youth movement. A Palestinian newspaper editor, Akram Haniye, was deported last month, also on charges of being a Fatah organizer. **********Thirty-seven Palestinians have been deported since the practice was reinstituted under the national unity Government in July 1985. The policy was halted by Prime Minister Menachem Begin in 1982. **********Stone-throwing at Israeli cars in the West Bank has also become a daily occurrence in recent weeks. **********The army said today that it was investigating whether an Israeli civilian, whose car was hit with rocks while driving past the Balata refugee district near Nablus on Monday, was responsible for shooting a Palestinian youth from Balata who was taken to a hosptial in Nablus with a gunshot wound. **********Last, month a 12-year-old Palestinian boy from Balata was shot and killed, reportedly by an unidentified Israeli West Bank settler whose car was stoned while driving by the camp.

A bomb damaged the Defense Ministry in Bogota, 16 people were killed one afternoon by feuding emerald-smuggling rings and gunmen of the left and right added several dozen to the estimated 1,200 political killings here so far this year. **********Even for Colombia, a country long accustomed to levels of violence that would be considered intolerable elsewhere, the events of recent weeks have proved too much to ignore. **********The immediate response of many Colombians has been to blame the Government for the breakdown of law and order and to complain that President Virgilio Barco Vargas has failure to provide strong leadership. **********There is also new recognition that, while Colombia is in no imminent danger of being taken over by leftist or rightist extremists, uncontrolled violence is seriously undermining the country's democratic institutions. **********But perhaps most of all, the crisis has exposed a deep sense of powerlessness. Violence affects some regions and social groups more than others, yet not one person can say that he or she really knows what is going on, who is responsible and what should be done. **********''The population is perplexed,'' said Enrique Santos Calderon, a leading newspaper columnist. ''People ask, 'Why is this happening?' and 'Who wants to destabilize the country?' and then they answer according to their intuitions and passions.'' **********Trends nonetheless exist. While at different times this year violence has come principally from leftist guerrillas and narcotics traffickers, there is now strong evidence that extreme rightists are waging a ''dirty war'' against nonviolent leftists. **********The killing of the leader of the leftist Patriotic Union, Jaime Pardo Leal, on Oct. 11 served as the catalyst for the latest soul-searching, but it was in no way an isolated incident. Over the last 18 months, close to 500 other party members have been killed. **********Death threats sent out to a number of priests, academics, lawyers, journalists and artists have in turn spread terror to groups outside the Patriotic Union. Several of those threatened had denounced the rightist campaign. But in other cases, the motive was unclear. **********For many, in fact, the severity of the crisis became apparent only when they learned that many prominent people - among them, the actress Vicki Hernandez, the musician Sergio Acevedo and the journalist Daniel Samper Pizano - had fled the country. **********Yet while the leadership, structure and activities of the country's leftist guerrilla groups are well known, no one has so far been able to identity the members of what is apparently an active and well-organized extreme right. **********There is well-documented evidence of the direct participation of some army officers in rightist death squads. Before he was killed, Mr. Pardo even asked the Attorney General's Office to investigate several officers who, he said, were involved in killings. **********But despite chants at Mr. Pardo's funeral accusing the Defense Minister, Gen. Rafael Samudio Molina, of responsibility for his death, to date there is no proof that the army as an institution has adopted ''dirty war'' tactics. **********The Patriotic Union contends that in many troubled regions, the extreme right includes cattle ranchers, narcotics traffickers and rightist politicians as well as army officers. Yet those who are coordinating what leftists call the ''extermination campaign'' at a national level have not been identified. **********Bernardo Jaramillo Ossa, the 33-year-old lawyer who succeeded Mr. Pardo as head of the Patriotic Union, said the extreme right's objectives at least are clear. ''It wants to drive us out of the political arena, to force us to abandon the democratic struggle, to make us boycott next March's municipal elections,'' he said. ''We're not going to give it that pleasure.'' **********Many politicians in fact specifically link the latest wave of violence to the elections, scheduled for March 13, because for the first time in this country's history mayors will be elected rather than appointed by the central government. Thus, where the Patriotic Union might win, it is coming under attack.  Colombia's Crisis: Not Easily Stereotyped **********While warnings are heard that Colombia is sliding irrevocably toward the kind of chaotic polarization that has convulsed El Salvador in recent years, this country's crisis still somehow escapes easy stereotyping. **********The economy, for example, is growing strongly. The battle lines between left and right are not clearly defined; many conservatives are anxious to dissociate themselves from the extreme right and some leftists are openly critical of guerrilla tactics. And while violence in Central America is mainly political, things are complicated enormously here for many reasons. **********The kidnapping last week of the sculptor, Rodrigo Arenas Betancourt, was a case in point. He was grabbed in Medellin, a city where leftist guerrillas, narcotics traffickers, paramilitary gangs and common criminals all operate with apparent impunity. None took responsibility for the crime. **********There were more than 11,000 killings in Colombia last year, making for a per-capita rate almost five times higher than the rate in the United States. Many killings are attributed to personal vendettas and crimes of passion, particularly since even minor disputes are routinely settled with guns. **********Further, violence has undergone a qualitative change here this decade with the introduction by major cocaine traffickers of the macabre figure of the paid assassin, invariably a young man in his late teens or early 20's who has been specially trained to kill. **********Known locally as ''sicarios,'' or ''assassins,'' these gunmen over the last three years have killed a Justice Minister, some 50 judges and more than a dozen journalists who dared challenge the power of the billionaire drug barons who form the so-called Medellin Cartel. **********Yet since mid-1987, when terrorized judges and politicians finally abandoned efforts to either jail major traffickers or extradite them to the United States, drug-related violence has sharply diminished. **********''The drug bosses now feel relaxed,'' one foreign narcotics expert said. ''They don't need to kill anyone because they have gotten their way. They're exporting more cocaine than ever and there aren't even arrest warrants out for them.''  A Grim Legacy: Mobsters and Justice **********In the process of intimidating society, the drug mobsters have effectively destroyed Colombia's system of justice, which now seems incapable of confronting an array of other criminal or paramilitary groups. **********The mobsters' grim legacy also includes assassins, now underemployed, who will kill for as little as $70 a victim. The Government announced last week that 403 ''sicarios'' had been arrested and another 38 killed in gun battles since 1984, yet others have quickly taken their place. **********One consequence of this insecurity is that many senior officials and politicians now drive in bulletproof cars accompanied by heavily armed guards. The security police force, which is roughly equivalent to the F.B.I., is forced to assign 70 percent of its 2,000 agents to personal protection, and has few available for investigations. **********Only last month, the Minister of Government, Cesar Gaviria, stunned Congress by providing a list of 138 paramilitary groups that are active in the country. **********Some are believed to be gangs of criminals and assassins. Others are so-called self-defense groups formed by cattle ranchers with army encouragement to combat rural guerrillas. A few, such as the Colombian Anti-Communist Association and Death to Revolutionaries, appear to be rightist bands. **********But the list also included groups named Rambo, Terminator, Love for Medellin and the Clean-Up Squad of Cali, which have taken responsibility for killing several hundred homosexuals, transvestites and petty criminals over the last year. **********A recent report from Colombia's Roman Catholic Bishops complained that ''private justice has imposed itself as a generalized method, with armed bands and paramilitary groups operating under the slogan of 'cleaning up society' and escaping the vigilance of authorities, military or civilian.'' **********The culture of violence is deeply ingrained here. Throughout the 19th century and again during a period known as La Violencia between 1948 and 1954, when some 300,000 people died, it pitted Liberals against Conservatives. The two parties made peace in 1958, but then the partisan struggle gave way to ideological warfare as new leftist guerrillas appeared. **********First in the countryside and later also in cities, rebels carried out attacks on police and army units and financed themselves through kidnappings and extortion. The armed forces, in turn, were frequently accused of killing innocent peasants and of torturing suspected guerrillas. **********But after the country had been under a state of siege for more than 30 years, with the suspension of many constitutional rights, a consensus began to emerge that neither side could win a military victory. When he took office in 1982, President Belisario Betancur therefore decided to gamble on negotiations with the rebels. **********''There was extraordinary support for the idea,'' a former Government official recalled. ''Everyone was exhausted by the futility of the violence. Many thought the guerrillas should be given a chance to join democracy.'' **********When cease-fires were finally signed with the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces, or FARC, and three other groups in 1984, they were not required to surrender their weapons. Theoretically at least, the way was opened for them to take part in politics.  Fighting Is Renewed: Charges, Countercharges **********Within a year, however, all but the FARC had resumed guerrilla warfare. The April 19 Movement, or M-19, for example, said the Government had broken its promise to carry out social and economic changes. The Government said the rebels had used the truce to recruit and re-arm. By early 1986, the violence was widespread as ever. **********The FARC, the largest rebel force with some 6,000 men spread over 38 fronts, persevered in the cease-fire. In alliance with the Communist Party, it formed the Patriotic Union, which won 14 seats in Congress - as well as some 300,000 votes - in elections last year. **********Thus, even in an atmosphere of violence, the Patriotic Union demonstrated that political participation was possible. But its very success immediately converted its leaders into targets for assassination, particularly in regions where it expects to do well in municipal elections next March. **********The crisis touched off by Jaime Pardo's killing, therefore, not only focused attention on the murder campaign against the Patriotic Union, but also prompted different political groups to urge the Government to resume the peace process with other guerrilla groups. **********Many politicians of both the left and the right believe that only peace talks can keep Colombia from sliding into a more open civil war. The Roman Catholic Church has offered to mediate, while both the Patriotic Union and the opposition Social Conservative Party have called for negotiations. **********''At the moment, everyone in the country is in favor of a dialogue except the Government,'' said Misael Pastrana Borrero, a former President who now heads the Social Conservative Party. ''But a dialogue without the Government is meaningless.'' **********The Barco administration, however, has insisted that the guerrillas must agree to disarm before negotiations are possible. Further, after the FARC joined five other groups in a new Simon Bolivar Guerrilla Coordinating Committee last month, officials said the rebels were preparing for all-out war.  [ On Wednesday, apparently in response to criticism of the Government's failure to respond to calls for talks, a senior presidential adviser, Carlos Ossa Escobar, traveled to the headquarters of the FARC for the Government's first direct contact with the rebels since last April. It was not immediately known if any progress had been made. ]  Many politicians have blamed the immobility of the Government for the deepening crisis. After only 15 months in office, President Barco's image is that of a weak and indecisive leader who is holed up in the palace and out of touch with the rest of the country. **********A respected former Foreign Minister, Alfredo Vazquez Carrizosa, complained that Colombia had ''an executive branch that doesn't decide, a Congress that doesn't legislate and a judiciary that doesn't apply the law.'' **********Even the Defense Minister, General Samudio, has warned that ''a demented society is leading the country to anarchy and chaos,'' while a former President, Carlos Lleras Restrepo, said he could remember ''no moment of such anguish for Colombia.'' **********For Patriotic Union leaders, however, a primary objective is simply to stay alive. Although the party's new leader is now guarded around the clock, he and others continue to receive death threats. **********''They at least prove we're growing,'' Mr. Jaramillo said. ''If we were weak, no one would bother with us.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/12/business/dow-gains-6.52-on-reduced-volume.html": {"writer_name": "Lawrence de Maria", "pub_date": "1987-06-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 756, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Gains 6.52 on Reduced Volume", "print_headline": "Dow Gains 6.52 on Reduced Volume", "body_text": " **********The stock market continued its leisurely rally yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 6.52 points, to 2,360.13.

This rise, analysts said, confirms the likelihood of more months of restrained business expansion. **********It was the sixth straight advance in the index of leading economic indicators, the longest streak since the period from December 1985 through May 1986. **********''This is generally consistent with continued moderate gross national product growth of about 2 1/2 percent,'' commented Stephen S. Roach, principal senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. But he also noted that much of the July advance reflected higher stock prices and inflation and that therefore the data were ''not a real source of encouragement.'' **********Nonetheless, the Reagan Administration cited the leading index as yet another in a series of mostly favorable recent statistics while asserting that September would mark the 58th straight month of economic growth, tying a modern peacetime record. Administration Comment **********''Reaganomics gets better with age,'' declared Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, at the Western White House. **********Four of the nine indicators available for July accounted for the five-tenths of 1 percent advance. **********The biggest contribution came from a rise in the proportion of companies, to 62 percent from June's 57 percent, reporting slower deliveries from suppliers. This indicator points up production bottlenecks and possible inflationary pressures. **********The other significant contributors to the advance were a second straight sharp increase in stock prices and a rise in the price of various materials that are sensitive to the business cycle. The value of contracts and orders for new plant and equipment showed a negligible increase. **********The three elements that weakened the leading index were a decline in manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials, a decline in building permits and a tiny decline in the M-2 measurement of the nation's money supply. **********Two components - initial claims for state unemployment insurance and the length of the average work week - were unchanged in July. **********The July increase, which was in line with expectations, brought the index to 191.8, or 6.6 percent higher than in July 1986. Revision of June Figure **********Meanwhile, the increase for June was raised today to a full 1 percent from the eight-tenths of 1 percent initially reported, with inventories accounting for the additional strength. This made the June increase the biggest since a jump of 2.1 percent in December. **********Today's report also showed that the index of coincident indicators - those that tend to track current economic activity - climbed five-tenths of 1 percent in July after averaging no change for May and June. **********But the index of lagging indicators fell five-tenths of 1 percent following declines of two-tenths in both May and June. It is the first time this index has fallen three straight months since mid-1983. **********Although declines in the lagging index are not in themselves bullish, such declines do tend to push upward the coincident-lagging ratio, a gauge that many economists consider a useful supplementary predictor. **********The coincident-lagging ratio climbed above 1.3 at the July reading as it registered its third straight advance."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/19/business/falstaff-loses-pricing-case.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 129, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Falstaff Loses Pricing Case", "print_headline": "Falstaff Loses Pricing Case", "body_text": " **********The Falstaff Brewing Corporation was ordered yesterday to pay Best Brands Beverage Inc. nearly $46 million for overcharging the company. **********Falstaff, based in Vancouver, Wash., and its Texas affiliate, the Pearl Brewing Company, violated antitrust law, according to a Federal court jury.

A broad coalition - from the United States Chamber of Commerce and the Sierra Club to the Farm Bureau and the United Automobile Workers - had opposed the provision, as had the Reagan Administration. **********The debate revived many of the energy dependence and independence arguments of the 1970's and the early 1980's. It also touched on the danger to oil supplies posed by the Iran-Iraq war and the resulting attacks on oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. **********Supporters of the provision, led by Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committtee, argued that the proposal would force the White House and Congress to work to develop a national energy policy. Opponents said the proposal was a ''backdoor'' way to impose an oil import fee, which has been rejected overwhelmingly in the Senate the last two years. 'Plasma' of Economy **********''It's a straightforward response to one of the most urgent and important problems facing America today -our dangerous drift toward dependence on OPEC oil,'' Mr. Bentsen said, adding that ''oil is really the plasma of the American economy.'' **********Speaking against the plan, Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, called it ''special-interest legislation at its worst,'' adding: ''It seeks to prop up the domestic oil industry at the expense of everyone else. It's a backdoor way to ram through an oil import fee.'' **********Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, also opposed the Bentsen provision. He argued that most imported oil comes from countries that are not likely to cut off supplies, such as Mexico, Venezuela and Canada.

Among the major proposals still to be debated are a provision requiring notification of employees before plant closings and mandatory retaliation against unfair competition. **********Under the Bentsen proposal, the Administration would have had to set a ceiling of 50 percent or less of total consumption for imported oil. If oil-consumption projections prepared by the Administration showed that this ceiling would be exceeded within a three-year period, the President would have been required to submit to Congress a plan for reducing dependence on imports. **********The legislation did not set out what steps could be taken, but opponents argued that they would most likely be an oil import fee or oil import quotas."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/20/business/busting-into-the-big-leagues.html": {"writer_name": "Alex Jones", "pub_date": "1987-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 4491, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Busting Into the Big Leagues", "print_headline": "Busting Into the Big Leagues", "body_text": " **********LESS than four years ago, William Dean Singleton had no newspapers and no money to speak of - only a yearning to own a newspaper chain. By the end of this year, if all goes according to plan, the newspaper chain the 36-year-old Texan runs will be worth an estimated $1.2 billion, with Mr. Singleton owning roughly one-third of that. **********Though he has been building his chain since 1984, Mr. Singleton marched into newspaper publishing's big league over the last 10 days with the announcements that Media News Group Inc., the umbrella corporation for his privately held group of papers, plans to pay $95 million for The Denver Post and $150 million for The Houston Post. It will add these two major dailies to its chain of nearly 60 newspapers, weeklies and dailies, including The Dallas Times Herald, which it bought last year for $110 million. **********Mr. Singleton either owns, or is committed to buying, 28 dailies and 28 weeklies from Connecticut to California. **********By combining his volcanic entrepreneurial drive and his tough management style with the financial clout of others, Mr. Singleton has now assembled one of the nation's largest newspaper groups. He has come a long way from his days as a poor boy in west Texas who went broke trying to found a newspaper chain when he was in his mid-20's. **********His partners, Richard B. Scudder, a third-generation New Jersey newspaper owner, and Media General, a communications conglomerate based in Richmond, have provided the cash. The only money Mr. Singleton has invested personally is the $200,000 he borrowed from Mr. Scudder in 1983 to start his chain, a loan he says he has not yet bothered to fully repay. **********Mr. Singleton has exhibited a voracious appetite for acquisition and a willingness to pay top dollar for newspapers. With the Houston and Denver papers, Media News, with total circulation of more than 1.3 million, will become the nation's 11th-largest newspaper group, according to Morton Research, which also figured the group's breakup value of $1.2 billion based on annual revenues it estimates at about $600 million. **********A man who works non-stop - a habit that cost him his first marriage - Mr. Singleton has emerged as one of this generation's premier newspaper empire builders. Among the nation's hungriest newspaper entrepreneurs, his biggest rival is Ralph Ingersoll Jr., a man of similar age and driving ambition, whose Princeton-based chain now has 38 dailies and 159 weeklies. Mr. Singleton unabashedly embraces the role of newspaper magnate. ''I want to die and at the funeral have a lot of people stand around and say, 'Dean Singleton built a hell of a newspaper company,' '' he said last week at his corporate headquarters at The Times Herald. He added that he also wants his papers to be good and that he will do all he can to encourage his son, William Dean Singleton Jr., now 18 months old, to run the company after him. **********His reputation of being one of the tightest, toughest managers in newspapers, holds little appeal for him, he said. His nightmare is for his mourners to say, ''God, that Dean Singleton, he sure knew how to make money - he made 40 percent,'' referring to the profit margin sometimes commanded by the smaller, monopoly newspapers that Mr. Singleton owns. **********Journalists and others in the newspaper industry have mixed feelings about Mr. Singleton and the papers that bear his mark. Some argue that he saves jobs by saving the newspapers themselves, and that his publications are as good as their markets allow. Others say his papers are editorially undistinguished and rarely reflect any priority beyond tight management aimed at insuring high profitability. But with his three recent big-daily purchases, Mr. Singleton has in a sense demonstrated that the assurance of big profits is not the only reason he will buy a newspaper. **********At a time when virtually all the big chains shun competitive markets, he is brazenly challenging the belief that it is financial folly to buy the second-ranked newspaper in a two-paper town. His papers in Dallas, Houston and Denver all trail their rivals in circulation and advertising market share, although he says only the last is a money-loser. **********Some newspaper analysts are skeptical that these papers can survive in the long term, arguing that Mr. Singleton is fighting some strong evidence that only one paper can prosper in even the largest cities. They point, for example, to Detroit's two dailies, which are among the nation's 10 largest, and are seeking Government permission to merge all non-editorial departments into a joint operating arrangement because they say they cannot be profitable independently. **********Aggravating the problem for Mr. Singleton is that Dallas, Houston and Denver are all economically depressed because of the flagging energy industry. He must generate cash from these local economies to pay for his papers, since his company has financed most of their combined $355 million purchase price with debt. **********But Mr. Singleton, who sleeps about five hours a night and who went back to work two hours after marrying his second wife, Adrienne Casale, is unperturbed. Though his face is cherubic and his nature personable, he has an enormous confidence in what he calls his ''killer instinct,'' an entrepreneurial drive for success that he strives to instill in his publishers. **********Despite his hope that he will leave a legacy that goes beyond the bottom line, once he runs a paper, his management code dictates that profitability must precede all. It is a lesson, he says, he learned the hard way.  An Entrepreneur at 8 **********Dean Singleton grew up in Graham, Tex., a small town 110 miles west of Dallas, whose fortunes waxed and waned with the price of oil. His father worked the oil rigs as a pumper, and there wasn't much money for the Singletons' five children. **********Mr. Singleton says his father - whom he spoke to almost daily until the older man's death in 1982 - always pushed him and loved to hear about his latest deal, though he wound up living in a different world from that of his son. ''The year he died, he bragged to me that for the first time in his life he'd made $20,000,'' Mr. Singleton said, with a bit of melancholy in his voice. **********Even at a young age, Mr. Singleton, the next-to-youngest in the family, was ''a little hyper,'' said Pat Robinson, his sister and, since last year, his secretary. His instincts were entrepreneurial, his dealmaking talents apparent. **********At 8, he was a chubby little boy who sold mail-order Christmas cards door-to-door. He remembers laboriously drafting a letter to the Cheerful Card Company in Scarsdale, N.Y., to persuade the company to extend him credit. Based on his letter, it did. **********The town of Graham was divided into the rich - cattle barons and old oil money - and the poor. Early on, Mr. Singleton noticed the difference. ''I always admired people who had a little more than I did,'' he said. **********At 14, he took a part-time job at The Graham News, one of the town's two twice-weekly papers. He started in the mailroom, though he was soon covering sports and city hall. **********But the person in town he most admired was Edward B. Harris, publisher of The Graham Leader, the rival weekly. ''He was the man in town because he owned the newspaper,'' Mr. Singleton recalled. **********Often, after finishing his work at The News at 3 A.M. on days of publication, Mr. Singleton would go to The Leader and talk for hours with Mr. Harris about his ambition to own a newspaper someday. (He bought The Leader from Mr. Harris last year.) His friendship with the older man was only the first of many such relationships for Mr. Singleton, who found little in common with his peers and who considers his 74-year-old partner, Mr. Scudder, to be his best friend. **********After three years at three different colleges, when he also worked full time at several newspapers, Mr. Singleton quit school and became a copy editor at The Dallas Morning News, the city's dominant paper and now Mr. Singeton's bitter rival. (See box) While at The Morning News, Mr. Singleton, then 21, was approached by Edwin M. Eakin, who invited him to run a weekly paper he wanted to start in Clarendon, a small town in west Texas. Mr. Eakin and his partner put up the $5,000 to finance the paper, and Mr. Singleton was offered half-ownership for operating it. He accepted, and the first issue of The Clarendon Press was printed in May 1972. **********Mr. Eakin remembers Mr. Singleton as very energetic, but also as a self-promoter. ''He can convince people he can go to the moon,'' he said. **********A few months after starting the Press, Mr. Singleton married a girl from an old Clarendon ranching family who never adjusted to Mr. Singleton's frenzied devotion to work. ''She didn't understand, and I wasn't going to change,'' he said. The couple divorced three years later. **********By then, Mr. Singleton had put Clarendon's other paper out of business, and had acquired a few other small papers, with his partners putting up the money. **********He also embarked on a venture that left him devastated and changed his life. **********In August 1975, with different partners providing the cash, Mr. Singleton tried to revive The Fort Worth Press, an afternoon tabloid that had recently been closed by its owners, Scripps-Howard. **********Mr. Singleton restarted it as a morning broadsheet paper, but by mid-October, the board of directors had ousted him as publisher in favor of his general manager, an older, more experienced man. Three weeks later, on Nov. 5, a date Mr. Singleton cites from memory, the paper closed. ''I had personally signed a lot of bank notes, and had to sell everything I had,'' he said.  Profits Come First **********The experience taught him what he considers to be the fundamental lesson of newspaper publishing: ''While your total dedication may be to the news product and causes you can fight, if you don't have a solid profit base, all else is meaningless.'' **********Feeling a failure, he nonetheless went looking for another paper to buy. He found one in Westfield, Mass., that was losing money. Joseph L. Allbritton, the entrepreneur who then owned The Washington Star and who wanted to acquire more papers, was also interested in the Westfield paper. Over lunch, the two men struck a deal: Mr. Allbritton would buy the newspaper, and Mr. Singleton would run it. **********Soon he was acquiring other papers for Mr. Allbritton. In fact, during the next eight years, Mr. Singleton was the hungry and apt student of Mr. Allbritton, whom he describes as his mentor. ''I worshipped the ground he walked on,'' Mr. Singleton said. ''He was tough, tough as nails, but a gentleman,'' and superb at figuring out creative deals. **********It was during this time that Mr. Singleton, in his late 20's, began to earn a reputation as a henchman for Mr. Allbritton and a union-buster - because, he says, Allbritton Communications acquired unprofitable newspapers that needed severe cuts to become profitable. **********When production unions struck the Allbritton paper in Paterson, N.J., Mr. Singleton immediately replaced union workers, and most of the strikers lost their jobs permanently. **********At The Trenton Times, which Allbritton Communications bought from the Washington Post Company in 1981, he slashed the staff by a third. **********He also created a flap when he dismissed a Times business reporter who, when asked to limit an article about an advertiser to its press release, added unfavorable information about the company. At the time, Mr. Singleton was quoted as saying, ''We don't have a situation where the newsroom is autonomous.'' He denied, however, that advertisers controlled news coverage, and said the reporter was fired for ''insubordination.'' **********Though Mr. Singleton said he sometimes throws up after announcing the layoffs that often have accompanied his proprietorship of a newspaper, he always makes the necessary cuts. **********The cuts at The Trenton Times did not provoke a strike, he added, because the bitter Paterson strike had demonstrated how tough he could be. **********Drastic action was needed at The Times, he said. The money-losing paper ''was a journalistic masterpiece in many ways,'' but too weighty for Trenton and too fat to make money. **********To compete better with the Trentonian - the town's leading paper, owned by Ralph Ingersoll - Mr. Singleton went beyond job cuts, ordering lots of short articles, flashier design and a local focus. He also came up with advertising discount plans to lift revenues. **********The result: As with other papers Mr. Singleton has managed since his Fort Worth debacle, red ink turned to profits. As a lagging paper in a two-paper town, The Trenton Times served as a kind of laboratory for Mr. Singleton, who now faces that situation with his three biggest papers.  A Paper of One's Own **********By 1983, Mr. Singleton was itching to own papers himself, and when Mr. Allbritton declined to make him a partner - ''Joe Allbritton never has partners,'' said Mr. Singleton - he forged an alliance with Mr. Scudder and struck out on his own. Mr. Scudder had been publisher of The Newark News, his family's paper, and had also founded the Garden State Paper Company, a newsprint manufacturing company. **********Characteristically, Mr. Singleton first met Mr. Scudder over a deal: When it was acquired, The Paterson paper owed Garden State for newsprint, and Mr. Scudder threatened to cut the paper off unless the new owners paid the debt. But, Mr. Scudder said, Mr. Singleton persuaded him ''to keep shipping paper, and for every ton shipped, he would pay for one-and-one-third tons.'' Soon the two men had a standing Friday lunch date.  Mr. Scudder, who had sold his paper and paper company to Media General in 1970 - though he continued to manage them for a while - had some cash. And in late 1983, he and Mr. Singleton formed Gloucester County Times Inc. and acquired The Gloucester County Times, a daily in Woodbury, N.J., with a circulation of about 26,000. **********Mr. Scudder lent the new company $2.5 million, and put up $300,000 for his 60 percent equity of the company. He also lent Mr. Singleton the $200,000 he needed to acquire his 40 percent stake. Neither man has ever had to put any more personal money into the business, according to Mr. Scudder. **********The company borrowed the rest of the $10.5 million for The Times from Rhode Island Hospital Trust, a Providence bank later acquired by the Bank of Boston. The two banks have remained the principal lenders to the chain. **********Mr. Singleton quickly demonstrated that he could run his own daily. ''In two years, The Gloucester Times tripled its cash flow,'' to about $2.5 million, Mr. Scudder said. The new partnership also quickly acquired several other papers, all with money from friendly bankers. **********Along the way, Mr. Singleton married a second time, and though he wedged the ceremony between deals, he says he loves his understanding wife, his child and his business equally, which he considers the highest accolade. **********By this time, Mr. Singleton and Mr. Scudder realized that, even with good profits, their credit would not be great enough to build the major chain of which Mr. Singleton dreamed. **********So in 1985 they created another company, Garden State Newspapers Inc., with Media General as a partner. Media General agreed to provide all the cash for down payments on newspaper acquisitions - usually 20 to 30 percent of the purchase price - in exchange of 40 percent of the ownership of the papers. Mr. Scudder and Mr. Singleton equally divided the remaining 60 percent. **********They also formed Media News, an operating company that managed all of the papers, with Mr. Scudder as chairman of all three corporations and Mr. Singleton as president. **********With Media General's financial power behind him, Mr. Singleton began buying papers furiously. In 1986, he acquired 35 dailies and non-dailies, many of them from Harte-Hanks Communications, a media conglomerate. In fact, he has acquired most of his papers from other chains. **********But it was with the purchase of The Times Herald in September 1986 that Mr. Singleton began to be recognized as a significant player among newspaper entrepreneurs. **********When he acquired The Times Herald from the Los Angeles-based Times Mirror Company, the paper had become unprofitable after years of a bruising and expensive newspaper war. Media General, which has first refusal on all of Mr. Singleton's acquisitions, decided not to be a partner in this one because, as a public company under pressure to keep earnings at a maximum, it felt the No. 2 paper in Dallas was too risky. **********Instead, Mr. Scudder and Mr. Singleton bought the paper through Gloucester County Times, their other partnership. Of the $110 million purchase price, Gloucester County put up $20 million in cash and borrowed $30 million from banks. Times Mirror, the seller, financed the remaining $60 million, with no interest or principal to be paid for four years, according to a source close to the transaction who asked not to be identified. **********Times Mirror agreed to similarly generous terms in its agreement to sell The Denver Post for $95 million, but this time Media General was a partner. **********Media General provided $25 million to Garden State, to be used for the down payment, with Times Mirror financing the rest. John Morton, of Morton Research, characterized the deal as very good for Mr. Singleton, because he will be getting a $56 million plant, 45 acres of land near Denver and highly favorable financing terms from Times Mirror. The terms are so good, he says, that he estimates the low-cost loan effectively lowers the price by about $25 million. **********Media General will have an option on 40 percent ownership for its $25 million. Mr. Singleton said that about $20 million more would be needed to acquire presses, and that the money would come from Garden State's earnings. **********Mr. Scudder and Mr. Singleton will acquire The Houston Post from the Toronto Sun Publishing Company through Gloucester Times, financing nearly all of the $150 million price with bank debt - Mr. Singleton says he has never had to use high-yield, high-risk junk bonds to raise money.  'Warm and Fuzzy' **********The Toronto Sun had sought bids for The Post, and accepted Mr. Singleton's proposal. His proposal did not offer the most ready cash - instead, Mr. Singleton agreed to pay the Post's owners a sum equivalent to 1.25 times the increase in annual revenues in 1992 over that of 1987. **********''Pretty creative, wasn't it?'' Mr. Singleton said, with the delight of a man who acknowledges that dealmaking makes his heart jump. **********Even with the new acquisitions, Mr. Singleton says there is more than enough money to pay the interest on the loans. Mr. Morton estimates that Media News's annual cash flow, the money available to pay down the debt, is between $80 million and $90 million. Mr. Singleton says that the company's cash flow-to-debt ratio will remain near its present level of between 5:1 and 6:1. But Mr. Singleton still has to make his No. 2 papers successful. In Dallas, he commissioned a survey - which he plans to do in Houston and Denver - and decided that The Times Herald was too much like The Morning News, the city's newspaper of record. **********Mr. Singleton also hired David Burgin, a man respected for journalistic creativity and reknowned for a volatile nature. Mr. Burgin had been Mr. Singleton's editor in Paterson before going on to larger papers. Mr. Singleton once fired him in Paterson, after an argument in which Mr. Singleton insisted that a story on the Middle East did not belong on the front page. He said, ''Damn it, we don't sell any papers in Cairo,'' Mr. Burgin recalled. Mr. Singleton quickly rehired Mr. Burgin. **********Mr. Singleton still gives strong policy guidance, though he said he does not interfere with day-to-day decisions. Though he sits on The Times Herald's editorial board, he has one vote, and yields to the majority, even in political endorsements when his more conservative choices are sometimes overruled. **********At Mr. Singleton's direction, Mr. Burgin said, the new Times Herald has tried to become ''more warm and fuzzy'' with a ''heavy dose of stories that are emotional, practical, and analytical.'' Mr. Burgin's first move was to frame the nameplate on page one with flags of Texas and the United States. He also added a cheery ''Good Morning'' to the front page. **********Mr. Singleton cut the news staff to about 250 from 320, and eliminated bureaus in El Paso, Tyler, and Lubbock, as well as New York. The Sunday magazine also went, along with expensive weekly fashion and society sections that were printed on high-quality newsprint. **********As a result of these and other economies, Mr. Singleton says, The Times Herald is once again making a profit. Its coverage, he claims, now suits all but the most upscale reader better than before. While staff members say the breadth of coverage may have suffered, the paper competes with a sort of guerrilla journalism, with scoops that editors at the more conservative Morning News say they find questionable in some cases. For instance, when the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation began their investigation of fraud and corruption in thrift institutions in Texas last month, The Times Herald published the names of all those subpoenaed. **********But The Times Herald still dramatically trails The Morning News in advertising and circulation, and such gaps in other cities have led to dizzying declines for the weaker paper. **********At The Houston Post, which is profitable, Mr. Singleton has the advantage of having a sophisticated printing facility and the morning slot, although his rival, The Houston Chronicle, has a commanding advertising and circulation lead. The Post is also far leaner than The Times Herald, giving Mr. Singleton less room to cut expenses. **********The Denver Post leads The Rocky Mountain News in Sunday circulation, but trails during the week. The two papers are also quite close in advertising share, but The Post is losing money. Mr. Singleton says that, despite recent layoffs by Times Mirror there, he still thinks the paper has room for significant economies. **********To Mr. Singleton, the Dallas, Houston, and Denver acquisitions make sense because the markets have traditionally been dynamic. He is confident they will be so again. And, he says, none has significant competition from suburban papers, which makes more room for two papers.  Joining the Club **********As Mr. Singleton surveys the future, he sees a growing - but not a public - company. He says he has no intention of taking his company public, given the attendant pressure for high earnings every quarter and the scrutiny of analysts. **********Mr. Singleton now is molding himself to fit comfortably in the courtly, small world of newspaper publishing, which is often compared to a gentleman's club. **********His goal, says this toweringly ambitious and competitive man, is to behave like a gentleman. For instance, even though his partners need him more than he needs them now, he says, he will not seek to alter the arrangement to his advantage. **********Even being the No. 1 paper in Dallas, Houston and Denver, while nice, is not essential. ''I'm not going to hang my head if I'm a strong No. 2,'' he said.  TAKING CIRCULATIONTO COURT **********IN Dallas, the rivalry between The Times Herald and The Dallas Morning News has long been fierce. Now it has turned ugly. **********In November 1986, two months after Dean Singleton took over The Times Herald, he filed suit in Federal court against The Morning News, charging it with fraudulently padding its circulation records and seeking damages for advertising lost because of the alleged misrepresentations. **********''I've never seen the arrogance of it,'' said Mr. Singleton of The Morning News and the A.H. Belo Company, its parent. **********Soon after, The Morning News filed a countersuit, charging similar circulation fraud by The Times Herald, and branding Mr. Singleton's lawsuit a gimmick to discredit The News and gain market advantage. Both papers have denied wrongdoing. The Morning News has shown steady circulation gains in recent years, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Mr. Singleton has also sued the A.B.C., charging that the bureau, aware of Morning News circulation irregularities, did not stop the paper from publishing those figures. **********According to Mr. Singleton, the dispute began when Morning News circulation employees approached the Times Herald, claiming they were disturbed by circulation irregularities at their newspaper. Mr. Singleton instructed his law firm, Baker & Hostetler of Cleveland, to investigate and its report - citing allegations of inflated circulation numbers - was presented to the A.B.C. **********The Times Herald reported some of those allegations on its front page in October, prompting an investigation by Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox. He eventually served notice on The Morning News that he was considering bringing charges of deceptive trade practices against the paper, which Morning News executives branded political opportunism. Mr. Mattox's action now awaits an audit of both papers by the A.B.C., expected by Christmas. **********Last month, The Times Herald charged a junior Morning News circulation manager with perjury in depositions for the Federal suits. The Morning News has reprimanded the circulation manager, but Morning News executive vice president Jeremy Halbreich said the incident was ''absolutely not representative of a pattern.'' **********''Our circulation numbers are very solid and will hold up under anyone's scrutiny,'' he said. **********Unaudited publishers' reports issued by the A.B.C. for the six months ended September 1986 claimed the Morning News had a daily circulation of 391,000 and 531,000 on Sundays; The Times Herald had daily circulation of 246,000 and 339,000 on Sundays."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/20/business/kaiser-shows-smaller-loss.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-01-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 198, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kaiser Shows Smaller Loss", "print_headline": "Kaiser Shows Smaller Loss", "body_text": " **********The Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation said today that it lost $18.3 million in the fourth quarter, coming back from a $107.8 million deficit a year earlier. **********The latest net loss included an after-tax loss from continuing operations of $38.9 million, and $20.6 million in net income from discontinued lines.

The select committee was given the authority to make public whatever parts of the Intelligence Committee report it felt should be disclosed in the ''public interest.'' Damage to Presidency Feared **********The actions today left open the question of whether the Congressional investigations, which are expected to take most of the year, would be conducted in a bipartisan fashion. **********The four senators who voted against the creation of the select committee were Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Chic Hecht of Nevada and Gordon J. Humphrey of New Hampshire, all Republicans, and Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, a Democrat. **********The three Republicans argued that an extended investigation would be damaging to the Presidency and to American foreign policy. Senator Hollings contended that the entire matter could be cleared up without an investigation if President Reagan would come forward and tell all he knew. **********The agreement on the scope of the special prosecutor's inquiry was reached today at a meeting between Mr. Walsh and senior Justice Department officials. 'He Was Shown the Store' **********Reagan Administration officials said that the officials, including Associate Attorney General Stephen S. Trott, told Mr. Walsh that they would turn over any Justice Department investigation involving Iran arms smuggling, support for the contras, or both. **********''Everything was made available to him,'' one Federal law-enforcement official said. ''Anything he wants, he gets. He was shown the store and told he can take anything off the shelf that he wants.'' **********In a court order announcing his appointment, Mr. Walsh, a former Deputy Attorney General, was given power to investigate not only the links between Iran arms sales and the contras, but also any illegal financing for the contras since 1984. **********As a result, Government officials have said that Mr. Walsh was expected to take over at least three Justice Department investigations involving contra financing, including a year-old inquiry now being handled by the United States Attorney's office in Miami. **********Senator Dole, a likely candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, appeared eager today to dispel any notion that he might be trying to exonerate President Reagan prematurely in the Iran-contra affair. Bipartisan Effort Needed **********''It is necessary that we start off on a totally nonpartisan, bipartisan basis,'' the Kansas Senator said in his opening remarks to the Senate as the new Congress convened. **********On the other hand, Mr. Dole said, a good deal of information is already available to Congress because of the Intelligence Committee's investigation. ''The President of the United States,'' he added, ''is entitled to have that made public at the earliest possible date.'' **********''We may never have all the facts,'' Mr. Dole said. At the same time, Senator Dole said the Iran affair should not dominate the new Congress. ''There are too many other problems, domestic and foreign, that are not going to go away,'' he said. ''They cannot, and should not, be swept aside because of an obsession with the Iranian affair.'' **********At Senator Dole's suggestion, the target date for completion of the Senate investigation was moved forward to Aug. 1 from Oct. 30. But procedures were aproved that would allow the Senate to vote later to extend the investigation until the end of October. Restoring Public Trust **********Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the Democratic leader, also attempted to put forth a bipartisan air. **********In his opening statement to the Senate, Senator Byrd said that ''the Iran misadventure has hurt the Presidency,'' and he added, ''Our first duty in this new Congress is the restoration of public trust in the formulation of American foreign policy.'' **********Mr. Byrd went on to say he had ''every faith'' that the Senate investigation would be conducted ''in a statesmanlike and bipartisan fashion.'' **********Mr. Byrd said he objected to making public the Intelligence Committee's findings now because that panel's report was ''filled with gaps'' and had been ''sanitized'' by the White House. **********He said that ''as of now'' he knew of no evidence that President Reagan had broken any law. But he added, ''Nobody is served by making available to the public part of the record.'' 'Devastating Effect' Is Seen **********One of the Republicans who opposed creation of the committee, Senator Hecht, said it would allow the controversy to ''drag on and on and on into the next year.'' **********That, Mr. Hecht said, would have a ''devastating effect on present and future intelligence operations around the world.'' **********But most senators who spoke today expressed confidence in Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, who was named chairman, and Senator Warren B. Rudman, Republican of New Hampshire, the vice chairman. **********Mr. Inouye promised a careful investigation today and said he had reached an arrangement with the chairman of the House select committee, Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, to share information and avoid a ''situation where each side is trying to outdo the other, rushing for headlines.'' **********The two panels, he said, will alternate hearings, with one committee in session one week and the other holding hearings the next. The hearings may begin as soon as next month. **********For his part, Senator Rudman also promised a ''fair, thorough, bipartisan, careful inquiry.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/22/business/fed-nominee-confirmed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 42, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fed Nominee Confirmed", "print_headline": "Fed Nominee Confirmed", "body_text": " **********The Senate has confirmed Edward Kelley as a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, succeeding Emmett Rice, who resigned."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/01/business/dow-drops-76.93-points-to-1833.55.html": {"writer_name": "Lawrence de Maria", "pub_date": "1987-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1210, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Drops 76.93 Points, To 1,833.55", "print_headline": "Dow Drops 76.93 Points, To 1,833.55", "body_text": " **********Stock prices plunged yesterday amid continuing concern over the apparently unbridled fall in the dollar. **********The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 76.93 points, to 1,833.55, or 4.03 percent. While that was the Dow's eighth-biggest point loss ever, it represented a slight comeback from midsession, when the Dow was off by more than 110 points. **********At that time, when the Dow fell briefly below 1,800, traders began recalling other recent Mondays, particularly Oct. 19, when the Dow plunged an unprecedented 508 points, and Oct. 26, when it fell 156.83. Treasury Securities Bought **********With yesterday's drop, the Dow lost 159.98 points for November. The 30-stock blue-chip index now stands 888.87 points, or 32.6 percent, below its record high of 2,722.42 reached last Aug. 25. And the Dow is just 94.81 points above the Oct. 19 closing level of 1,738.74. **********As stock prices tumbled yesterday, worried investors flocked into fixed-income investments, pushing up the price of Treasury securities, especially short-term issues, in a ''flight to quality.''  [ Page D19. ]  Gold prices also rose, to their highest levels since 1983, as many investors also scurried into that traditional safe haven. But while many gold and silver mining issues at first bucked the Wall Street trend, they, too, were sold off in the general rout of stocks. **********''Nobody wanted stocks at all,'' said Bernard Spilko, managing director of Bank Julius Baer. **********Yesterday's stock selloff was broad, particularly in the early going. Traders in New York got little comfort from the Asian stock markets, which closed sharply lower before Wall Street opened. At one point on the New York Stock Exchange, 25 stocks were down for every advancing issue. Not one Dow stock managed a gain. No Panic Selling **********But despite the inevitable comparisons, there was none of the panic selling that characterized some recent Mondays. Trading was heavy, especially when compared with the moribund level of late last week, when many traders and investors took off Wednesday and Friday to stretch out the Thanksgiving holiday. **********While a hefty 268.9 million shares changed hands on the Big Board yesterday, that figure was misleading. More than 61 million shares of that volume was in only five utility stocks - Ohio Edison, Texas Utilities, Union Electric, Detroit Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric. Those stocks were traded by big institutions as part of specialized strategies designed to capture dividends. **********Some market experts said that a bad day for Wall Street was probably inevitable yesterday. Indeed, many analysts said on Friday that it was a strong possibility, citing the inflation concerns raised by recent rises in commodity prices and the uncertainty generated by a falling dollar. **********So when the dollar fell in European and United States trading, after plummeting to a new low in Tokyo, stock traders in New York braced themselves. **********Mr. Spilko, whose bank is the securities arm of the big Swiss banking house, said, ''You need to have a stable dollar.'' He said that foreign investors, particularly the Japanese, were loath to buy stocks in the United States while the dollar eroded, making their investments worth less after currency translation. Confidence Erodes **********The Federal budget-cutting accord reached recently in Washington between the White House and Congress had firmed the dollar somewhat. But market experts said that the confidence of the currency and stock markets started to erode last week with the realization that it might be some time before Congress voted on the package. **********Noting that many foreign investors had lost heavily during the dollar's slide, Mr. Spilko said: ''And now we're asking them to invest more. Who would put money up?'' ''I feel that there will be a stable dollar,'' Mr. Spilko said. ''I feel that confidence will be restored.'' But he added that Wall Street might be in ''for a tough couple of days'' because yesterday's selling might precipitate a new round of margin selling and mutual fund redemptions. Moreover, he added, the Dow's performance yesterday was ''psychologically disappointing.'' **********In Asian markets, stocks sagged badly yesterday. On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei index of 225 blue-chip stocks fell 365.45 points, to 22,686.78, and in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell 55.79 points yesterday, to 2,138.39. In Tokyo, traders said that, while the loss itself was not so large, the fact that stock volume was comparatively light indicated bearish sentiment. Program Trading a Factor **********The Dow's latest rout was worsened by program trading in the morning. When brokers noted that stock index futures contracts opened the day at wide discounts to cash stock prices, they predicted the Dow would drop 50 points, which turned out to be conservative. Program traders bought the ''undervalued'' futures and sold actual stocks to lock in so-called riskless profits. **********''There was a continuation from Friday, when discounts widened,'' said Donald M. Selkin, head of stock index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities. ''The programs came late Friday and early today.'' **********Program trading, in which arbitragers and others try to profit from unusual disparities that arise between the value of stocks and the value of the futures contracts that are tied to certain stock indexes, was temporarily banned after the big stock selloffs that started on Oct. 19. But now they are unrestricted. ''I don't know if that's what the market needs,'' Mr. Selkin stated. **********Stock prices fell sharply in the over-the-counter market, although a late rally there trimmed most 3- and 4-point losses to only 1 or 2 points. **********''The whole market is beat up, across the board,'' one O-T-C trader said in midsession. ''The rest of the world doesn't think we're serious about budget cutting.'' **********Some analysts said they were concerned by certain technical indications in the stock market. For example, last week the stock market broke with tradition and closed sharply lower on the day after Thansgiving -breaking a 22-year string of gains. **********And the 33.29-point drop in the Dow transportation average yesterday, to 695.14, was seen by some as a sign that the cyclical rail and air stocks were ''predicting'' a recession. Big Board Composite Off 5.47 **********On the Big Board yesterday, the composite index fell 5.47 points, to 129.69, and the S.&P. 500-stock index dropped 10.04, to 230.30. At the close, 1,576 stocks were down, and only 201 up. **********Among the blue chips, I.B.M. lost 4 1/8, to 110 3/4; Digital 6 1/2, to 119; Merck 5 1/2, to 170; General Motors 2 1/8, to 56 3/8; Du Pont 3 3/8, to 78 1/8, and Phelps Dodge 4 7/8, to 40. Elsewhere, CBS lost 9, to 155 3/8.  Brokerage stocks were very weak. Merrill Lynch lost 2, to 20 1/2.  Even Paine Webber Group fell 2 1/8, to 16 1/2, despite the company's announcement that it had agreed to sell an equity stake of up to 25 percent to Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance, one of Japan's biggest life insurance concerns. **********The Nasdaq composite index of O-T-C stocks fell 11.31, to 305.16, and the American Stock Exchange's market-value index declined 8.58, to 242.39."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/17/world/new-attitude-of-arabs-a-challenge-eban-says.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1987-11-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 651, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Attitude of Arabs a Challenge, Eban Says", "print_headline": "New Attitude of Arabs a Challenge, Eban Says", "body_text": " **********Abba Eban, the former Foreign Minister, says Israel is failing to understand, or take advantage of, a revolutionary change in the Arab world. **********In an interview today on the eve of the 10th anniversary of Anwar el-Sadat's visit to Jerusalem, Mr. Eban asserted that it was a ''tragedy'' that at a time when the Arab world appears increasingly willing to come to terms with Israel, a deadlocked national unity Government is keeping the country from recognizing or exploiting the opportunity. **********''We have gotten so used to the idea that the Arabs were immobilized and frozen in their antipathy to Israel that when they do finally change we do not know how to take 'yes' for an answer,'' said Mr. Eban, a member of the Labor Party and chairman of the Parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee. Restoration of Relations **********Mr. Eban pointed to the Arab League summit meeting last week in Amman as the best indication yet that the Arabs ''may be on their way to changing their struggle with Israel from one about legitimacy to a pragmatic argument about interests and territory.'' The meeting, he said, cleared the way for a restoration of relations between Arab countries and an Egyptian Government that has diplomatic relations with Israel and approved the idea of an international Middle East peace conference. **********The Arab summit meeting resolutions were also important symbolically, said Mr. Eban, because they referred to the ''Arab-Israel'' conflict, using the sovereign term for Israel and not the old language of ''Zionist entity.'' They also placed the threat from Israel as secondary to that from Iran. **********''All of this does not mean the Arab-Israel conflict will be easy to solve, but it does mean that there is an opportunity,'' Mr. Eban added. ''We should look at Sadat's visit to Israel a decade ago as the beginning of something and the Amman summit meeting as the continuation of it.'' Israelis Misread Arabs **********As examples of an Israeli failure to read changes in the Arab world, he cited Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's rejection of an international peace conference, and the insistence of other ministers that Israel should support Iran in the gulf war because the Khomeini revolution is only ''temporary.'' **********''The notion that Khomeini is a passing episode is nonsense,'' Mr. Eban said. ''Those who have studied the history of Iran would be more inclined to believe that it was the Shah's regime which was the passing episode.'' **********Mr. Eban argued that Israel's support for the Maronite Catholics in Lebanon, its decision to sell arms to the so-called pro-Western ''moderates'' in Iran and its ability to ignore the meaning of the Amman Arab summit meeting, which most Israeli officials did, are all rooted in the same outlook. **********Israel, he explained, has historically lived in a very isolated state from its immediate neighbors. He said it made Israelis very vulnerable to offers from anyone in this hostile neighborhood who ''winked'' at them, such as the Maronites or the so-called moderates in Iran. He said that when the Iranians or Maronites approached Israeli officials and said that with a little Israeli help they could reverse the tide of history in their respective countries, and make them more pro-Israeli, normally savvy and sober Israelis bought it. **********The isolation, he continued, has also prompted Israel to look for friends outside its immediate neighborhood to the non-Arab and sometimes non-Moslem nations on the periphery of the Middle East, such as Iran, Ethiopia and Turkey. **********''The result was an Israeli tendency to say that in any confrontation between an Arab and a non-Arab, we must support the non-Arab,'' Mr. Eban said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/06/business/advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1987-05-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 42, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; People", "body_text": " *********** Ronald Lawner has been named executive vice president at HBM/ Creamer, Boston. *********** Christine A.

Investment, the key to a sustained recovery, was also climbing. **********Today, financial markets reopened for the first time after a military rebellion Friday - a revolt that had followed a leftist-inspired general strike two days earlier. And it was evident that much of what the administration of President Corazon C. Aquino had achieved was thrown into confusion. **********Economic growth is crucial to the political stability of the Philippines. This is particularly true in rural areas, where the Communist New People's Army looks for recruits, and where Government-sponsored development programs had just begun to work. Too Early to Judge **********Diplomats, economists and Government officials say it is too early to make a judgment on the long-term economic effects of the latest attempted coup, led by a disgruntled colonel with few if any apparent policies of his own beyond an aversion to politics and a preference for military rule. **********''I am still bullish,'' Jose Concepcion, Minister of Trade and Industry, said today in an interview. ''There might be a temporary review of the situation by some investors. But the President has certainly sent a clear signal not only to foreign investors but also to domestic businesses, and to the army, that she is Commander in Chief.'' **********He told a tale of a Australian investment team who happened to arrive in the southern city of Davao when the radio station was blown up and then made it into Manila in time for the street battles Friday. After all that, he said, they turned up in his office asking how they could speed up their proposed deal. **********But today, stocks that had risen on aggregate by 4 to 5 percent in value last week dropped across the board on the Manila and Makati stock exchanges by 3.9 percent, nearly erasing the recent gains. G.N.P. Prediction Lowered **********Effects on investment and economic growth will take more time to measure, although hopes of 6.5 percent increase in gross national product this year are already being scaled back to about 5.8 percent, The Business Chronicle, a Manila newspaper, reported today. **********Investment, foreign and domestic, is considered by many to be the key factor in determining whether the Philippines can hold on to the place it was beginning to achieve among the faster-growing countries of Southeast Asia. **********Foreign economic analysts point out that the growth rate reached by Manila in the first six months of this year puts it in a league with Singapore and Thailand, and ahead of Malaysia and Indonesia. Those countries are all partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. **********The construction industry has boomed, with cement plants running at capacity and imports required for the first time in many years. The city of Manila has begun to take on a slightly more upbeat air, as long-delayed improvements are made. Several Rural Projects **********In the countryside, diplomats say, Government-sponsored work projects have created jobs while building needed roads, bridges and other structures that enhance rural life. **********Mr. Concepcion said that People's Economic Councils were beginning to operate at the province level, advising the national Government of local needs. Small industries were beginning to be established. **********Diplomats and foreign economic analysts say that rising commodity prices have also contributed to improved conditions, often measured here by increased consumer demand. **********For instance, the price of copra, dried coconut meat, has doubled in the last year, with most of the profit going to farmers, a diplomat said. Under President Ferdinand E. Marcos, crony monopolies would have reaped the rewards, many here say. Major Problems Remain **********There are still major problems facing the rural economy, however. With land redistribution now bogged down in Congress, farmers are finding that agricultural development loans have dried up, as banks anticipate the breakup of holdings larger than 15 or 20 acres. **********Despite record foreign and domestic investment figures for July - an increase of more than 1,000 percent from the year before, Mr. Concepcion says - cash is not flowing into rural or urban areas at the rate economists had hoped. The economic revivial has been almost entirely fueled by consumer demand. **********To further complicate the outlook, there have been calls in the newly elected legislature for a selective repudiation of the Philippines' international debt, now about $27 billion. **********But trends are positive in industrial centers, Mr. Concepcion said, with the 40 percent plant utilization of a year ago increased to 90 percent or more now. He said the textile industry, with plants going seven days a week, could absorb a billion dollars in investment at this point. Toys and electronics are also growing sectors, he said. Some Existing Benefits **********The Philippines, if finally free of political tensions, could benefit from several factors, officials and foreign economists say.

Instead, he said, he hoped that ''a definitive and lasting solution'' to Brazil's debt problems would emerge from negotiations with creditor banks, which are expected to begin next month in New York. **********''We want to negotiate a formula to meet our obligations without compromising our development,'' he said, ''a formula that avoids the political instability that will inevitably follow a new recession, unemployment or social crisis.'' Open-Ended Moratorium **********Brazilian officials said that Mr. Sarney had originally planned to announce a suspension of interest payments for 90 days but that he was persuaded by his financial advisers to make it open-ended. The suspension will presumably last until coming negotiations with commercial banks are completed. **********The action by the largest debtor in the developing world seemed certain to create worry in banking circles. Of a total foreign debt of $108 billion, Brazil owes about $81 billion to private banks, including $24 billion to American banks, led by Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and Bank of America. **********The buildup of the crisis within a few weeks has taken bankers and Brazilians by surprise. Bank stocks fell in New York today, but bankers acknowledged that Brazil had little choice but to halt the interest payments. They said the nation needs to undertake fundamental economic changes. (Page 33.) At current interest rates, American commercial creditors would normally receive about $500 million from Brazil each quarter. If the suspension of interest payments extends beyond 90 days, it would hurt banks' quarterly earnings because banks in the United States would then be required by law to account for the payments that are overdue. **********In the last four years, banks have grown accustomed to almost continuous restructurings of the debts of Latin American nations, but Brazil's problems are causing particular worry, not only because they involve such an important debtor but also because any special deal worked out with Brazil could serve as a precedent in other negotiations. **********Nonetheless, the banking community is less vulnerable today to a debt crisis than it was when the region's problems began with Mexico in August 1982. Since then, many American and European banks have taken measures, such as increasing their capital and making reserve provisions, to protect themselves against suspension of interest payments and even an outright default by any single debtor nation. Healthy Trade Surplus **********Brazil, which has paid no principal on its commercial debt since the country's last financial storm in 1982 and 1983, appeared to have resumed its traditional dynamic growth rates in 1985 and 1986. A healthy trade surplus more than covered annual interest payments of between $9 billion and $11 billion. Both local officials and foreign bankers had predicted that Brazil would soon resume normal borrowing operations. **********But a price freeze imposed last February increased purchasing power and stimulated an unprecedented boom in consumer spending. Consequently, exports slumped and imports rose. The country's foreign exchange reserves then tumbled, bringing on the debt crisis. **********From monthly trade surpluses of more than $1 billion in mid-1986, the surplus fell to just $129 million in January this year, the lowest in four years. Similarly, in barely 12 months, reserves dropped from $11 billion to less than $4 billion. Inflation has also soared again in the last three months and is now running at an annual rate of more than 700 percent. $3.96 Billion in Reserves Tonight, President Sarney said he acted to protect Brazil's reserves, but dismissing rumors that they were close to zero, he disclosed that they stood today at $3.96 billion, enough to cover imports for several months. ''For reasons of sovereignty and national security, our reserves have to be preserved,'' he said. **********Brazil is known to want both new credits and a reduction of its current payments, but the details of its negotiating position are reportedly incomplete. The Finance Minister, Dilson Funaro, is expected to present the Government's proposals at a meeting with a 14-bank advisory committee representing about 600 creditors in the first week of March in New York. **********Tonight, Mr. Sarney noted that the country's political and military leaders had unanimously endorsed his measures, and he said it was the moment for ''responsible patriotism.'' He added, ''We need to negotiate with the authority of a sovereign country and a Government supported by the people.'' **********But he also promised that domestic austerity measures would be taken to complement the external action. He pledged that for the next six months, the Government would spend only as much as it received, that state companies would not invest more than their revenues and that the whole range of subsidies would be reviewed. He once again emphasized that the program would be aimed at maintaining growth and employment. **********Since March 1985, when he became Brazil's first civilian President in more than two decades, Mr. Sarney has committed himself to a strategy of economic growth, and he has consistently pledged that the Brazilian economy would not fall into recession. The country's majority party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement, has warned that it would not endorse any cutbacks in social spending. **********While Mr. Sarney's announcement seemed aimed at stirring nationalistic feelings, it was criticized by opposition leaders of the right and left. 'Incompetence and Imprudence' **********Senator Roberto Campos, Planning Minister under the former military regime, lamented Brazil's unilateral move, which, he said, was the result of ''management incompetence and imprudence.'' Noting that world interest rates as well as Brazil's oil import bill fell last year, he added, ''There was no external factor to justify Brazil's insolvency.'' **********The prominent labor leader, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, whose Workers Party has frequently called for a total halt to Brazil's debt payments, was also critical. ''A moratorium works when you announce it from a position of strength, when you have money and decide to invest it domestically instead of paying it abroad,'' he said. ''But in this case, I think the moratorium is just bankruptcy. Brazil is simply recognizing that it has no way of paying.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/12/world/5-killed-by-bomb-at-beirut-airport.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 346, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "5 KILLED BY BOMB AT BEIRUT AIRPORT", "print_headline": "5 KILLED BY BOMB AT BEIRUT AIRPORT", "body_text": " **********A bomb hidden in a suitcase exploded in a crowded passenger terminal at Beirut International Airport today, killing at least 5 people and wounding 70 others, the police said. **********The police said they believed that the bomb, which weighed about two pounds, was carried by a woman who died in the blast.

Crackdown Is Widened **********The police raids today widened a crackdown on militants that has grown increasingly intense in recent days, leading to the arrest of dozens of student leaders, lawyers and other dissidents. **********In Ulsan, a southeastern industrial center, riot officers stormed into the dormitories of Hyundai Heavy Industries, where 20,000 shipyard workers have been on strike since Wednesday in a wage dispute. Early this morning, the police arrested 70 men suspected of violence, and later in the day they took away about 30 more. They included 10 strikers who had seized a police officer, touching off a brief scuffle at the main shipyard entrance. **********In Pupyong, 18 miles west of Seoul, the police arrested 100 workers in a Daewoo car plant who had taken over the administration building and had held company executives as virtual hostages for a while. According to the authorities, the strikers had gasoline bombs and were threatening to set fire to the building. **********At both Daewoo and Hyundai, workers did not inflict any damage that would affect mechanical operations once work resumes. Ulsan strikers confined most of their damage to the city hall, where they burned cars and broke windows and furniture, angering local officials and some residents who do not work for Hyundai. Request of Authorities **********A Hyundai spokesman said today's arrests came on the authorities' own initiative and without a company request for help. Daewoo, on the other hand, did ask the police to intervene. **********The Government had apparently sensed that labor violence was an issue that could be used to its advantage. A hard line, political analysts said, improves the chances for blunting any unhappiness about the unrest that may exist within the powerful South Korean military. **********In addition, some said, the Government may sense that it enjoys popular support in this matter. ''There are people who say that you can't have workers running amok,'' a foreign diplomat said. ''There is a conservative streak in Korea that goes beyond strikes.'' **********Government and ruling-party officials insisted that the military would not be used to end the labor strikes, which affected about 700 companies nationwide, most of them small. **********''What the Government is trying to do is not to suppress workers' demands but to have an orderly settlement process - it won't go beyond that,'' said Hyun Hong Choo, an influential National Assemblyman from the ruling Democratic Justice Party. **********Ulsan and Pupyong were both quiet after the arrests.

Aquino embarked this weekend on what amounts to a presidential campaign, one year after what had seemed an improbable bid for office against Ferdinand E. Marcos. **********In contrast to last year's makeshift campaign, in which pro-Marcos officials sometimes denied her a stage from which to speak, local officials now crowded close to be seen with her, calling her ''the most beautiful President we ever had.'' **********The issue this time is a draft constitution, which faces a nationwide plebiscite on Feb. 2 and which both sides agree will amount to a test of confidence in Mrs. Aquino's Government. **********This time the underdogs are her opponents, many of whom have rallied behind Juan Ponce Enrile, who has admitted rigging his region's vote against her a year ago, when he was Mr. Marcos's Defense Minister. He was dismissed as Mrs. Aquino's own Defense Minister in November. Inept, He Says of Aquino **********He, too, opened his campaign this weekend, calling her both a dictator and weak and inept, and urging the nation to ''rise as one'' to reject her presidency with a no vote. **********Speaking in Zamboanga City in southern Mindanao, he belittled her role in toppling Mr. Marcos, saying she had not been present at the military revolt, which he helped lead, that forced Mr. Marcos to flee the country two weeks after the election. **********Attacking Mrs. Aquino in harsher language than he used before his dismissal, Mr. Enrile said: ''The people are strong enough to compel anybody to come down. If we had done it before, we can do it again.'' **********The older politicians of Mr. Marcos's own party, those who have not abandoned it for one of the more vital alternatives that have appeared to take its place, also opened a campaign of opposition to the constitution this weekend. **********At the same time, the country's first leftist party, the Party of the Nation, which had at first indicated support for the charter, appeared to be moving for tactical reasons toward an opposition stand. New Election Is Aim **********Few analysts here believe that the constitution can be defeated. But its opponents on the right say they hope the vote will be close enough to reinforce their calls for a new presidential election. **********The President's own spokesman, Teodoro Benigno, has said only an ''overwhelming'' vote of at least 65 percent will be considered a victory. **********The presidential palace announced that Mrs. Aquino would make campaign appearances in different cities each weekend this month. Her strategists have said they are consciously tailoring the campaign to emphasize her personal popularity rather than any aspects of the long and complicated constitution. **********''I know you still love me,'' Mrs. Aquino said as she opened her campaign Saturday in the southern Luzon region of Bicol, where she received strong support in the presidential election last February. **********Although the crowds were smaller than predicted, they showed the same fervor they had last year, when the nation became aware of the ''Cory phenomenon,'' the unexpected star quality of an inexperienced, untried candidate. A Promise of Help **********As they had a year ago, thousands of supporters stood for hours in the burning sunshine, waving yellow banners and clamoring for a glimpse of the candidate. Once again they raised the campaign chant, ''Cory, Cory, Cory,'' that had so disconcerted Mr. Marcos's confident strategists. **********This weekend Mrs. Aquino showed she had learned some politics during her months in office, promising, as Mr. Marcos had in his campaign, more money for local schools, irrigation projects and highway construction. **********In the city of Legaspi, she announced a 33 percent increase in economic aid to the region, with a grant of 2.4 billion pesos, or $120 million this year. **********An economic consultant to the Government said a major job-creation program would be introduced just before the February vote for maximum political effect. **********''It's patronage politics, but a more enlightened kind of patronage politics,'' he said. ''It's more enlightened because they don't like to do it.'' A Vote 'for Our Children' **********On stage, Mrs. Aquino sounded some of the themes of her earlier campaign, talking of her husband, Benigno, an opposition politician whose assassination in 1983 began a series of events that led to Mr. Marcos's downfall. **********She seemed at times almost apologetic in asking for support, reminding her audience that they had voted her into office for a six-year term and recalling her pledge not to run for re-election when that term ends in 1992. **********''This yes vote is for democracy and economic recovery,'' she said. ''This is also for our children, so that they can live in freedom at all times and so that no dictator can ever rule over us again.'' **********Politicians on both sides agree that passage of the constitution will mark a new chapter in her presidency, giving it a legal basis and laying the foundation for a democratic government that will include a two-chamber legislature."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/01/world/kuwait-arrests-11-in-oilfield-blasts.html": {"writer_name": "John Kifner", "pub_date": "1987-02-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 770, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KUWAIT ARRESTS 11 IN OILFIELD BLASTS", "print_headline": "KUWAIT ARRESTS 11 IN OILFIELD BLASTS", "body_text": " **********The Kuwaiti authorities said today that they had arrested 11 men for bombing the emirate's oil installations on the eve of the Islamic summit conference held here this week. **********The names of two members of the purported terrorist cell - five more men were still being sought - suggested that they were Shiite Moslem Kuwaitis of Iranian origin, sources here said. The men were also accused of starting a series of fires in the oil fields last June. **********Iran boycotted the meeting of the 46-member Islamic Conference Organization over Kuwait's support for Iraq in the Persian Gulf war. Several Islamic fundamentalist groups, including the shadowy Islamic Holy War, threatened reprisals if the meeting was held. **********The Islamic summit conference went ahead as scheduled under tight security, including roadblocks in the downtown area, banning fishing boats from going into the Gulf, sealing mailboxes and halting the shipping of parcels from the post office. Underlying Tensions **********But the arrests pointed up the underlying tensions in this tiny nation, a boom town surrounded by desert, only 40 percent of whose population of 1.6 million are Kuwaiti citizens. **********The ruling Sabah clan, along with a network of other important families, are mostly Sunni Moslems. But about a third of the population are Shiite Moslems, along with an expatriate community that does much of the work, including about 300,000 Palestinians and an estimated 60,000 to 90,000 Iranians. **********Tens of thousands of these expatriates have been deported in the last two years as part of a security crackdown, and because of cutbacks in the economy due to falling oil prices. **********The surnames of two of those implicated in the purported plot - Behbahani and Dashti - are the same as two of the half-dozen leading Shiite families of Iranian origin who came here around the turn of the century. Those families are regarded as the peers of the network of influential, largely merchant, Kuwaiti families at the pinnacle of influence.

The 17 are mostly Iraqi Shiites, but include several Lebanese. **********In addition, a Kuwaiti airliner was hijacked to Iran a year later, a suicide car bomber attempted to blow up the ruling Emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, and a series of bombs went off in popular coffeehouses along the seafront. Oil Platform Damaged **********On Jan. 19, three days before the foreign ministers of Islamic states gathered here to draw up the agenda for the summit, explosions went off simultaneously at three oil installations. **********One of the bombs reportedly caused considerable damage to Kuwait's offshore oil-loading platform at Sea Island, knocking one of the two berths out of service. **********Responsibility for the explosions was claimed in Beirut by a previously unknown group calling itself the Revolutionary Organization - Forces of the Prophet Mohammed in Kuwait, which declared, ''We threaten people who do not want to look at the right of the oppressed in Kuwait and tomorrow in Palestine.'' **********The Kuwaiti television tonight showed extensive footage of what it said were caches of arms and explosives seized along with the terrorists. Arrests Hinted During Summit **********The piles of weapons included more than a dozen handguns, machine pistols and automatic rifles; hand grenades; detonating devices including alarm clocks, fuses and electrical wires, and, according to the narrator, TNT and C-4 explosive. **********The dates Jan. 27 and 29 appeared superimposed on some of the film of the weapons, suggesting they had been found, and the terrorists arrested, during the Islamic summit. **********The announcement of the arrests quoted a source at the Interior Ministry who ''praised God for protecting Kuwait and thanked the Almighty for helping Kuwait's security forces to arrest those responsible for the fires that broke out in oil installations last June and last Jan. 19.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/05/world/reagan-and-aides-prepare-offers-on-future-arms-pact.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "1987-12-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 753, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reagan and Aides Prepare Offers on Future Arms Pact", "print_headline": "Reagan and Aides Prepare Offers on Future Arms Pact", "body_text": " **********President Reagan and senior officials met today to review what arms control proposals the United States should make at the summit meeting next week. **********Administration officials said there was no basic change in many key elements of the American position. **********But American and Soviet officials expect intense negotiations on how to reduce long-range nuclear arms and on the related issue of what commitment should be made to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. **********Administration officials also said they expected to wrap up remaining minor issues at talks in Geneva on the new treaty to ban medium- and shorter-range missiles in time for the signing Tuesday by President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader. Soviet Expects Resolution **********Col. Gen. Nikolai F. Chervov, the head of the arms control directorate of the Soviet General Staff, said in an interview that the two sides would try to resolve several key issues next week here on a future agreement on long-range arms and anti-missile systems. **********On reducing long-range arms, General Chervov said the two sides should be able to resolve the question of what missile ceilings or ''sub-limits'' should be set by the new agreement. ''There is every reason now to believe it could be done,'' he said. **********General Chervov also suggested that the two sides should be able to make progress on how long to adhere to the ABM treaty. **********The Soviet Union has proposed that the two sides should pledge not to withdraw from the treaty for 10 years, while the United States has proposed a commitment not to withdraw before the end of 1994. **********''As to the duration of that period of time it could be 10 or 15 years or less than that,'' General Chervov said. ''Anyway, it is up to the heads of our two countries to decide and agree upon.'' **********General Chervov also said that Mr. Gorbachev and President Reagan would have a ''significant conversation'' on the ABM treaty. Strict Interpretation **********General Chervov and other Soviet officials here have left the impression that Moscow believes that the critical issue of interpretation of the ABM treaty is too difficult to deal with resolve at the summit meeting. But he asserted that there was no change in the Soviet position that the ABM treaty must be interpreted strictly. **********He said that the Soviet position was similar to that of senators who have endorsed the traditional, restrictive intepretation of the treaty. The Reagan Administration has developed a ''broad'' interpretation that would allow expanded testing of a space-based defense against missiles - known as ''Star Wars.'' **********General Chervov also suggested that a treaty reducing long-range arms could not go into effect until the two sides resolve what the ABM treaty means and its period of observance. He said a ''50 percent reduction in strategic nuclear offensive arms can only become a reality'' if all the ABM provisions are strictly observed and complied with. Resistance From Hard-Liners **********Before today's meeting, several compromise proposals on the ABM issue had circulated in the Administration but had run into strong resistance from Administration hard-liners. **********Some Administration officials had suggested that the United States agree not to withdraw from the treaty until the end of 1996 - instead of 1994 - as the United States has proposed. **********Another suggestion involved the Soviet radar at Krasnoyarsk in central Siberia, which the Reagan Administration says is a violation of the ABM treaty. Under this idea, the Russians would satisfy American concerns by eliminating the radar's power source instead of tearing down the radar, as the United States had demanded. **********Under another suggestion, the United States would try to address Soviet concerns by agreeing to negotiate the meaning of key terms of the ABM treaty after a new treaty reaching long-range arms goes into effect. **********For the treaty eliminating medium- and shorter-range weapons, the Soviet Union earlier this week provided its final package of required missile data, Officials said that the data appear to be in line with American estimates. **********An American official said today that the two sides were still trying to work out differences on monitoring outside of Soviet and American missile plants.

We need to redirect our policy toward exploring every political and diplomatic path available, which I frankly do not believe the Administration has done.'' 'Political Slavery' Feared **********The two officials, Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, and Philip C. Habib, special envoy for Central America, argued that the obstacles to a negotiated solution had been erected by the governing Sandinistas. The Administration remained committed to the Contadora process, Mr. Habib said, under which a 21-point tentative settlement has been worked out. **********But Mr. Abrams contended that without military pressure, the Sandinistas would not be induced to negotiate or permit democracy. He denounced the bill to halt aid as guaranteeing ''political slavery for Nicaragua.'' **********The bill was introduced by Connecticut's Senators, Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat, and Lowell P. Weicker, a Republican. It would deny the contras the $40 million that remains of the $100 million appropriated this year. **********The measure's prospects for passage are uncertain. Since it would undoubtedly be vetoed by President Reagan, sponsors would need two-thirds of both houses to override the veto. Some Democrats would rather confront the White House on next year's appropriation request, which could be defeated by a majority of the legislators. Goal of 'Political Victory' **********Under close and often hostile questioning, Mr. Abrams said it was not the Administration's goal to build up a conventional force that could march into Managua. ''If the question is, can they win a straight-out military victory such as what we won in World War II,'' he declared, ''nobody is thinking about that.'' He stressed that the contras were fighting a ''guerrilla war'' and that the goal was ''political victory.'' **********He predicted that with continued aid, the rebels could force the Sandinistas to permit democracy in Nicaragua in two to four years. He said that with the $100 million appropriated this year for the contras and $105 million or more next year, the pace of guerrilla warfare would increase, and Nicaraguan troops would lose control of some territory. **********He also said the Administration was moving toward a decision to sell F-5E jet fighters to Honduras, which recently declared it would stop allowing the contras to use its territory as a staging area. Most of the 15,000 to 18,000 rebel fighters are now in Nicaragua, Mr. Abrams contended, although he declined to give precise figures. **********Senator Dodd questioned the assumption that the contras could force the Sandinistas to permit free elections. ''How do you get a force strong enough to force a government to change fundamentally but not strong enough to overthrow the government?'' he asked. **********Mr. Abrams replied simply that the Sandinistas had to be convinced that ''down the road lies ruin.'' **********''They don't believe that yet,'' he said, ''but when they believe that, we have the potential for a settlement.'' **********Mr. Habib faced tough questioning on the Administration's refusal to conduct negotiations with Nicaragua. **********''We are ready to resume bilateral talks as soon as the Sandinistas enter into a dialogue with their opposition,'' he said. ''We believe that until the Sandinistas come to terms with its own people, there is no point in resuming bilateral talks with the Sandinistas.'' **********The only Senator to express clear support for the contras was Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina. Noting that some claim that the contras cannot win, Mr. Helms asked: ''How do we know that? They have never had a fighting chance.

Asked if the Ambassador brought a message of support, Mr. Arias Calderon replied, ''I think the visit itself was a message.'' **********The crisis, considered the most serious Panama has faced since the military seized power in 1968, erupted on Sunday with the publication of dramatic charges by Col. Roberto Diaz Herrera, who until his retirement last week was the second-ranking member of the Panama Defense Forces. Allegations Against Leader **********Colonel Diaz said he had collaborated with the top military commander, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, in electoral fraud in 1984, and said General Noriega had directed the 1985 slaying of Dr. Hugo Spadafora, a leading critic of the Government. **********In addition, he said General Noriega had planned the killing of Gen. Omar Torrijos Herrera, Panama's leader, who died in a plane crash in 1981. General Torrijos is a hero to many Panamanians and is regularly invoked by General Noriega and other officers as their mentor. **********Amado Martinez, one of a group of more than 100 people who gathered in the San Cristobal section of the capital to block streets by building barricades and setting them afire, said: ''We are not organized by anyone, we are just the people of Panama, and we are fed up. Everyone wants to get rid of Noriega and to return to democracy.'' **********In an interview with a radio station from neighboring Colombia, General Noriega said today that he would not resign his office because doing so would not resolve the country's problems. He blamed this week's turmoil on ''groups of businessmen stimulated by opposition politicians.'' **********Under what the Government called a state of urgency, which limits personal freedoms and resembles a state of emergency in other countries, police may arrest citizens without charge and hold them for indefinite periods without informing them of charges against them or presenting them to the judicial authorities. Constitutional guarantees of free speech, peaceable assembly and free transit were also suspended. The Government prohibited independent radio news programs. Stations not broadcasting music were required to join a national network that broadcast appeals for calm and condemnations of ''evil men who have always been ambitious for power.'' **********Even before Colonel Diaz's charges last weekend, there had been widespread reports that General Noriega was involved in vote fraud and the killing of Dr. Spadafora. Colonel Diaz added hitherto unknown details, identifying officers he said were involved and specifying the electoral district in which he said vote counts were altered to provide a victory margin in 1984. New Charges on Torrijos Death **********But the allegations surrounding General Torrijos's death were not widely heard before, and few Panamanians or foreigners had seriously questioned the official conclusion that the general's death in the plane crash was accidental. Colonel Diaz said a bomb disquised as a radio transmitter was placed aboard the plane on orders of General Noriega, who was then the country's second-ranking military officer. **********Today, Colonel Diaz was gathered with his family and supporters behind the walls of his luxurious home, which he said he bought with money he earned from bribes paid by Cubans seeking Panamanian visas. **********In an interview, the 49-year-old colonel said he was moved to speak out by a growing sense that God would punish him if he did not. Like some other leading Panamanians, including General Noriega, Colonel Diaz is in regular touch with psychics and spiritualists. **********''I have confessed, and it would be best for Panama if General Noriega also confesses,'' Colonel Diaz said. ''Our war is psychic, mystical and religious.'' Priests Gather With Colonel **********Among those gathered with Colonel Diaz today were several Roman Catholic priests. One, the Rev. Juan de Dios Antolines, said the church had intervened to protect the ''physical and spiritual life of Colonel Diaz and his family.'' **********The colonel has rejected suggestions that he seek asylum in a foreign embassy, but indicated he would consider an invitation from Archbishop Marcos Gregorio McGrath that he and his supporters move from their home to a church to conduct a ''permanent vigil.'' He also acceded to the Archbishop's request that he surrender all firearms that supporters had brought into his house in recent days. **********Colonal Diaz, who was the first chief of the army's Office for Psychological Operations, said he was not seeking power for himself. He said the man who should legally be president of Panama is Dr. Arnulfo Arias Madrid, who was proclaimed the loser in the 1984 elections. **********Dr. Arias was wildly cheered as he took part in a downtown motorcade on Tuesday. But he has not joined the call for a national strike, which several private groups support.  U.S. Warns Travelers WASHINGTON, June 11 (Special to The New York Times) - The State Department warned Americans today to avoid traveling to Panama, and the Pentagon ordered American military personnel to restrict their movements there because of the clashes. **********The measures came as the Reagan Administration stepped up its public criticism of the Panamanian Government.

The National People's Party said he had been forced to resign as ''punishment for exposing corruption.'' **********The resignation is certain to pose a serious test to Mr. Gandhi at a time of rising criticism of his performance and deepening divisions in his party. Aggressive Tactics Criticized **********The dispute began in March, when Mr. Singh came under attack for having hired an American investigative agency, the Fairfax Group of Annandale, Va., to look into illegal activities overseas by Indian businesses. The agency was hired last year while Mr. Singh was Finance Minister; he moved to the Defense Ministry in January. **********Then, last Thursday, Mr. Singh said he had begun a separate inquiry into payments to an Indian who served as an overseas agent in a $300 million defense contract. **********The contract was for purchase of submarines from West Germany. The commission awarded was said to have been about $25 million. **********No additional details were available, including the name of the recipient of the commission. But the payment was widely seen as evidence of a possible kickback to Mr. Gandhi's ruling Congress Party. **********Many political experts have asserted that the party raises funds by skimming money from overseas contractors in both the West and the Soviet Union. But no evidence has surfaced. **********Mr. Singh's dramatic announcement of the investigation in Parliament on Thursday stunned his fellow party members. He had not cleared the action with the Prime Minister or any appropriate Cabinet committee. Accusations of Disloyalty **********Publicly, the criticism by Mr. Singh's colleagues centered on his failure to notify them and on charges that he had jeopardized the inquiry by making it public. But leading allies of Mr. Gandhi were reported to have denounced Mr. Singh at a closed meeting of Cabinet members Friday night, suggesting that he had sought to embarrass the Prime Minister, improve his own image and save his job. **********Mr. Singh responded by promising to resign as an act of ''loyalty'' to Mr. Gandhi. He said today that he gave his resignation to the Prime Minister after a ''heart-to-heart talk'' late Saturday night. **********The Prime Minister's own role remained unclear tonight. It was not certain whether he asked for the resignation, encouraged his colleagues to press for it, or tried to dissuade the Defense Minister. **********The resignation was accepted today by the Indian President, Zail Singh, and Mr. Gandhi transferred K. C. Pant, the Steel and Mines Minister, to the defense post. **********In a statement, Mr. Singh continued to proclaim his loyalty to the Prime Minister, saying he had begun his investigation with the best intentions. **********''It is honor enough to belong to the Congress family and work with its leader, Rajiv Gandhi,'' he said. ''It is now for the people to decide whether I am over-ambitious or my critics are wrong.'' Criticism From Opposition **********George Fernandez, a leader of the People's Party, said tonight that ''Mr. Singh should put the country's security above loyalty to his party and let the people know the truth behind the dirty deal.'' **********Mr. Fernandez said the resignation confirmed that for seven years an ''illegitimate fortune'' had been made out of arms sales to India. **********Mr. Singh, a 56-year-old politician from a princely family in the populous northern state of Uttar Pradesh, created a splash by resigning as the state's Chief Minister in 1982. The issue then was his admitted failure to contain a crime wave. **********But as Finance Minister and then Defense Minister, Mr. Singh rose to become one of the most popular politicians in India, with a reputation as an honest and effective administrator. **********In the finance post, he was the architect of India's policy of lowering taxes and easing Government regulations and earned an international reputation for his understanding of economics. **********But Mr. Singh also rankled businessmen and politicians by authorizing investigators to pursue cases of tax fraud by raiding the homes and offices of leading industrialists. Many of his targets were longtime allies and contributors to the Congress Party.

For example, it was reported that Finance Ministry inquiries had forced key businesses to shut down while being investigated, costing them much of their export trade. This in turn was said to have damaged India's balance of payments. **********Then last month, it was disclosed that Mr. Singh had hired the Fairfax Group to look into the overseas accounts of a leading Indian textile industrialist. **********The industrialist, Dirubhai Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, had been accused in the press of smuggling in machinery and chemicals for synthetic fabrics in collusion with the Government. He denied the charges. **********Mr. Singh's critics became angry, however, when it was alleged that Fairfax Group fees may also have been paid by a rival textile company, Bombay Dyeing. **********In the view of many, this tainted the Government's investigation and raised the charge that Mr. Singh had thrust the Government into a private-sector dispute."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/13/world/kuwaiti-hanging-of-3-shiites-is-reported-in-beirut-s-press.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-07-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 229, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kuwaiti Hanging of 3 Shiites Is Reported in Beirut's Press", "print_headline": "Kuwaiti Hanging of 3 Shiites Is Reported in Beirut's Press", "body_text": " **********The Beirut press reported today that Kuwait had executed three convicted Shiite Moslem bombers whose release had been demanded by people claiming to hold American hostages here.

Ervin Jr. wrote that a Congressional investigation could become either ''an instrument of freedom'' or ''freedom's scourge.'' **********Had he lived to see the Iran-contra investigation, the North Carolina Democrat might have added a third possibility: that the investigation could become the scourge of Congress as well. A Sympathetic Figure **********Critics of the Administration both inside and outside Congress watched in dismay as Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, the witness whose advance notices had cast him as the probable villain of the drama, became a sympathetic figure to much of the public by skillful use of the platform the hearings provided. At the most crucial point in their work, the committees appeared off stride, scrambling to regain momentum and public credibility. **********In interviews over the last week, veterans of earlier Congressional investigations, as well as members of Congress not directly involved in the current inquiry, indicated general, if tentative, agreement on several aspects of the committees' work so far. **********They said the Iran-contra investigation was a more difficult one for Congress than the Watergate inquiry, and that the chairmen, Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii and Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, deserved credit for maintaining a dignified, nonpartisan tone despite the size of the group - 26 members compared with 7 on the Watergate committee. **********But they added that the high-profile role of the committees' lawyers, while probably necessary, nonetheless had hurt the panels' public effectiveness. Some Things Done Better **********Fred D. Thompson, who served as chief minority counsel to the Senate Watergate committee, said the public now forgets that the committee was widely criticized for its leaks and open partisanship. **********''There were days when people said that maybe Nixon's a crook, but these guys are out to lunch, too,'' he said. ''The facts bailed us out.'' Indeed, a Gallup poll in August 1973, as the Watergate committee was in the midst of its work, indicated that a bare majority, 52 percent, thought the hearings were ''good for the country.'' **********''These committees are doing some things better than the Watergate committee did,'' said James Hamilton, who was assistant majority counsel to the Watergate committee and the author of a book, ''The Power to Probe,'' about Congressional investigations. **********''They have controlled leaks, they have prevented partisan staff wrangling,'' he said, but added: ''The committee members have not been as dominant as those on the Ervin committee, perhaps because the staff lawyers have played such a large role. This may have worked to North's advantage, since it is difficult even for superior lawyers to weigh in with moral rectitude like Sam Ervin did so effectively.'' On the Defensive **********Those interviewed said that the dominance of Arthur L. Liman, the chief Senate counsel, and John W. Nields Jr., chief counsel to the House panel, have given the proceedings a prosecutorial tone that has created public sympathy for the witnesses. **********''You have all the standard courtroom theatrics,'' said Mark Helmke, who until earlier this year was press secretary to Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana. ''Prosecutorial staff counsel, brilliant defense attorneys. The problem is that in a trial, there is a judge. That's a role that members of Congress don't play very well. They've been miscast. They look bad.'' **********Mr. Helmke added that the sheer size of the committees ''makes it look like a bunch of Congressmen and hired guns are ganging up on the witnesses.'' **********''Having counsel do the questioning, so that it is coherent and consistent, is basically a sound idea,'' said Representative David E. Price, a freshman Democrat from North Carolina. Mr. Price, a political scientist and academic specialist in the Congressional committee process, said his studies of Congressional oversight hearings had shown that questioning by members was often ''sporadic and segmented.'' He added, ''You put counsel in that role for good reason, running the risk that they come on too strong.'' **********Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, put it another way. ''The lawyers are doing what good lawyers do in a court of law,'' he said. ''They're building a case brick by brick. But these pieces have to be bigger. The public has to see a 100-piece jigsaw puzzle, not 1,000 pieces. It's not a jury of 12 but of 100 million.'' **********By permitting the ''detective story'' to dominate the hearings, the committees have not focused adequately on the public policy part of their mandate, said Jerome Levinson, who served as a counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. **********''In allowing the issue to be framed as a detective story - whether Reagan knew - the committees miss the boat,'' he said. ''The real question is the role of covert action in a democracy. How often do you have the chance to get the attention of the nation on a fundamental question like that?'' **********But Mr. Levinson said ''tremendous institutional pressures'' make it difficult to focus on the larger issues. ''It's just so easy to be pulled into the facts and lose sight of what it is you want to accomplish,'' he said. **********Mr. Thompson said there were inherent political risks for members of Congress in pursuing any sustained, high-profile investigation. **********''Whether the members like it or not, this is essentially a broad policy debate,'' he said. ''There's an inherent weakness in the committee process. You can try to bear down on the factual side, but a real strong witness who's got sympathetic points to make and who can deliver those points effectively can make the policy debate jump out. All of a sudden the ground is shifting out from under you.'' **********Senator Terry Sanford, Democrat of North Carolina, said: ''It's not a perfect system. But I hope we don't have these investigations often enough to develop a perfect system.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/18/business/japan-s-efforts-to-soften-us-anger-on-toshiba.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Chira", "pub_date": "1987-07-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1037, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japan's Efforts to Soften U.S. Anger on Toshiba", "print_headline": "Japan's Efforts to Soften U.S. Anger on Toshiba", "body_text": " **********In its desire to quell American anger over a Japanese company's sale of militarily sensitive technology to the Soviet Union, Japan is taking steps that may seem extraordinary to Americans, but make perfect sense to Japanese. **********The action has been rapid-fire this month: *********** On July 1, the top two officials of the Toshiba Corporation resigned, even though they said that the company had not known about the illegal export of propeller-milling equipment to the Soviet Union by the Toshiba Machine Company, of which it owned a majority interest.. *********** On Tuesday, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone accused Toshiba Machine of betraying Japan. *********** On Wednesday, the Toshiba Corporation sent a contrite letter of apology to members of Congress. *********** On Thursday, Japan's trade minister told American officials that his Government would seek harsher penalties for future violators and would work to toughen Japan's export control system. **********While some of these steps might strike Americans as degrading, they have not occasioned much comment in Japan. Their logic is clear to most Japanese - Japan cannot afford to risk losing access to its most important foreign market. Moreover, gestures such as public apologies or the resignation of top corporate executives are accepted - and expected -here as a proof of sincerity. They are considered not humiliating but honorable. **********''The resignation doesn't mean that the executives say they are guilty,'' said Naohiro Amaya, executive director of a research center called the Dentsu Institute for Human Studies and one of the architects of Japan's postwar trade policies. ''The company was put in a disastrous situation, and it's common sense in Japan for the president to take a serious action that may help to solve the problem. But Americans may find this puzzling - Chrysler was involved in some scandal, and Lee Iacocca's reaction was quite different from Toshiba's.'' **********Moreover, unlike numerous past disputes with the United States, many here acknowledge that Japan was in the wrong this time. **********''We are saying one thing - We are responsible,'' said Yoshifumi Matsuda, a spokesman for the foreign ministry. ''Toshiba Machine committed an illegal act.'' He added that the Government was also responsible ''because of a rather loose framework of export controls and a shortage of manpower'' to supervise these exports. **********A senior Japanese executive of a major corporation agreed. ''I don't think anyone was surprised'' by the measures taken, he said, adding: ''Since Toshiba Machine did something against the law, how do we fight back against American accusations?'' **********Nonetheless, many Japanese are puzzled and resentful about the depth of American fury over the Toshiba affair. **********For most Japanese, the incident has not loomed nearly so large as it has in the United States. Mr. Nakasone's charge of betrayal did not stir much comment here, although he may well have understood how his comments would be received in the United States. **********Nor was there much comment about the pledges made in Washington by Hajime Tamura, Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry, to toughen export controls and stiffen penalties. One foreign ministry official said today, however, that some of Mr. Tamura's promises ''are not fully endorsed by other ministries.'' Mr. Nakasone, however, endorsed some of the proposals in testimony today before Japan's parliament. **********These remedial measures came after the United States delivered two shocks that jolted the Government and the public into recognizing the high stakes of the Toshiba affair. One was the Senate proposal to ban imports made by the Toshiba Corporation. The other was the picture of Congressmen smashing a Toshiba radio in front of the Capitol. What appeared a mere photo opportunity in the United States received prominent coverage in Japan. **********Just a few hours after the Senate proposal, Toshiba's chairman and president resigned. A ban on Toshiba exports to the United States - which accounts for 10 percent of Toshiba's annual sales - would have a devastating effect on the company. **********Indeed, it was American pressure that played a key role in prompting Japan to consider toughening its export controls, said one foreign ministry official who helps supervise the controls. ''Of course, if there was no United States pressure, it would be very difficult to take measures which by Japanese standards are very drastic,'' he said. Trade Curbs Feared **********Many here also fear that the furor will further poison trade relations with the United States - and insure the passage of harsh trade measures under consideration in Congress. Last year, the United States accounted for 38.5 percent of Japan's exports and a third of Japanese trade. **********''Japanese don't want a protectionist trade bill,'' said Clyde Prestowitz, a former United States trade negotiator. ''They want the semiconductor sanctions lifted. They don't want to be locked out of Strategic Defense Initiative research. They have enormous stakes in the United States. They are trying to save this at the cost of having someone go over and bow low and apologize - that's a pretty low cost.'' **********At the same time, however, many Japanese are troubled by the intensity of the American reaction. **********''There is a sense here that the American Congress is making a witch hunt without substantial evidence,'' Mr. Amaya said. ''It's rather interesting that the Congress didn't smash Norwegian sardine tins, only the Toshiba radio.'' A Norwegian company, Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk, was also involved in the illegal sale. U.S. Charge Questioned **********There is widespread skepticism here about the American charge that the Toshiba Machine equipment was used to make Soviet submarines quieter. Military experts, some politicians and many ordinary Japanese have questioned whether a direct link really exists. In several days of questioning in Japan's parliament, Government officials have provided conflicting accounts on the evidence of such a link. **********The result, said Mr. Matsuda, the foreign ministry spokesman, was that many Japanese remained doubtful about the evidence of a linkage. That, he said, was ''very regrettable.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/28/business/business-people-quadrex-president-takes-kidder-post.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1987-08-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 426, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Quadrex President Takes Kidder Post", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Quadrex President Takes Kidder Post", "body_text": " **********John M.

The offer is set to expire April 3. **********Analysts said the judge's order also took away Mr. Icahn's most potent weapon to put pressure on USAir management: the ability to increase his stake in the carrier. **********''Time is now in USAir's favor,'' said Hans Plickert, an airline analyst at E. F. Hutton & Company. ''It is not in Icahn's favor.'' **********Even if Mr. Icahn decides to end his effort, analysts said, he still could face substantial losses in disposing of his four million USAir shares. They said that USAir's stock price could drop further if Mr. Icahn ends his bid. **********USAir shares fell 62.5 cents, to $47.125, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday after trading as high as $51.125 last week. **********Some analysts speculated that Mr. Icahn's tactics in the USAir bid could draw more attention to his activities on the part of the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********And Mr. Plickert said the climate that Mr. Icahn was operating in had changed as a result of Wall Street's insider-trading scandal. ''Takeover games have gotten a bad name,'' he said. ''When someone violates a regulation in the process, that's a lot more negative today than it was six months ago.'' **********Emerging from yesterday's court proceedings in Pittsburgh, Edward I. Colodny, the chairman of USAir, who has so far helped build a strong defense against Mr. Icahn, told reporters that however Judge Cohill ruled in the future, ''USAir is in this thing to win.'' **********T.W.A.'s reaction to the court order was a short statement by Mark A. Buckstein, the airline's senior vice president and general counsel.

Under that law, his ownership in USAir would have been limited to $15 million worth of stock unless the Transportation Department assumed jurisdiction over the takeover effort. **********But the agency, with the Justice Department's backing, rejected his takeover application last Friday, the same day that Mr. Icahn disclosed he had lifted his USAir stake to 15 percent and the day that the USAir and Piedmont boards approved the merger. **********USAir also said that Mr. Icahn violated the Federal Aviation Act, by acquiring more than 10 percent of USAir stock - a stake that gave him control of the carrier under the act -without the Transportation Department's approval of a voting trust to hold the stock. **********The USAir suit said that if Mr. Icahn had filed under the Hart-Scott-Rodino law, ''he would have been forced to delay his purchases of USAir stock by many weeks.'' **********''He chose to circumvent those requirements,'' USAir's suit said, ''because they conflicted with his need to prevent the formation of another strong national carrier in competition with T.W.A.'' **********USAir's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and sources involved in the takeover effort, including a source close to Mr. Icahn, suggest that Mr. Icahn was seeking to stop the USAir-Piedmont merger because the two carriers were prime candidates to either merge with T.W.A. or buy out his huge stake in T.W.A. **********The documents and sources indicated that Mr. Icahn was concerned that after the merger, it was unlikely that the Department of Transportation would allow T.W.A. to merge with the combined USAir-Piedmont because of competitive concerns. **********In addition, the industry's rapid consolidation had diminished the number of carriers to which he could sell his T.W.A. holdings. **********''His options became very limited,'' said a person close to the takeover effort. **********According to documents filed by USAir with the S.E.C., Mr. Icahn contacted Mr. Colodny several times to discuss a merger, from last September to this month.

Wojciech Jaruzelski. **********It remained unclear how the Government would accommodate apparently conflicting elements of the program, elements that raised the specter of renewed social unrest.

Evokes Gorbachev's Efforts **********As he laid the measures before Parliament, the Prime Minister evoked the spirit of the changes in the Soviet Union under Mikhail S. Gorbachev, which have been referred to as glasnost, or openness, and perestroika, or restructuring. **********''The rightful character of the direction that we selected is confirmed by processes now under way in other member states of the socialist community,'' he said. ''Soviet perestroika has become a symbol here.'' **********If carried out over coming months, the measures would enable Poland to challenge the role of Hungary as the most daring economic innovator in the East bloc. Last month, Budapest announced a series of austerity measures, telling Hungarians they would have to tighten their belts for an indefinite period if better economic times were to follow. **********In an apparent effort to gain a measure of popular support for the Polish changes, Parliament agreed to a national referendum Nov. 29 to determine the pace and extent of the program. **********It was made clear that the Government would not ask the population whether it desired the changes, but merely how quickly and with what intensity. **********The Government also announced it intended to introduce fundamental changes in the political system. But it did not elaborate, saying only that they would be discussed at a special session of the Communist Party's Central Committee in November. **********Within several months the Government plans to break up the monolithic state banking system, allowing competing commercial banks to operate, and to create the East bloc's second securities market, after Hungary. **********There was litle excitement and no applause in the Parliament building as Mr. Messner, in a voice free of emotion, announced that the Government would scale back its commitment in an area once sacred to Communist governments by requiring citizens to pay a larger share for health services, entertainment and cultural events. **********The Government laid before Parliament its economic program through the end of 1990. It described the program as the second stage of reform following efforts begun in 1981, after martial law was imposed to crush the Solidarity labor movement. Speaks Candidly of Economy **********While Mr. Messner said the first stage had enabled Poland ''to accumulate a number of valuable experiences,'' he spoke candidly of current economic conditions. **********''There are bureaucratic overgrowths, erroneous motivational systems, shortcomings in the organization of labor, lack of respect for social property,'' he said. Then, borrowing a witticism common to the streets of Communist countries, he added, ''In extreme cases, the people pretend to be working, and the enterprise pretends to pay them.'' **********The Prime Minister said the program was designed to meet conditions set by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for initiating aid to Poland. ''The fund's stance is that solutions in the sphere of incomes and prices should be quick, firm and profound,'' he said. **********Indeed, the keystone of the measures incorporates a drastic overhaul of the centralized system of prices and wages, which officials said could yield markedly higher prices for basic goods and raise the possibility of social unrest. The idea is to link wage levels more closely to company profitability as a spur to efficient operation.

In the last five years, however, artists and young professionals have flooded into the area looking for affordable housing and willing to pay prices that are out of reach for long-time residents but a bargain for people moving from Manhattan. **********Michael D'Annunzio, born and reared in Greenpoint, and his wife, Elina Gonzalez-D'Annunzio of Brooklyn Heights, have scrambled to fill the niche. As a development team, these principals of South Heights Construction have renovated four small vacant apartment buildings - one in Williamsburg and the others in Greenpoint - with the apartments renting for $600 to $800 a month. **********Now they are undertaking their first new construction, a 14-unit condominium building at 102 Guernsey Street, between Norman and Nassau Avenues, a mixed block of residential and commercial buildings. The development is next door to the home of Mr. D'Annunzio's parents and a few houses from his own home. Mr. D'Annunzio's father, Emidio, provided the 6,500-square-foot site, which used to be a parking lot. **********Work on the foundation began last week. The four-story red brick building will be called Florence Courts, after Michael D'Annunzio's mother. **********''We know all the ins and outs of renovation, but this is a new phase for us,'' Mrs. Gonzalez said, pointing at the foundation with its pools of muddy water, as her two young girls skipped on the sidewalk. ''Condos seemed too big time for us. We were small contractors. We're excited, nervous.'' **********The project, apparently the first new condominium building in Greenpoint, is scheduled for completion next summer. Four one-bedroom apartments, eight two-bedrooms and two three-bedrooms, measuring from 600 to 1,000 square feet, will cost from $135,000 to $175,000. The architect is Paul Draskovic of Manhattan. **********The D'Annunzios expect the condominium buyers to have roots in the community. ''Ten years ago my friends didn't want to live here when they moved out of their parents' houses,'' said the 36-year-old Mr. D'Annunzio. ''They moved to suburbia, but when their wives had babies the fact was they couldn't afford to stay there. Now they want to come back, but you can't buy a house here. It's all word-of-mouth, and the cheapest one is $165,000.'' **********Last year the couple finished their most elaborate renovation so far. The four-story turn-of-the-century building at 125 Guernsey Street between Norman and Meserole Avenues (a half block from the condominium site) had been heavily damaged by a fire a few years ago. When their company, South Heights Construction, bought the tan brick building for $25,000 through a request for proposals issued by the Department of Housing Preservation and Developments, the building lacked a roof, stairs and part of the cornice. **********As in their other renovations, they replaced all the mechanical systems, installed new windows and erected new walls, besides restoring the roof and cornice. Today a bright red door leads to a carpeted stairway, off which are eight apartments - four one-bedrooms and four twos with monthly rents ranging from $600 to $800. The building is now full. **********''It's a very young building, and I know almost everyone,'' said Charles Redguard, 22, a pharmaceutical salesman. ''This is ideal for me. I could never find a $600-a-month one-bedroom in Manhattan.'' **********The developers also did the nearby renovation of a four-story brick building at 57 Norman Avenue, at the corner of Guernsey Street, into eight rental units in 1984 and the rehabilitation of a four-story building at 296 Nassau Avenue, off Hausman Street, into nine apartments in 1985. **********Financing for the condominium, as well as 296 Nassau Avenue and 125 Guernsey Street, came from the Community Preservation Corporation, which does market-rate lending in neighborhoods that have a hard time attracting major creditors. The D'Annunzio project represents the 13-year-old company's first new-construction financing. **********''Michael and Elina have demonstrated an ability to take on new challenges,'' said Mary A. Brennan, a Community Preservation vice president. ''It's fair to say that he's a little bit nervous about his first new construction project, and so are we. But the two of them have excelled at bringing projects in ahead of schedule and under budget.'' **********The D'Annunzios are now negotiating with the city's housing agency for development rights to a major site in Williamsburg. The three vacant buildings there, at 28-32 Havemeyer Street off North Seventh Street, would probably yield 32 units - either condominiums or rental apartments."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/28/business/business-digest-saturday-february-28-1987.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 653, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1987", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1987", "body_text": " **********The Economy **********The U.S. suffered a $14.8 billion trade deficit in January as imports flowed at nearly twice the level of exports. The showing was much worse than in December, though not nearly as bad as November's revised $15.4 billion trade gap. Some prominent private economists said the January results were a warning signal that the nation's trade deficit will be hard to turn around, and legislators said the figures were bound to increase the momentum for protectionist legislation.

The rise in the most widely followed inflation gauge exceeded general expectations and prompted some experts to express uneasiness about price trends.

Bowen, a vice chairman of Heidrick & Struggles, recalled, ''We were reluctant to do the search because we had no experience finding college presidents.'' **********Now the firm is so deeply involved in finding presidents, deans, private school principals and other academic officials that it has published its first academic survey. Released last week and titled ''The University and College President,'' it offers a profile of the position. **********The typical president is a white Protestant male, 53 years old, with a doctoral degree; is married and has not been divorced; has an academic background, but not necessarily as a tenured professor, and has held the post about six years. That merely reflects what is, of course. Many universities would be happy to fill openings with qualified candidates from more diverse backgrounds. **********Mr. Bowen cannot recall when there were so many openings for college presidents. ''The tenure of many in office - 40 percent - now is about three years,'' he said. At many schools, however - the Ivy League, the Southwestern conference, and women's colleges including Bryn Mawr, Mount Holyoke, Smith and Wellesley, presidents tend to stay on the job longer than average. **********Some of the most recent comings and goings: Colin Campbell, president of Wesleyan University, announced last week that he was leaving; James O.

Langdon stepped down at Colgate University, and Oakes Ames at Connecticut College. Daniel Berg has left the Rensselaer Polytechnic presidency to return to a tenured professorship.

Mellon Foundation, and has been replaced by Harold T. Shapiro, former president of the University of Michigan. Dr. Howard Swearer is leaving Brown University. **********''I am not sure why so many presidents have stepped aside, but I think it might be a burnout factor, but not the same problems like the sit-ins and riots of the Vietnam period,'' Mr. Bowen said. He explained that independent colleges and universities and a growing number of state-supported schools ask their presidents to be fund-raisers. **********''They don't like to do it year after year,'' he said. ''They become drained.'' **********Facing six dinners this week, Dr. Edward Lewis, president of St. Mary's College, a state-supported liberal arts college in Maryland, agrees about the burnout factor. ''Furthermore, social interaction can be painful for some academics,'' he said. ''Also, we are robbed of time to think.'' **********He said he thought that the opportunities for women presidents were growing but added that there ''has been a belief that fund raising involves working the old-boy network, which cannot be done as well by women as by the typical 53-year-old male president.'' **********He pointed to Dr. Hannah Gray, president of the University of Chicago, as a woman who made the jump to a presidency recently. ''Also there is Dr. Patricia Plante, a former dean at another college, who now is president of one of the University of Maine's units,'' he said. **********Fund raising aside, the life of a college president can be quite pleasant. They usually occupy a mansion on or near campus rent-free. A staff is also provided, which means instant help when entertaining. **********The pay is good, too. The survey indicates that college presidents average $89,450 a year, with some large Eastern universities paying more than $100,000. **********College presidents who responded to the survey said they worked 67 or more hours a week.

In other words, care and feeding of faculty egos takes precedence over the trustees, who win the next highest consideration, and the students, for whom the education is intended. **********For the survey Heidrick & Struggles reached 971 presidents of four-year degree-giving institutions with 1,000 or more students.

Accordingly, they say, both leaders are now dependent on each other. **********But if Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev have developed a personal rapport, and a common political interest, this summit has also demonstrated that they remain rivals in basic ways: for public attention, for press coverage and for influence and prestige around the world. **********The White House is keenly aware of this rivalry, and directed Richard Wirthlin, the President's pollster, to take overnight soundings of public reactions to the first day of the summit talks. One White House aide boasted that ''the President is coming off tremendously'' in the battle for public approval, but that view is not universally shared in the political world. **********Before the summit meeting began, Mr. Reagan joked that he was not worried that Mr. Gorbachev would steal the scene. After all, he noted, he had worked in films with Errol Flynn, the late actor known for his scene-stealing. But some White House aides admit that the Soviet leader has looked more vibrant and animated than Mr. Reagan, particularly in televised discussions with groups of Americans. President Looks Bored **********Mr. Reagan, who uses notecards to prompt his memory for even the most casual remark, would never engage in such an open and wide-ranging discussion. But one White House aide complained that Mr. Gorbachev is being held to a lower standard of performance than Mr. Reagan. **********''It's pretty easy to come in here and make general statements for two hours,'' he said. **********Some guests at the White House dinner Tuesday night thought Mr. Reagan looked bored and distracted at times, sitting silently with his hands in his lap. And the 76-year-old President, 20 years older than the Soviet leader, has kept a much more private schedule during the summit talks, husbanding his strength and energy for the intense exchanges with Mr. Gorbachev. **********The White House is clearly irritated with talk around Washington that Mr. Reagan cannot cope with the demands of the summit. 'Sort of a Touchy-Feely Summit' **********The President's advisers are bothered by the memory of the Reykjavik meeting last year, when Mr. Reagan seemed unprepared for the new arms control proposals advanced by the Russians. **********''The President gets tired of people asking, is he prepared, is he up for this,'' said one of the President's senior advisers. ''There are some in this Administration who are trying to create the impression that the President can't do anything unless they're out there, plowing the ground.'' **********Mr. Reagan's most important problem comes from his longtime conservative supporters, who are openly alarmed at the sight of their longstanding hero bargaining with the leader of what he once called the ''evil empire''. **********One White House official with close ties to the conservative movement, said: ''I hear from people outside who are very, very upset. This is Carter-like, sort of a touchy-feely summit, instead of being specific about the major differences that divide the two countries.'' **********To those conservatives, the aide added, Mr. Reagan is ''too concerned with his place in history,'' and has thus ''gotten soft'' in his views toward the Russians. 'Sober, but at Ease' Approach **********The more common view in the White House, however, is that the summit is going as planned, and that Mr. Gorbachev's strong presence works to enhance Mr. Reagan's as well. In fact, the White House wanted the Soviet leader to meet with Congressional leaders, as he did today, because they thought he would be an effective advocate for the treaty, which must still win Senate approval. **********As for the President's own performance so far, Mr. Reagan's aides said he was doing what he set out to do in his pre-summit planning. **********One aide described his approach as ''sober, but at ease,'' and noted that Mr. Reagan sprinkled his remarks with folksy humor and stories. **********Another aide said Mr. Reagan was effectively conveying the message he wanted to convey. As that adviser put it: ''It's important to make the point over and over again. This shows that peace through strength works.'' **********White House aides are also delighted with the personal chemistry between the two leaders, which has showed itself in humorous public exchanges, as well as in their private chat this morning. **********''These are two superpower leaders,'' said Mr. Fitzwater, ''who know how to sort out the wheat from the chaff. And they know the tough bargaining, and they know the tough talk. But they also know how to deal on personal, friendly relations, and this meeting was part of that.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/14/business/business-people-a-top-treasury-officer-is-going-to-law-firm.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Kilborn", "pub_date": "1987-07-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 310, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Top Treasury Officer Is Going to Law Firm", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; A Top Treasury Officer Is Going to Law Firm", "body_text": " **********J.

AQUINO; Get Business on the Government's Side", "body_text": " **********NEARLY a year after the defeat of Ferdinand Marcos, the Philippine economy remains capital-starved and in trouble - per capita economic growth fell for the second straight year in 1986. Frightened by political instability, both American and Philippine executives continue to withhold new investment. Unfortunately, with the future of the Aquino Government hanging on the performance of the economy, this reluctance has itself become a major source of instability. **********Why the inaction? After all, segments of the Philippine business community proved their daring by taking an early and outspoken stand against the Marcos regime. And American executives murmured in enthusiastic response when President Corazon Aquino called for renewed investment during her triumphant tour of the United States a few months ago. **********Moreover, this is a country wealthy in agricultural lands and natural resources. Its currency has stabilized and the rate of inflation is below that of the United States. Capital flight has slowed. Labor is abundant, competent and inexpensive. Finally, the United States Government, in word and deed, has emphasized its continuing support of the Aquino Administration in its struggle to shape a viable, moderate political mandate. **********Despite these promising aspects, many business leaders apparently fear that the process of political rejuvenation is still incomplete; that, like the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, the Peoples Power drama of last February signaled the beginning and not the end of the revolution. This reasoning is clearly evident in the actions of the ''Filipino-Chinese'' community. **********In the Philippines, as in other Southeast Asian countries, Chinese immigrants and their descendants play a signal role in the economy. The Filipino-Chinese business community is highly sensitive to potential tremors, which accounts for the anomaly of capital flight out of the Philippines peaking in the months before, and not after, the murder of Benigno Aquino in 1983. Regrettably, their fears have yet to fade. Respected members of the Filipino-Chinese community told me recently that funds were not yet returning for direct investments. **********The general concern over instability translates into the specific worry that President Aquino is ill-equipped to deal with the serious and violent threats from both ends of the political spectrum. Perhaps this is a valid anxiety. However, in November Mrs. Aquino clearly demonstrated that she was more the dragon-lady than the housewife when she dealt with the challenge of former Defense Minister Juan Enrile. And it now appears that she would not succumb to accommodations with the Communists, which could lead to their infiltrating and eventually dominating the country's political institutions. **********However, the investment drought may have less to do with politics than with the failure of the Aquino Administration to demonstrate a unified commitment to the private sector and to foreign investment. Mrs. Aquino may sincerely believe in the contributions foreign investors can make to the Philippines. And her competent Ministers of Finance and Trade, Jamie Ongpin and Jose Concepcion, may firmly support a dynamic private sector. But the words and actions of others in the Government make a different impression. For example, the number of strikes in 1986 may exceed by 50 percent those in 1985. A majority of these were instigated by the Communist-controlled Kilusang Mayo Uno, the largest union in the Philippines. But many observers also point a finger at the Minister of Labor, Augusto Sanchez, for his statements attributing economic problems to the private sector and for his criticisms of foreign investors. With an unemployment rate surpassing 30 percent and with underemployment even higher, a Minister of Labor should be more interested in urging businesses to create new jobs than in engaging in irresponsible confrontations. A FURTHER example is provided by the Presidential Commission for Good Government. Established to recover the wealth stolen by President Marcos, his friends and relatives, the commission sometimes appears vengeful and arbitrary, interested more in ''getting even'' than getting money. Assets of targeted companies have been sequestered, apparently to force them into quick cash settlements and to avoid a drawn-out legal process during which the sequestered assets would diminish in value. These actions are destructive of the business climate, not to speak of the companies in question and their thousands of employees. **********While the alleged billions of dollars stolen by Mr. Marcos would go far in reviving the crippled economy, the Government cannot look upon the money as a quick fix. Legal and administrative roadblocks in the Philippines, the United States, Switzerland and other foreign countries make recovery a frustrating, long-term task. **********As bleak as the economic situation may seem, there are several immediate steps the Aquino administration can take to regain the initiative. **********First, her administration should speak in a single voice in defining the moral and operational terms in which foreign investors can function in the Philippines. Business can live with constraints and risks, as long as they are clearly stated. It is Mrs. Aquino's prerogative to have Cabinet ministers openly hostile to the private sector or to foreign investors certainly, but such voices are a costly luxury at a time of great unemployment and economic stagnation. **********Second, realizing that the Marcos wealth will not be recovered quickly, the commission should concentrate its recovery efforts overseas. Its activities in the Philippines should be limited strictly to instances where there is clear and promptly confirmable evidence that the Marcos family and cronies were hidden owners. **********Lastly, the Government should open talks about the United States military bases. The rental price for the facilities at Clark Field and Subic Bay Naval Station should be determined on the basis of ''market value.'' Just what are the Russians paying for Camranh Bay in Vietnam and for secret airfields in Cambodia? If their rental is $1 billion a year, then the United States should be asked to pay $1 billion a year for its bases in the Philippines (we are now paying $900 million over five years). These funds could be applied in part to the retirement of the $26 billion Philippine foreign debt. Moreover, management of the non-military aspects of the bases should be transferred to a civilian corporation, which would be a joint venture of American and Philippine companies. **********Foreign investment in concert with a confident domestic private sector has been a winning combination in many Asian countries and could work in the Philippines. However, President Aquino must demonstrate a commitment to this approach. Meanwhile, American and Filipino businessmen will watch and wait."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/29/world/shultz-meets-with-leader-of-rebels-in-south-africa.html": {"writer_name": "David Shipler", "pub_date": "1987-01-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 747, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SHULTZ MEETS WITH LEADER OF REBELS IN SOUTH AFRICA", "print_headline": "SHULTZ MEETS WITH LEADER OF REBELS IN SOUTH AFRICA", "body_text": " **********Oliver Tambo, the head of the African National Congress, called on Secretary of State George P.

It also was an indication that the United States recognizes the A.N.C. as a central factor in the South Africa struggle and is willing to engage in discussions with the organization. **********The State Department did not allow news photographers into the session, although an official State Department photographer took pictures. Mr. Redman said that it was not customary for news photographers to be present during meetings that did not involve foreign ministers or other officials of a foreign government. But it is not unusual for photographers to take pictures before or after such sessions. **********Mr. Shultz held the meeting amid criticism from conservatives, who have condemned the Congress as a pro-Soviet terrorist organization. The Secretary addressed these two issues at the outset of the discussions, according to Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman. He said that Mr. Shultz had ''laid out our concerns about the degree of Soviet influence in the A.N.C.'' and the group's use of violence. 'Very Serious' Meeting **********Mr. Tambo, who makes his headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, called it ''a very serious and substantive meeting,'' and Mr. Redman used the same characterization. **********''We found there was a large area of agreement on the nature of the apartheid system, on the need to abolish it, and we are considering together the ways of achieving this,'' Mr. Tambo said. He criticized the Administration's ''constructive engagement'' policy, under which Washington has sought to exert quiet pressure on South Africa, as ''unhelpful'' in combating apartheid. **********Although Mr. Shultz's stated purpose was to explore the possibility of an American role as a broker in the South African conflict, State Department officials acknowledged that the meeting was largely symbolic and, in part, an effort to defuse criticism of American policy by black African leaders. **********Mr. Redman emphasized the Secretary's desire ''to work with all of the parties, to bring them together so they can start talking.'' The South African authorities have refused to negotiate with the African National Congress. Relations at a Low Point **********The session with Mr. Shultz comes at a time when relations between Washington and Pretoria are at a low point and American influence with the South African Government appears practically nonexistent. **********In an unusual show of force, dozens of uniformed policemen were stationed in and around the diplomatic entrance to the State Department, and the adjoining street was closed to traffic along the full length of the building. **********Mr. Shultz's decision to meet with Mr. Tambo drew strong criticism from the Conservative Caucus, which condemned the A.N.C. for both its use of violence and its ties to the Soviet Union. Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, said yesterday that he feared that the session would be seen as showing approval for terrorism. Use of Violence Endorsed **********During his visit to Washington, Mr. Tambo has endorsed the use of violence in the struggle against apartheid. **********''Apartheid is inherently a practice of violence,'' he said yesterday in a speech at Georgetown University. ''We choose not to submit but to fight back, arms in hand. We have no alternative but to intensify our armed resistance because, as your Declaration of Independence says, in the face of systematic tyranny, it becomes a duty and a right to take up arms.'' **********He told reporters that the A.N.C. was indebted to the Soviet Union for providing arms, but he stressed that non-military assistance had also come from Norway, Sweden, Italy, the Netherlands and other Western countries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/26/world/us-to-send-official-delegation-to-observe-haiti-s-voting-sunday.html": {"writer_name": "Elaine Sciolino", "pub_date": "1987-11-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 625, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "List", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. to Send Official Delegation To Observe Haiti's Voting Sunday", "print_headline": "U.S. to Send Official Delegation To Observe Haiti's Voting Sunday", "body_text": " **********President Reagan will send an official delegation to Haiti this weekend to observe its first presidential election in 30 years, the White House announced today. **********The delegation, which includes members of Congress and representatives of labor, business, education, churches and the law, will observe the election at polling places around the country. **********The decision, which has been expected for some weeks, puts Haiti's military on notice that the United States is firmly behind a free and fair election and will support the civilian government that emerges. **********The observers ''carry with them my hope and confidence in Haiti's success,'' Mr. Reagan said in a statement issued by the White House.

They said that embassy staff members were assigned to watch sensitive areas at night to supplement the marines. Least Prepared for Soviet Stay **********Of all the Americans here - diplomats, military officers, business executives, journalists, students and scholars -the marines seem least prepared for their stay in the Soviet Union. They are generally in their early 20's, unversed in Russian and unfamiliar with the nation's culture. Unlike most Americans, who at least try to interact with Soviet society, the marines focus exclusively on embassy affairs. **********They are discouraged from mixing with Russians, instructed to travel in pairs and obliged to turn for entertainment to the English-speaking community. **********While most seem to adjust and make the best of their circumscribed world, some become bored and lonely, developing a tendency - for sheer excitement, if nothing else - to deal with the very world they are told to avoid. **********That is apparently what happened in the spy case, where one marine, Sgt. Clayton J. Lonetree, was reportedly seduced by a woman who was a Soviet agent engaged in custodial work at the embassy. **********The marines guard the embassy's main entrance and the ninth floor with its sensitive areas, patrolling the grounds and serving as firefighters. The unit is headed by a gunnery sergeant, who reports to the civilian security officer at the embassy. **********Other Western embassies use experienced security forces, often drawn from the ranks of intelligence services, and consider the American system less reliable. **********''No one has all the answers, but it invites trouble to turn over security to a group of young men who are more suited for combat than for guard duty,'' a Western European diplomat said. **********The marines, while not mixing socially with senior diplomats, seem well integrated into the younger community of diplomats and students. **********Their social world revolves around a cluster of Western nightspots, including ''Uncle Sam's,'' an informal bar and discotheque set up evenings in the embassy snack bar, similar operations at other embassies and, on Saturday nights, the foreign currency bar and discotheque at the Cosmos Hotel. **********For female companionship, they turn mainly to ''nannies,'' a British term used here for young foreign women who are employed by Western residents to take care of their children. **********Since last fall, the marines have been housed in a barracks in a new embassy compound, and have access to recreational areas in the compound, including an indoor pool, gymnasium and bowling alley. Past Black Market Problems **********The espionage case is not the only trouble to strike the Marine contingent. American diplomats said that four marines were sent home this year after they became involved in trading money on the black market. In a separate case, two marines were withdrawn when a Western woman said they had raped her. **********Several nannies said that Marine parties often turned wild and that they were frightened at times by the aggressive behavior of the Americans. **********Diplomats who knew Sergeant Lonetree described him as an isolated figure who never seemed comfortable in the embassy. **********They said the man arrested as his accomplice, Cpl. Arnold Bracy, was friendly with many members of the American community and displayed curiosity about Soviet life, sometimes joining other Americans for dinner at restaurants. **********''Arnold was one of the first marines here who ever wore a Russian fur hat,'' a friend recalled. **********A British nanny said that Marine drills had increased and that access to the embassy was restricted for a period on Friday evening as the marines conducted a security exercise. **********''There are not any Marine parties this weekend,'' she said.

The merger wave is continuing to roil key industries. Slow, or non-existent, growth and falling prices are forcing some sectors into a new pragmatism. **********In oil, commercial real estate and agriculture, owners are becoming more willing to sell out at what seem to be fire-sale prices.

Investment-minded doctors in Des Moines and lawyers in Chicago, hoping that the agricultural cycle has bottomed out, are buying up land. **********While they wait for land prices to rise, these investors are renting out the land to farmers, some of whom already have their own farms, some of whom are merely tenant farmers.

Schnittker, a former Under Secretary of Agriculture. **********Overcapacity in rural America is making this absentee ownership possible. With the nation's grain exports having plummeted since the glory days of the 1970's, agricultural overcapacity has resulted in dismally low grain prices. This is slowly and painfully squeezing out marginal operators. The shakeout will cause the number of commercial farmers to fall to 450,000 in five years, down from 600,000 now, says Mr. Schnittker. **********If there is a silver lining to all this, it is that the upheaval will force American farm goods, helped by the weaker dollar, to become more competitive on world markets: Farmers who survive will be able to produce at lower prices. **********Still, no one expects agricultural America to make great strides over the next few years in regaining lost market share in the global grain trade - unless there are major commodity shortages in China, the Soviet Union or elsewhere. Much capacity has been added in competing countries like Brazil and Australia. And many nations are heavily subsidizing their farm sectors, though there will be stepped-up pressure to reduce those subsidies in future trade talks. **********Says John K. Hosemann, senior economist with the American Farm Bureau: ''We built this mess we're in over six to eight years, and it will probably take six to eight to work it out.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/06/business/analysts-urge-caution-in-wake-of-market-surge.html": {"writer_name": "Calvin Sims", "pub_date": "1987-04-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 525, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ANALYSTS URGE CAUTION IN WAKE OF MARKET SURGE", "print_headline": "ANALYSTS URGE CAUTION IN WAKE OF MARKET SURGE", "body_text": " **********Although the stock market ended the week on a very high note after beginning it on a sour one, individual investors should remain cautious in their buying, according to analysts interviewed over the weekend. **********''One should not panic during a decline or grow overly euphoric during advances,'' said Larry Wachtel, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. ''When all is lost, buy. And when all is wonderful, don't buy. Don't be dictated by the pressure.'' **********Some market professionals have been expecting a significant correction in the market and had thought that the 57.39-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average last Monday might have been the start of one.

Stable Rates Cited **********As long as the economy continues to show modest growth and the dollar and interest rates remain relatively stable, the stock market will not suffer a damaging plunge, at least not without some significant warning, the analysts said. **********The market tumbled early last week on fears that the falling dollar would decline even further and that interest rates would rise as a result, but as those tensions subsided by week's end, the relieved market soared. **********Investors tracking the ebb and flow of those tensions should not limit themselves to just strong stocks or stay too long in one group, the analysts said. They said investors should also consider cyclical and emerging growth stocks, such as drugs, paper, chemicals and technology, and not just the insurance and utility stocks that are the staples of many portfolios. Flat Second Half Possible **********Many securities analysts have adopted the view that the current uptrend in the stock market will not stop simply on a random day or in response to a single news event. Instead, they said, stock prices will probably flatten in the second half of the year, when the current season of liquidity changes. **********It is this liquidity factor, which stems from increased foreign buying, as well as investors pumping money into Individual Retirement Accounts and mutual funds, that has helped fuel the market. Analysts predicted that this situation will not change until later in the year. **********Analysts also predicted an overall improvement in corporate profits this year, which should help stock prices. This improvement will be mainly the result of a decrease in foreign competition as the weaker dollar makes foreign products, particularly Japanese items, more expensive. **********In addition, the weaker dollar makes American goods cheaper, which should allow American manufacturers to set up or recapture markets overseas.

Volcker met last Tuesday with Howard H. Baker Jr., the White House chief of staff, he delivered a message without equivocation: After two terms, he wanted out as the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. **********But no one, including Mr. Baker and President Reagan, thought he was serious. That conclusion prompted several days of behind-the-scenes drama that ended today when Mr. Reagan announced that Mr. Volcker would not stay on when his term expires in August. **********White House officials replaying the drama provided these details: *********** While Mr. Volcker had reason to think that Mr. Reagan would reappoint him, he never heard this directly from the President. Mr. Volcker apparently interpreted the President's unwillingness to make a direct appeal as a sign that, while Mr. Reagan did not want to dismiss the central banker, he did not really want him to stay on. *********** The process leading to the selection of a new Federal Reserve chairman, which had been a source of speculation for months, took place in less than a week. Mr. Baker had the key role, first in trying to dissuade Mr. Volcker from leaving, then in the selection of the New York economist Alan Greenspan over two other candidates - John Whitehead, the Deputy Secretary of State, and Beryl W. Sprinkel, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. The only other top Administration official actively involved was Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d. *********** Mr. Reagan chose Mr. Greenspan nearly on the spot after his name was put forward by Mr. Volcker as his first choice. The President offered the job to Mr. Greenspan, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, about an hour after receiving Mr. Volcker's resignation. **********Officials said the first indication of Mr. Volcker's intentions came last Tuesday when he met with the White House chief of staff to discuss his plans. At the private meeting, Mr. Volcker said he did not want to stay past August, a decision that had not been tipped to senior White House officials, one Reagan aide said. **********But the aide said that Mr. Baker had nevertheless already consulted the President on Mr. Volcker's reappointment and that the President had supported it. Thus, he conveyed to Mr. Volcker the message that Mr. Reagan planned to ask him to stay on and that he should rethink his decision. **********However, people close to Mr. Volcker suggested that attempts at persuasion were minimal and that no offer came directly from the President. **********Nonetheless, as Mr. Volcker went off on a four-day fishing trip to think about what he would do, White House officials said they were convinced that he would reconsider. They expected him to tell the President that he would accept a third term. **********Adding confusion to the events, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that a senior White House official said he would not lead reporters ''off'' predicting reappointment. An Administration official made a similar point in an article in The New York Times today. **********But Mr. Volcker's intentions became clear when he met with the President in the Oval Office at about 4 o'clock on Monday afternoon. Howard Baker and James Baker were also at the session, which lasted about an hour. Mr. Volcker arrived with a letter that indicated he did not want to be reappointed, one official said. **********''I want to make it very clear that the President would have been very, very pleased had the chairman's decision been otherwise,'' Secretary Baker said today. ''And it's quite clear, I think, that this is what the chairman wanted to do and thinks he should do.'' **********But officials familiar with the meeting said Mr. Reagan made no effort to persuade Mr. Volcker to remain after he announced that he did not want a third term. Mr. Reagan then elicited advice from the chairman on possible successors. **********By the account of the officials, Mr. Volcker said his first choice was Mr. Greenspan, regarded in financial circles as a ''pragmatic ideologue,'' who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Ford Administration. The Fed chairman's second choice was Mr. Whitehead. **********According to one official, Howard Baker put forth Mr. Sprinkel's name, but only as a courtesy. In the end, Mr. Reagan decided on Mr. Greenspan and called him at about 5 o'clock. **********The Volcker development is reminiscent of the situation involving Howard Baker when he was considered recently for the position of Director of Central Intelligence before the selection of William H. Webster. **********At that time, associates of Mr. Baker had said he would have accepted the post had he been asked by the President. However, Donald T. Regan, the chief of staff at the time, had informed Mr. Reagan that Mr. Baker was not interested, and no Presidential appeal came."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/01/world/defense-aide-rejects-concept-of-a-world-free-of-atomic-arms.html": {"writer_name": "John Cushman", "pub_date": "1987-02-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 346, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DEFENSE AIDE REJECTS CONCEPT OF A WORLD FREE OF ATOMIC ARMS", "print_headline": "DEFENSE AIDE REJECTS CONCEPT OF A WORLD FREE OF ATOMIC ARMS", "body_text": " **********A senior Pentagon official today called suggestions that the world could some day be free of nuclear weapons an absurd folly.

Two and a half hours later, the executive board received a letter from Senegal's President requesting that Mr. M'Bow's candidacy be withdrawn.  [ In Washington, a State Department spokesman said the department had no comment either on Mr. M'Bow's plan to withdraw or on his tenure at Unesco.

''We are not currently members of Unesco,'' he said, ''and I will not speculate on what we might do in the future.'' ]  Although several Unesco delegates at first thought Mr. M'Bow's withdrawal might be part of a strategy to rally African support, others said the two letters together made clear that Mr. M'Bow's candidacy was dead. **********His withdrawal would end the tenure of one of the most controversial, tough-minded leaders of any international organization.

Clear Support for Rival **********Over the last few days, several African and Soviet-bloc delegates had urged Mr. M'Bow to withdraw gracefully in order to reduce the contentiousness within Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. **********Several delegates said Mr. M'Bow decided to request that his name be withdrawn only after it became clear that a majority of the 50-member executive board supported Mr. Mayor, 53 years old. Mr. Mayor, is a native of Barcelona and a biochemistry professor. A member of the European Parliament, he was Unesco's Deputy Director General under Mr. M'Bow from 1978 to 1981. **********On the executive board's fourth ballot, taken on Wednesday, Mr. M'Bow received 21 votes and Mr. Mayor 19 for the $170,000-a-year job, which has a term of six years. Mr. M'Bow was backed principally by Arab and African nations. Mr. Mayor had the official support of Japan and most European and Latin American nations and the unofficial backing of the United States and Britain. **********Many delegates predicted that in the fifth ballot, scheduled for tonight, Mr. Mayor would pick up most of the 10 votes that had gone to three other minor candidates. By Unesco rules, the fifth ballot is limited to the top two candidates in the fourth round of voting. **********At midnight, board members were still arguing over procedure and had still not cast the fifth ballot. **********The United States and Britain have long said that even if Mr. M'Bow is succeeded by someone more to their liking, they would not automatically rejoin Unesco. Funds Eroded **********The United States quit Unesco in 1984 and Britain left the next year. Their withdrawals, combined, slashed Unesco's funding about 30 percent. **********American and British officials have said they would only rejoin the organization if there were substantial changes in Unesco's programs and structure. Among other things, they contend that the countries that contribute more of Unesco's budget should have more of a say in shaping the organization's activities. **********In addition, West Germany, Canada, Switzerland, Denmark, Japan and the Netherlands have threatened to resign if substantial changes were not brought about within the organization. Their withdrawals would reduce the organization's $159 million annual funding another 30 percent. **********Mr. Mayor has pledged to restructure Unesco in an effort to woo back the countries that quit the organization. **********In his withdrawal letter, Mr. M'Bow protested that some member nations had ''perverted the democratic process'' by threatening to quit or not pay their annual contributions. Speculation on New Candidacy **********Several Western delegates interpreted Mr. M'Bow's letter as intended to protest the executive board's nomination process, perhaps in the hope of overturning its recommendation when Unesco's 158-nation General Conference, its highest body, meets in early November. **********As the executive board meeting continued late Saturday night, several delegates said they expected Mr. Mayor to win enough support within the board so that he would have little problem obtaining the General Conference's backing. **********However, many delegates did not rule out the possibility that despite his withdrawal letter, Mr. M'Bow might seek somehow to revive his candidacy. They remember Mr. M'Bow's statement last year that he would not stand for re-election if his candidacy were to prove divisive - a statement that led many to believe he would not run for an unprecedented third term.

Trends have rushed in this summer with more force than a mid-August storm. **********One of the hottest consumer items is a small electronic bread maker that costs about $250. It is being snapped up by a rapidly growing number of people who, despite the traditional rice culture, feel that breakfast is incomplete without a freshly baked loaf of bread. **********Other Japanese, unfazed by high import duties that push the price of a quart of imported Scotch to $50 or $60, are willing to pay extra for special ice to pour their liquor over. One company has turned a neat profit this summer with polar ice, shipped from Antarctica and sold for $2.40 a pound. **********Connoisseurs say they like a distinctive crackling of the ice as it melts. Frenzy Over Telephone Cards **********But for depth of passion and breadth of numbers, nothing compares with a telephone-card collecting frenzy that has become an expensive mania involving millions of people. **********The card, a magnetized piece of plastic about the size of a credit card, can be inserted into the slots of special pay phones. With a 500-yen card, a customer gets 50 units of 10-yen phone calls. Ten yen, or about 6 cents, is the basic charge for a local call, which makes it one of the few items one can get in Japan without having to contemplate bankruptcy. **********When a card is used up, it is to be thrown away. But suddenly, sensing that there is money to be made, more and more of the millions of Japanese card buyers are holding onto these bits of plastic. **********About 500,000 Japanese have become serious collectors of the cards, trading them like stamps and paying many hundreds of dollars for any card considered especially valuable. #40,000 Different Types Telephone cards are not unique to Japan. But other countries usually have only one basic design. Here, with money to burn for such frills, the variety seems endless. **********By one expert count, at least 40,000 different types have gone into circulation since the first card was issued in December 1982 by Teleca, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation. Hundreds of new cards flood the market each week as businesses and individuals design their own for advertising purposes or for sheer vanity. **********Cards bear company logos and store names and addresses. There are cards with pictures of just about everything: pets, pop stars, Mount Fuji, sumo wrestlers, Tokyo Bay, the Princess of Wales, plum blossoms, samurai figures, pornographic models, political slogans and James Dean. **********Politicians issue cards bearing their photographs as fund-raising gimmicks. Unions produced special cards recently to help promote their annual organized campaign for wage increases. Antismoking groups did the same. **********Even organized-crime groups like the cards. Police officials in Nagoya were dismayed not long ago when a local crime clan issued a telephone card bearing its name and symbol. Collectors Form Associations **********Collectors have decided that for one reason or another - relative scarcity, unusual designs, printing errors - some of these cards are worth far more than the basic 500 yen. To trade with one another, they have banded together in at least five asssociations in Tokyo alone. Some are specialists, such as the fellow who collects nothing but pictures of hotels and inns. **********Japan's King of Cards is a slight, bookish-looking man named Hidetaka Matsuda, who says that when he last counted he had 5,000 of the cards. Operating out of an apartment in northern Tokyo, he writes a column for a monthly magazine that collectors use as a guide to the latest hot items and their prices. **********Mr. Matsuda's own prize is a rare card bearing the photo of a pop singer named Yuki Saito. He bought it a year ago for the equivalent of $660 and figures that its value has since doubled, making it probably the most expensive card in Japan. Other pop stars also sell for $1,000 or more. **********''We never imagined that things would get like this,'' said a senior phone company official, Koichi Fujisawa. ''The reason we came up with telephone cards was to provide better service to our customers. We never thought they would lead to manic collectors.'' Rich Source of Additional Profits **********Not that he is complaining. For Nippon Telegraph and Telephone the cards have proved a smashing success, worth $620 million in sales in 1986. **********The company expects to sell 200 million cards this year, compared with 148 million last year, 60 million the year before and only 9.4 million the year before that. That means there will be roughly two cards sold for every Japanese, including those too young to reach the dial on a pay phone and those too lonely to have anyone to call. **********While there is no end in sight for the card-collection fad, it could slow down. But it is a safe bet that something new will turn up, perhaps $1,300 waterbeds, which suddenly have caught on even though most houses are too small to accommodate them comfortably. **********Some businessmen found this summer that people are not beyond spending money on air. One company does a brisk business selling oxygen in a can - $16.60 for a five-minute supply. And the oxygen does not last as long as a tumbler of crackling polar ice."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/22/business/market-turmoil-the-investors-small-investors-seize-the-moment-hunt-for-deals.html": {"writer_name": "Sam Verhovek", "pub_date": "1987-10-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 671, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Small Investors Seize the Moment, Hunt for Deals", "print_headline": "MARKET TURMOIL: THE INVESTORS; Small Investors Seize the Moment, Hunt for Deals", "body_text": " **********As the stock ticker flashed by at a crowded discount brokerage firm in Los Angeles yesterday afternoon, Ray Bachar studied the numbers for several minutes, trying to decide what to do. **********''I'm looking for an opportunity within the volatility,'' said the 41-year-old resident of Huntington Beach, Calif, who settled on a small investment in the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. In his opinion, the company's stock had been undervalued by the market's decline last week and its free fall on Monday. **********Like Mr. Bachar, millions of small investors were looking for opportunity in the midst of volatility. With so many people aggressively seeking bargains, there was little sign of the kind of panic selling that some had feared would develop, analysts said. 'Vastly More Confidence' **********''The realities are that the small client is testing the waters, and confidence does appear to be coming back,'' said Philip Waxelbaum, national sales manager for Prudential-Bache Securities. ''There was vastly more confidence in the system today than there was on Tuesday.'' **********To be sure, many small investors remained somewhat shellshocked by the events of the last few days and sat tight on their holdings. ''Right now, I'm not doing anything - the market's just too crazy,'' said Joe Polimeni, a 33-year-old photographer for United Press International, who checked the ticker at lunchtime at Olde Discount Brokers in Detroit. **********But the fact that even nervous investors were choosing to take no action at all, rather than to sell - to ''take the shot and hang tough,'' in the words of one investor - seemed to reflect confidence in the market. 'Large Sigh of Relief' **********''There seems to be a large sigh of relief, for the moment,'' said Bill Sullivan, director of individual financial services for Merrill Lynch. **********''The average small investor did not panic,'' Mr. Waxelbaum said. ''Interestingly enough, a very large number of them have been nonchalant. They're saying that something like this was to be expected as a correctional action.'' **********Moreover, the perception that there are bargains to be had led many people to brokerage firms to place buy orders - some for the first time. **********Some observers even wondered whether a few small investors were overdoing it. ''We see a large increase in greed here - we're seeing people throwing money fast and hard, and maybe without thinking,'' Thomas J. Czech, first vice president for research at Blunt Ellis & Loewi Inc., a Milwaukee-based firm, told The Associated Press. **********Whether they were buying, selling or just watching, people at brokerages across the country expressed fascination with the week's events. **********Many people complained that they had effectively lost money because their orders had taken so long to execute, because of the extremely high market volume this week, and others said they were waiting for confirmations on orders they had placed as long ago as Friday. Conversely, the question of timeliness had other investors praying that their orders had never been processed at all. No Bullish Stampede **********Despite the more optimistic mood that was prevalent yesterday, many analysts said they did not expect a sustained bull market anytime soon. **********''There's still a lot of concern out there. The average investor is not rushing back into the market, and we're not suggesting that they rush back into the market,'' said Mr. Sullivan of Merrill Lynch. **********Indeed, there was perhaps more preoccupation with the economy in general than with particular stocks, and several investors said they were heartened by indications that the Federal Reserve Board would act to prevent a recession - by encouraging lower interest rates - rather than fight inflation. **********''I'd rather be employed and have inflation than be unemployed,'' said John Hawley, a real-estate manager for an oil company in Los Angeles."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/14/business/finance-new-issues-pennsylvania-conducts-postponed-bond-sale.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 180, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pennsylvania Conducts Postponed Bond Sale", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Pennsylvania Conducts Postponed Bond Sale", "body_text": " **********The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which delayed a proposed debt financing on April 21 because of unfavorable market conditions, sold about $154 million of bonds yesterday through the First Boston Corporation. **********The bonds, rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and AA- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, were offered with yields ranging from 5 percent in 1988 to 5.90 percent in 1992, 6.70 percent in 1997, 7.40 percent in 2002 and 7.60 percent in 2006 and 2007. **********Interest rates on long-term tax-exempt bonds are now equal to or higher than what they were when the state postponed its sale.

While United States officials concede that the Iranians are softening their tone, they say they would be astonished if Iran accepted a cease-fire. Iranian to Speak at U.N.  To press Iran's case, President Ali Khamenei, one of the four highest-ranking Iranian leaders, will address the United Nations on Tuesday. **********According to Iranian officials, Mr. Khamenei will seek to show what an Iranian official described as the ''human face of Iran,'' emphasizing that his country is a victim in a war that destroyed cities, killed and maimed hundreds of thousands of Iranians and made many more refugees. **********Iranian officials say Teheran has been careful not to attack Western naval vessels in the gulf and has toned down its demands for the overthrow of the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein. Among other efforts, the Iranian President, who is a severe hard-liner, will meet American reporters privately and publicly and appear on television news shows in the United States - the country Iran refers to as the Great Satan. **********But Iranian officials and independent experts say that a ''war lobby'' in Iran makes it hard for the country's leadership to turn abruptly to peace. **********Gary Sick, an Iran expert formerly on the National Security Council, said the growing domestic Iranian weapon industry, which supplies from 60 to 75 percent of Iran's needs, and the militant Revolutionary Guards, who are fighting the war, have an interest in carrying on with it.

**********Excerpts from an interview with Martin E. Marty, a professor of history of modern Christianity at the University of Chicago: **********IN recent years I've had a funny feeling in any city, Houston, anywhere. You go past 15 or 20 miles of aluminum and steel and glass and you find people doing things in those buildings with paper. And they're doing it in an economy in which fewer things are being produced than 30 years ago. They're not building transistors or forging steel. They're advertising transistors and steel products manufactured elsewhere. **********I'd often get the feeling that we really have invented a marvelous fiction that we're all very very serious and very grim but there's really not a lot to it. We get up early in the morning, compete like mad, drive around the country, as if we were really producing something, and yet if you take an ironist's view you could almost say it is a game and it is based on a fiction. We take it seriously, just as we take the rules of pro football seriously, as if it were real. **********This week I've had the sense that people feel they've changed the rules - or that it was a game. When people play the horses or buy a lottery ticket they expect to lose. But in the stock market people are gambling and betting all the time. And when they lose, they feel cheated instead of waking up and saying life should normally cheat you. **********After Monday I don't know of any people saying they are going to put their money only in a coffee can. People are easily assuaged. We have all the props that were invented since 1929. But in a sense you have a different perspective on life, less sense of security, a feeling that you can't rely on things. **********From the viewpoint of someone who studies religion and culture, my interest is in the games we invent, the facades behind which we live, the subtle contracts we make to ward off chaos, which is what religions are. **********And Monday was chaos. Suddenly all these things we think we have ordered and channeled and domesticated impinge on each other. **********There's a funny side to it. It was unstoppable. Program buyouts were in the computers and you couldn't introduce human rationality to stem it. All of us were trying to reach our brokers, the frantic people on the floor. If you came from another culture you'd have to say they have a funny game in America."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/26/business/personal-finance-a-time-to-settle-up-with-uncle-sam.html": {"writer_name": "Carole Gould", "pub_date": "1987-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1207, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Time to Settle Up With Uncle Sam", "print_headline": "PERSONAL FINANCE; A Time to Settle Up With Uncle Sam", "body_text": " **********THE Internal Revenue Service is putting the pressure on taxpayers to settle continuing disputes. In late May, the I.R.S. began a formal program to clear up a backlog of tax-shelter cases by offering 75,000 investors a one-shot chance to settle. And in all cases, taxpayers are finding it is increasingly expensive to fight: Last year the penalty for substantial understatement of tax jumped to 25 percent of the tax owed from 10 percent. The fraud penalty has risen to 75 percent from 50 percent. ''The growth of penalties, in number and size, is putting a premium on resolving problems more quickly,'' said Gary K. Shelton, a San Francisco attorney. **********Last year's Tax Reform Act provides an additional settlement incentive by phasing out the deduction for personal interest. While all interest on overdue taxes could be deducted in 1986, only 65 percent can be written off this year, and the deduction will be phased out completely by 1991. **********Higher price tags notwithstanding, ''disputes have become more frequent,'' said Leon Nad, a partner with Price Waterhouse. At the same time, both the agency and taxpayers are becoming ''more litigious'' and showing ''less inclination to settle'' than in the past, he said. **********One exception is carved out for tax-shelter cases. ''The new tax act put most tax shelters out of business, which makes it psychologically easier,'' for the I.R.S. to settle existing disputes, knowing they will not recur, said Sheldon S. Cohen, a partner with the Washington law firm of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius. **********Growing numbers of disputes are prompted by bills appearing in taxpayers' mailboxes. Now that the much publicized I.R.S. computer snafus of a few years ago have largely been corrected, the system automatically kicks out bills when, for example, dividends or interest paid by banks and mutual funds, or amounts on a W-2, do not match the income reported on taxpayers' returns. **********But most tax controversies still begin with audit notices. Taxpayers receive a form letter, asking them to meet with an examiner. The main function of I.R.S. auditors at this level is to establish facts - whether an expense should be treated as investment interest or personal interest, for example - but on occasion they will negotiate a compromise settlement. **********Auditors are least likely to negotiate a settlement on items that require documentation - the allocation of business and personal use of an automobile, for instance, or the value of property donated to charity. Experts say this trend may be attributable to the tough new documentation requirements written into the recent tax law. Other unlikely candidates for settlement: recurring items that will turn up on a taxpayer's return in future years - depreciation, for example - or issues for which the national office has not yet set up a formal policy. **********Does it pay to hire a professional to represent you at an audit? Around New York, accountants' hourly fees average $75 to $125; lawyers may charge $100 to $200 an hour or more. Mr. Shelton advises using accountants for cases worth less than $5,000, and estimates that it takes about eight hours to review the papers and handle the interview. His rule of thumb: Pay a professional if the fees will not exceed 25 percent of your potential tax liability. (These fees are combined with other miscellaneous itemized expenses and may be deducted to the extent they exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income.) Taxpayers who fail to settle with an examiner may take their cases to the I.R.S. appeals office. Appeals officers are senior employees who have more discretion to settle cases and may take into account a taxpayer's chances of success in court. Thus, an appeals officer who estimates that the I.R.S. would have a 60 percent chance of winning in court might offer to settle a $5,000 dispute for $2,000. **********While about 85 percent of disputes are settled at this level, ''the appeals office is not a bargain basement,'' advised Laurence Keiser of Hanigsberg, Stern & Keiser, a New York accounting firm. To discourage nuisance cases, the I.R.S. has an unwritten 80/20 rule, Mr. Keiser says, so if you estimate you have ''less than a 20 percent chance of winning in court, forget it.'' **********PROFESSIONAL fees rise as you move through the system. Mr. Keiser estimates that an average appeals case costs $1,500 to $2,500, to pay for a lawyer to evaluate the case, review the file, prepare a written protest (required where the disputed tax exceeds $2,500) and attend the conference. But ''if the appeals officer has the sense that the lawyer handling the case will litigate, that will be worth a couple of points in the settlement negotiations,'' he said. **********The costs of refusing a settlement offer may be substantial. ''Interest and penalties used to be a minor consideration,'' Mr. Shelton said. ''Now, they could almost double your payment on a longstanding problem.'' **********Tax reform also phases out the deduction for personal interest, impelling cost-conscious taxpayers to settle now instead of next year. In 1987, top- bracket taxpayers pay 38.5 percent. Since 65 percent of interest is deductible this year, each dollar of interest paid reduces the Federal tax bill 25 cents. In 1988, that will drop to a maximum tax savings of 11 cents on the dollar. **********Some people may want to hedge their bets by paying the disputed tax as they negotiate a settlement. This stops interest from running and creates an interest deduction. A word of caution: before paying, ask the I.R.S. to formally assess the tax. If you don't, you get the money back if you win the case - but without interest. **********Be aware that it may simply be uneconomical to litigate. While a special small-claims procedure lets tax-court litigants handle their own cases, the costs in time can be heavy. Those who hire lawyers can run up a $10,000 to $15,000 bill, experts say. **********Finally, consider the human element. ''At some point, you may get tired of living with an audit,'' said Sheldon Ganis, a partner with Oppenheim, Appel, Dixon & Company. ''It may be worthwhile to take the settlement and say enough is enough.''  MONEY IN THE MAILBOX **********Even taxpayers who waited until April 15 to file their returns should have received their refunds by now: Checks are mailed out 10 to 12 weeks after the return is filed, said Robert Kobel, an I.R.S. spokesman. If the agency is dragging its feet in your case, you can check the status of your refund by calling 1-800-554-4477. And take heart: When the refund is received more than 45 days after the return was filed, you receive interest - now at 8 percent - on the money."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/16/world/gunmen-in-the-punjab-kill-6-independence-day-toll-at-13.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 187, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gunmen in the Punjab Kill 6; Independence Day Toll at 13", "print_headline": "Gunmen in the Punjab Kill 6; Independence Day Toll at 13", "body_text": " **********Two gunmen raided two villages in Punjab state today and opened fire at random, killing six people and wounding at least three, the Press Trust of India said. **********The killings, coinciding with the 40th anniversary of India's independence, raised the death toll in the 24-hour-period to 13. **********Extremists had stepped up their attacks ahead of independence day celebrations, and security in New Delhi had been tightened. **********In the attacks today, two men believed to be Sikh extremists raided the town in Kapurthala district, indiscriminately firing on villagers from a motorscooter. **********On Friday, five people, including four members of a family, were shot dead near India's border with Pakistan. **********Two other killings were reported from the Punjab, where the death toll for August stands at 79.

Aquino. **********''I want them arrested,'' Mrs. Aquino told reporters Saturday. ''It's not a question of forgiving. It was not only done against me but against the entire country. You saw how many innocent civilians were killed.'' **********Mrs. Aquino's tone Saturday was in sharp contrast to her expressions of leniency in the past against those involved in actions against her Government. **********The Government said 40 people had died in the fighting, most of them civilians. Hundreds were reported to have been wounded, including the President's son, Benigno S. Aquino 3d, who said he was fired on by troops he mistook for friendly forces.  [ Page 9. ]  Roadblocks Set Up There were reports, which were difficult to confirm, that some rebellious soldiers might still be moving toward Manila. The military set up tight roadblocks on the northern and southern approaches to the city. **********Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, the armed forces Chief of Staff, estimated that 800 to 1,200 soldiers had taken part in the uprising and that 705 were in detention aboard a 300-foot-long naval landing craft. He said the military lacked other facilities for holding them. **********House Speaker Ramon Mitra said he had ordered the arrest of the entire 200-man House security detachment, which he said had joined the mutiny and left the Congressmen unprotected. Complaints About Government **********Although the mutineers did not draw significant support from civilians, some of their complaints about the pace and style of the Aquino Government echoed a growing restlessness often expressed among middle-class Filipinos. **********A nationwide strike to protest fuel price increases, held two days before the attacks last Friday, appeared to reflect a larger discontent with a Government that is often described as indecisive and lacking direction. **********An officer close to Col. Gregorio Honasan, the leader of the rebels, said Colonel Honasan had ''gone underground.'' The officer said of the uprising, ''I see it as a beginning.'' **********A source close to renegade forces loyal to the former president, Ferdinand E. Marcos, said it was possible that Colonel Honasan, now that he had failed on his own, could join forces with them. **********Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, Colonel Honasan's mentor, denied on radio today that he had been involved, though some members of government said publicly they suspected him. **********Five other middle-grade officers identified as commanders of the mutineers were also being sought. Call for Punishment **********''The full force of the law will have to be meted out to the ringleaders,'' said the President's spokesman, Teodoro Benigno. ''Many of those on a lower level might not have known what was going on.'' **********Some captured enlisted men said they had thought they were going on a training mission, or were heading into battle with Communist guerrillas. **********As for the leaders, Mr. Benigno said, ''They might have hypnotized themselves into thinking they are the saviors of the country.'' Luzon Soldiers Said to Be at Large **********Some soldiers who had prepared to join the rebels in Manila from camps in southern and central Luzon were reportedly still at large. **********The military said that to avoid a shootout, about 400 mutineers were allowed to leave a police garrison they had captured in San Fernando, 40 miles north of Manila, taking their weapons with them. **********In Legazpi, 210 miles south of Manila, some 100 soldiers were reportedly allowed to escape serious punishment and return to their units after taking over an airport with plans to fly to the capital. **********The roadblocks on the outskirts of Manila were heavily manned, with tanks deployed at some points, and all traffic entering and leaving the city was being stopped. Roadblocks at Other Towns **********Other towns near the capital were reported also to have set up strict roadblocks. **********Cadets at the Philippine Military Academy, where Colonel Honasan enjoys wide support, issued a statement warning the Government to ''exercise justice and good sense'' in dealing with captured mutineers. **********The leaders of the rebellion, the same men who had organized a number of coup threats last fall, represented a deep strain of discontent in a divided and politicized armed forces. **********Mr. Benigno said: ''The country is moving forward. This is not a banana republic.'' He added, ''There's one thing you can say about the Aquino Government that you can't say about other third world governments: its capacity to withstand coups.'' Rebel Called Urban War Expert **********Colonel Honasan's friend, who declined to be identified, said that the rebellious soldier was an expert in urban guerrilla fighting and that he might begin his own small insurgency. **********Colonel Honasan, when planning a coup against Mr. Marcos that developed into the revolt that helped bring Mrs. Aquino to power in February 1986, is said to have planned to escape to the mountains if the attempt failed. **********''Look forward to interesting urban-type warfare because that's what Greg excels in,'' his friend said. **********In a statement Saturday, Communist rebels said the mutiny had enhanced their own position. They called the uprising a ''panic reaction'' to their own growing strength. Statement From Communists **********''The current situation is undoubtedly excellent for the Filipino people to victoriously advance their revolutionary struggle on all fronts,'' said the statement, issued by the Communist-dominated National Democratic Front. **********The last small pockets of armed resistance were neutralized Saturday, one day after pro-Government forces waged vigorous ground and air attacks on their positions. The headqauarters building at Villamor Air Base, where a small group appeared to be holding out, was sealed off to the public. President and Son Attend Mass The President and her son, whose arm was in a sling, attended a mass Saturday for five slain members of the presidential security command, including three who died in the attack on Mr. Aquino. **********The rebels failed in an attempt to seize Malacanang palace shortly after midnight Friday morning and later were driven from four television stations, after broadcasting a brief message calling for popular support. **********The armed forces general headquarters building stood blackened and gutted Saturday after a fire that began when rebels were forced from the building in fighting that raged through Camp Aguinaldo. **********Cebu City, the nation's second largest urban center, returned to normal Saturday after local military forces put civilian leaders under arrest and forced most radio and television stations off the air. **********The local commander, Gen. Edgardo Abenina, was dismissed by General Ramos. As the mutiny in Manila collapsed, he accepted his removal without resistance.  REAGAN PLEDGES U.S. SUPPORT **********LOS ANGELES, Aug. 28 (Special to The New York Times) - President Reagan today pledged the ''wholehearted support'' of the United States for the presidency of Mrs. Aquino, and said he was determined to work closely with her to spur democracy in the Philippines. **********In a statement issued here shortly before Mr. Reagan's departure for his ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif., Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said, ''The President is gratified and relieved that President Aquino has resolved the crisis faced by her Government over the past two days.''  AQUINO AND THE MILITARY: AN UNEASY ALLIANCE  President Corazon C. Aquino has withstood several challenges from the military since she came to power in February 1986. Here are several of the most significant incidents.  July 6, 1986: A group of military officers supporting the deposed President Ferdinand E. Marcos takes over the Manila Hotel and declares Arturo Tolentino, who had run for vice president on a ticket with Mr. Marcos, the president. The officers surrender two days later.  Nov. 23, 1986: The Government says Lieut. Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, Chief of Staff, has blocked a coup plot by disaffected military officers linked to Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile. Mr. Enrile is dismissed.  Jan. 27, 1987: Marcos loyalists and mutinuous troops try to seize military and press installations in the capital. The mutineers hold a radio-television station for 61 hours before surrendering.  July 13, 1987: Four army officers are arrested in Manila in connection with a coup attempt.  Aug. 27, 1987: Mutinous soldiers begin attacks on the presidential palace to try to overthrow the Government. By the next day, the uprising, the most serious assault on the Aquino Government, has been crushed, but the military remains on alert and the coup leaders remain at large."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/24/business/l-multitask-pc-s-393388.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Multitask P.C.'s", "print_headline": "Multitask P.C.'s", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********A.T.&T. has had two multi-tasking computers on the market for more than a year.

But according to the Patent Office's statistics, that is rapidly changing. Last year, foreigners accounted for 44 percent of the 76,000 patents granted by the Government; 20 years ago, the figure was only 16 percent. ''And when a foreigner gets a patent, it's a good bet that he or she plans to enter our market,'' said Mr. Quigg, who added that it is no coincidence that the nation's trade deficit has grown along with the number of foreign patent-holders. **********In fact, in some of the most important technological fields, such as fiber optics, electrical equipment and sound reproduction, the lion's share of United States patents is now going to foreigners. **********An explosion of patents in a given area, however, does not necessarily mean an explosion of ground-breaking inventions. As Jacob Rabinow, an inventor who holds 221 patents ''and a couple more pending,'' explains it, many patents simply reflect the incremental advances being made in a given technology. ''It means that a lot of people are working in that field,'' he said. **********But the crowd at last weekend's convention was not thick with corporate engineers or research and development technicians. There were engineers - some with doctoral degrees - but mostly they worked for small companies or ran their own. And there was a sprinkling of individuals with no corporate affiliation and no academic credentials. **********At this gathering, the inventions tended to be more eccentric. A few even seemed to challenge the Patent Commission's modest criterion that a new device be ''useful'' to be patented. And most of the devices exhibited had only the slimmest commercial prospect. But for all that, their involvement was no less passionate: **********''You're from Miami?'' said one man, reading the other's tag. ''Yep.'' ''What do you do there?'' **********''Invent.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/02/business/business-people-m-a-com-picks-leader-from-its-own-ranks.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1987-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 367, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "M/A-Com Picks Leader From Its Own Ranks", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; M/A-Com Picks Leader From Its Own Ranks", "body_text": " **********M/A-Com Inc., an electronic equipment manufacturer that has been undergoing a restructuring, announced yesterday that it had named Thomas F.

Phelan Jr., chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, had come to his wit's end. The tiny pool of ''buy orders'' on hand at the opening had dried up. And temporarily closing the Big Board seemed like the only way to prevent the market from another debilitating tailspin on top of Monday's 508-point decline. **********Yet a shutdown, however temporary, would be the option of last resort. At a late Monday night brainstorming session beneath the stained-glass ceiling of the exchange's boardroom, three dozen leading brokers had cringed at the thought of interrupting trading. Howard H. Baker Jr., the President's chief of staff, telephoned to say the White House did not care much for the idea. The Securites and Exchange Commission and officials of the trading pits in Chicago did not like the idea either. **********Ultimately, Mr. Phelan did not exercise his final option. ''We decided to let it bounce around and see what happened,'' he said Tuesday afternoon. **********The market continued to struggle through the day. And while trading continued on the floor, nervous officials worked closely with the financial community, with corporations and with Government experts to make sure that Monday's free fall did not recur. **********All through the week, the Big Board jawboned its members, urging them not to trade stock-index options and stock-index futures, in an attempt to contain the market's unsettling volatility. And market officials fine-tuned trading hours, hoping to lift some of the oppressive volume from their backs. **********When the Federal Reserve said it would try to promote easier credit, many banks lowered their prime rates, some by as much as three-quarters of a percentage point, in a dramatic retreat from increases made as recently as the previous Friday. And several companies quickly said they would buy back millions of their own shares to support their sagging stock prices and at the same time strengthening them against takeovers. **********Indeed, those corporate buybacks became a significant factor in the market. Early Tuesday, David Roderick, chairman of the USX Corporation, said USX would ''take advantage of current market conditions'' to buy up to 20 million of its shares. **********Donald Peterson, chairman of the cash-laden Ford Motor Company, then said Ford would accelerate its scheduled repurchase of 45 million shares. **********''Those announcements brought buyers back and allowed some stocks to re-open,'' said Leo Melamed, who introduced financial futures contracts at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. ''They brought a great deal of confidence back to the market.'' **********By the end of the week more than 100 companies announced buybacks, including Honeywell, ITT, General Motors, Chrysler, McGraw-Hill, MCA, IC Industries, Allegis, Citicorp, Merrill Lynch, Shearson American Express and Bristol-Myers. **********''They wanted to make a demonstration of their confidence,'' said Stanley Abel, the chairman of Abel/Noser, a Wall Street consulting firm that specializes in buybacks. ''That's all part of calming the troubled waters, reassuring the public that the panic on Monday was unjustified.'' **********Calming the volatility proved more difficult that soothing the public. And many experts and voices in Washington blamed that on the impact of trading in stock-index futures and options. Both products give investors the right to purchase or sell a bundle of securities at a specified price at some point in the future. **********Since these ''derivative products'' became popular a half-dozen years ago, brokerage houses have recruited mathematicians and physicists to join their ranks. These so-called ''rocket scientists'' have devised intricate formulas and complex trading programs that measure both the market value of certain stocks and of futures on those stocks, and then rapidly execute trades when the market values are out of synch. The technique is known as program trading. **********By Tuesday morning, the New York Stock Exchange forbade brokers to use its electronic data system for program trading, saying the system was about to overload. **********''What we wanted to do was take it out of our system,'' Mr. Phelan explained. ''We wanted to make sure our system was clear for people who wanted access to it.'' **********BEHIND the scenes a debate raged on program trading, and whether it was indeed a culprit in the remarkable volatility. Members of Congress and the S.E.C. said they would investigate. The Chicago exchanges, perpeptually on the defensive about stock-index trading, felt the most pressure. Facing the possibility that they would become scapegoats if the market dove again, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Kansas City Board of Trade, the New York Futures Exchange and options pits of the American Stock Exchange decided to shut. **********The executive committee of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange huddled in special session, thinking that the New York Stock Exchange was about to close, too. The members voted to shut down. Then came a call from New York. **********''We were advised by Mr. Phelan that they were going to try to tough it out,'' said Mr. Melamed of the Merc. After 40 minutes of eerie silence, the Chicago exchange reopened. **********By Thursday afternoon, the Big Board had decided to close two hours early on Friday, as well as tomorrow and Tuesday. Other exchanges took the cue and followed. Mr. Phelan said the 2 P.M. close was intended to give the exchange a breather, allowing the staff and the member firms to catch up on paper work. **********Because of the paucity of buy orders, the market frequently ran out of gas late in the trading session during the week. Many brokers said they expected that the shorter work day would lead to a less volatile market. **********The cooperation between Wall Street and the Federal Government was echoed within the financial community. Goldman, Sachs & Company established a loan fund of $1 billion for cash-strapped mutual funds that had been hit by heavy redemptions. Stock exchange executives monitored the finances of shaky firms and directed them to sources of ready capital. **********When A. B. Tompane & Company, one of the specialist firms whose job it is to maintain orderly markets in selected stocks, was overwhelmed by the crushing volume, Merrill Lynch & Company helped forestall panic by quickly agreeing to acquire it. **********But all the gyrations have taken their toll. For example, two seats on the exchange, sold by distressed brokers trying to raise cash, brought $750,000 and $760,000 respectively late in the week. A week earlier, a seat sold for $1.25 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/12/world/aquino-is-the-key-in-philippine-vote.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Mydans", "pub_date": "1987-04-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 890, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AQUINO IS THE KEY IN PHILIPPINE VOTE", "print_headline": "AQUINO IS THE KEY IN PHILIPPINE VOTE", "body_text": " **********Three rival political rallies competed for crowds here one recent humid night amid the smoke of frying squid and the tinkling bells of ice cream vendors.

At each rally they danced, sang and shook their fists in the Philippine style. **********Elections for a new Congress are a month away, and the political scramble that is now under way demonstrates the new wide-open atmosphere Mrs. Aquino has restored. **********Future members of Congress - and people who consider themselves potential presidents - seem to be everywhere now, more than a year after the end of two decades of authoritarian rule by Ferdinand E. Marcos. A Thousand Candidates **********Early soundings have caused unexpected concern among Mrs. Aquino's strategists over the possibility of a strong showing by her opponents. **********Nearly 1,000 candidates from as many as 70 parties are campaigning for the 24-member Senate, whose members are elected nationwide, and the 250-seat House of Representatives, whose members are elected from districts. **********In this jostling crowd, getting name recognition has become the main challenge. Most candidates are focusing their energies on simply trying to get voters in the May 11 election to remember who they are. **********Leticia Ramos Shahani, for example, a normally sedate former United Nations official who is running for the Senate, dances the cha-cha on stage to her theme song, ''Sha-Sha-Shahani.'' The Popularity of Aquino **********After the overwhelming endorsement of a new Constitution in a referendum in February, it is Mrs. Aquino who is indisputably the country's most popular politician. **********Pro-Government candidates, who are expected to dominate both houses, compete to share in her popularity. A photograph of the President holding up a candidate's hand can mean victory. **********Her opponents, including former Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, who once tried to force her from office, now play down their opposition to her, saying they want to help her form a democratic legislature. **********For the same reason, few politicians have dared attack the President directly. Instead, accusations of corruption have been aimed at some relatives. **********Some former Marcos supporters have come over to the Aquino camp, and it is a measure of the Government's concern about this election that it has welcomed support from the stronger vote-getters among them. Warning to Opposition **********Mrs. Aquino herself is on the stump each weekend. She has aroused some controversy with a declaration, in the Marcos style, that she needs no opposition in the legislature. **********Her Secretary of Local Government, Jaime Ferrer, has ordered all local officials, who are appointed by the Government, to campaign for Mrs. Aquino's candidates or be dismissed. **********Most of the leading figures now on the campaign trail are familiar faces from within the Government or the opposition of the past, including loyal Marcos functionaries who withered in his shadow and dissidents who marched against him in the streets. **********The major alliances supporting or opposing the President differ little in their social backgrounds or political programs, however, except for a handful of issue-oriented activists. Political alliances take precedence over issues. No Aquino Party **********The President has refused to form a political party, and her supporters have put together a fractious alliance known as Laban. She has endorsed 24 candidates for the Senate but has chosen to leave many of the House races open, and confusion and acrimony have resulted in many places. **********Her senatorial candidates, traveling the country in four groups of six, have canceled appearances in some towns to avoid embarrassment of the kind encountered in Cebu. **********The major opposition parties have formed an equally tenuous grouping known as the Grand Alliance for Democracy, which includes a number of men closely associated with Mr. Marcos. **********Other Marcos men have kept alive his political party, the New Society Movement. Although it is now very much a minority party nationwide, the structure still exists in many places. A Threat to Aquino Program **********These opposition groupings are expected to present a stronger challenge in the House than in the Senate. A strong opposition here could seriously slow the President's program. **********Meanwhile, the left wing has started an experiment in mainstream politics with a coalition called the Alliance for New Politics, which is expected to win only a symbolic presence in the legislature. **********The core of the alliance is the Party of the Nation, a legal group that was formed under the sponsorship of Jose Maria Sison, the founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines. **********The alliance's seven senatorial candidates are radical organizers and former leaders of the leftist underground. They support Mrs. Aquino while putting forward their own political agenda, which includes the immediate dismantling of American bases and free redistribution of land to peasants. **********Mrs. Aquino's supporters have not stressed issues, in part to avoid splits in their disparate alliance."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/25/business/baker-to-picture-decline-of-dollar-as-economic-boon.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Kilborn", "pub_date": "1987-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1251, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BAKER TO PICTURE DECLINE OF DOLLAR AS ECONOMIC BOON", "print_headline": "BAKER TO PICTURE DECLINE OF DOLLAR AS ECONOMIC BOON", "body_text": " **********Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d is expected to tell President Reagan Monday that the two-year fall of the dollar that accelerated late last month has been good for the economy, an Administration aide said today. **********The aide, one of a score or more who have reviewed the briefing papers and charts and graphs prepared for a meeting to brief the President on the economy, said Mr. Baker and Beryl W. Sprinkel, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, are also expected to say that the tumult in the stock market Friday causes them little worry. **********A White House spokesman, Dale Petroskey, confirmed the meeting, set for 2 P.M. Monday, but he declined to discuss what the President would be told. Volatile Stock Market **********Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average, apparently benefiting from prospects that a cheaper dollar would increase the profits of American industries by helping them sell more goods abroad, embarked on its longest rise in history - 13 consecutive day that pushed it up more than 200 points. It turned on Thursday though, and in a wildly gyrating market Friday, the Dow swung back and forth by more than 100 points before plunging 44.15 points to close at 2,101.52. Market analysts are predicting that the wild swings will continue, while carefully distinguishing between the surge in the market earlier in the month and the pandemonium on Friday.  [ Page 22. ]  The event brought expressions of concern from the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, John S.R. Shad. **********Mr. Petroskey said today, ''We have no comment on the stock market,'' but the Administration aide said Mr. Baker and Mr. Sprinkel would tell Mr. Reagan that Friday's turmoil was an aberration and that the more important trend was the long-term rise in stock prices that began in 1982. **********The Baker-Sprinkel briefings are usually given every two or three months to top White House officials and typically cover broad economic trends. **********The Administration aide, who insisted on anonymity, said that this time the briefing papers of the two men dwelled heavily on the volatile events in the stock and currency markets, which have aroused calls for regulation from some of Congress's new Democratic leaders. **********The dollar, declining steadily for two years under a carefully orchestrated effort by Mr. Baker and the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, Paul A. Volcker, began falling sharply against the West German mark and the Japanese yen after the Administration reported late last month an unexpectedly large, $19.2 billion November deficit in the nation's foreign trade. The fall continued with reports that the Administration favored a further decline. **********The Administration's indifference to the volatility in the stock market developed last year with the proliferation of computer-driven ''program trading,'' a complex strategy involving the interplay of stocks and related investments, stock index futures. Resisting Calls for Regulation **********The official added that Mr. Sprinkel, in presenting charts showing the performance of the Dow, was likely to urge the Administration to resist attempts in Congress to regulate the activity. He is also planning to present historical material showing that stock prices often embark on sustained climbs after periods when the Federal Reserve helps stimulate the economy's growth with declining interest rates. With the Federal Reserve's help, interest rates have been declining steadily since 1980, leveling off in mid-1986. **********Commenting on the long-term trend in stock prices, one Administration official said today, ''Obviously, we're pleased.'' **********Regarding the dollar, the Administration has made its satisfaction known in recent days. At the White House Mr. Petroskey said again today, ''Our position on the dollar remains unchanged. We don't intervene unless there's a disruption in the market.'' **********In Japan, by contrast, the decline has caused dismay because it is undermining the profits of that country's giant export industries. Japan's finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, was so concerned that he paid an emergency visit to Mr. Baker Wednesday seeking help to arrest the dollar's fall. But he left without any public assurances, at least, that such help was imminent. **********West Germany has been affected in much the same way, and on Thursday, the country's central bank cut interest rates, partly in response to pressure from Mr. Baker. Cutting interest rates was designed to help stabilize the dollar, but the mark rose anyway. Fears of Recessions **********The dollar, though it stabilized Friday, has also largely shrugged off comments by Mr. Volcker that it had declined about enough. The aide and other officials said they did not know whether Mr. Baker would also express some concern that the fall of the dollar against the yen and the mark might become counterproductive. Too sharp a fall, a senior Administration official said in an interview last week, could slow the West German and Japanese economies so much that they could slip into recessions. **********They would then be unable to buy increasing quantities of American goods and thus help reduce the American trade deficit, which the Reagan Administration now sees as the No. 1 problem facing the economy. The deficit reflects difficulties and job losses in American manufacturing and agriculture and has led to widespread pressure in Congress to enact protectionist legislation against foreign imports. **********But the decline of the dollar to date, the aide said of Mr. Baker's views, ''has been good for America and good for the economy.'' While the trade deficit reached a record of an estimated $175 billion last year, the falling dollar, in pushing up the prices of imports and depressing those of American exports, will soon show a reversal. **********To demonstrate that the dollar still has some room to fall, Mr. Baker has prepared charts showing its performance where decline has been slight, against currencies other than the yen and the mark. These are the currencies of South Korea and Taiwan, which are now tied to the dollar and rise and fall with it. **********This largely protects their exports to the United States, which now account for a sizable share of the American trade deficit, from the fall of the dollar against other currencies. For months, the Treasury has been urging those countries to readjust their Government-fixed exchange rates to take account of the deficit but has so far won only token adjustments. ''They've done diddily-squat,'' the aide said. **********Some economists find less to fault in the Administration's hands-off attitude toward the stock market than in a similar attitude as yet toward the currency markets. With respect to the yen, the mark and several other European currencies, especially, they say the dollar's decline should stop for now because they see widespread signs that it will soon show it has succeeded in reducing the trade deficitmarkedly. **********Lyle E. Gramley, a former governor of the Federal Reserve Board who is chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, said that in dollar terms the American trade deficit with Japan had reached another record. But in volume terms, in the quantities of goods involved in the two nations' trade, Japan's exports here fell about 3 percent last year. He said the volume of Japanese imports, meanwhile, is rising."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/05/business/key-rates-848488.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-03-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 190, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEY RATES", "print_headline": "KEY RATES", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/26/business/business-forum-argentina-s-basic-economic-problem-when-economy-goes-underground.html": {"writer_name": "Maria Estenssoro", "pub_date": "1987-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "When an Economy Goes Underground", "print_headline": "BUSINESS FORUM: ARGENTINA'S BASIC ECONOMIC PROBLEM; When an Economy Goes Underground", "body_text": " **********For years, Latin American economists have attributed underdevelopment to ''dependency'' and the unfair ''exchange terms'' of third world primary goods for manufactured products from the advanced nations. **********Although these theories looked good on paper, they scarcely helped developing nations progress. Luckily, an unconventional but more practical and self-reliant approach to economic growth is taking shape in Latin America: the ''informal'' approach. **********Just as expert Persian rug dealers look at the reverse of carpets to find their true value, some Latin American scholars, such as the economists Hernando de Soto in Peru and Marcos Victorica in Argentina, are looking at the underside of their economies to find out why they resist working effectively. The results are astonishing. **********Argentina is a good case study. The seventh most prosperous nation in the world in gross national product per capita before World War II, Argentina today finds itself 40th. **********For decades, perplexed analysts have searched in vain for ways to explain the drastic decline. But two years ago, Mr. Victorica, who directs the Institute for Contemporary Studies (I.D.E.C.), sensed the clue lay in the irregular practices that permeate Argentina's economy: standard double accounting, uncontrolled tax evasion, what is thought to be the highest level of capital flight in Latin America (as high as $31 billion annually, according to one study) and a habit of under-reporting payrolls and understating revenues and profits. **********Mr. Victorica and his colleagues delved into the mysteries of the informal economy and concluded that three out of every five Argentines today work full or part-time in the unregistered sector, producing as much as $42 billion a year in goods and services, equal to 60 percent of G.N.P. None of this shows up in official accounting. A comparable underground economy in the United States would account for as much as $1.8 trillion in economic activity. **********Although at first glance this would suggest the Government is simply too lenient, the institute's investigation suggests that ''informality'' spreads because the state is too intrusive. **********According to Adrian Guissarri, an I.D.E.C. economist, Argentines have kept out of the official system about 33 percent of the total wealth produced since the late 1940's, when this country's free-market economy became largely state-controlled. Argentina's economic decline began at about that time, too. **********Today, the state controls enterprises that account for more than 50 percent of G.N.P. The Government not only owns monopolies in oil, railways, telephone, electricity, postal service, gas, water and airlines, but also runs more than 520 deficit-ridden companies. Last year, by the calculation of economist Rodolfo Rossi, the state monopolies were responsible for 84.1 percent of the public sector's consolidated deficit. **********The import restrictions, export taxes and price, wage, interest rate and exchange controls that today straitjacket the economy have been standard practices - with nuances - under all Governments, even those that advocated free-market theories. But the most alarming aspect of this all-encompassing bureaucracy is its suffocating inefficiency and total disregard for the public interest it claims to represent. **********Retired people, who were forced to pay mandatory retirement dues to the state welfare system while working, receive miserable pensions of less than $100 a month. A year ago, when they sued the state for its failure to pay them the equivalent of 82 percent of their last salary, as established by law, the Government declared a ''state of social emergency'' and refused to pay, claiming the money was ''gone.'' **********THE state telephone system is another example of what people are forced to tolerate. At a time when communications are erasing national borders and gathering the world into one network, Argentines have trouble reaching their neighbors by telephone. Until last year, people suffered through unconscionable waits - 40 years in one case - to obtain a telephone. **********But thanks to a much publicized program, people with a desperate need for telephone service - primarily businesses and individuals who have been waiting many years for a phone - have been allowed to place ''special'' orders that the state monopoly promises to fulfill within 66 months. Such special-order telephones cost $2,500, a little more than twice the typical fee of $1,200 for a residential line and $2,000 for a commercial line. **********Another victory of spendthrift bureaucrats has been the final outcome of the anti-inflationary Austral Plan introduced in June 1985 to stop a monthly inflation rate of 30 percent. Though President Raul Alfonsin promised to reduce bloated Government expenditures, which, he admitted, were causing rampant inflation, public deficits and inflation were lowered through price and wage controls and higher taxes, not by significant public sector cuts. **********The extremely low payoff of this state-run system is pushing Argentines to boycott the voracious bureaucracy and enter the vast and ever-expanding underground economy. This explains why the unregistered sector here is not restricted to marginals, dropouts or outcasts, as in most countries, but includes many of the most ambitious working people from all social, economic and professional backgrounds. Most agree that informal transactions are the only defense against price controls, astronomical interest rates and high taxes. **********Tax evasion has been the curse of all Argentine administrations - last year, only 130,000 out of three million people who were supposed to pay the three main taxes actually did. When tax agents hit the streets in search of evaders, they found that 40 percent of the people registered had declared false addresses, including one who claimed to live in the middle of the River Plate, another in a church and a third in a soccer stadium. **********Such scandalous levels of tax evasion and under-the-counter operations were explained, until recently, as an Argentine genetic or cultural penchant for civic indiscipline. A legacy of the Italian and Spanish immigrations, analysts said. **********Today, however, they are beginning to be taken for what they really are: A symptom of the dramatic divorce between Argentina's authoritarian economic rules and most people's freer attitudes and preferences. **********The informal economy is a symptom of Argentina's economic woes, not a solution to them. Its presence suggests that growth will begin to recover only when people believe that the state is serving, rather than robbing, them. Only when taxes are lowered to realistic levels, wages and prices are set by the market, and major industries are returned to the private sector will Argentines bring money back from foreign banks, take it out from under the mattress and out of unregistered businesses and invest in renewed growth at home."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/04/business/how-industries-will-fare-in-1987-no-room-in-outer-space-for-private-launchers.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1987-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 622, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Room in Outer Space For Private Launchers", "print_headline": "HOW INDUSTRIES WILL FARE IN 1987; No Room in Outer Space For Private Launchers", "body_text": " **********THE outlook for the economy in 1987 looks all-too-familiar: another sluggish year with worries about too much debt and too little growth to drive the unemployment rate much below today's 6.9 percent. **********But behind the standard forecast for another standard year is an American economy still churning with change. The merger wave is continuing to roil key industries.

But with no domestic launching capability in place, major satellite owners -like Comsat, Intelsat and Western Union - have been scrambling to get aboard Europe's Ariane flights. **********''If there is room for an American competitor, and we think there may only be room for one, it could be whoever wins the MLV contract,'' said Brad Meslin of the Cambridge-based Center for Space Policy, referring to the Air Force's new medium-launch vehicle. The multibillion-dollar contact should be awarded in the next few months. And the winner - the contenders include Martin Marietta, Hughes Aircraft and McDonnell Douglas - will wind up with a production line in place, making it far cheaper to sell variants of the rocket for private satellite launchings. **********There is also a race on for another unmanned rocket: The Pentagon's ''heavy lift'' vehicle to take very large ''Star Wars'' payloads into orbit. Boeing has already proposed a craft that uses many of the features of the shuttle's propulsion system. **********Just how quickly American aerospace companies should jump into the fray, however, is unclear. Some are afraid of getting burned on Government programs that are later cut by Congress. And the demand for private launching services may decrease by 1993 as the sky fills with more than enough communciations-satellite capability, say several experts, making many wonder whether it is worth the investment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/15/world/india-s-president-confronts-gandhi.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Weisman", "pub_date": "1987-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 927, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INDIA'S PRESIDENT CONFRONTS GANDHI", "print_headline": "INDIA'S PRESIDENT CONFRONTS GANDHI", "body_text": " **********A long-simmering dispute between Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and President Zail Singh of India erupted in public this week, creating an embarrassing new political crisis for Mr. Gandhi's Government. **********The unusual rift between two former allies threatened to undercut the Prime Minister's authority and deepen divisions within the ruling Congress Party at a time when Mr. Gandhi's political difficulties were already on the rise. **********On the surface, no major issues were at stake. But the controversy was said to have derived partly from strains between the two leaders over the handling of Sikh demands in the northern state of Punjab. President Singh is a Sikh. **********Politicians now speculate that Mr. Singh may run for re-election as President this July without Mr. Gandhi's support, seeking votes from Congress Party dissidents and opposition politicians. This could pose a serious challenge to Mr. Gandhi's political strength. **********The President is elected by a vote of Parliament and India's 24 state legislatures. Normally, he is little more than a figurehead who attends ceremonial functions at home and abroad. But as chief of state, he can wield influence at decisive moments. Ties to Gandhi's Family **********For example, it was Mr. Singh who decided in 1984 to swear in Mr. Gandhi as Prime Minister after the asssassination of his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, instead of waiting for Parliament to make the choice. **********At the time, it was said that Mr. Singh was acting out of political loyalty to Mrs. Gandhi, who had backed him for the office of President in 1982 in an attempt to heal the disaffection among Indian Sikhs. **********The President's devotion to the Gandhi family has given an ironic edge to reports in the last year that Mrs. Gandhi's son had snubbed him. **********It was widely reported, for example, that Mr. Gandhi had stopped briefing and consulting the President, had barred him from foreign trips and had permitted his allies to criticize him in Parliament. **********The strains began to come into the open this winter when President Singh refused to sign a bill approved by Parliament to give the Government sweeping powers to intercept mail. A Letter to Gandhi **********Then, this week, the President wrote a letter to Mr. Gandhi, charging that the Prime Minister had refused to keep him abreast of the issue, as required by the Constitution. **********The letter was prompted by Mr. Gandhi's earlier assertion that he had treated Mr. Singh appropriately. ''There is no question of keeping the President outside,'' Mr. Gandhi had told Parliament. ''We keep him fully informed on all major national issues.'' **********The letter, which was published in the newspaper Indian Express on Friday, created a furor in Parliament. **********Addressing the Prime Minister as ''My Dear Rajiv,'' the President said he appreciated Mr. Gandhi's desire to avoid an ugly controversy but added: ''As you are aware, the factual position is somewhat at variance with what has been stated by you.'' **********''Even on certain important domestic issues, I have not been kept informed,'' the President wrote. Blame for Punjab Tensions **********The Prime Minister has never made public his complaints about the President, but senior aides have let it be known that it derives partly from the issue of Sikhs in the Punjab. **********Mr. Singh was a former Chief Minister of the state of Punjab and later Home Minister under Mrs. Gandhi, and Mr. Gandhi is said to have blamed him for letting the situation deteriorate into one that cost his mother's life. Mrs. Gandhi was assassinated by two Sikh security guards. **********Mr. Gandhi's supporters also cite reports that Mr. Singh had once been friendly with Sikh extremists in order to undercut rival Sikh politicians in the Punjab, and that he still has links with some extremists. **********Other analysts say the rift is partly cultural. At the age of 71, Mr. Singh is an affable and shrewd politician who is uncomfortable speaking English and proud of his humble rural upbringing. **********When Mrs. Gandhi backed him for President in 1982, the choice was widely criticized, especially when Mr. Singh declared facetiously that he would have been happy to take a broom and sweep the floor if that was what his leader wanted of him. **********In any case, Mr. Singh's background contrasts with those of the Oxford- and Cambridge-educated people around Mr. Gandhi. Squabbles in the Past **********There have been cases in the past of Indian prime ministers squabbling with presidents. But the confrontation with Mr. Singh poses a serious political challenge for Mr. Gandhi at a time of rising criticism of his style in office. **********Even some of those sympathetic to the Prime Minister regard his behavior toward the president as petulant and high-handed. **********In still another twist to the controversy, federal policemen on Friday raided the residence of Ram Nath Goenka, one of India's leading industrialists, who is a longtime foe of the Gandhi family and owner of the Indian Express. **********The raid appeared to be a part of the Government's crackdown on tax evaders, but Mr. Goenka's associates said it could have been a retaliation for the publication in The Express of Mr. Singh's letter."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/12/world/2d-seoul-opposition-leader-set-to-run.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1987-10-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 763, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2d Seoul Opposition Leader Set to Run", "print_headline": "2d Seoul Opposition Leader Set to Run", "body_text": " **********Although stopping short of a formal declaration of candidacy, South Korea's most prominent opposition figure left virtually no doubt at a public rally here today that he was running for president. **********''The great majority of the people will want me to run,'' the opposition figure, Kim Dae Jung, said in his clearest indication that he would enter the race. **********''I am the one who is needed today,'' he said. **********Mr. Kim's remarks before tens of thousands of supporters capped a troubled weekend for South Korea's political opposition. It has suffered a severe split despite previous promises to stand united against a Government that it denounces as a military dictatorship. A Growing Rivalry **********On Saturday, another dissident politician, Kim Young Sam, announced that he was running for president, saying he was tired of weeks of fruitless wrangling and it was time for action. **********Kim Dae Jung is considered likely to follow with an official declaration of his own later this week, barring a switch in position that seemed hard to imagine after his statements today. **********For weeks, South Koreans have been riveted by the growing rivalry between the two Kims and their obvious inability, despite frequent pledges of allegiance, to set aside old rivalries and long-frustrated ambitions to become president. **********Many of their supporters have been openly dismayed by the split, believing that only a united opposition led by a single candidate can guarantee victory against the ruling party in elections expected in mid-December. **********Acknowledging that he, too, was concerned, Kim Dae Jung told the crowd today that the ultimate goal was to defeat not Kim Young Sam but the Government party and its candidate, Roh Tae Woo. He suggested, moreover, that it was conceivable that either he or Kim Young Sam might ultimately drop out of the race if it looked like victory was beyond reach. 'Sacrifice' Is Expected **********''Kim Young Sam and I will cooperate in the face of military dictatorship,'' he said. ''At the last minute, if it is needed to defeat the military dictatorship, we will make whatever sacrifice is necessary to make sure that the ruling party cannot win.'' **********Echoing charges made the day before by Kim Young Sam, Kim Dae Jung accused the Government party of having tried to buy votes by handing out gifts during a long holiday season that ended today. It was the first clear signal that the opposition would charge fraud should it lose to Mr. Roh. **********This working-class city, 15 miles south of Seoul, is a natural constituency for Kim Dae Jung, and an enthusiastic crowd filled an open field to hear him speak for an hour. Many people chanted his name over and over, and shouted, ''Run, run, run!'' **********And that is what Mr. Kim essentially said he would do, despite the absence of a formal statement. ''I think I'm the strongest candidate to solve the problems that our nation faces,'' he said. Risk of Army Intervention **********He was even more unequivocal in a written statement distributed earlier to reporters and translated into English by his aides. In it, Mr. Kim bitterly denounced the contention, raised by Kim Young Sam and others, that he should not run because strong opposition to him within the South Korean Army created a risk of military intervention. **********If Koreans accept the idea of a military ''veto group,'' Kim Dae Jung said, ''it only means that we have given up democratization.'' **********He added, ''I am convinced that we absolutely cannot change our position because of a certain attitude taken by a small number of politically minded soldiers.'' **********In the written statement, Mr. Kim also touched on a point that he does not often tackle head-on - the sense among some South Koreans that for all his talk about democracy he is really, in his own words, ''seized with the desire for power.'' **********''Even though there may be a temporary misunderstanding among the people,'' he said, ''I believe I cannot neglect the ardent popular expectations of a large number of people, support being given me by dissident leaders and my own sense of a mission to perform. **********''For that reason, I am positively examining various factors in the direction of running for the presidency.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/21/business/company-news-wendy-s-layoffs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 134, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wendy's Layoffs", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Wendy's Layoffs", "body_text": " **********Wendy's International Inc. said it would eliminate 160 positions, or 20 percent, of its nationwide administrative staff.

The Wellcome swings illustrate the speculative excitement generated by companies working on AIDS drugs. **********The British pharmaceutical maker's American subsidiary, the Burroughs-Wellcome Company, has developed azidothymidine, or AZT, as a treatment for patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Recent Government-monitored trials have shown that AZT prolongs the life of AIDS patients. **********On Jan. 16, Food and Drug Administration experts are scheduled to hold public hearings to discuss whether AZT should be approved as a prescription drug, with formal F.D.A. approval expected soon afterward. The F.D.A. has already given AZT a special 1AA classification, meaning that the drug is deemed to be of vital importance. Accordingly, AZT could win approval in record time and be on the market by March or April. **********News of the F.D.A. meeting prompted a wave of Wellcome share buying last week, with most of the interest coming from American investors. About a dozen Wall Street houses make markets in the British company's shares. There is no way to invest directly in Burroughs-Wellcome, the American subsidiary that accounts for roughly 70 percent of the parent company's earnings. **********But that has certainly not deterred United States investors recently. ''The surge in buying interest in Wellcome has been just phenomenal,'' said Jonathan Gelles, an analyst for Wertheim & Company in New York, whose firm rates Wellcome a ''speculative buy.'' Market makers estimate that the American trading volume in Wellcome jumped as much as fourfold some days last week, with millions of shares changing hands. **********Indeed, the American buying was the main reason for the sharp runup in the company's share price last week, from a 236-pence-a-share closing price the previous week to 271 pence last Thursday. (There are 100 pence to a British pound, and a pound is worth $1.48 at last Friday's exchange rate.) But last Friday, Wellcome's share price dropped 21 pence, to 250. **********The reason for the fall in Wellcome shares was that on Friday an American company, ICN Pharmaceuticals, of Costa Mesa, Calif., reported that its drug, Ribavirin, appeared to be effective in preventing people exposed to the AIDS virus from developing the disease, based on clinical trials. **********The Ribavirin results, while promising, are preliminary. ICN has not yet had its antiviral agent tested in Government-regulated experimental treatment programs, a stage already completed by Wellcome's AZT. In addition, the two drugs have been tested on different groups, with AZT going to seriously ill patients, while Ribavirin was given to people with a pre-AIDS condition. Wellcome has done some work on AZT's effectiveness in retarding the progression from AIDS-related complex to full-blown AIDS, but the results have not yet been released. **********The Friday retreat shows the vulnerability of Wellcome's shares to competing AIDS-research announcements, not to mention competing breakthroughs. But Wellcome's enthusiasts stress that hopes for AZT as an AIDS treatment merely add to the company's allure, but is not the main reason Wellcome is an attractive investment. **********Wellcome is already ''the world's commercial leader in virology,'' says Samuel D. Isaly, an analyst for S. G. Warburg & Company in New York. For the next few years, Zovirax, an anti-herpes drug, is expected to be the key element in corporate growth. **********A high growth rate became evident in the second half of the company's fiscal 1986 year, which ended last August, when pretax earnings increased 20 percent. Warburg, which is also Wellcome's investment banker, says the rapid growth in earnings should continue. **********In a new report, Warburg states, ''We identify Wellcome as our single-most-attractive major capitalization recommendation of pharmaceutical companies based anywhere in the world.'' Last Friday, Mr. Isaly stressed that the Warburg recommendation still held, despite the ICN announcement. **********However, Wellcome's stock is now selling at roughly 30 times most analysts' estimates of fiscal 1987 earnings, a rather lofty multiple. There already appears to be a fair degree of what one analyst called ''AIDS hope'' in Wellcome's stock price. **********It could be justified. For example, if AZT were sold to 20,000 AIDS patients and had an annual treatment cost of $5,000, it would be a $100 million-a-year drug, according to Ian White, an analyst for Greenwell Montagu Securities in London, which as a ''hold'' recommendation on Wellcome shares.

The moves came on the 18th day of a nationwide miners' strike against six major mining companies that has crippled most gold mines and a fifth of the coal pits. **********Also today, the South African Government announced that it was assuming new emergency powers to censor the press and to close for up to three months newspapers that it believes are promoting acts of civil disobedience and boycotts or promoting the image of radical groups. **********The stringent new curbs, which supplement existing restrictions under a 14-month-old emergency decree as well as over 100 laws restricting the press, will apply to all newspapers and publications, although they are directed specifically at the so-called alternative press, a category including low-budget, mainly weekly newspapers, news agencies, journals and specialist publications concentrating on anti-apartheid politics, education, labor and economic issues. Curbs Are Condemned **********Opposition and anti-apartheid spokesmen condemned the curbs as another bid to crush legitimate dissent and warned that, in addition to their effect on ''alternative'' news outlets, the new regulations would increase already high levels of self-censorship by more established news organizations. **********In the miners' strike, the Anglo American Corporation, the biggest mining company and the one worst hit, adopted a tougher stand by carrying out threats to dismiss 20,000 miners at seven gold and coal pits. **********Employers, grouped under the Chamber of Mines, have refused to improve a wage increase ranging between 15 and 23.4 percent since talks broke down six weeks ago.

It combines an old idea, employee stock ownership plans, with a newer one, leveraged buyouts. **********In the leveraged employee stock ownership plan, the buyers borrow money to pay for the company in a deal that leaves employees with a majority of the stock. In a typical deal, the employees usually get around 70 percent of the stock. **********Both new financing methods and Federal tax advantages have encouraged a number of these deals this year. And if stock prices remain depressed as a result of this week's volatility, the deals could become even more attractive because they will be cheaper for the buyers, said Eugene J. Keilin, general partner at Lazard Freres and a specialist in this area. **********Last week's $750 million bid by 17 unions to take control of their own railroad, Southern Pacific, is the latest. Another example is the proposed $1.2 billion management-driven buyout of the Charter Medical Corporation, a large provider of psychiatric care. The deal will leave the management of the Macon, Ga., company in charge, but also confer an undisclosed amount of ownership on Charter Medical's employees. In addition, there is the proposed $1.8 billion buyout of Avis Inc., which is being financed in part by an employee ownership plan. **********Investment bankers often praise these deals, citing the advantages of self-ownership. But some plans have drawn harsh criticism. The Charter Medical deal provides a case in point. The company and its adviser, the Bankers Trust Company, are tight-lipped about the specifics, but many on Wall Street, believe the plan could leave employees with a minority voice in the board room despite being the majority owners. **********Critics say that deals in which the employees effectively end up with only minority control are merely financing schemes that offer tax advantages for managers, whose primary interest is not employee ownership or a democratic workplace. **********In some of the deals, employees are given shares that carry less voting power than the stock that management receives. In other cases, the managers could receive warrants or other convertible instruments that could give them greater power after the deal is consummated. **********One investment banker, calls these plans typical management-driven buyouts with ''ESOP qualities'' thrown in simply for the tax breaks. Management essentially gets a leveraged buyout at a discount. The key tax advantage is that principal and interest on the debt are deductible. Bankers Trust, which has pioneered a new security, called floating- rate ESOP's, to finance such leveraged deals, has been sharply criticized for the structure of some of their deals because of the diluted power left in the hands of employees. Bankers Trust executives, however, staunchly defend their plans. **********''Is management ripping off'' the employees? asked Kim M. Chandler, a vice president at Bankers Trust. ''No. Employees shouldn't be brought in on the day-to-day decisions. You still need management to run the company.'' She added: ''Remember, the employees get ownership free. It's a free gift. It's manna from heaven.'' **********Though they might have diluted control, she argues that employees should still benefit from the self-ownership and all the commonly promoted advantages, including greater motivation. **********Ms. Chandler concedes, however, that some leveraged ESOP's were made simply to provide management with attractive tax credits, deals possibly conceived in the ''wrong spirit.'' **********But not all leveraged ESOP's are the same. Employee or union-driven ownership deals are also common. The bid by United Airlines' pilots to win control of the carrier, is a case in point. And the bid for Southern Pacific by the unions is the creation of the employees, whose motivation stemmed mainly from a fear of anti-union purchasers, according to sources working on the deal. The deal is said to include the current management as well as the employees. **********Although most analysts agree that these plans will probably become more common, Mr. Keilin of Lazard Freres thinks the management-driven leveraged employee ownership deals will come under added regulation. **********''These tax advantages are potentially costly to the Federal Government,'' Mr. Keilin said.

Veit, international economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company. ''I predict that in June the monthly trade deficit will fall to below $12 billion, from the $14.4 billion reported for May,'' he said. This would mean three successive quarters of declining trade deficits in nominal terms. **********One of the factors in closing the gap, Mr. Veit says, is the increasing competitiveness of American labor costs. Two years ago, unit labor costs in the United States were $12.82 an hour, much higher than Japan's $6.45 an hour or Germany's $9.60 an hour. This year American manufacturing labor costs should be about $13.70 an hour, but thanks to the falling dollar, Germany's comparable costs will be $16.30 an hour and Japan's $11.44 an hour. **********Even if the dollar rises, American labor costs should remain competitive in the near future, Mr. Veit says. The reasons: Wages are rising slowly, and American companies are investing in new equipment to raise worker productivity. **********The footnote to all this, Mr. Veit said, is that in 20 years or so, the figures on industrial labor costs will become almost useless in determining American competitiveness. With the industrial sector shrinking, he said, there won't be much manufacturing labor to keep track of.  Shrinking Surpluses **********The nation's economy may get little help from the states over the next 12 months. While the states appear to be in good shape this year, Federal spending cuts and an anticipated $3 billion decline in Federal grants-in-aid will reduce their revenues, said James S. Fralick, senior economist at Morgan Stanley. **********This will cause state surpluses to shrink this year, according to Mr. Fralick - to about $54.8 billion from an estimated $63 billion in 1986. Some states can be expected to make up any resulting revenue gap by raising income taxes, excise taxes or sales taxes, said Mr. Fralick. ''One survey shows that 29 states have already proposed sales tax increases,'' he said. **********But even if the states overcome their own fiscal problems, Mr. Fralick said, they will be saving less. This hurts the economy over all, because money that the states salt away is figured into the national savings rates. **********''Retrenchment at this level of government,'' Mr. Fralick said, ''represents a removal of a significant source of support of an already sluggish economy.''  Ideas That Venture Out **********Corporate executives who normally scour the business landscape for startup companies their corporation might want to invest in are increasingly looking inside their own walls. ''Major corporations are becoming the source of high-potential venture capital opportunities,'' said Mark L. Radtke of Venture Economics in Wellesley Hills, Mass. **********According to Mr. Radtke, companies are beginning to see that some of the ideas and products they develop internally might provide the basis for new companies. As a result, they are using their venture capital to start up the businesses that can market - or further develop - these products. **********This approach is not just a way to find new companies to fund, said Mr. Radtke. It is also a potentially profitable way to develop products that ''might have been shelved'' because they didn't fit with a large corporation's overall strategy. **********Monsanto has already funded four small start-ups to commercialize their own technology, he said. So have Tektronix, Kodak and 3M. In the future, he said, this will increasingly ''be a mechanism to maximize the productivity of corporate R.&D.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/28/world/white-house-crisis-man-great-conciliator-howard-henry-baker-jr.html": {"writer_name": "Martin Tolchin", "pub_date": "1987-02-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1159, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Great Conciliator: Howard Henry Baker Jr.", "print_headline": "THE WHITE HOUSE CRISIS: MAN IN THE NEWS; The Great Conciliator: Howard Henry Baker Jr.", "body_text": " **********Howard H.

Casey as Director of Central Intelligence. **********But Mr. Baker's friends were not surprised that when the President himself telephoned the former Senate Republican leader at a Florida retreat Thursday and asked him to run the White House, there was little hesitation before the acceptance.

Now those friends say the Presidential campaign is probably over. **********''You have to assume that when you're taking this job you're taking it for the remainder of the term,'' a Baker confidant said. A Career as a Conciliator **********An informal, rumpled, unthreatening man, the 61-year-old former Senator made a career out of being a conciliator, bringing together disparate factions and cajoling them into agreements that led to legislation. It was this quality that led to his election in 1977 as Senate Republican leader and his elevation to majority leader in 1981, when the Republicans won control of the Senate. **********His skills were sorely tested. Mr. Baker reconciled the liberal and conservative wings of his party and then reconciled the President's goals with those of the Senate Republicans. At the same time, he won the respect and affection of Democratic leaders of both the House and Senate. He was fond of putting opponents in the same room for all-night sessions and was instrumental in orchestrating the President's many victories on the Hill. **********''He's a genius at finding the compromise point and pushing it through,'' said Senator Jim Sasser, Mr. Baker's Democratic colleague from Tennessee. **********President Reagan frequently acknowledged Mr. Baker's role. ''I'm frank to say that I don't think we could have had the successes that we've had up there without his leadership,'' the President once told a reporter. **********Although the two men were not socially close, Mr. Baker considered himself the President's lieutenant on Capitol Hill. He said today that he made a conscious decision ''that I would be Ronald Reagan's spear carrier in the Senate.'' **********''Anytime there was a matter on which we disagreed, where I felt very keenly, as a matter of conviction and philosophy, I let him know that, and someone else handled it,'' Mr. Baker said. ''But that was very rare.'' **********Indeed, although Mr. Baker's gave the impression of being politically moderate, his voting record was conservative even before he became President Reagan's man on the Hill and helped arrange the curtailment of dozens of social programs. **********Mr. Baker was never the most organized man in the world, nor the most driven, despite his wish to be President. His managerial skills also were the subject of occasional good humor, if not hilarity, on Capitol Hill. He often seemed distracted and preoccupied with matters other than the affairs of state. **********Mr. Baker was both participant and observer, casual and calculating. An avid photographer, he rarely is without his camera. He took it to White House meetings, frequently photographing the President and Vice President as well as many of the staff members he will now manage. **********He acknowledged that the camera reflected his own view of himself as an outsider. Asked once if he felt like an outsider at the White House, he said, ''I am, and always have been.'' Then, gesturing at his Senate surroundings, he added, ''And sort of an outsider here.'' **********Howard Henry Baker Jr. was born to politics on Nov. 15, 1925, in Huntsville, in the eastern, Republican part of Tennessee. His paternal grandfather was a judge; his maternal grandmother a county sheriff, and his father a House member from 1951 until his death in 1964. His stepmother then took over the House seat. **********After high school at the McCallie Military Academy in Chattanooga, he enlisted in the Navy and studied engineering, receiving his Navy commission just in time for the Japanese surrender. Mr. Baker went on to the University of Tennessee Law School, where he was elected president of the student body after running on a platform of - what else? - ''mending fences'' between fraternity members and the independents. It was an early example of Mr. Baker's lifelong devotion to coalition politics. **********He married Joy Dirksen, the daughter of Senator Everett M. Dirksen of Illinois, the Republican leader. ''His marriage could not have been better politically arranged if it had been made in the courts of Europe,'' Prof. John Bakke of Memphis State University observed. The Bakers have two children, Darek, 34 years old, and Cissy, 31. On Watergate Committee **********After a legal career in which he specialized in handling the defense in murder cases, Mr. Baker ran for the Senate in 1964 and was buried in the Lyndon Johnson landslide. Two years later he became the first Tennessee Republican ever popularly elected to the Senate. He easily won re-election in 1972 and 1978 and received national exposure because of his habit of helping Presidents, regardless of party. **********As a member of the Senate Watergate committee, he sought to separate President Nixon from the actions of his underlings, pounding away at an artful question, ''What did the President know and when did he know it?'' **********Senator Baker eventually grew bored with the Senate, however, and retired in 1984, to spend more time with his wife, who was suffering from cancer, as well as to earn some money and to run for President. ''I make no bones about it,'' he often said at that time. ''I want to be President.'' 'Happy as a Bug' **********Mr. Baker joined the Washington office of Vinson & Elkins, a Houston law firm, proclaimed himself ''happy as a bug'' and, when asked how it felt to be making $500,000 a year, told a visitor, ''You vastly underestimate me.'' **********Old friends and colleagues enthusiastically greeted his new appointment, but most considered it a political and financial sacrifice. **********''I can see his interest in terms of meeting a public responsibility,'' said former Senator Edmund S. Muskie, who served with Mr. Baker in the Senate. ''I don't see any political advantage to his doing this. He's a man who enjoys challenges.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/12/business/credit-markets-prices-rise-in-light-trading.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1987-06-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 813, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prices Rise in Light Trading", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Prices Rise in Light Trading", "body_text": " **********Treasury note and bond prices rose modestly yesterday, although market participants said the gains were based on light volume and accompanied by a great deal of uncertainty. **********Although the decline in retail sales for May and the weakness in non-auto sales over the last two months indicated that the American economy is growing only modestly, such domestic news continues to be overshadowed by worldwide developments. **********Late in the day, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent bonds due in 2017 were offered at 100 30/32, up 21/32 of a point, to yield 8.66 percent. Two-year notes were yielding about 7.60 percent and five-year notes were at 8.10 percent. **********Much of the recent uncertainty in the bond market centers on how the currency market will react to the American trade statistics for April, which are to be published today. Some analysts said yesterday that a deficit of $14 billion or less would encourage a stable to stronger dollar and higher bond prices, while a larger trade deficit would have the opposite effect. They also noted that foreign exchange traders in Tokyo are becoming impatient with the restrictions placed on them by Japanese regulators. These restrictions have helped stabilize the dollar in recent weeks. But when they are lifted, the dollar might decline again. Slow Growth Worldwide **********Economists expect that sluggish economic growth in Japan, Germany and Latin America points toward a slow reduction in the American trade deficit, which will keep alive the threat of renewed weakness in the dollar. **********''World economy is still dominated by a lack of growth, and nothing that came out of the summit is likely to alter that,'' said Georges F. Rocourt, chief economist at the Mercantile-Safe Deposit and Trust Company in Baltimore. **********Although slow economic growth worldwide suggests that inflation is not likely to surge and put pressure on interest rates, Mr. Rocourt said that bond investors still have good reason to be nervous. Another decline in the dollar might mean that higher interest rates would be required to attract money from overseas. He added that the Federal budget deficit might emerge as a new worry this summer. Although the deficit is expected to shrink this fiscal year to about $170 billion, from more than $220 billion, the outlook for 1988 is not as bright. Much of the decline in 1987 was a result of the change in the Federal income tax law. **********The Federal Reserve's report late yesterday on the nation's money supply had little impact on short- or long-term interest rates. As expected, the Fed figures showed that the money supply measures known as M-2 and M-3 had grown more slowly in May than April, and remain below the bottom of the Fed's 1987 growth target of 5 1/2 percent to 8 1/2 percent. The Fed's Criteria **********Although slower-than-targeted growth in the money supply would in the past lead to expectations of a more stimulative monetary policy with lower short-term rates, the Fed's policy today is guided by other criteria. Traders remember that in April, when M-2 and M-3 were also below their annual growth targets, the Fed moved to a more restrictive monetary policy with higher short-term interest rates. **********The Fed's motive for pushing rates higher in April was to keep the dollar from declining further by making it a more attractive currency and to demonstrate to the credit markets that it was willing to oppose the inflationary expectations that resulted from increased commodity prices. **********Analysts at Ried, Thunberg & Company concluded yesterday that ''unless the commodities and financial markets turn rambunctious, it looks as if American monetary policy will be on automatic pilot,'' for at least the next few months. **********The nation's basic money supply measure, M-1, consisting of checking accounts and currency, fell $4.4 billion, to $753.7 billion, in the week of June 1. Although the Fed does not set a target for M-1 growth because its links to changes in the economy are unreliable, analysts still follow its growth pattern to measure to extent to which liquidity is building in the economy. Since the fourth quarter, M-1 has grown at an annualized rate of slightly more than 10 percent, well below the 1986 growth rate of more than 16 percent. **********The more broadly defined money supply measures, which the Fed is watching closely enough to publicly set growth targets, are also expanding more slowly than last year. M-2, which rose $900 million in May, to $2.838.9 billion, has grown at a 4.5 percent rate since the fourth quarter. M-3, which grew $14.3 billion in May, to $3,555.1 billion, has grown at a 4.3 percent rate since the fourth quarter."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/12/business/executive-changes-623187.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 307, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** BankAmerica Corp., San Francisco, elected as a director Kathleen Feldstein, president of Economic Studies Inc., a private economic consulting firm in Belmont, Mass. *********** Calprop Corp., Los Angeles, a land development, construction, and condominium conversion concern, appointed William R.

Unfortunately, the trees, rivers and air of Eastern Europe do not understand Marx. **********Across Eastern Europe, pollution - as well as general economic decline - are the Grim Reaper of the l980's. In East Germany, according to a West German environmental research group, 90 percent of the trees are sick, dead or dying. The human mortality rate has increased sharply in Hungary, Poland, Russia and Bulgaria, and environment-related illnesses such as cancers and skin and heart diseases are soaring in all Eastern bloc countries. **********In Czechoslovakia, health threats have become so ominous that the Government, according to internal documents, considered a mass evacuation of its industrial region in early 1986. In Poland, experts predict that all plants in Krakow could be dead by the year l990, and the Polish Academy of Science estimates that pollution damage is already costing Poland an amount equal to 10 percent of its gross national product. **********In Leipzig, once one of the prettiest cities in Germany and now a chemical-industry center, the windward sides of monuments and buildings look like they were scorched in a fire, while the leeward sides are smooth and clear. In Molbis, a town downwind of Leipzig, the air is so dirty with the emissions of chemical plants that drivers sometimes must turn on their headlights during the day. Neighbors cannot see each other's houses, and visitors often vomit after a night of breathing the air. **********In Prague, mothers are advised not to give their babies tap water - even after boiling it. In northern Bohemia, the most heavily industrialized area of Czechloslovakia, life expectancy is up to l0 years shorter than elsewhere in the country. Rates for skin disease, stomach cancer and mental illness are twice as high or higher than in the rest of the country. According to Dr. Zdenek Badura, a Czech environmental expert, ''new viral illnesses are emerging. The activity of viruses has grown and they are assuming new forms unknown to us.'' **********Sections of northern Bohemia suffer with permanent near-zero visibility. The Erzgebirge mountains along the Czech-East German border are rapidly becoming a huge tree cemetery, the world's best showcase of the effects of acid rain. The higher one travels up the mountains, the worse the forest carnage. At the top of some mountains, not a single tree survives - just barren landscape with a few remaining stumps. **********In Krakow, the Polish National Lawyers Association reports that cancer, heart disease and artery problems are between two and eight times higher than in the rest of Poland, and the infant mortality rate is more than three times the national average. A 1985 report by the Polish Academy of Sciences noted an ''appalling increase'' in the number of retarded school-age children in Upper Silesia. **********And Poland faces a catastrophic water shortage. Only 1 percent of the country's water is clean enough to drink, and almost half the water is so polluted that it is unfit for any use. Temporary water shortages now reportedly affect l20 cities and l0,000 smaller towns. The Academy of Science report warned that if present trends continued, ''in five years there will be no more water.'' Why is pollution so terrible in Eastern Europe? One reason is that, since 1980, when the Soviet Union sharply reduced oil deliveries, East Germany, Poland and Czechloslovakia have increasingly turned to brown coal. It takes five tons of soft brown coal to produce the energy of one ton of black coal, and brown coal has a very high sulfur content. And East European plants often use antiquated machinery with no filters. Thus, the air is increasingly cloudy and poisoned. BUT THE problems are deeper than that. In East Europe, the governments are both protector and polluter - and this conflict of interest is almost always resolved by maximizing production at the expense of the environment. Some governments have tried until recently to deny that any environmental problem exists. East Germany blames its dying forests on storms and heavy snow. One Czech Communist Party ideologist attributed environmental problems to ''non-Socialist individuals still surviving in the country.'' **********In most countries, environmental policy consists largely of praying for strong winds. In Czechoslovakia, factories are often exempted from pollution regulations when their output is declared to be ''in the interests of the entire community.'' In Hungary, more than half the factories hit with pollution fines have done nothing to reduce their pollution. Pollution controls in Polish factories are frequently turned off to save energy. **********Pollution can be reduced substantially only with expensive Western pollution control equipment. But Eastern European nations cannot come up with a few score billion dollars to overhaul factories, clean up rivers and install catalytic converters. **********Thus, Socialist poverty will likely be destiny - and doom - for East Europe's environment. East Europe is a land of declining productivity, increasingly antiquated machinery and collapsing infrastructure. The only East European country not suffering falling living standards is East Germany, and most of its ''prosperity'' comes from its handouts from West Germany, and from extracting $15,000 from the the West German Government for each citizen that is allowed to emigrate. **********As the world economy becomes more integrated and the pace of technological change quickens, East Europe is becoming an economic ghetto. The only advantage in international trade that Eastern Europe had in recent decades was skilled labor and low wage rates. But now that the newly industrialized countries are rapidly raising their technological levels, Eastern Europe has lost its final advantage. **********In all of these countries, pollution is getting worse and will continue worsening for at least the next several years because of the increasing reliance on brown coal. Severe environmental problems helped create the Solidarity movement and continue to fuel the opposition in Poland. In Czechoslovakia, Hungary and East Germany, dissident organizations are spreading the news of health threats and urging governments to reform. Governments have arrested environmentalists but it is a little difficult to hide tens of millions of dying trees. **********Eastern European governments face a Catch-22 situation. They must soon either make expensive pollution control investments or face a public health catastrophe and possible revolts. To afford the necessary investments, however, the governments will have to cut living standards sharply - another potential provocation. **********Pollution could be the final nail in the coffin of East European Socialism. Unfortunately for Eastern Europe, there is no export market for brown snow and dying trees."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/04/business/currency-markets-dollar-closes-mixed-precious-metals-drop.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1987-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 508, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dollar Closes Mixed; Precious Metals Drop", "print_headline": "CURRENCY MARKETS; Dollar Closes Mixed; Precious Metals Drop", "body_text": " **********The dollar turned in a mixed performance yesterday, firming against the Japanese yen but setting new three-month lows against the West German mark in active trading dominated by rumors. **********Meanwhile, precious metals prices fell in a round of profit taking following the previous day's strong advance.

The December silver contract dropped 9 cents, to $7.94 an ounce. **********The dollar began the day stronger in Tokyo, helped by corporate orders and reports of an attack on a Japanese tanker in the Persian Gulf. **********''That is the first time we have seen corporate buying in Japan in quite a while,'' said Paul O'Gara, chief foreign exchange dealer for Midland Bank in New York. Rumors of Secret Talks **********However, as trading shifted to Europe, and later to New York, dealers pushed the dollar lower on rumors that finance ministers from the five leading industrial nations - the United States, Japan, Britain, West Germany and France - were planning to hold a secret meeting over the weekend to negotiate a lower trading range for the dollar. **********An official from the West German Finance Ministry denied the rumors that the nations, known as the Group of Five, would meet, and the Treasury Department refused to comment.

In these go-go years, the geniuses of high finance have been busy inventing a new world in which billions of dollars ride on stock maneuvers that few people really understand. Financial futures are swapped for stocks and back again in space-age strategies that sometimes send the markets reeling. Big investors play one market against another, believing - until the market brutally teaches them otherwise - that it is possible to buy one's way out of risk. **********While the system was working, hardly anybody paid attention. But, suddenly, as the market avalanches on the last two Mondays have shown, it isn't working. Now, the experts are beginning to ask whether all that cleverness may have helped push the country to the brink of economic disaster. Did the markets, in effect, try to commit suicide? **********That question is kicking off a debate that is one of the most fundamental that can take place in a capitalist system. What is the role of markets? How much of their function is to raise money for businesses? How much is to satisfy the urge to gamble? How much should government regulate a free market? **********Conditions were ripe for an end to the aging bull market, most everyone agrees. But the speed and depth of the recent dives sent a everyone agrees. But the speed and depth of the recent dives sent a chill through the country. And they put a spotlight on the relatively new futures and options markets. Demands are building for regulations tear the system apart. ''There is an element of underlying risk that was never perceived,'' said Salomon Brothers' chief economist, Henry Kaufman late last week. **********Critics charge that the market's collapse was amplified by the unusual ways in which the futures markets sometimes interact with the stock markets. The futures market was designed partly to shift the risks of price drops away from the equities markets. But when the markets turn sour, the huge institutional traders who dominate both markets play them both - with the aid of computers that can preside over the destruction of billions of dollars faster than people can figure out how to stop them. Rather than limiting risk, critics say, those computer strategies actually contribute to the market decline. **********Through history, futures and options have been spurned because they were often viewed as mere speculation. Thomas A. Russo, a securities lawyer who wrote one of the leading texts on commodities law, says options on commodities have been so controversial that they have been banned entirely in this country at least seven times since the early 19th century. **********But in this era of deregulation, they have come into their own. The first financial futures contract on securities, Mr. Russo said, was offered in 1975. Since 1982, one particularly novel instrument, a futures contract that mimics the price of Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, is the most widely used of the new ''shadow stocks. It is a high flier: The amount of money riding on stock futures contracts now dwarfs the amount in the New York Stock Exchange. **********Options are the right to buy or sell stock for a certain price on a certain date. Futures contracts represent the obligation to buy or sell stocks on a certain date. Like stock purchases themselves, both are bets on the future. But they are cheaper because fees are lower. That is because they do not require the complex documentation of real stock purchases and they can be bought with much lower ''margin'' deposits. Although, in theory, futures represent the right to have actual stock delivered on the final date of the contract, this seldom happens and most contracts are settled in cash. Rather than being a destructive force, as some critics charge, futures and options were supposed to be the magic potions of the new financial world. Used properly in conjunction with purchases and sales of stocks, their salesmen said, futures and options could prevent portfolio losses, making them the perfect hedge. The promise of lower risk helped draw money into the stock market. **********So grand was the feeling of invulnerability that someone named this new strategy portfolio ''insurance,'' a label that seems sure to win an ironic footnote in accounts of the billions of dollars quite uninsurably lost in the collapse of '87. **********WHILE the fever of the bull market built, however, the new hedges won plenty of followers and the futures' zealots were not shy about pointing out an apparent correlation: As trading in futures contracts surged, so did the number of shares traded on the stock exchanges. That, they said, was proof that the new instruments were performing the useful function of encouraging investment. The more money hedged in the stock market, the argument went, the more money would come into the market and the country would be richer. It was not an argument anyone felt much like puncturing while the Dow Jones industrial average was climbing skyward. **********Many of the future-markets critics acknowledge that the ability to hedge helped spur the bull market. But they charge that the futures markets whipped what might have been a gentle downdraft into a frenzy of selling, adding to the 508-point loss on Black Monday and the second big loss a week later. **********The ''portfolio insurance'' strategies essentially involve alternate bets in the markets. Most of the portfolio insurance programs are run with the aid of complex computer programs - so-called program trading - that can automatically initiate trades in multimillion dollar lots. In the equity markets big investors bet heavily that their stock will move up. In the futures market, for a small premium, they hedge against the chance that those same stocks will move down. If the markets move up, they take the gain from the increase in value of their stock minus the small cost of buying futures to cover themselves against loss. **********When the stock market begins to fall, however, the situation gets more complicated. As the value of stocks falls below the value of the matching futures index, program traders and portfolio insurers begin selling stocks and buying futures. This action, in turn, depresses stock prices further, and a vicious cycle begins that sends both markets into a downward spiral. **********IN an interview last week with New York Times reporters, the New York Stock Exchange's chairman, John J. Phelan Jr., said there was a flaw in the way the financial futures market fed on falling equities prices. Portfolio insurance, for example, was designed so that stockholders could shed some of the risk of owning shares, he said. ''But there's a chink in the system, so that instead of protecting itself against a crisis, it had created more risk in the system,'' he said. ''Some way has to be found so that once risk is transferred out, it won't come flying back into the system.'' **********It is not universally agreed that the financial futures markets contributed to the market's collapse. The day after Mr. Phelan's interview, Leo Melamed, chairman of the executive committee of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the nation's largest futures exchange, said efforts to pin the blame on futures trading for the stock-market collapse amounted to a witch hunt. **********Some critics worry that, without new regulation, the cannibalization of the main market by the futures markets may injure the economy permanently. The country's ability to raise capital could be in jeopardy if people fear investing in stocks, critics say. Some investors may stay out of the market, fearing the increased volatility that many attribute to the futures markets, said Roberta S. Karmel, a former Securities and Exchange Commission member and a member of the board of the New York Stock Exchange. ''The questions is: Are these products having the effect of destablizing the equities markets?'' she asked. **********Some who are concerned about the effect of the futures markets on the economy suggest such adjustments as limiting the amount of futures any one player can control. Some contend that reforms must be more extreme. Markets have always provided havens for the sometimes incompatible goals of investment and gambling, said the economist Robert L. Heilbroner. **********He worries, however, that the severity of the market's fall appeared so unrelated to corporate health that it represents the sudden deflation of a vast speculative bubble. The bubble, in turn, he fears, may have been inflated by futures markets - markets more divorced from productive enterprises than the stock market. **********The recent fall of the Japanese stock market, he said, can be explained with traditional measures of corporate performance. Since the action in the American markets cannot be explained the same way, Mr. Heilbronmer said, ''I can't think of another reason except that the gambling function overloaded the markets.'' **********President Reagan appointed Nicholas F. Brady, head of Dillon, Read & Company and a former United States Senator from New Jersey, to study the market collapse. His commission is expected to look into whether the futures markets increase volatility in the stock markets. The New York Stock Exchange is expecting a report in two weeks on the same subject from former Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, requested by the exchange several months ago. Other official investigations are also underway. **********The Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which regulates futures contracts, says it is studying the market's huge drop. But one of its commissioner, Robert R. Davis, said previous studies had indicated futures markets could affect how quickly equities markets move, but not how far. ''We have a problem of unsubstantiated allegations,'' Mr. Davis said. **********The fact that the Commodities Futures Trading Commission is responsible for financial futures is one issue certain to get a lot of study. The agency is small and, some critics say, unsophisticated, compared to the S.E.C., which regulates stocks. But a major issue likely to emerge is not who regulates financial futures, but how they are regulated. One key difference between treating financial futures as securities rather than commodities is the amount of money a player must ante up. Options, less popular among institutional money managers, are regulated as securities. **********Since the Depression, Federal law has set a 50 percent ''margin'' requirement for stocks. That means an investor may borrow no more than half the purchase price. In the world of grain and hog-bellies where commodities rules were born, margins were intended merely as a good-faith deposit that signaled to the seller that he was dealing with a person of honor. Those margins were much smaller. **********When financial futures came along, those same rules were applied and the result - until two weeks ago, when the financial futures exchanges temporarily raised their margin requirements during the financial panic - was that people could control millions of dollars of ''shadow stock'' with relatively small investments. Many critics believe there should be a margin requirement for futures equivalent to the one applied to the securities that set futures' prices. **********Those low margin requirements, critics say, multiply vastly whatever negative effects might come from the existence of a shadow market. Until the market collapsed on Oct. 19, investors could control portfolios worth tens of millions of dollars with an actual investment of as little as 7 percent of that amount. **********''The country learned a lesson about margins after 1929 and unfortunately, it's a characteristic of human beings that the farther they get from the past, the more they forget,'' said James M. Stone, who was chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission under President Carter. ''These financial instruments opened the back door to 5 percent margins, 50 years after the front door had been closed.'' **********The debate about the role of futures is not new. Mr. Stone, a member of the commission for the first few years of the Reagan Administration, said the futures market had accelerated the recent market collapse. In 1982, he voted against allowing their sale. ''These are very dangerous instruments and their benefits are not commensurate with their dangers,'' he said. **********Some business experts say they think the recent episode has demonstrated that there may be a need to increase margin requirements or limit the amount of financial futures that any one trader can control. **********Some experts argue, however, that the investment world will never again be a simple place. Walter B. Wriston, the former Citicorp chairman, said that the stock market's increasingly rapid movement had more to do with the rapid flow of information and the increasing globalization of markets than with other financial developments. In any event, he said, it be unrealistic to think that those markets were going to disappear. Even if they were outlawed in this country, he said, they would move abroad and draw investments with them. **********The new markets were born, he said, because computer systems can calculate the value of vast portfolios and communicate information in a flash. ''That system,'' Mr. Wriston said, ''wasn't built by economists. It was built by technology and it isn't going to go away.'' As long as there are financial geniuses around, they will find a way to test the limits of that technology."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/14/world/5-senators-offer-legislation-to-shut-plo-offices-in-us.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "5 Senators Offer Legislation To Shut P.L.O.

Baker 3d proposed to lay another brick in the foundation of a new world monetary system - a gold brick. The United States, he told the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, is ready to consider using, as an ''additional indicator'' for guiding the coordination of national economic policies, ''a basket of commodities, including gold.'' **********Although his proposal caught most of the delegates by surprise, a few American economists and a few foreign officials, including the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, and the West German Finance Minister, Gerhard Stoltenberg, knew it was coming. The one thing unsure the night before Mr. Baker's address was whether he would actually mention gold in the basket. **********Indeed, Mr. Lawson, speaking ahead of Mr. Baker on Wednesday, proposed that, as a policy indicator, ''special attention'' be given to ''the trend of world commodity prices'' - but without naming gold. Nor was there any reason to think that the Briton was concealing his interest in a return to the gold standard, which would require a country losing gold to tighten its monetary policy to defend the value of its currency, even at the cost of recession. **********On the contrary, Mr. Lawson said that ''we have put a lot of effort into developing performance indicators for individual countries'' and that he had ''considerable doubts whether we can usefully take that exercise much further.'' It would be far better, he thought, to monitor ''the group as a whole.'' **********But Mr. Baker's reference to gold as an indicator, along with economic growth rates, external imbalances and exchange rates, thrilled the champions of gold, such as Representative Jack Kemp of upstate New York. He hailed it as ''a victory for those of us who have been working to restore a sound dollar and low long-term interest rates.'' **********Was Mr. Baker's mention of gold simply throwing a political bone to the conservatives - or did it have genuine economic and financial significance? **********The markets reacted as though it did: The dollar rose briskly after his speech. And the price of gold fell, implying that traders thought a reinforced commitment to an anti-inflationary policy would make gold a less attractive speculation. **********Gold advocates, such as Robert A. Mundell of Columbia University, believe that gold should stabilize within a range of $500 to $600 an ounce. Gold, now near the middle of that range, offers investors little prospect of capital gains - and no yield. **********Professor Mundell believes that stabilizing the dollar against gold would also increase the flow of capital, especially Japanese capital, into this country's stock market as anxieties about further dollar depreciation recede. In a conversation on the eve of Mr. Baker's talk, he predicted that it would lift the Dow Jones industrial average to 3,000, with American equities looking better than ever, particularly in relation to Japanese equities. He forecast that stabilizing the dollar against gold would bring Japan's overvalued stock market crashing down. **********Further, he said, belief in a stable dollar would bring more capital into the American bond market, lifting prices and pushing down long-term interest rates. The premium required to lure capital because fears of dollar depreciation and inflation result in very high real rates would no longer need to be paid. Lower interest would spur growth in this nation and ease the third world's debt burden. **********However, this heavy inflow of capital, as Mr. Mundell sees it, would perpetuate the American trade deficit, which he considers the inevitable result - and the mirror image - of the heavy volume of capital that the Japanese and other foreigners want to invest in the United States. **********But many American economists stress that this game cannot continue indefinitely as the United States becomes engulfed with foreign debt. **********However, unlike the majority of American economists who consider the dollar still overvalued, as indicated by the persistent trade gap, Mr. Mundell considers the dollar undervalued in terms of what American assets are really worth and roughly right in relation to the current gold price. **********It is such thinking that now appears to be playing a role in the Reagan Administration's changed exchange-rate policy and its cautious flirtation with gold. It also looks like a new element in Federal Reserve monetary policy under Alan Greenspan, a longtime conservative and cautious friend of gold. **********All of this may shock many American economists, disciples of John Maynard Keynes who, in a 1930 essay, said, ''Gold has become part of the apparatus of conservatism.'' He warned that ''the friends of gold will have to be extremely wise and moderate if they are to avoid a revolution.'' **********The revolution did occur, but now gold is tiptoeing back - floating exchange rates having caused more instability than the world can stand. Yet the movement toward gold looks hesitant and uncertain. Mr. Mundell would call it only a step in that direction. More important now is the move toward stable exchange rates and the defense of the dollar."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/25/world/100-married-priests-meet.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "100 Married Priests Meet", "print_headline": "100 Married Priests Meet", "body_text": " **********More than 100 married Roman Catholic priests began a weeklong congress today to press the Vatican to modify clerical celibacy regulations.

Bernard W. Rogers, made it clear that he considered the emerging agreement a mistake. **********He said he had always opposed such an accord and asserted that his concerns were shared by all his subordinate military commanders in the 16-nation Western alliance. **********Warning that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization could resist a Soviet attack only for ''days, not weeks,'' without nuclear arms, General Rogers not only criticized the Reagan Administration's willingness to remove United States and Soviet nuclear missiles from Europe but also set out three conditions for maintaining the credibility of Western defenses. **********Although General Rogers, who is 65 years old, is leaving military life, many officials say his views could have an influence on the fate of any new medium-range arms control treaty when it comes up before the Senate for ratification. Pressure on Europeans **********General Rogers, whose views command considerable respect in Western Europe, implicitly criticized the Reagan Administration for seeming to rush European governments into accepting an arms control plan that some have doubts about. **********''I think the pressure was there,'' he said, adding that some members of the Administration wanted an American-Soviet summit meeting this fall and ratification of the arms pact ''before the President leaves office.'' **********Many European leaders, General Rogers went on, consider the agreement ''foolish.'' But he said they were ''hoist on their own petard,'' since, as a condition of deploying United States missiles in the first place, they had agreed to remove them if the Soviet Union offered to withdraw its equivalent missiles. **********''Which is more important, political credibility or the credibility of deterrence?'' General Rogers asked. **********General Rogers, who will hand over his command to Gen. John R. Galvin on Friday, cited three steps he believes NATO must now take to keep ''the credibility of our deterrence as high as possible'' after the medium-range missiles disappear. **********First, he said NATO must resist ''sliding any further down the slope of denuclearization.'' He called for a halt in new nuclear disarmament negotiations with the Soviet Union while ''we look at the long-term implications for Western Europe.'' **********''Let's not sacrifice the long-term security of Western Europe on the altar of political expediency,'' he said. Concern Over German Missiles **********In particular, General Rogers insisted that NATO resist Soviet pressure to include West Germany's 72 aging Pershing 1A missiles in the proposed ban and press ahead with plans for modernizing them. **********He also urged NATO members to resist expected Soviet pressure to cut back on very short-range tactical nuclear weapons in Europe and start eliminating aircraft capable of carrying atomic bombs. **********''I'm convinced the Soviet Union is going for the denuclearization of Europe,'' he said, adding that this would leave Western Europe vulnerable to ''intimidation and blackmail'' from the Warsaw Pact's superior conventional forces. **********Second, General Rogers said NATO must ''follow through'' on its 1983 decision to reduce, but also improve, its stock of such tactical or battlefield nuclear weapons. **********General Rogers said the alliance had already cut the number of these warheads below the ceiling of 4,600 that it set itself to reach by 1988. **********But he pointed out that the Nuclear Planning Group also agreed in 1983 to develop a new longer-range version of the Lance missile and a new nuclear missile that aircraft can fire at ground targets 200 miles away. **********Finally, General Rogers called on the Atlantic alliance to hasten development and deployment of high-precision rockets with conventional explosive warheads capable of striking at enemy reinforcements moving up well behind the front line. **********If all this is done and NATO allies press ahead with current plans to strengthen other aspects of their conventional forces, General Rogers said, then the alliance's present dependence on nuclear deterrents will be reduced. **********General Rogers asserted that he is not bitter about the NATO governments' decision to press ahead with the zero-option disarmament plan against his advice. **********But he insisted that the proposal to trade United States Pershing 2 and cruise missiles against Soviet SS-20's and to ban shorter-range systems as well is fundamentally flawed because the military need for the United States missiles will still be there after their Soviet counterparts are gone. **********General Rogers described the Pershing 2 as the European missile the Russians ''fear most'' because it can strike military targets in Soviet territory as well as in Eastern Europe, with pinpoint accuracy in just 13 minutes. **********General Rogers contended that a zero option agreement appears to run counter to the new political guidelines NATO countries approved last year for the use of nuclear weapons. **********These guidelines, he said, require the alliance commander to be able ''to strike with certainty'' at enemy targets and possess ''an escalating series of options'' in response to any threats.

Drop Followed Dollar's Fall **********The drop in bond prices followed the dollar's decline on foreign exchange markets to new lows of about 123.3 yen and 1.58 marks. Although declines in the dollar are still worrisome to the bond markets - because they suggest more inflation, stemming from higher prices for imports and more leeway for American producers to raise their prices - analysts noted that those fears have not prompted significant investor selling of bonds. **********''The dollar helped bring on lower bond prices, but I think the statement from the White House and the widespread intervention are reasons to believe that the dollar is beginning to reach its bottom,'' said John L. Hickey, executive vice president at Swiss Bank Corporation International Securities. Accepting the idea that the dollar may not decline much further ''gives good value to the bond market at this time,'' he added. **********The White House issued a statement yesterday saying that further declines in the dollar were not desirable. At the same time, central banks in the United States, Japan, West Germany and other countries opposed the dollar's decline by intervening in foreign exchange markets to buy dollars or sell their own currencies, currency traders said. Interest Rate Rise Not Seen **********Analysts noted that the latest declines in the dollar had not revived old fears that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates to help make the American currency more attractive. Concerns about higher short-term interest rates were allayed by a statement last week by Beryl W. Sprinkel, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, that an increase in American interest rates was not part of an agreement by leading industrialized countries to promote stable exchange rates. **********Economists also doubted that the Fed would be willing to raise short-term rates at a time when the momentum of economic growth seems to be waning as consumer spending slackens. **********One additional sign that consumers are more circumspect about spending was evident in the National Association of Realtors' report yesterday that prices and resales of existing homes fell during November. Sales fell 4.5 percent during the month, to an annual rate of 3.41 million units, 11.4 percent lower than a year ago. The median sales price slipped $600, to $84,200, but was still $3,800 above the price a year ago. **********John Tuccillo, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said the drop in the median sales price ''was caused by a change in consumer behavior with more emphasis on the lower end of the market.'' He said the lower sales prices did not imply that homeowners were suffering a loss of wealth because of declining values of their homes. ''We estimate that home prices rose about 6 1/2 percent this year, or a bit more than inflation,'' he said. Bill Rates Drop **********In the Treasury bill market, interest rates declined at the regular weekly auction. The average rate for three-month bills fell to 5.73 percent, from 5.96 percent, while the new six-month rate dropped to 6.32 percent, from 6.48 percent. **********Traders said the lower rates were a result of greater-than-normal demand because the maturity of the new issues coincides with the end of the first and second quarters in 1988. Others said yesterday's steep drop in the stock market might have encouraged securities dealers to bid more for the new bills in anticipation of stronger demand from investors who might pull money out of the stock market. **********Elsewhere in the short-term market, commercial bankers in charge of liability management and securities dealers in charge of financing their inventories are hoping there will be no surge in borrowing costs over the New Year's weekend comparable to last year's, when rates rose above 30 percent in some cases. By borrowing in advance to cover their end-of-year needs - even if it means paying a slightly higher interest rate - they hope to avoid a similar crunch this year. Securities dealers yesterday paid about 6.5 percent for overnight financing of their Treasury securities, compared with about 7.4 percent for one-week financing. **********The combination of advance planning and the Federal Reserve's willingness to supply ample funds to the banking system caused analysts at Griggs & Santow, an economic advisory firm, to conclude that ''the chances of anything resembling the late-in-the year tightness of 1986 are slim.'' **********In the tax-exempt market, the year-end turmoil caused securities dealers temporarily to offer an abnormally high 8 percent yield for a few issues of variable rate demand bonds. ''At the end of the year, there are relatively few buyers, so dealers end up setting an interest rate that reflects their cost of financing,'' one New York banker noted. ''By this time next week, the rates will be back down to 5 percent or 5 1/2 percent.'' **********Following are results of yesterday's auctions of three- and six-month Treasury bills:  (000 omitted in dollar figures)             3-Mo.

But the lesser-known cartridge disk has lately been gaining popularity with computer users. **********The cartridge is a hybrid that combines the floppy's ease of switching and the storage capacity of hard disks. **********The most widely used cartridge-disk system is probably the Bernoulli Box, whose patented technology employs ''superfloppies,'' each capable of storing 20 megabytes, encased in a hard covering. Like a hard disk, the Bernoulli and other cartridge systems can be installed as either an internal or external drive. The recent substitution of a Bernoulli drive for a hard disk in Leading Edge's Infinite Memory System should increase the prominence of this medium. **********Unlike the Bernoulli Box, however, most cartridge drives contain a hard disk in their removable cartridges. Their backers contend that hard disks have a longer life, because they are less prone to wear than the softer, flexible floppy. Personally, I've experienced no wear problems with Bernoulli cartridges, and I know of at least one insurance company that has been using them for two years without any difficulties. **********Putting a hard disk in a cartridge introduces two areas of potential difficulty: The disks may be too sensitive to shock damage to be altogether practical and the cartridge - which is not hermetically sealed, as the traditional hard disk is - may be too easily affected by smoke and dust particles. **********Lately, however, I've been using just such a cartridge drive, and again I can report that I've had no problems. Given that I usually manage to bring considerable difficulties upon myself whenever I deal with a new product, this failure to encounter any obstacles speaks rather highly for both versions of cartridge technology, hard and soft. **********The cartridge hard-disk unit I have been using is the Diskit 2 Plus ($3,595 from Ideassociates Inc., Billerica, Mass. 01821, tel. 800 257-5027). The only part I'm unhappy with is its price. It's hard to justify spending as much, if not more, for an external hard-disk cartridge system than you would for a computer itself. I also find it difficult to justify spending $1,000 more than what I'd pay for a dual-drive Bernoulli Box, each of whose cartridges has a 20-megabyte capacity, compared with the Diskit 2's 10 megabytes. **********Yet there is one application that can justify the additional expense. That's when you must deal with sensitive data best stored in encrypted form. **********Diskit 2 Plus offers the standard advantages of the removable cartridge medium: limitless data storage away from the computer, the flexibility of being able to have separate hard disks for separate applications or functions and fast backup. But its real edge lies in the rapid encryption system that it offers. Instead of the computer encrypting the material in a batch after you have completed a file entry, Diskit 2 Plus encodes the material as you work. Because the process is hardware-based rather than a function of the software, the encryption is much faster. **********THE manual provided with the cartridge provides very little background on the actual encryption method that Diskit 2 Plus employs. You are limited to a key ''word'' no longer than eight characters, whether they be letters, numbers or keyboard symbols, and each character in the key word must be typed twice. **********Only X's appear on the screen as you enter the key word. Such hidden verification makes unauthorized entry, or access to the systems data, marginally more difficult, at least for amateurs. For pros, I'm not sure how troublesome it would be to break the encryption. Then again, since its primary function is to secure such information as financial data or sales figures, would-be scrutinizers are not likely to be professional cryptographers. **********The bad side of this security system is that if you happen to forget the code you chose, you can forget the data, too. The manual stresses, ''There is no method of recovery if you forget the key used.'' **********But should you want to change the key word, that is easily done. First you copy the contents of an encrypted cartridge to a cartridge in an unencrypted drive and then recopy the information to the cartridge in a newly encrypted drive with a fresh key word. It sounds a bit clumsy, and it is time-consuming. But that is the price one must pay for the speed that hardware encryption offers. **********The Diskit 2 Plus hardware includes a drive unit the size of a small telephone book that fits unobtrusively between the monitor and the console. There is also a controller board that must be installed inside the computer, and on that board is a jumper to be set to either the encryption or the non-encryption mode. **********None of the installation maneuvers are any more difficult than those for other boards, although setting the jumper might be intimidating to some, since it requires actually fiddling with the board itself. A simple, sturdy toggle switch at the end of the board, accessible from the back of the computer, would have been a preferable design. **********THE software for Diskit 2 Plus, which comes on a standard floppy disk, installs automatically and includes a diagnostic program. My biggest problem lay in the seemingly innocuous insertion and removal of the cartridge for the first time. The drive doors of Diskit 2 Plus are very stiff, and you must wield more force with them than you are likely to be accustomed to using when dealing with a computer. The extra force is required because of the tight seal around the cartridge, which is designed to minimize contamination. **********Similarly, when you open the drive door, the cartridge seems unwilling to be ejected. Here too you must use more force than you expect to use in computing, pushing the door down beyond where it first stops. **********I asked several people to try to remove the cartridge, and all of them failed. They were afraid of breaking the drive as they wrestled with it. But in the process of getting over such misgivings, you learn how rugged the drive actually is. **********The cartridges are surprisingly sturdy, considering that they contain a sensitive hard disk. I dropped one a number of times from table height, and it continued to function without faltering. **********About all you could wish for is that Ideassociates would do with the price what I did with the cartridges."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/03/business/toshiba-us-talk-on-exports.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Rasky", "pub_date": "1987-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 800, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TOSHIBA, U.S. TALK ON EXPORTS", "print_headline": "TOSHIBA, U.S. TALK ON EXPORTS", "body_text": " **********American lawyers for the Toshiba Corporation met with Pentagon officals today to discuss steps the company will take to improve its export control procedures. **********Administration officials said the Pentagon had assigned an expert on export controls to work with the lawyers in drafting a compliance program for Toshiba. **********The meetings come amid a clamor from Congress for retaliation against the Japanese company and Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk, a Norwegian state-owned concern.

In college, his roommate created a gadget that sent a weight reeling onto his metal bedpost when the alarm sounded. The bang startled him out of bed and into class. **********Today's devices are not quite so primitive. **********Early in the morning, before the sun has risen, Mr. Jordan's Signalman - a transmitter attached to his clock and a nearby lamp -causes the light to blink in the still-darkened room. ''No more weights shattering the morning,'' said Mr. Jordan, 57, a registrar at Gallaudet University. ''It's a peaceful way to start the day.'' **********Strange things are happening in the homes of the hearing-impaired. Lights flicker, beds vibrate and fans start to blow when doorbells, alarm clocks or phones ring. That may be a bit spooky for the unaccustomed, but the devices that trigger such effects are making life easier for the hearing-impaired. **********''People do not have to live in isolation anymore,'' said Pauline Davies, a sales representative of Hearing Instruments. ''They don't have to say 'What?' all the time or worry about how they're going to get up in the morning.'' **********Listening and alerting devices account for less than 5 percent of the industry's $650 million in annual sales, but manufacturers expect them to rise to 20 percent by 1990, said Tad Zelsky, president of Sehas Inc., a distributor of hearing aids and personal devices based in the Southeast. **********Listening devices include telephone amplifiers, infrared or FM units, and portable microphones that a hearing-impaired person can place close to a subject, just as television reporters do. Alerting devices include the Signalman, a small transmitter that is attached to two electric appliances and can send signals from one to the other. **********Costs range from $25 for the Signalman to $850 for a vibrotactile wristwatch/pager, a complicated device that makes use of bells and vibrations. The device is connected to appliances and, for example, when a faint timer bell on the oven sounds, a signal is sent to the watch, which vibrates on the wrist. **********Many products are usually available only through the manufacturers. But some department stores and electronics stores carry the Signalman as well as television decoders, which make specially designed captions visible and cost approximately $250, and a pocket talker, the portable microphone that costs about $100. **********The popular phone amplifier -A.T.&T.'s National Special Needs Center handled 340,000 calls for it last year - increases sound by 30 percent and is available for about $170, according to Susan Decker, the company's manager of sales development. **********For Jerald Jordan, whose home is fully equipped with hearing devices, life is much easier today.

But, he added, the symbolism of the award to Mr. Arias meant that ''there will be no support for the contras at this time.'' **********Nonetheless, Secretary of State George P. Shultz told the House Foreign Affairs Committee later in the day that President Reagan will demand that Congress provide new aid to the contras before Thanksgiving. 'Necessary' for Agreement **********Mr. Shultz argued that the aid would enhance the prospects of the agreement for which President Arias was given the award. The $270 million, he said, was ''necessary to support the agreement and insure that it endures.'' **********At the same time, some Republicans grumbled about the award to Mr. Arias. Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader, said it remained to be seen whether the Arias plan would bring peace and freedom to Nicaragua. **********''The award may be premature,'' said Mr. Michel, who has often spoken for the Administration on the issue. **********Representative Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, was even harsher. He said the Peace Prize decision was ''premature and saddening.'' Mr. Gingrich compared it to 1973, when the Peace Prize was awarded to Henry A. Kissinger, then the Secretary of State, and Le Duc Tho of North Vietnam, for negotiating what was supposed to be an end to the Vietnam War. Military and Nonmilitary Uses **********''This is the same committee that gave the award to Le Duc Tho two years before he turned South Vietnam into a Communist prison,'' he said. **********Under the Administration plan for aid to the contras, the money would be available for both military and nonmilitary uses. Mr. Shultz said the money could later be applied solely to nonmilitary purposes if the peace plan were proceeding. **********Democratic leaders in Congress have said that they might later appropriate a smaller amount of money to help in resettling the contras. But they have been adamant in their opposition to the Administration's proposal for $270 million in aid. **********Under the peace accord, of which Mr. Arias was the chief architect, five Central American Governments - Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras - are to carry out cease-fires with rebel groups by Nov. 7. Other Provisions **********At the same time, each of the Governments is to insure that several other provisions are in place, including freedom of the press and amnesty for political opponents and insurgents. The agreement also calls for an end to all outside aid to insurgent groups. **********In an appearance in Washington last month, Mr. Arias urged Congress to refrain from providing new aid to the contras while the peace process was under way. There was widespread agreement today that the naming of Mr. Arias as the Peace Prize recipient enhances his prestige and his request to suspend contra aid. **********''Now people will pay more attention to the request from Central America that aid to insurgent forces should be ended,'' said Guido Fernandez, the Costa Rican Ambassador to Washington. Congratulations From U.S.  The White House and the State Department offered congratulations to Mr. Arias today, but the event signals a shift in the Administration's fortunes on the issue. Administration officials have complained with increasing frequency that the Arias plan favors the Government in Nicaragua. **********In his testimony today, Mr. Shultz seemed to be setting out the conditions to allow the Administration to declare that Nicaragua has failed to comply with the accord by Nov. 7. **********He criticized President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua for saying he would not negotiate a cease-fire with the leadership of the contras. Mr. Ortega said last week that he would seek to comply with the peace accord's requirement for a cease-fire by negotiating with contra field commanders. **********''He should negotiate directly with the resistance for a cease-fire,'' Mr. Shultz said. ''The Ortega regime has so far refused, trying instead to divide the fighters from their political leaders.'' **********At another point in his testimony, Mr. Shultz said of the peace plan: ''If any part fails, the entire structure fails. If no cease-fire is negotiated, if no full amnesty is implemented, the other measures are in abeyance.'' **********Representative Dante B. Fascell, a Florida Democrat and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said it appeared that the Administration was setting conditions difficult to meet by insisting that everything be accomplished by Nov. 7. **********Earlier, Mr. Wright told reporters that the Nov. 7 date should not be considered a true deadline.

''It is complicated, deciding how to give out our votes. We are now obliged to cross out names, and that is difficult.'' **********But she concluded that the system ''will take root'' and be instituted across the country for the next local elections in early 1990. Effort to Shed Complacency **********The competitive election experiment grew out of a call in January by the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, for a measure of ballot-box accountability to break the complacency of an utterly predictable political system. **********Competition is being imposed on a style of politics that, by tradition, shuns all signs of conflict in favor of collective harmony. **********It is considered bad form for a candidate to boast of his own virtues, so an associate, known officially as the ''trusted person,'' accompanies the candidate to public appearances to do his bragging for him. **********There are no brass bands or bunting, lawn signs or television advertisements. The only campaign posters are grainy, black-and-white handbills that could be mistaken for wanted posters. **********When Nikolai M. Selivyorstov, a lanky first-time candidate who works at the Surovikino grain elevator, was asked why anyone should choose him over Boris K. Sovranski, the manager of the cement factory, he seemed shocked by the question. **********''I don't feel any spirit of competition,'' he said, adding that he would quite likely cast one of his votes for Mr. Sovranski. The Issues Are Familiar **********Nevertheless, local politics in the Soviet Union are recognizable to a Westerner. Everyone knows everyone else. The issues are the everyday problems of poor telephone service, missing sidewalks and spotty garbage pickup - issues that the local councils have some power to affect. **********Even without competition, Soviet elections have traditionally been an opportunity for citizens to demand apartment repairs or other favors when the nominee is most likely to pay attention. **********The Communist Party still maintains a firm monopoly on the making of broader Government policy, and a central role in the screening of candidates, assuring that no election will become a referendum on, say, Mr. Gorbachev's anti-drinking campaign. **********Whether under the old system or the experimental one, candidates for the unpaid, part-time jobs as local representatives - deputies - are nominated at public meetings, usually in workplaces, and screened by election commissions dominated by the party. **********Local ward-heelers, called agitators, shepherd the voters to the polls, where the ballot normally bears the name of a single candidate. **********Voters may cross out the proferred name, and in a handful of districts each year a majority of voters reject the nominee. But to scratch out the name, a voter must detour to a voting booth, signaling his intentions and his questionable loyalty in full view of the presiding officials. Surplus Candidates Offered **********In the experimental areas, election districts have been combined and a surplus of candidates nominated, usually four nominees for every three offices. **********On Sunday, every voter will enter a booth and scratch off names until the number of candidates listed equals the number of offices to be filled. The runners-up become reserve deputies who can move up in case of an emergency. **********The campaign meeting at the Surovikino high school was to consider candidates for District 18 of the county council, and voters interviewed afterward said it was fairly typical, although subdued somewhat by the conspicuous presence of foreign guests. **********Eight candidates had been nominated for six seats that represent the eastern portion of the town, including the hospital, the high school, the automotive repair shop and the milk can factory, amid weathered wood houses and gray brick apartment blocks. More than 200 voters had been excused from work to attend. **********The meeting began with presentations by the ''trusted persons,'' usually co-workers, who took the stage to describe the background and work habits of the candidate. **********''First of all, he has a businesslike approach to work,'' said the proxy for one candidate, Viktor N. Yerokin, principal of the high school. ''He not only fulfilled, but overfulfilled the planned enrollment of children to our school.'' **********The spokesman for another candidate, the chief doctor at the hospital, told the voters, ''We can assure you on behalf of our collective that he will spare no effort to preserve your health.'' **********Vyacheslav V. Antonov, who works at the gasoline station, was praised for saving the station 150 gallons of grease last year. Sweeping Promises **********Then came a period of comment from the voters. Citizens arose in the audience and stated their demands. One complained of infrequent garbage pickup; another called for sidewalks along the eastern end of Lenin Street, and a third wanted better bus service to the hospital. **********Finally, the candidates were invited to speak. Only two came to this meeting, the doctor and a young investigator for the prosecutor's office. The voters seemed not to mind, saying they had plenty of chance to hear the candidates at other meetings or accost them on the street. **********The election speeches, on this occasion, were marvels of brevity, camaraderie and commitment. **********''On behalf of all the candidates, thank you for being here today,'' said Mikhail I. Selevanov, the doctor.

After that, no one else considered seeking the nomination. **********With opposition forces planning vast demonstrations in Seoul and other cities, the country's 120,000-member police force went on maximum alert.

Milestone in Politics **********Despite the inevitability of the outcome, the party convention was treated by the Government as a milestone in what is intended to be the first peaceful transfer of presidential authority in the country's stormy postwar history. **********In a speech prepared for delivery at the convention, Mr. Roh pledged to pursue democratic reforms and to seek political dialogue with opposition leaders. **********Among the changes that he mentioned, without providing specifics, were greater press freedom and local political autonomy. However, he warned that ''radical leftist ideologies coupled with violent activities'' threatened democratic advances in South Korea. **********In a speech of his own, President Chun bluntly warned that civil disorders would be ''resolutely dealt with, no matter what sacrifice may be necessary.'' Opposition Leaders Detained **********Police officials said they would put 200 dissident leaders under house arrest, but it was not clear how successful they were. About 15 opposition figures sought sanctuary in an Anglican church, a rallying point for protesters, and many others have stayed away from their homes since last weekend to avoid confinement. **********In the meantime, thousands of police officers in riot gear and in plain clothes took up positions along downtown streets to block demonstrations that top Government officials claimed were inspired by ''impure elements'' trying to ''create extreme social confusion.'' **********The opposition, a loose network of politicians, clergymen, labor leaders and students, denounce Mr. Chun as a ''military dictator'' and say that Mr. Roh will not be much different. ''He's a second Chun Doo Hwan,'' said Kim Young Sam, head of the main opposition force, the Reunification Democratic Party. **********Indeed, Government officials agree that Mr. Roh, who is 54 years old, is likely to continue the present emphasis on military preparedness, economic growth and tough tactics against dissenters. But politicians and diplomats regard Mr. Roh as more willing to listen to other views than the aloof Mr. Chun, and say he may prove more conciliatory. Boycott of December Elections **********In an interview, Mr. Kim reiterated his party's intention to boycott the December elections, and demanded that the Government resume suspended talks on revising the constitutional method of selecting a leader. **********Opposition leaders insist on direct presidential elections, contending that the present electoral college - or even a parliamentary system proposed until recently by the ruling party - offers them no chance for victory. **********By refusing to take part in the electoral college, the opposition intends to handicap Mr. Roh in his search for legitimacy, a problem that ruling-party members acknowledge they must solve.

He is the guiding force behind the College Savings Bank, a new institution based in Princeton, N.J., whose sole line of business is to sell certificates of deposit with interest rates that will change annually to keep pace with the rising costs of a college education. Filling His Brother's Needs **********Recalling that discussion with his brother, Mr. Roberts said: ''We sat over the dinner table and talked about the whole range of investments. When I suggested zero coupon bonds, my brother asked what would happen if inflation was to rise sharply from current levels. I had to admit that zeros might not be the answer. As it became clear there was no investment then available to satisfy my brother's needs, I decided to develop a specific product for that purpose.'' **********Even if the new product falls short of Mr. Roberts's claim of being ''the single most important financial product of this century,'' his hyperbole is close enough to the mark to attract attention from educators and financiers who are looking for alternatives to Government loan programs that leave students or their families heavily in debt. **********''Should the same generation that is bequeathing its children an extra $1 trillion in national debt hand its offspring a bill of upwards of $25 billion a year for their own college educations?'' asked Michael S. McPherson, chairman of the economics department at Williams College. **********Because 30 percent to 40 percent of the $25 billion spent annually on college comes from savings, the potential market for the College Savings Bank's product looked lucrative enough for Mr. Roberts to leave a job at Lazard Freres that he modestly described as ''very well paying'' and to attract four Lazard partners as investors and directors. One of Several New Plans **********At a time when the average cost of tuition, room and board for one year of college is up to $11,312, from about $5,800 in 1980, and rising much faster than the overall inflation rate, the College Savings Bank program is one of several new plans to encourage savings by families. Many families are already aware of the heavy burden they are facing. One recent survey by the Opinion Research Corporation found that 82 percent of Americans expect college expenses will soon be beyond the means of the average family. **********In an article published by the Brookings Review last autumn, Mr. McPherson estimated that college costs are likely to continue rising faster than the overall general inflation rate, though not faster than family incomes. **********Some states and a handful of colleges have responded to rising costs by developing tuition prepayment plans in which a specified payment today guarantees to pay college costs in the future. There are some drawbacks to these plans. For one thing, there is the possibility that the interest earnings in such early-contribution plans might be subject to Federal income tax. **********But the major problem with these plans is that they limit the student's choice of schools. If the student decides not to attend one of the schools in the plan, the amount prepaid is returned but the interest on it is forfeited. In contrast, the College Savings Bank imposes no restrictions on which college the student may attend. Costs Vary Widely **********One College Savings certificate, called a College Sure C.D., is based on the average cost at a group of 500 independent schools, as compiled by the College Board, the educational testing and information company based in Princeton. But college costs vary widely - at current prices it would take 1.49 College Sure C.D.s to pay for four years at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, but 6.36 C.D.s to pay for four years at Bennington College in Vermont. **********The bank advises families how to buy C.D.s with maturities that will coincide with their childrens' college years and how to make periodic contributions if they are unable to buy one C.D. with a lump sum. **********If paid in a lump sum, a College Sure C.D. that would cover one year of average college costs in the year 2000 can be bought now for about $14,750. Assuming college costs rise 10 percent a year, the C.D. would be worth $39,052 in the year 2000. **********Like other bank deposits, interest on College Sure C.D.s is subject to income tax. To ease the tax burden, there are proposals in Congress that would either exempt from taxes the interest on savings earmarked for college or allow some tax deduction for the savings. The proposals are supported by educators but are worrisome to Government officials concerned about reducing Federal tax revenues. Not Always the Best Rate **********To provide the College Savings Bank with a profit margin, the price of a College Sure C.D. will be greater than the average cost of one year at college as measured by the index. Because of that premium, the effective interest rate for depositors will be roughly two percentage points less than the college inflation rate, Mr. Roberts said. **********Since 1983 when Federal interest ceilings for bank time deposits were lifted, data compiled by the Bank Rate Monitor, an industry newsletter, shows that the national average for one-year time deposits has been higher than the rate that would have been paid by the College Savings Bank. **********''Our interest rate will often be lower than what could be earned at other banks, though at times we might pay more,'' acknowledged John D. Finnerty, executive vice president at College Savings. ''But we are not trying to offer the best investment. The important thing we are offering is a guarantee that over time the value of your C.D. will keep pace with college expenses.'' **********For the bank itself, there is a risk that its investments will pay low interest rates even though college costs are rising rapidly. ''I expect our earnings to be volatile and show some years red ink,'' Mr. Roberts said. Insured Deposits **********The bank's investments will be limited to high-quality securities, he said, supplemented by trading in consumer price index futures contracts and options on those contracts.

'Confusion and Pandemonium' **********Companies generally place about 50 percent of their pension funds into stocks, about 35 percent into bonds and the balance into a combination of real estate and other investments. **********''With the average pension fund being 50 to 60 percent stock, you can see that damage has been done,'' said James F. Beasley, chief operating officer of Rogers, Casey & Barksdale, a pension fund consulting firm in Stamford, Conn. ''There is a lot of confusion and pandemonium right now.'' **********Chrysler had about $4 billion in its pension fund in September, with about $2 billion of that invested in stocks, Mr. Zuckerman said. He was unable to estimate how much the fund had lost after stock prices collapsed on Monday. **********At the Manville Corporation, Charles F. Lemons, who manages that company's pension fund, said he was also unable to determine the value of his fund now. He said the pension fund had a value of about $800 million in September. **********A five-year bull market in stocks had resulted in a proliferation of overfunded pension plans as the investments made by pension fund managers earned more than was needed to pay benefits. But the pensions managers interviewed yesterday said that Monday's selloff eliminated some of those surpluses, reducing the amount by which the pension plans were overfunded. No Lasting Impact Is Seen **********Many worried retirees have been calling companies to ask about their pensions. But Mr. Beasley and others insisted that the market plunge in stock prices should not have long-term impact on the pension funds' ability to make payments to retirees. **********''I don't think this should be perceived as having a lasting impact on companies and certainly should not be viewed as something that would prevent them from handling their liabilities,'' he said.

It just takes away from the surpluses.'' **********For example, Bruce Bunch, a spokesman for the General Electric Company, said that G.E.'s pension programs were still adequately funded.

Toshiba Machine is partly owned by the Toshiba Corporation. **********The equipment sold by the Norwegian and Japanese companies would enable the Soviet Union to produce quieter propeller blades for its submarines.

'Just Doesn't Work' **********''The very high level of progressive taxation just doesn't work,'' Kjell Olof Feldt, Sweden's Finance Minister, has acknowledged. **********Earlier this year, Mr. Feldt proposed a sweeping overhaul that would lower income tax rates, reduce tax avoidance and broaden the tax base in Sweden. **********Tax revision - corporate overhaul will be addressed later this year - is a highly sensitive political issue in this country, especially for Mr. Feldt's Social Democratic Party. The Social Democrats, who have controlled the Government for 49 of the last 55 years, have made high taxes a central part of their platform. **********Tax reduction has always been the rallying cry of the non-Socialist opposition. So by calling for an overhaul, the Social Democrats risk laying themselves open to charges, especially from their own left wing, of deserting their Socialist principles. The tax debate will be a central issue in next year's elections, but some overhaul of the system seems certain to be approved. A Global Movement **********While the debate here, as elsewhere, is shaped by domestic politics, it also provides a magnified example of the forces behind the international tax-revision movement. **********In addition to the United States, nations that have adopted or are considering tax overhauls include Britain, France, West Germany, Denmark, Belgium, Australia and New Zealand. The drift of the Swedish proposals -cutting rates and simplifying the tax system - mirrors the global trend. **********Some nations may be acting, at least in part, out of fear that companies and skilled employees will relocate to places with lower taxes. **********In Sweden's case, for instance, IKEA, the country's most rapidly expanding retailing chain, has moved its headquarters to Denmark for tax reasons, and a large community of wealthy Swedes lives in Britain. One of them is Erik Penser, one of the most successful and influential individual investors in Swedish corporations. Swedish tennis stars routinely move to Britain or Monte Carlo as soon as they begin to pile up large earnings on the international circuit. **********But the impetus for tax revision in the industrial world is mainly a drive for efficiency. Ideology, to be sure, has played a role, especially in Britain and the United States, where the Thatcher and Reagan Administrations view high taxes as an infringement on individual freedom and enterprise. But Labor or Social Democratic Governments in Australia and New Zealand in addition to Sweden, have also embarked on tax revision. **********Accordingly, many analysts have pointed to the tax movement as evidence of an international shift to the right in economic policy. That claim is debatable. Yet even in a Social Democratic country like Sweden there is less concern today about income redistribution and more about efficiency. No Welfare Cuts Planned **********Political leaders here say the focus on efficiency is not a departure from its long-held commitment to economic egalitarianism, enshrined in the Swedish welfare system, but is necessary to insure that the nation can continue to pay for its generous social programs. So far, there is no serious talk of paring the welfare state. **********''The Social Democratic Party has to recognize that high taxes, which reduce efficiency and stimulate inflation, slow down growth and ultimately undermine social equity,'' said Mr. Feldt, one of the party's so-called new pragmatists. ''That is a sophisticated argument. But I think we will get it through.'' **********Mr. Feldt's proposal calls for reducing income tax rates to three levels: 60 percent, 45 percent and 33 percent. (Beginning Jan. 1, there will be two main tax brackets in the United States: 15 percent and 28 percent, although some taxpayers will pay 33 percent on part of their income.) In addition, Mr. Feldt's plan would sharply cut back the generous deductions for interest payments on personal loans, insurance fees and other expenditures. Curbing deductions would make up for some of the $4 billion of revenue lost from reducing income tax rates. Curbing Underground Economy **********Analysts here hope that lower rates will diminish underground activity, estimated at up to 20 percent of Sweden's gross national product, and thereby return substantial funds to the taxed economy. In all, the total tax load on the Swedish economy of 52 percent of G.N.P. is not likely to change much., if at all. **********Mr. Feldt's proposals will be debated in party conferences later this year and will be a focal point during the 1988 elections. **********Moreover, a program to revise corporate taxes, expected to include a hefty cut in the nominal rate of 50 percent, will also be introduced later this year. If approved, overall tax revision would probably go into effect over the next two or three years. Approval Expected **********Though details remain to be worked out, a sweeping tax package is all but assured. ''There is a majority in Sweden today, including major interest groups that would lose some of their special benefits, that understands we need tax reform,'' said Bengt Westerberg, head of the Liberal Party, a leading non-Socialist party. **********Indeed, the perceived need to rid national tax systems of decades of growth-inhibiting special deductions, allowances and loopholes is another common thread in the global tax-revision movement. Some economists suggest that tax systems have life cycles and what is occurring around the world today is the death of the postwar generation of tax structures. **********Accordingly, the only means to tax rationalization becomes a drastic overhaul, instead of the piecemeal bartering among interest groups that led to the problem in the first place. In Sweden, the American approach is deemed worth copying. 'You Have to Be Brutal' **********''Politically, you have to be brutal and have a clean sweep, much like in the United States,'' said Gunnar Eliasson, president of the Industrial Institute for Economic and Social Research, a private research group. **********Sweden's combination of high income taxes and proliferation of deductions has made tax avoidance a cottage industry in recent years. A decade or so ago, sidestepping taxes was considered shady behavior. ''But today, how to avoid taxes is one of the most common subjects of social discussion at dinner parties or over drinks,'' said Nils Lundgren, senior economist at PK Banken, a big Swedish bank. **********The 1980's also brought to prominence Roger Akelius, a best-selling author who has been called the ''Dr. Ruth of Swedish tax avoidance,'' dispensing helpful tips on how to outsmart the tax man. **********The inflation of the 1970's focused public attention on ways to avoid taxes because workers were bumped into higher and higher tax brackets. The high taxes, in turn, fueled further inflation. For example, if a company gives workers an increase in take-home wages, it has to pay out three or four times the amount because of the high taxes. **********One result: average wage settlements in Sweden have increased by 8 to 9 percent annually in recent years, compared with annual advances of 1 to 3 percent in West Germany, whose companies often compete with Sweden's. The Corporate Tax Debate **********Still to come is the debate over corporate tax revision. One of the secrets of Sweden's strong economic performance in the postwar years has been the implicit deal struck between the Social Democrats and major corporations. **********Part of the formula has been the tax treatment, which is extremely favorable by international standards. ''The big companies provide exports and jobs, but they are taxed very lightly,'' said Jacob Palmstierna, president of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the nation's largest bank. **********At present, the nominal corporate tax rate is 50 percent. However, given all the allowable deductions for investment and depreciation, the effective rate that Swedish companies pay is 25 percent. (Beginning July 1, the statutory corporate tax rate in the United States drops to 34 percent, from 46 percent.) The Federation of Swedish Industries has recommended that the nominal rate be cut to 25 percent, along with a cut in deductions. Industrialists worry that they could be short-changed in the political negotiations. ''If the corporate rate in the tax reform package ends up above 25 percent, it will be a tax increase,'' said Pehr Gyllenhammar, chairman of A.B. Volvo, the country's largest company. ''And Sweden would not be well served.'' 'Brain Drain' Feared **********Despite reservations, Swedish executives want tax revision. They worry about a ''brain drain'' of people in global industries such as finance and electronics if Sweden keeps its high income tax rates while other nations are cutting theirs.  WHAT SWEDES GET FOR THEIR TAXES  The Swedish social welfare system has worked in a society of shared values, where it might not in a country where different groups have conflicting goals, say experts at the Brookings Institution, who have studied the Swedish economy. Some Swedish tax revenues, unlike many nations' welfare benefits, go to reward those who work. Three examples are:  DAY CARE  Parents must be registered as members of the work force in order to enroll their children in day care.  SUBSIDIZED LUNCHES  Employees may buy coupons for half their face value and redeem them for restaurant meals. Consequently, many Stockholm restaurants are open only at lunchtime.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS  Work incentives are built into the Swedish equivalent of Social Security so that greater work results in greater retirement benefits."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/19/business/business-people-thrift-official-plans-to-resign.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 226, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Thrift Official Plans to Resign", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Thrift Official Plans to Resign", "body_text": " **********The Commissioner of the Texas Savings and Loan Department, L.

The fastest-growing part of many accounting firms is management consulting, and they do not want to use accountants for such jobs. **********Michael Bealmer, a Coopers & Lybrand partner with the title of national director of systems services consulting, said last week that 21 percent of the professionals at his firm work in consulting, compared with 12 percent five years ago. **********About 60 to 65 percent of the professionals are accountants in the auditing part of the business, he said, while most of the rest are tax experts. **********''Our numbers have been steadily increasing,'' he said, adding that he expects the consulting sector to grow each year until it reaches about 30 percent of both professionals and billed hours. **********Consulting growth makes sense because the wave of corporate mergers has reduced the number of accounting firms' clients. **********In the 1970's and early 1980's, Mr. Bealmer said, the emphasis was on hiring M.B.A.'s or engineers with about 10 years of experience for consulting. **********''Years ago, management consultants tended to be efficiency experts - an image that has dogged us,'' he said. ''In recent years we have branched away from a soft-product mentality that meant consulting sessions with management and writing reports.'' Now, he explained, the firm wants to present ideas and follow up to make sure they work. **********''So we do take graduates right out of college, and that represents a significant shift - a shift from being just an adviser to being an implementer,'' he said. **********Useful courses that new graduates might offer include management information systems, computer science, mathematics and engineering. **********''As soon as they join, we give them five weeks of a technical program,'' Mr. Bealmer said.

Now it is considered a sign of strength.'' **********He credits the change partly to the fact that many top businessmen, when they were still in college, had professors who did a lot of consulting. **********Mr. Schiller's firm stresses expertise in two areas - logistics and manufacturing. ''We like more experienced M.B.A.'s,'' he said, adding that they need about six to nine years of experience. ''We give them real live training on the job, and they must be able to contribute quickly.'' **********Still another change, he noted, is ''more and more overlapping'' with legal aspects. ''We act as expert witnesses,'' he said. ''Our firm has been hiring persons with background in product libability issues.'' Management consulting these days, he said, also overlaps with public relations and advertising. **********Another trend he described as ''a double-edged blade'' involves consulting firms that develop long-lasting relationships with clients. ''If we become too chummy with clients, a company might let consultants do the management thinking,'' he warned. **********To avoid this and make sure an effective job is done for a client, he said, ''a team of our people determines if our recommendations have been implemented after a year or so and if the ideas have been beneficial.'' **********Kearney operates around the world directly, not through affiliates. **********''There is a good market,'' Mr. Schiller said, ''because Europe is five years behind us in consulting, and Japan is five years behind Europe.'' **********To staff its global operation, Kearney has these criteria for M.B.A.'s from five major business schools: at least two years of experience in the firm's consulting area, fluency in a foreign language and work or residency in a foreign nation.

That would not be enough to kill the treaty, but Mr. Cranston warned that ''a determined minority can delay things for a long, long time.'' **********Even supporters of the pact cautioned that they wanted to see the ''fine print'' when the actual text of the proposed treaty is completed by technical experts from both countries. Their chief concern is how the bargain will be verified, a problem that has plagued previous attempts at arms control between the two super-powers. Talks on Conventional Forces **********Moreover, defense experts pointed out that today's agreement in principle would leave the Soviet Union and its allies in a stronger military position, given their overwhelming superiority in conventional forces. **********Many lawmakers agreed with Senator J. James Exon, a Nebraska Democrat, who said talks on reducing conventional armies in Europe is ''the next serious problem that needs addressing.'' **********It was a day of political irony for Mr. Reagan, as the staunchest expressions of support for the impending accord came from some of his traditionally fiercest opponents. Senator Cranston, a man that President Reagan tried mightily to defeat last year, said he would lead the fight for approval of the pact in the Senate. ''He may end up glad that I'm here,'' Mr. Cranston said . **********But Democrats today could not resist taking a few jabs at the President and what they called his born-again commitment to arms control. A View to History **********''I welcome these late conversions,'' said Senator John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat, ''even if it came later than a lot of us would have liked.'' **********But few questioned the President's sincerity. Mr. Reagan's support for an arms agreement was said to reflect his determination ''to go down in history as a peacemaker - that's human nature,'' as Senator Exon put it. **********Moreover, many lawmakers said that after more than six years in office, Mr. Reagan had learned a good deal about the terrors of nuclear war, and the economic burden that an unbridled arms race was placing on the country. **********But Tom Griscom, the President's communications director, said that Mr. Reagan has been devoted to arms reduction for a long time, and that he was implementing a proposal first made five years ago. ''People ought to read the speeches he's made,'' the White House aide said. Gorbachev Was Willing **********But Mr. Griscom also acknowledged that today's agreement ''was probably not something people would have anticipated'' from the Reagan Administration. One reason Mr. Reagan has put so much effort into reaching an agreement, he added, is that he found the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a receptive negotiating partner. **********The impending arms pact is also a significant achievement for Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who negotiated the major points during a marathon session on Thursday and will go to Moscow next month to complete the final draft. When he finished briefing senators this afternoon on Capitol Hill, the lawmakers gave Mr. Shultz a rare round of applause. **********Aides to Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger, Mr. Shultz's long-time bureaucratic rival, were noticeably absent from several key meetings this week, and some Administration officials said this was done deliberately, out of concern that they would chill the tone of the negotiations. But Congressional officials said the Administration would have trouble securing Senate approval for ratification of any treaty that was opposed by the Defense Secretary or his military advsiers on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. **********Although Mr. Weinberger, as Defense Secretary, played a less visible role than Mr. Shultz in the week's negotiations, Mr. Weingerger was the first in the Administration to champion the kind of proposal announced today by the United States and the Russians. Skeptics on the Hill **********In the weeks ahead, Mr. Shultz is likely to continue his visible role, negotiating the terms of the summit meeting, expected in late fall in Washington. That meeting will also deal with other matters, including human-rights issues and regional problems such as in Afghanistan. **********The skepticism on Capitol Hill came primarily from two camps: from conservatives who distrust any agreement with the Soviet Union, and from arms control experts who worry that today's agreement in principle focuses on a relatively less-dangerous category of nuclear weapon and that it raises potential difficulties between the United States and its European allies. **********Much of the criticism focused on the verification question, and many details about the proposed procedures were not yet available to lawmakers. **********''I am concerned about verification - I have grave concerns,'' said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican and a leading conservative. Concern Over Verification **********''If verification procedures are airtight - and I mean airtight - then we'll do all right,'' added Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader. **********Many lawmakers, including some leading Democrats, also criticized the failure of the Administration to move forward with efforts to reduce the Soviets' wide lead in conventional forces. **********''We don't have anything on the table that would make any difference in the imbalance of conventional forces,'' complained Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Armed Services Committee and one of Senate's most influential voices on military policy and arms control."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/28/business/london-coffee-climbs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "London Coffee Climbs", "print_headline": "London Coffee Climbs", "body_text": " **********Growing sales of coffee from Brazil have drawn processors back into the market, jolting prices out of a three-month slump, analysts said today.

Broadens", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union's call for a United Nations naval force in the Persian Gulf is the latest sign of a new interest by Moscow in using the organization's peacekeeping machinery to advance Soviet interests, diplomats say. **********In the 42-year history of the United Nations, Moscow was traditionally aloof or critical of the few times that international forces flying the United Nation flag have been sent into troubled areas. But recently, the Russians have begun paying their share of the costs for peacekeeping operations - to which they had refused to contribute. **********And in his address to the General Assembly on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze for the first time clearly called for a United Nations naval presence in the gulf to insure freedom of navigation there, saying it should replace the United States and other Western navies now protecting civilian ships in the area. **********Last week in an article in Pravda, Mikhail S. Gorbachev also praised the efforts of the United Nations to maintain the peace around the world by sending military forces to supervise truces or to keep antagonistic forces apart. The Soviet leader said the organization should increase such peacekeeping activities in future. New Interest in Command Unit **********Recently, Soviet officials have said Moscow was also interested in reviving a forgotten and almost-defunct United Nations organization called the Military Staff Committee. When the United Nations Charter was drawn up, the Staff Committee was supposed to comprise the armed forces chiefs of staff of Britain, China, France, the United States and the Soviet Union, the five permanent members of the Security Council. **********The Staff Committee was to command joint military operations carried out by the national forces of those countries on Security Council orders and intended to enforce peace. The need for unanimity, however, paralyzed it and prevented the Security Council from ever ordering such an operation under its command. **********Although the United Nations sent forces to repel North Korea's invasion of South Korea in 1950, that decision was made by the Security Council in the absence of the Soviet Union and the United States was designated sole commander of the operation. **********Significantly, the Soviet Foreign Minister coupled his call for a United Nations naval presence in the Persian Gulf with a strong appeal for unity among the Security Council's permanent members, essential for any military intervention in the area. Goals of Russians Questioned **********Western diplomats and United Nations officials are divided over what this new Soviet interest means. **********Some are skeptical, arguing that Moscow is seeking a propaganda advantage over the West by appearing to favor international action to resolve the gulf dispute at a time of public anxiety in the United States and Europe about the involvement of Western navies there. **********In addition, they point out that such a United Nations force in the gulf would probably include Soviet as well as American ships, giving Moscow an internationally sanctioned military role in the area for the first time. **********Today, the Reagan Administration signaled its opposition to the whole idea. A State Department spokeswoman, Phyllis Oakley, said such a United Nations presence would be new and complicated to work out. The Reagan Administration, she added, was also opposed to giving the Soviet Union ''the chance to increase its presence in the region.'' 'It Could Be Propaganda' **********Other officials and experts contend that the new Soviet leadership may now be genuinely interested in using the United Nations' peacekeeping machinery to help resolve the many bitter regional conflicts in which the Soviet Union is now involved, which are increasingly costly for Moscow to pursue. **********''It could be propaganda but it may also reflect Soviet interest in making the U.N. machinery work properly at last,'' said Brian Urquhart, former United Nations Under Secretary General for Special Political Affairs. **********In the past, the Soviet Union has never liked United Nations peacekeeping operations. Moscow seldom agrees to pay for them although it has only once vetoed such an operation in the Security Council. In 1978, after the Camp David accords, the Soviet Union insisted on closing down the second United Nations Emergency Force set up to preserve the peace between Israel and Egypt. **********Part of the explanation, experts say, is that the Soviet Union traditionally favors strict adherence to the United Nations' charter, which clearly states that all military operations should come under the control of the Security Council and the Military Staff Committee. Soviet Hostility Decreases **********But Soviet suspicion of United Nations peacekeeping activities also reflects its resentment at the large United Nations peacekeeping force mounted in the Congo in 1960, which Moscow felt favored the pro-Western factions in the bitter civil war that ravaged the country at independence. **********Soviet hostility to the United Nations' peacekeeping role has been decreasing in recent years, suggesting Moscow is coming to accept that the world body can play a useful role in ending conflicts and preserving peace. **********At the end of the Middle East War of 1973, the Soviet Union allowed Poland to send troops to participate in a United Nations peacekeeping force. And in October of that year, it accepted Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's invitation to send 36 Soviet officers to the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organization overseeing the cease-fire. **********In April 1986, the Soviet Union agreed to start paying its share of the cost of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, which first set up in 1978 to oversee the withdrawal of Israel forces from Southern Lebanon."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/01/business/dow-gains-23.60-points-ibm-up.html": {"writer_name": "Lawrence de Maria", "pub_date": "1987-09-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 675, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Gains 23.60 Points; I.B.M.

Abandoned villages are being repopulated, and food production is climbing. **********Worldwide, varying stages of ''oncho'' affect an estimated 20 to 30 million people - in southern Mexico, the Pacific coastal regions of Guatemala, Colombia and Ecuador, the Orinoco river basin in Venezuela and Brazil, in Southern Yemen and in Africa from Senegal to Ethiopia. **********While malaria spreads largely unchecked through Africa, the successful ''oncho'' campaign involving helicopters, larvacides and extensive laboratory research may serve as an example for other health campaigns in the third world, scientists say. **********Since it was begun in 1974, the program has lifted the threat of river blindness from a core area comprising Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger and Togo. Last year, the program was expanded to Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Senegal and Sierra Leone. **********In this village, southwest of Bobo Dioulasso, the country's second-largest city, and half a mile from the River Kou, river blindness is largely an unhappy memory. **********''There are very few blind people here now,'' Adama Sanon, Samandemi's village chief, said recently. **********The infection is borne by a black fly, aptly called Simulium damnosum. The fly's ''damnable'' nature came from its sting and its invisible cargo - larvae. **********In the human body, these larvae develop into threadlike worms. Lumped in nodules, the worms cause an itching so severe that ''oncho'' is one of only a handful of diseases that have been known to drive Africans to suicide. **********Moving through the body, the worms invade the eye. The buildup of dead worms in the eye eventually causes lesions and blindness. **********A new drug, ivermectin, is now undergoing field trials in Burkina Faso and appears to reverse the condition without adverse side effects. But, without controlling the carrier, medication cannot stop new infections. **********Since the black fly was the sole carrier and the worms had an estimated life of 15 to 18 years, scientists reasoned that the disease could be controlled if they could wipe out most of the flies for a 20-year period. **********In a program that has cost $200 million to date, a fleet of aircraft have flown weekly missions during the rainy season, spraying 11,000 miles of West African rivers with larvacides approved by independent ecologists. The fly fought back. New, resistant strains emerged and had to be countered with different larvacides. Winds, blowing across Africa from east to west, brought new flies into previously cleared areas. Scientists discovered that flies can travel 400 miles in a day on the wind. **********To stop reinvasion, the Oncho Program last year was expanded east, from a core area of 295,000 square miles to one of 502,000 square miles. **********While scientists do not talk of eradication, they believe that the problem now is sufficiently under control to start turning over monitoring responsibility to local authorities. **********''In 90 percent of the program area, the transmission of onchocerciasis has been interrupted,'' read a report prepared last year by the United States Agency for International Development. ''An estimated 27,000 cases of blindness have been prevented in Burkina Faso alone over the past decade.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/18/business/your-money-co-op-loan-shopping.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1987-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 903, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Co-op Loan Shopping", "print_headline": "YOUR MONEY; Co-op Loan Shopping", "body_text": " **********DR. PETER HOFMANN, who lives in a Manhattan apartment building that was converted into a cooperative, was faced with a task recently that thousands of other apartment dwellers are faced with each year - finding a mortgage. Yet even though the sponsor of the conversion had arranged with one bank to supply mortgages in bulk to all of the tenants, Dr. Hofmann chose another. ''The bulk interest rate was 9 3/4 percent, but I'm only paying 9 percent,'' he said. ''The difference was significant.'' **********Others involved in cooperative conversions have discovered that the bulk mortgages they were offered had lower rates or had benefits that could not be obtained on an individual basis. Those people naturally chose the bank or savings and loan association that the sponsor of the cooperative had selected. **********The choice of a mortgagee is one of the most important made by individuals whose apartments are being converted to cooperative ownership. In most cases, buyers of apartments in new buildings constructed as cooperatives or condominiums must also obtain a mortgage to finance their purchase. **********In those situations, the sponsor will frequently make an arrangement with one or more financial institutions that agree to provide mortgages to anyone living in the building or to those who intend to move there. The institutions normally make a master appraisal and engineering study so that each purchaser will not have to go through this process individually. And while buyers are under no obligation to use that institution, they are generally encouraged to do so. **********''The sponsor or the builder tries to arrange some kind of bulk commitment through a local institution,'' said Paul Havemann, vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage research company. ''It's likely to be the same bank that lent him money to rehab the deal. But there's no guarantee that this commitment will contain the most competitive terms.'' **********In previous years - particularly in the early 1980's, when rates were much higher - sponsors who had difficulty selling apartments arranged so-called buy-downs, in which they paid banks to offer more favorable rates to purchasers. But such buy-downs are rare today, when mortgage rates are just about returning to double-digit levels. **********Nevertheless, many sponsors and builders are still anxious to dispose of their apartment inventory and therefore try to make it easier for buyers to get financing through a bulk commitment. And when a rate advantage is not offered, other benefits may be included. **********''The sponsors may smooth the path for the borrowers,'' said Arthur Weinstein, a New York lawyer and vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives. ''They'll negotiate appraisal fees, closing costs and perhaps even points. Then there's the pure convenience of a bulk commitment.'' **********Some bulk mortgages eliminate the need for income or employment verification of buyers, which enables the application-to-commitment procedure to be completed in as little as 15 business days -typically less than half of the usual time. In addition, because of strength in numbers, less documentation may be required and representatives of the lender may be available on the premises to handle details of the transaction. **********''Under a bulk commitment, we offer more aggressive terms than we would offer typically on a walk-in basis,'' added Leonard N. Druger, executive vice president of Citicorp Homeowners Inc. in St. Louis. ''On a loan-to-value basis, we might offer 90 percent up to $400,000 on a bulk commitment, but only 90 percent up to $200,000 on a walk-in.'' **********In certain instances - sometimes by choice, sometimes by necessity - the sponsor will offer its own financing as another alternative to purchasers. This type of financing - known as a balloon mortgage - is often for a short term, perhaps two to five years, and requires a large payment at the end of the period. **********''Only a minority of the sponsors now take back and hold the mortgage,'' said Leslie Plump, a Long Island lawyer who represents a number of banks that participate in bulk mortgage commitments. ''Then they may try to peddle it to a bank or pick up a line of credit.'' **********Bulk commitments can also be obtained by a tenants committee, as well as by a sponsor or builder. **********''It all boils down to legwork by somebody,'' Mr. Weinstein said. ''I recommend that the tenants association stick together even after a deal has been struck and that it put banking on the agenda.'' **********But as Dr. Hofmann learned to his profit, a bulk commitment can at times be bettered by an individual willing to take the time and trouble to shop around. Of course, a careful analysis of the complex loan packages is necessary in order to make a meaningful comparison. Even if the bank offering the bulk mortgage is eventually chosen, you will have the peace of mind of knowing that it had the best terms available when a loan was needed to buy your apartment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/13/world/2-ex-us-aides-talk-to-walsh-s-investigators.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 286, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 Ex-U.S. Aides Talk to Walsh's Investigators", "print_headline": "2 Ex-U.S. Aides Talk to Walsh's Investigators", "body_text": " **********Two former White House officials involved in the Iran-contra affair have begun cooperating with the investigation by a special prosecutor, according to Federal investigators and people with knowledge of their accounts. **********The officials, Howard R.

Hymns are sung slowly to the beat of old tribal drums. **********But last Sunday, the churches of the tiny territory of Mizoram were filled with prayers of a more urgent nature. Worshipers were asking for a safe and fair election to enable them to be accepted at last by their country. **********For 20 years, the heavily forested mountains of Mizoram were the scene of a secessionist insurgency led by a former government clerk, who spent most of that period in jail, under house arrest, in exile or in hiding. **********Last June, Laldenga, the guerrilla leader, reached a settlement with Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in which the rebels laid down their arms in return for his becoming interim Chief Minister of the territory. Mizoram was also promised elevation to the status of an Indian state. Elected in His Own Right **********On Monday, voters here elected the 59-year-old Mr. Laldenga as Chief Minister in his own right, dealing a blow to Mr. Gandhi's Congress Party but shoring up his hopes for national unity. **********Although there were charges of fraud and vote-buying by all parties before the election, the voting was eventually deemed peaceful by all parties. **********''We are going to have a new state, and we are going to have a new beginning,'' said C. Lawmsanga, a counselor in the tiny village of Muthi, a few miles from Aizawl. ''All of us hope that our lives will be improved.'' **********With its myriad religious, ethnic, linguistic and caste groupings, India faces a constant struggle for national integration. But few of its groups are more disaffected than the 50 million aboriginal tribespeople scattered in remote forests and mountain areas. **********Like tribal people elsewhere, the Mizos and others in the northeast have mixed emotions about their relationship with the rest of India. Feeling neglected, they also fear that development programs could attract outsiders and wipe out their distinctive identities. Protests Began in Famine **********A famine in Mizoram in 1959-60 spurred Mr. Laldenga and others to protest, and their movement became an outright rebellion as Mizos felt increasingly excluded and oppressed by New Delhi. **********In the last decade, the Mizo insurgency died out. But aides say Mr. Gandhi pursued a political accommodation because of an overall strategy to convince Indians that their grievances could be resolved in the framework of Indian unity. **********The approach has led to political accords with leaders of Punjab, Assam and Jammu and Kashmir, some of whom had earlier been jailed on charges of sedition. **********Mizoram, sandwiched between Burma and Bangladesh in India's northeast, is an unfamiliar and untraveled place even for Indians. Since the insurgency began in 1966, it has been closed to foreigners, although foreign reporters were permitted this week to observe the election. **********Isolation has brought certain rewards. Only 500,000 people live in an area roughly the size of Massachusetts. The thinly populated ridges are lush with orchids, teak, thorny bamboo and wild banana trees, and the mist that settles in the valleys makes the mornings serene and beautiful. Headhunting Once Common **********The Mizo people came here a few hundred years ago, perhaps from China or Upper Burma. Headhunting was once common. So were animist religious beliefs holding that the hills, trees, rocks and streams were inhabited by demons who delighted in creating trouble for mankind. **********Somehow, Hinduism passed by these hills as it spread across Southeast Asia. Mizoram was transformed instead by the arrival of Presbyterian missionaries from Wales in 1894. Within a few years, 90 percent of the Mizo people had converted to Christianity. **********The mixed heritage of tribal and Christian influences makes Mizoram and other parts of the northeast an anomaly. In the village of Muthi, a radio was blaring ''Jingle Bells,'' and afterward people were singing it by themselves. Inside another hut of grass and bamboo, a middle-aged man was strumming Western chords on a guitar. **********The Mizos never had a written script until the missionaries introduced Roman letters. Now Mizoram has one of the highest literacy rates in India. **********But it was not always easy to suppress old tribal customs. A certain religious value used to be attached to seducing a woman, for instance, and many tribal chiefs had concubines. Even today, sexual morals in Mizoram and elsewhere in the northeast are considered looser than in the rest of India. But the church has been able to curb promiscuity, largely because Mizos quickly wrested church leadership from the foreign missionaries. **********''In the olden days, people got drunk on rice beer and beat their wives,'' said the Rev. L. N. Ralte, executive secretary of the Mizoram Presbyterian Church. ''It was the Mizo Christians who thought this should be stopped, and it was.'' New Threats to Morality **********Now, Mr. Ralte said, new trends threaten the morality of the Mizo people. Videotapes, films and other materials are regularly smuggled in from Thailand through the jungles of Burma, along with what are considered corrupting Western values. **********Many young men and women here wear jeans and chic-looking blouses and skirts. Drugs and crime are a growing problem for the police, and much of the recent political campaign turned on issues of law and order. **********''The Christian missionaries are doing a very fine job,'' Chief Minister Laldenga said. ''But we have been a troubled area for a long time, affected by violence and corruption. We must have a program of social reformation.'' **********Indians elswhere are expected to be watching Mr. Laldenga's performance in office. Aides to Mr. Gandhi hope the Chief Minister's installation will help convince the leaders of other insurgent groups that they can settle their grievances with New Delhi peacefully. **********That may be a farfetched hope, given the rising violence by Sikh radicals in the northern state of Punjab and by dissidents elsewhere in India. Ban on Immigration Sought **********''After 40 years, our unity is wearing thinner and thinner,'' Mr. Laldenga said, referring to national unity, and he added that certain ''special protections'' should be established for aggrieved regions. For Mizoram, he favors a ban on immigration by Bengalis and other outside ethnic groups. **********The problem of unity remains especially acute in the northeast. In nearby Manipur and Nagaland, a leftist guerrilla organization is said to have at least 2,000 soldiers continuing a rebellion that has been going on since India's independence in 1947. **********Indian officials say that with Mr. Laldenga's ascension, they at least might be able to withdraw army troops from the area for use in suppressing insurgencies elsewhere."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/03/business/5-year-stock-rally-the-far-reaching-impact.html": {"writer_name": "Leslie Wayne", "pub_date": "1987-08-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1823, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "5-Year Stock Rally: The Far-Reaching Impact", "print_headline": "5-Year Stock Rally: The Far-Reaching Impact", "body_text": " **********The bull market in stocks, which five years ago began a climb that is still breaking records, has changed the face of corporate America. **********Since the rise began on Aug. 13, 1982, the market value of all stocks has swelled by $1.8 trillion - or about $1 billion a day, according to the Federal Reserve Board. **********Does this represent actual wealth? According to Franco Modigliani, the professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who won a Nobel prize in 1985, the value of a stock is determined mainly by what the company is expected to earn. **********But whatever causes the stock to rise, the results are quite real. ''The increase in stock prices has created a sense of wealth that has had a major and beneficial effect on the economy,'' said George L. Ball, chairman of Prudential-Bache Securities. ''You've got 40 million people owning stock, and they are feeling richer and spending more freely.'' **********In addition, this bull market - which has advanced faster in its first five years than any other - has brought about a takeover frenzy and led to a significant consolidation of American industries. It has shaken up complacent companies and ousted entrenched managers. And it has helped the economy by encouraging spending by consumers and businesses alike. **********This spending has financed start-up companies and helped to expand existing ones, flowed into the pockets of corporate raiders and made many investors a lot richer. **********''What we are seeing is the largest creation of wealth since the 19th century,'' said Donald B. Marron, chief executive of Paine Webber, Still, past performance is no indication of what will happen in the future. No one can say how long this bull market will last. And many Wall Street experts and economists are uneasy about the risks that seem to be part of today's market. **********In the rash of deal-making, corporations have loaded up on debt - either to fend off raiders or improve performance in the stock market. As money pours to Wall Street from foreign shores, serious questions have been raised about foreign investment in American companies. And while the rising market has enriched many, it has rekindled suspicions about ethics in business and led to cries to re-regulate industry and Wall Street. **********Since August 1982, the Dow Jones industrial average has risen more than 230 percent, to a high on Friday of 2,572.07. This year, the average of 30 major stocks has climbed 36 percent, hitting four consecutive highs last week alone. This bull market has been exceeded only by one that lasted from August 1921 until the crash of September 1929, when the market appreciated 496 percent, and by the run from June 1949 to December 1961, when stock prices rose 355 percent. Better Economic Times **********Today's bull market is the child of better economic times. It began as a recession was ending, interest rates started falling and American business became determined to improve its competitive position. **********When it will end is anyone's guess. Experts say the traditional signs of a dying bull market have not yet appeared: excessive optimism, heavy issuance of new stock and sudden participation by small investors who normally do not buy stock. **********Yet there are storm clouds in the form of an economy that continues to limp along, a Federal budget deficit of $119 billion so far this year and a stubborn trade deficit. Still, the market has continued to climb on improved corporate earnings, a stable dollar and reduced fears of inflation. **********On the popular level, business has captured the imagination of small investors, who are enjoying both real profits from appreciated stocks they have cashed in and paper profits from those they still hold. **********Stock and bond mutual funds - the primary investment vehicle of small investors - have swelled in value from $53.7 billion to $430 billion during the bull market, according to Lipper Analytical Services. At the same time, such businessmen as the Chrysler Corporation's chairman, Lee Iaccoca, and Steve Jobs, who helped start Apple Computer in a garage, have become modern American folk heroes. **********But the quest for wealth has also led to excesses that highlight the differences between rich and poor, insiders and outsiders. The spectacle of a 30-year-old Wall Street M.B.A. earning $300,000 a year and commuting by airplane to a weekend home in East Hampton stands in sharp contrast to the unemployed oil worker in Houston or the Middle Western farm family fighting to keep its land. **********This has begun to create a backlash in the form of anti-takeover legislation now being enacted in many states - particularly those where corporate takeovers have caused a loss of jobs. And it has prompted both social reformers and many on Wall Street to wonder if compensation on Wall Street is out of line. **********''The bull market has sharpened the difference between solid poverty and flamboyant luxury,'' said the Rev. William Sloane Coffin, who recently announced his resignation as senior minister at Riverside Church in New York to become president of a disarmament organization. ''These financiers don't produce anything. They make millions of dollars in a most non-creative fashion. They don't make products. They just shuffle papers very brilliantly.'' **********Many are troubled by rampant greed, especially when it has bred illegality, as in the case of Ivan F. Boesky, once a major player on Wall Street, who admitted last year to using inside information in picking stocks of takeover targets. **********The prospect of more investment from abroad has also created worry. Foreign investors, led by the Japanese, added about $18 billion to their holdings of American stocks in 1986 and $9.6 billion more in the first quarter this year - as a lower dollar made American stocks and other investments a bargain. Effect on Corporate America **********But the bull market's biggest effect has been on corporate America -whose net worth was dramatically increased by the market run-up, enabling it to engage in a variety of business maneuvers. **********This, plus lower interest costs, has prompted huge borrowing by corporations - to fend off raiders armed with equally low-cost debt or to engage in deals that made shareholders or management, or both, richer. In the last five years, corporate debt increased by some $700 billion, according to the Federal Reserve Board. **********Crafty investors and corporate chieftains learned that a rising equity market and reasonable borrowing costs could be a powerful combination. With a small amount of equity financing and a large amount of borrowed dollars, a small investor group could gain control of a company -and the earning power of its assets. **********In this environment, such companies as Beatrice and R. H. Macy & Company went private through multibillion-dollar leveraged buyouts. Revlon was taken over by a well-financed corporate raider. Uniroyal, Storer and Levi Strauss fended off raiders by borrowing heavily to go private, while Union Carbide borrowed to repurchase its own shares. A Shuffling of Assets **********The corporate shuffling of assets has touched every corner of business: from old-line concerns, such as USX, that have been streamlined to become more competitive to whole industries, such as the airline industry, that have been reshaped by mergers to the elimination of such familiar public companies as RCA, General Foods and Gulf Oil, all of which have been acquired. **********Critics say many of these deals have been constructed to reap financial gains for a few and do little to add productive business capacity or expand the nation's industrial base. And, say critics, they have pushed corporations far into debt, which in an economic downturn could transform today's leveraged buyout into tomorrow's bankruptcy. **********''People have taken advantage of an unprecedented opportunity to get a greater hold on the future earning power of corporate assets,'' said Kenneth Lipper, a former deputy mayor of New York and now a private investor. ''Managements have become preoccupied with getting a piece of the action and not in running a company. It's like: 'I build nothing. I own.' History will look back on this period with scorn.'' **********Much of this activity was facilitated by the advent of junk bonds -high-yield bonds issued by companies with low credit ratings. For corporate raiders and leveraged-buyout artists, the $92 billion junk bond market gave them financial firepower. **********Wall Street, meanwhile, has boomed from all this activity. Once an elite collection of private houses, investment firms have become huge public corporations with voracious appetites for capital and the ingenuity to capture it. **********Industry growth has been explosive - from 1.7 million employees at the end of 1982 to 2.3 million today. In the same time, industry capital, the best indicator of health, has increased sixfold, to $30 billion. **********But with size has come risk. The stock market itself has become more volatile with the advent of program trading - sophisticated computerized trading programs that allow big investors to hedge their bets in the stock market with positions in the options and futures markets. **********No less an industry leader than John J. Phelan Jr., chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, warns that program trading could lead to a ''financial meltdown'' in which the market would drop by hundreds of points. Already, the market has been shaken by a stunning 115-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average in a 70-minute period on Jan. 23. **********Not only is the market riskier, but so is the business of Wall Street. Deregulation has cut margins on stock commissions, and new competition has eaten into the fees that firms earn for acting as corporate financial advisers. As a result, Wall Street houses are now pumping more of their own capital into bigger trading positions, into new offices overseas and into merchant banking activities in which investment houses put money into the deals they arrange. **********And problems have cropped up. Merrill Lynch & Company lost some $377 million on trading in the second quarter and Salomon Brothers, the nation's pre-eminent trading house, lost $100 million in its trading operations in April alone. Some also now feel they have overspent abroad. Shearson is reviewing its London staffing, while Salomon is trying to trim in London too. **********With risk, comes reward - and that is what motivates Wall Street now. But some worry that in light of the investment in buildings, employees and uncharted new businesses, Wall Street is vulnerable if the bull turns around. **********Warns Mr. Lipper, ''You move farther and farther out on the high wire, and when you fall, its a long way down.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/09/world/iran-contra-hearings-north-vs-others-a-sample-of-the-conflicts.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-07-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 572, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "North vs. Others: A Sample of the Conflicts", "print_headline": "IRAN-CONTRA HEARINGS; North vs. Others: A Sample of the Conflicts", "body_text": " **********ISSUE: ARMS SHIPMENT - One of the most important questions facing the committee is the nature of Attorney General Edwin Meese 3rd's weekend fact-finding mission last November. Mr. Meese was present when Colonel North proposed that William J. Casey, the late Director of Central Intelligence, make the false statement to Congress that no one in the Government knew about the Iran arms shipment of November 1985. Colonel North said Mr. Meese knew the truth within weeks.  NORTH'S TESTIMONY - ''I do remember discussions which included the Attorney General subsequent to this event. I believe there was one that Mr. McFarlane referred me to in December... One of the issues that had already come up by then was a draft finding prepared in concert with Mr. Sporkin who was at the time the general counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency. I was led to believe or at least came to believe in 1985 that Mr. Sporkin had gotten the acquiescence or spport - either he or Director Casey - of the Attorney General in that November finding. The November finding specifically referred to prior actions.''  OTHERS' ACCOUNTS: Meese statement, released by his spokesman today - ''As to the arms shipments that took place prior to 1986, he did not learn about these until November 1986. The Attorney General was in no way involved with the November 1985 ''finding'' drafted by C.I.A. general consel Stanley Sporkin. . . . In fact, he did not know of any such November 1985 finding until a year later, in November 1986.''  ISSUE: CHRONOLOGIES - Another key issue is who ordered the falsification of chronologies to be used by the White House in presenting the Iran arms sales story. Colonel North attributes inaccurate statements about the November shipment to Robert C. McFarlane, the former National Security Adviser.  NORTH'S TESTIMONY - ''As I indicated earlier, I had gotten that language from Mr. McFarlane.''  Q. So you got the language from McFarlane. He persuaded you it was appropriate to put it in. You put it in.  A. Who is ''he?''  Q. McFarlane.  A. Yes.  OTHERS' ACCOUNTS - Mr. McFarlane testified that he assisted Colonel North in preparing the chronologies and that he acquiesed in some language prepared by others that he knew was ''technically wrong.'' He said, however, that it was Colonel North who directed the efforts of four to five people. He quoted Colonel North as saying: ''It looks to me like what we're putting together here will assure that the President isn't hurt by this.''  ISSUE: CARGO PLANE - The Reagan Admnistration repeatedly told the public and Congress that it had no connection with the cargo plane. Elliott Abrams, the Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs, said this was because he had made a honest error and had not been told of Colonel North's role in the operation.

But most supervisors do not have a direct link to top management, because for years their importance has been little realized, he said. **********Corporate organization charts vary widely but often the maintenance manager reports to the plant engineer, who reports to the plant manager, possibly a vice president. Generally, the top maintenance people have been engineers with degrees in mechanical, electrical or civil engineering. **********The maintenance manager might supervise groups of project engineers with responsibility for areas like the utility systems, the boilers, waste handling and repairs of machinery. Mechanics, carpenters, electricians, plumbers and others would work for the project engineers. **********Mr. Hora predicted that there would be ''more autonomous work teams with a maintenance person assigned to each.'' **********''I am thinking in terms of a team of operating, quality control, material handling and maintenance persons,'' he said. **********In years past the plant engineer or the maintenance manager often spent a lifetime in the job, with little chance of promotion, except possibly to the post of company engineer. **********Today, Mr. Hora suggested, maintenance engineers might be rotated, which means that they would spend a few years in the job and then move on to other company areas and presumably upward. **********''They do not all need to be engineers,'' he said, ''but could be holders of master of business administration degrees, accountants and even production people rotated through the job.'' They would bring fresh ideas, he explained. **********Indeed, Robert W. Lear, a former chief executive officer and the current executive-in-residence at the Columbia Business School, has long urged more young M.B.A.'s to take jobs working on factory floors at the start of their careers. He calls it a ''logical start on the pathway to top executive positions.'' **********Since so much can be done to improve maintenance, Mr. Hora said, the ideal candidates for top positions might have an engineering background and an M.B.A, along with the ability to sell improvement ideas directly to top management. **********Too much emphasis has been placed on making workers more productive and too little on keeping equipment parts on hand and readily available and on the purchasing of new types of equipment, he added. **********''There needs to be increased capital investment in equipment,'' he said, adding that maintenance people know this but often cannot make themselves heard. **********Mr. Hora has just completed a study for his firm, determining which companies out of 300 large ones have the best maintenance. In doing the study, he ''found no best corporation in terms of maintenance management'' but he did pinpoint seven excellent plants of large companies with regard to maintenance operations. **********The seven plants named for excellent maintenance techniques were: Allied Fibers, Moncure, N.C.; Alumax of South Carolina, Goose Creek, S.C.; Amoco Chemical Company, Decatur, Ala.; Frito-Lay Inc., Beloit, Wis.; Great Southern Paper, Cedar Springs, Ga.; Ore-Ida Foods Inc., Burley, Idaho, and Travenol Laboratories Inc., Marion, N.C. **********At these plants, he said, managements ''have recognized the contribution that maintenance can make to their companies' profitability and they have worked at becoming the best.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/08/business/consumer-rates-yield-rise-is-expected.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1987-10-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 493, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yield Rise Is Expected", "print_headline": "CONSUMER RATES; Yield Rise Is Expected", "body_text": " **********Yesterday's increase in the prime lending rates at a number of leading banks and thrift institutions, the second rise in just over a month and the fifth this year, sets the stage for another round of yield increases for certificates of deposit and bank money market accounts. **********Yields on C.D.'s, bank money market accounts and money market mutual funds were all up for the sixth consecutive week ended Wednesday. **********At the Treasury's closely watched bill auction, traders said the mixed results were a little misleading as strong investor demand for the new three-month bills resulted in a higher price and lower rate, a development contrary to the prevailing trend.

By late Friday, the outstanding three-month issue was 6.64 percent, down more than four-tenths of a percentage point, compared with 7.37 percent for six-month bills and 7.56 percent for one-year bills. **********In the note market, interest rates also fell on Friday, and the two-year issue was quoted by government securities dealers with a yield of about 9.09 percent. **********Elsewhere in the Treasury market, securities dealers doubt that Congress will increase the Treasury's authority to sell bonds with interest rates of more than 4 1/4 percent in time for the Oct. 28 announcement of details for a major Treasury financing in early November. **********Because the Treasury has the authority to sell only about $4.5 billion of unused bonds, dealers are speculating that the regular quarterly offering of about $9 billion of 30-year bonds in early November will be eliminated, while the size of 10-year note issues would be increased. That possibility has helped cause 30-year bonds and 10-year notes to trade at similar yields recently.

Gorbachev's proclaimed policy of freer expression, is apparently the first privately controlled periodical to be published openly in the Soviet Union. **********The 56-page inaugural issue, reproduced using typewriters and carbon paper for lack of a printing plant, is being withheld from distribution until early July to give Soviet officials a chance to react. **********Sergei Grigoryants, a literary critic released from prison in February after serving four years for his work on a clandestine human-rights journal, is the editor. He said 50 to 100 copies of the first issue would be distributed next month, whether or not the group received the requested permission. **********''We hope to do it with permission,'' he said. ''But we will do it anyway.''

On June 19, he sent officials copies of the first issue. **********It includes a reprint of an article by Andrei D. Sakharov, who Mr. Grigoryants said had agreed to appear at the news conference. Dr. Sakharov's article is an appeal for revisions in the Soviet Criminal Code and for release of political and religious prisoners. **********The issue of Glasnost also includes an article describing the growth of unofficial political discussion clubs in Moscow, reports on the Ukrainian Catholic Church and the underground human-rights organization Moscow Trust Group, and an annotated list of prisoners serving in Chistopol Prison, where Mr. Grigoryants was imprisoned until February. Plans for Publication **********Mr. Grigoryants said he and his collaboraters hoped to publish the magazine 36 times a year and would concentrate on problems that the official press overlooks, including human rights, emigration, prison conditions and religious affairs. Political and cultural reports will also be included. **********He said the organizers of the magazine had been offered financial support from both Soviet and foreign investors who wanted to reprint the magazine in Europe and the United States. **********Mr. Grigoryants says he sees the undertaking as a test of liberalization under Mr. Gorbachev. **********In a recent letter to the Central Committee, Mr. Grigoryants proposed to organize his magazine under a new law permitting individuals to start small-scale businesses. The law does not envision publishing ventures, but it does not rule them out, either. **********In addition to the magazine, Mr. Grigoryants said he and several friends planned to begin what he called a press club for free discussion of current events with public officials. In July, he said, the group will invite Soviet officials to discuss cases of would-be emigres who have been denied permission to leave the country because they once had access to secret information. **********Mr. Grigoryants acknowledges that without official authorization to hire printers and to buy paper, it will be extremely difficult to expand Glasnost beyond a limited circulation.

Icahn has turned down an offer from a foreign investor willing to pay a premium for the large Icahn holding in the USX Corporation, Wall Street sources said yesterday. **********The sources said that the buyout offer was made about a week ago by a group of small brokerage companies who said they were acting on behalf of a foreign investor. The sources would not say who the investor was. **********They said Mr. Icahn feared that if he accepted the offer, he would lose credibility on Wall Street, where he relies on his ability to raise huge amounts of financing. Greenmail Spurned **********To bolster his $8 billion offer to buy USX, Mr. Icahn stressed that he would not accept what is commonly known as greenmail by selling his stake of 29.3 million shares, or 11.4 percent of the company, at a premium. **********Through this stance, Mr. Icahn was able to persuade a wider group of investors to put up money for his offer, since he was assuring them he would not walk away with a higher profit for himself and his original group of backers. **********But Mr. Icahn was stymied in his bid to take over the huge oil and steel company by stalling actions instituted by David M. Roderick, the chairman of USX, who later also took measures that would make it more expensive to take over the company. Finally, Mr. Icahn withdrew his bid of $31 a share on Jan. 9, although he vowed to continue to seek control. Frustration for Mr. Icahn **********Now, the sources said, Mr. Icahn is frustrated and at a loss about what to do next to extricate himself from what so far has been his first significant defeat in an attempt to gain control of a major company. His most notable success was the acquisition of Trans World Airlines, which was nearly bankrupt when it was purchased and now is posting profits. **********Mr. Icahn is finding it difficult to dispose of his large USX stake, which has tied up more than $670 million. He is also paying interest on the funds borrowed to buy the stock. **********One leading foreign investor who has disclosed a strong interest in USX's shares in the past is Robert Holmes a Court, the Australian financier. He said last August that he intended to spend at least $15 million to buy USX stock and to acquire a stake of up to 15 percent. **********In October Mr. Roderick said that Mr. Holmes a Court has sold his $15 million investment, but Wall Street brokers said later that the investor was buying USX shares again. Little Leverage for Icahn **********Charles Bradford, the steel analyst for Merrill Lynch, said that there was little Mr. Icahn could do to press Mr. Roderick and the USX board of directors to do what he wants. The recent settlement of a strike by steelworkers against USX removes one element that had been seen as helpful for Mr. Icahn's bid. **********On the other hand, Mr. Bradford said that Mr. Icahn was in a good position to profit from his holdings if he was willing to hold on for the long term. **********He projected that USX would earn a modest $1 a share in 1987 from a small recovery in steel operations and that its oil division should also do better because of some firming of oil prices. In addition, he noted that a large part of Mr. Icahn's interest costs was offset by dividends paid by USX on the stock he owned. **********Thus, he concluded, Mr. Icahn could wait to see what developed at USX at small risk to his investment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/14/world/lost-10-million-regained-by-swiss.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Netter", "pub_date": "1987-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 582, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "'LOST' $10 MILLION REGAINED BY SWISS", "print_headline": "'LOST' $10 MILLION REGAINED BY SWISS", "body_text": " **********A $10 million donation from the Sultan of Brunei to the Nicaraguan rebels that was sent to the wrong Swiss bank account last August has been recovered by Swiss authorities, a spokesman for the bank said today. **********The bank, Credit Suisse, said in a communique that an investigating magistrate in Geneva last week froze all bank accounts belonging to the recipient of the misdeposited money, a businessman whose identity has not been made public.

That anxiety culminated Tuesday in the withdrawal of a proposed $1.5 billion financing for the Southland Corporation. **********While many analysts said the Southland financing was plagued by a fundamental problem of too many bonds backed by a company with too little earnings, they agreed that its problems were compounded by the generally negative conditions for the entire market of high-yielding, high-risk issues known as junk bonds. **********When stock prices fell sharply in October, yields of junk bonds rose as investors worried that the stock market decline would lead to a cutback in consumer spending that would, in turn, cause a recession. A recession is the best environment for Treasury bonds, whose prices rise on the prospect of declining inflation and interest rates, but it is the worst environment for junk bonds. Buyers of junk bonds worry more about whether corporations can pay interest and principal on their bonds if revenues weaken in a recession. Most Important Question **********''The most important question for the market is whether the economy is going into a recession or will it muddle along with modest or slow growth,'' said John A. Utter, portfolio manager of the IDS Extra Income Fund, a $1 billion mutual fund specializing in junk bonds. ''If there is nothing worse than a growth recession, then I expect the market for low-grade bonds will bounce back.'' But if there is a full-fledged recession, Mr. Utter said, ''then low-grade issues will underperform the rest of the bond market.'' **********The next economic recession, whenever it comes, will mark the most severe test of the junk bond market since it has grown from a backwater of the financial markets to a $150 billion market whose investors include thousands of mutual funds, savings and loans associations and insurance companies. No one knows how many issues may default, but many analysts expect that the rate of failure for junk bonds will exceed the historical average of about 1 1/2 percent of all outstanding issues. **********But investors have willingly accepted that risk in recent years, lured by the promise of high interest rates. Bond yields vary widely, but many junk issues are now above 14 percent, rising to more than 18 percent for riskier issues. **********According to data compiled by Kidder, Peabody & Company, 10-year single-B rated bonds of industrial companies averaged about 14.83 percent on Oct. 27, up from 13.74 percent just two weeks earlier. Market sources said the Southland financing would have offered even higher interest rates, of 15 1/2 percent and 16 1/4 percent on interest bearing bonds due in 1997 and 2002, respectively. Many Move Back In **********Since late October, analysts noted that many investors have been moving back into the high-yield market, despite their cautious response to the Southland offering. Prices of most issues have recovered from their lowest points and gained more ground after the Southland offering was canceled. **********At Drexel Burnham Lambert, the largest trader and underwriter of junk bonds, a spokesman said that yesterday ''was one of our busiest days in two years, with heavy volume and broad-based buying.'' Besides the demand from investors who were prepared to buy the Southland offering, he said that up to $3 billion of outstanding junk bonds had been retired in the last few weeks, adding to the amount of funds investors have available for buying other issues. **********Solomon Samson, an analyst at the Standard & Poor's Corporation, said that ''it's too early to ring the death knell on the junk bond market, or to assume that defaults won't come.'' He stood by a conclusion he reached earlier this year that junk bond issues of the last few years are more risky than earlier ones and ''could translate into higher default rates than in the past.'' **********He also estimated earlier this year that, over all, the performance of junk bonds over time ''will fall short of expectations'' and buyers of junk bonds may eventually return to more conservative investments. **********Donald P. Brennan, meanwhile, head of merchant banking at Morgan Stanley & Company, said, ''I would not read too much into the Southland financing as to the health or sickness of the entire high-yield market,'' 'Deals Have to Be Sensible' **********While the collapse of the stock market has led to a pause in junk bond financing, Mr. Brennan said he expected to see more corporate buyouts financed by junk bonds. ''But the deals have to be sensible, and within the company's ability to service the debt,'' he said. Several institutional investors who declined to buy the Southland bonds said they were not pulling back from all junk bonds, but were just not satisfied with the Southland financing, particularly the $650 million of bonds that would pay no interest for five years or pay interest in the form of other bonds rather than cash. **********Many investors and securities dealers said that the Southland financing was struggling even before the drop in stock prices made investors more wary of junk bonds. **********Raymond E. Neidle, a senior securities analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei, a New York credit rating firm, said that ''the company's earnings projections seemed to be on the optimistic side, especially since the interest rates on the bonds were going to be higher than they earlier assumed.'' **********Mr. Neidle noted that Goldman, Sachs & Company and Salomon Brothers, Southland's lead underwriters, did not plan to retain an equity interest in Southland, ''which is a negative factor for many investors who like to see more of a commitment to the company on the part of the underwriters.'' The two firms planned to use proceeds from the junk bond sale to repay $600 million in short-term ''bridge'' loans they arranged for Southland, including about $100 million each on their own books. Investors Being Selective **********While the rise in bond yields is a clear sign that investors see more risks, traders noted that investors were being more selective but were not fleeing the market. In the last few weeks, they have been trying to buy bonds of those companies they think will weather a recession better than others. **********''We see some tiering in the market as investors distinguish between the issues that should fare well in a recession and those which might be harder hit,'' said Robert Levine, head of high-yield bond research at Kidder, Peabody. **********For the issues that investors regard as the least risky in the junk bond category, prices have bounced back sharply from their lows set on Oct. 19. For example, a Colt Industries 12 1/2 percent issue due in 2001 was offered yesterday at 102 1/4, up from as low as 89 3/4 on Oct. 19, when the stock market and all junk bond prices plummeted. In fact, the Colt issue is now higher than before the Oct. 19 decline. **********But other issues are still treated skeptically by investors. Fruehauf, a supplier to the automobile industry and lessor of truck trailers and containers, is among the companies regarded as vulnerable to a recession. Its 13 3/4 percent securities due in 1996 were offered yesterday at a price of 72, up from 68 on Oct. 23 but still below the price of 81 7/8 in trading on Oct. 16. **********Raymond Lemanski, a vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities, said that, despite fears of a weaker economy and the problems of the Southland financing, there were other reasons to expect that corporate takeovers would continue and might still be financed by junk bonds. He said that interest rates on bank loans, which finance half or more of many leveraged buyouts, had declined. At the same time, the drop in the stock market has reduced the purchase price of many companies. Those two factors ''should more than compensate for higher interest rates on the junk bonds,'' he said. **********Even if large public offerings of junk bonds are more difficult now, those bonds may still be issued in exchange for common stock of a takeover target. Investment bankers have already proposed issuing junk bonds as partial payment for stock of the CNW Corporation and the Seaman Furniture Company. **********The risks faced by companies that issued junk bonds in anticipation of asset sales have also been exaggerated, according to many analysts. For example, Mr. Brennan said that Burlington Industries - which issued $1.7 billion of junk bonds before the market collapsed in September to finance a leveraged buyout arranged in April, when the Dow Jones industrial average was around 2,100, had not encountered difficulties in selling assets since the stock market declined in October."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/18/business/curb-asked-on-foreign-takeovers.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Kilborn", "pub_date": "1987-03-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 737, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CURB ASKED ON FOREIGN TAKEOVERS", "print_headline": "CURB ASKED ON FOREIGN TAKEOVERS", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration will consider policies to block foreign takeovers of companies in security-sensitive industries, officials said today. **********''I think there would be quite a lot of support for that position,'' Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said. **********A Japanese company, Fujitsu Ltd. announced Monday that it had abandoned its proposed takeover of the Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation in California, following opposition by the Pentagon, the Commerce Department and the Central Intelligence Agency. **********Japanese officials said Mr. Baldrige's public criticism of the deal contributed to its cancellation. His position appears to mark a movement toward an Administration policy of putting some American companies off limits to foreign investors. Specific Guidelines Sought **********''I just get the feeling it's an idea whose time has come,'' Mr. Baldrige said. He and other officials he declined to name want the Administration to fix specific guidelines for preventing such takeovers, he said, which would apply to only a ''tiny minority'' of the total. **********''Everybody wants an open investment policy,'' he said, ''but there have to be some exceptions for the national interest.'' **********A senior official who asked not to be named but who played a central role in the opposition to purchase of Fairchild said, ''I think there's a strong sentiment here that some industries are not totally up for grabs.'' **********''Two of the most visible are semiconductor and computer companies,'' he said, but there are others as well, including those that use exclusive American technology in making weapons and special components and materials for weapons. Japanese Reiterate Pledge **********Japanese officials, stung by the collapse of the Fujitsu-Fairchild deal, reiterated that Japan was doing its best to enforce the much-debated semiconductor agreement between the two nations. The United States has threatened to scuttle the agreement unless Japan assures that companies are abiding by it.  [ Page D6. ]  In Washington, the Japanese Embassy's economic counselor, Yoshiji Nogami, said, ''We regret that there have been a number of unwarranted criticisms raised by some Administration officials.'' He said Japan favord the unimpeded flow of capital among nations. Administration officials, however, were quick to observe that Japan restricts foreign investment in its economy. **********Mr. Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger are expected to bring the takeover issue before a top-level, interagency policy-setting group, such as Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d's Economic Policy Council or the President's National Security Council. **********For the moment, however, the White House said the Administration's official noninterventionist policy remained the same. ''So far as I know, there has been no change in our position,'' said Albert R. Brashear, a spokesman for the President. Advocates of Free Market **********Until the Fairchild takeover was proposed last fall, the Administration had been an unequivocal proponent of foreign investment in the United States, a position consistent with the President's free-market views. Some senior officials, notably in the Treasury and the President's Council of Economic Advisers, still espouse those views. **********No laws prohibit foreign takeovers, and top Government officials had never discouraged one until now. But even without a Federal proscription against some takeovers, the Fujitsu-Fairchild episode shows that jawboning can have the same effect. **********The thwarted deal has a bargaining-ploy dimension: Officials of the Administration are irked by what it sees as Japanese violations of trade agreements, particularly in the area of computers and semiconductors. They could therefore be trying to force compliance by obstructing Japanese investment in American industry and real estate that has made the country one of the biggest foreign investors in the United States. Japanese Predominance Feared **********But beyond such trade matters is the Administration's discomfort over Japan's emerging power in computers, of which Fujitsu is an important producer, and in semiconductors that make all electronic equipment run, from computers and fighter planes to video recorders and digital watches. **********The Defense Department's concern, officials there say, is fear of the loss of an American-owned source of supply. The Commerce Department shares that concern and worries about losing an American position in a major world industry. **********Both are concerned because the semiconductor industry, in particular, has been battered by soft sales and Japanese competition.

The decision followed a week of negotiations aimed at resolving differences over the Government's finance bill. **********At issue was a revision of the bill that eliminated a proposed income tax cut to help lower the Government's deficit. The Liberals maintained that the coalition's basic agreement on policy envisioned deficit reduction through cutting spending rather than increasing revenues. **********The Government's proposal aimed at bringing the 1988 borrowing requirement to $84 billion, from an estimated $89 billion this year. Italy has the largest official budget deficit in proportion to the size of its economy of any major Western industrial nation. **********In addition to the Liberals, several of Italy's top bankers, leading businessmen and the major trade union federations had all found fault with the limited budget reduction program proposed by Mr. Goria, who was Italy's youngest Prime Minister when he took office July 28 at the age of 44. **********Cesare Romiti, managing director of the Fiat company, said this week that the finance proposal was ''absolutely inadequate.''

Iran has failed to embrace the resolution. **********Syria's Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, arrived in the Saudi capital just before the meeting opened at Riyadh's ornate domed Conference Hall. His country is Iran's main ally among the Arab countries, and the gulf council countries have been pressing Syria to mediate with Teheran for an end to the war. Diplomatic Offensive Sought **********Knowledgeable officials said Saudi Arabia and Kuwait would press the council members for a diplomatic offensive to persuade world powers to support an arms embargo against Iran. They said the United Arab Emirates and Oman preferred to start a dialogue with the Iranian Government. **********Before the Saudi king spoke, other leaders of the council, a group based on a 6-year-old economic integration and defense pact, stressed the need for their combined action to ward off the perils of the war. **********The President of the United Arab Emirates, Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, said the meeting was being held ''under extremely sensitive and difficult circumstances, necessitating prompt action to confront the challenges that have adversely affected our region.'' **********The Emir of Bahrain, Sheik Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, also spoke of ''enormous challenges'' besetting the Arabs of the gulf region and called for deliberations among gulf allies to face ''these regional and international menaces.'' Half the World's Oil **********Others attending the summit meeting, the council's eighth, included Sultan Qaboos of Oman, and Sheiks Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah of Kuwait and Khalifa bin Hamad al-Thani of Qatar. **********The gulf council nations account for about 50 percent of the world's proven oil reserves. They profess neutrality in the Iran-Iraq war, but Iran accuses them of a bias toward Iraq, singling out Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for purportedly pouring more than $38 billion into Iraqi coffers since 1980. **********The summit is under the shadow of the worst phase of the so-called tanker war in the gulf. At least 26 ships have been raided by Iran or Iraq this month. **********The leadership in Teheran has warned the gulf Arab powers that the region's shipping routes will be insecure unless they can persuade the Iraqis to cease air strikes on Iranian shipping. U.S. Strengthens Presence **********The United States and five Western allies, along with the Soviet Union, have strengthened their naval presence in the region since the summer. **********Kuwait has registered 11 tankers in the United States to gain U.S. warship protection against Iranian attacks. **********The Emirates President, Sheik Zayed, told Saudi reporters that an end to the gulf war could be reached by dialogue. **********He repeated his call for a peace mission by three neutral Arab leaders ''to underwrite the rights of Iran and Iraq.'' **********''If the two sides accept this, then we can demand a cease-fire and a withdrawal of troops back to their barracks. Afterward, arbitrators acceptable to all would begin to define the rights and dues of each side.

Thousands of such volunteers have come here to work on a variety of projects, partly as a way to show their repudiation of United States support for the rebels, who are known as contras. Rebels Awaiting Details **********In a telephone interview from Miami, Marta Sacasa, a spokeswoman for the main contra force, said she had not yet received details of the incident in which Mr. Linder was killed. ''Obviously, the project he was working on was protected by militia or by the Sandinista Army, and we have said in the past that we consider any armed group to be a target,'' she said. **********In Honduras, Mrs. Sacasa's organization, the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, issued a statement saying Mr. Linder had been killed in ''a firefight between one of our patrols and a group of militia of the Sandinista army.' **********The Nicaraguan Democratic Force, the statement said, ''holds the Marxist Leninist regime of Nicaragua responsible for the death of the U.S. citizen by allowing him to enter an area of civil war in our country.'' **********Before dawn today Mr. Linder's body was taken to the city of Matagalpa from the remote part of Jinotega province where he was killed. It was to remain there until the arrival of his parents, who were expected in Managua on Thursday. **********Friends said Mr. Linder had expressed the desire to be buried in Nicaragua if he were to die here. **********More than 100 Americans and other foreigners marched in front of the United States Embassy in Managua today, chanting slogans and carrying signs that read, ''Stop the Spilling of Innocent Blood'' and ''Help Peace Come to Nicaragua.'' **********Six of the protesters were admitted to the embassy and met with Ambassador Harry Bergold for about 40 minutes. ''It went cordially,'' said Laura Enriquez, one of the Americans who took part in the meeting. ''He said it was a tragedy, that he regretted it had happened, and that he was sorry he had to receive us under these circumstances.'' U.S. Is Held Responsible **********Speakers at the demonstration said the United States was responsible for Mr. Linder's death because American funds support the contras. **********Mr. Linder was a mechanical engineer who had been living in the village of El Cua, 30 miles from the Honduran border, while directing a series of rural developmental projects. For five years, rebel activity in the area has been almost constant. **********Three days before the ambush in which Mr. Linder was killed, a group of contras attacked a government dairy project nearby, killing two people. **********Several land mines have exploded under vehicles passing through the area, including one on July 3 that took 34 lives. According to diplomats, the mines were planted by contra squads. **********''If you want to pick the most dangerous area in Nicaragua for Americans to be running around, that would be in for a good candidate,'' said Alfred Laun, a spokesman for the American Embassy here. **********It was unclear whether Mr. Linder or his co-workers had been armed. In an interview in El Cua last year, Mr. Linder said he sometimes carried a weapon or was accompanied by someone who did. **********In several conversations, Mr. Linder said he understood the risks he ran by remaining so long in such an area. He said he believed his training was better used in an isolated and impoverished place like northern Nicaragua than in the United States. **********Mr. Linder lived in a shack on the outskirts of El Cua, which has a population of about 3,000. With his reddish beard and jeans caked with mud, he appeared quite popular in the town. Residents recognized him as the person mainly responsible for the construction of a 100-kilowatt hydroelectric plant that opened in El Cua last May, bringing electric power to the town for the first time. **********''The last time I talked to him, he was talking about starting a forestry project, and he wanted me to come up and work with him,'' said Howard Hiner, an American who lived in Nicaragua. ''He was always coming up with something.'' **********Although there are no official figures for the number of Americans in Nicaragua, officials today gave estimates ranging from 1,500 to 3,000. Dangerous Areas Out of Bounds **********Mr. Linder was the 10th foreign-born civilian to die in the Nicaraguan conflict, according to Government figures. In October, the Government imposed new restrictions intended to keep foreign volunteers out of dangerous areas. But those restrictions applied only to projects officially sponsored by foreign governments, and were not enforced in the cases of individual volunteers like Mr. Linder. **********One of Mr. Linder's American co-workers, Mira Brown of Boston, said today that at the moment of his death, Mr. Linder and his crew were measuring the water flow of a stream to see if it could be harnessed to provide power for the village of San Jose de Bocay."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/16/business/boesky-use-of-futures-is-cited.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1987-07-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 557, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Boesky Use Of Futures Is Cited", "print_headline": "Boesky Use Of Futures Is Cited", "body_text": " **********Large positions in stock index futures accumulated by Ivan F. Boesky before the announcement in November of his $100 million insider-trading settlement appear to have been used by Mr. Boesky to offset, or hedge against, possible losses on a giant stock portfolio he controlled, according to officials of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. **********''There is no indication that Boesky was attempting to wildly profit from trading in stock index futures,'' William E. Seale, a member of the commission, told the Senate Agriculture Committee today. ''It would seem that he had some kind of portfolio he wanted to hedge.'' **********Mr. Seale said he doubted that Mr. Boesky had tried to profit from the drop in the stock market that was widely predicted after the announcement of his settlement on Nov. 14, even though Mr. Boesky had a substantial short position in stock index futures. **********''In that case, the rational thing would have been to liquidate all of his positions'' on the Monday following the announcement, which came on a Friday, Mr. Seale said. But in the days after the announcement, Mr. Boesky liquidated only about one-third of his short positions in the indexes. Trading in Index Futures **********According to data submitted by the commission to the Senate committee, which has jurisdiction over all commodity futures trading, Mr. Boesky actively traded in futures contracts on both the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the New York Stock Exchange composite index from at least May 1986 up to and after the announcement of his settlement. **********The documentation indicated that Mr. Boeksy both made profits and suffered losses from his futures positions. For example, on Sept. 11 and Sept. 12, when the stock market plunged a total of 120 points, Mr. Boeksy had a large short position in the S.&.P. 500 stock index future, which would have risen in value. On the other hand, from Sept. 12 through Nov. 14, Mr. Boesky held a large short position on the New York Stock Exchange composite index and would probably have lost money. **********In both cases, however, when he made money on the short positions, he would have lost money in his stock portfolio, and when he lost money in short positions, he would have made made money on his stocks. **********Investors use index futures as a way to bet on the future course of the stock market and to protect gains in stock they own. **********Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the committee, voiced concern that the Securities and Exchange Commission did not get in touch with the commodities commission until one hour before the Nov. 14 announcement and that the S.E.C. did not try to stop Mr. Boesky from trading in stock index futures. **********Gary G. Lynch, director of enforcement at the S.E.C., said the commission had been concerned about ''preserving the confidentiality'' of the Boesky investigation, adding that Mr. Boesky ''was a cooperating witness.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/04/business/trucker-turned-builder-arthur-e-imperatore-creating-shangri-la-on-the-hudson.html": {"writer_name": "N.

IMPERATORE; Creating Shangri-La On the Hudson", "body_text": " **********ARTHUR E. IMPERATORE, looking imperial, as he always does, nervously drummed his fingers on the table. Smoke seemed about to issue from his ears. He has a famous short fuse. He said stiffly, ''We've got a lot of money sitting around here. I hear the clock ticking.'' **********This meeting - being held at the Manhattan offices of the architectural firm of Schuman, Lichtenstein, Claman & Efron - had been called to discuss details of a crescent-shaped apartment building Mr. Imperatore intends to build on two miles of land he owns that winds through Weehawken and West New York on the New Jersey banks of the Hudson River. It would be the first stirrings of his ideal city, which he plans to call Port Imperial. **********He is basically a novice at real estate development. He has never built anything other than one housing project in Cliffside Park, N.J., and some truck terminals. Still, at 61, Mr. Imperatore sees no reason why an aging but active trucking magnate should not become a master builder. **********The meeting turned to windows. How many should open? How many shouldn't? Views diverged. At one point, Mr. Imperatore interrupted to say, ''You know, we better follow these things up or we're going to be out of time. We can't keep losing a week, a week, a week.'' **********Mr. Imperatore is worth perhaps $200 million. The money comes from his trucking company, the APA Transport Corporation, which hauls everything imaginable along the East Coast. In the mid-70's, Mr. Imperatore fell into doleful spirits. His mother died. One of his brothers was killed in a helicopter crash. His marriage disintegrated. He was creeping up on his 60's and felt it necessary to ponder succession. **********So he removed himself from active duties at his company. Needing a project to absorb him, he bought the big parcel of riverfront land in 1981, when wild dogs roamed on it. He got it cheap - $7.75 million - from the liquidators of the Penn Central holdings, and has already watched it multiply many times in value. Since he bought the parcel, he has been moving to create what he refers to as a Shangri-La with a glorious view of the Empire State Building. People who know him are not surprised. He has never thought small. **********The meeting sputtered along. Mr. Imperatore consulted his watch and announced that he had to get to New Jersey. ''If I said anything insulting,'' he remarked in leaving, ''I meant it.'' **********Buttoning his raincoat, Mr. Imperatore bustled downstairs, jumped into his Oldsmobile and and began careening at a blood-curdling speed through traffic. ''I drive like a truck driver,'' he said. ''I used to be a truck driver. You look for opportunity and move quickly. You have to make time to get productivity.'' **********Racing along, working the horn hard, he said, ''I have an esthetic eye that gives me insight and imposes a demand for high-quality esthetics and symmetry. My eye picks up asymmetry and rejects it. I'm a believer that people are affected by their environment much more than they are willing to admit consciously. I'm constantly fighting the battle of beauty and classicism and trying to compromise between what I feel people should require and have and the age of pragmatism. In my work, I'm always trying to think of how to make the world better - better human conduct, better civility, better efficiency, just a better civilization.'' **********He parked at a small pier on the Hudson River at 38th Street. This was where he had recently begun a ferry service to Weehawken - the first in 20 years - in order to carry commuters to his dream city. He boarded a motorboat, settled behind the wheel and plowed across the river to Arcorp Properties, his Weehawken real estate development company. **********''I'm 61,'' he said on the way over. ''I've worked for 50 or 51 years. I've always had an inner drive to accomplish and get things done with creativity, purpose and honesty, with a strong sense of personal discipline and control.'' **********Mr. Imperatore has a tall, lithe figure, sparse gray hair and a bulbous nose. He often wears a sort of tired, sad look. His voice, which he uses often, is like creaky hinges and his speech is generously laced with swearwords. He treats people well, providing they work harder than they ever thought they could. **********''I have great respect for people,'' he said. ''And I demand respect - because I earned it.'' **********His city, he explained, will be in the ''Greco-Roman tradition.'' It will contain 12,500 housing units, 10 million square feet of office space, a hotel and a cultural center. The cost may reach $6 billion. Construction is expected to span two decades. Mr. Imperatore hopes he'll see it all. **********In doing his planning, Mr. Imperatore dropped in on more than 50 cities to borrow ideas. Slices of Venice, Copenhagen and Paris will reappear on the New Jersey waterfront: a town square reminiscent of Venice's Piazza San Marco, an 800-foot observation tower derived from a Leonardo da Vinci sketch, a boulevard that some refer to as the ''Champs Elysees of Weehawken,'' an entertainment center mimicking Copenhagen's Tivoli Gardens. **********Ask him who will live in the city, and Mr. Imperatore responds firmly: ''The world.'' **********The world must wait, however. Ground-breaking for the first apartment building is not scheduled until September, and Mr. Imperatore faces rabid competition along the waterfront. **********''Even if his proposal can succeed on its own, 10 or 15 years down the line it's going to have to withstand competition from all the other developments on the West Bank of the Hudson River,'' said Martin Bierbaum, assistant professor in the graduate public administration program at Rutgers University. ''That area could turn out to be a total disaster.'' **********''I think that Arthur Imperatore, while he's a wonderful guy, is really a novice at real estate,'' said Joe Barry, a developer in Hoboken. ''What he's proposing is on such a massive scale that he's not going to have much learning time. You have to do more than throw a lot of money at a project.'' **********Donald Trump, in a recent television interview, succinctly summed up Mr. Imperatore's chunk of land as ''garbage.'' **********Mr. Imperatore huffs that anyone who doubts him doesn't know him. He says that he will soon be announcing a joint venture on his property with a large, seasoned developer that will silence a lot of naysayers. **********Arthur Imperatore wasn't always special. That didn't start, he says, until he was at least 2. When he was 10 he decided to become a millionaire. **********That was quite a dream for someone who was one of 10 children of an Italian immigrant who ran a grocery store. There was no money in the Imperatore house. The 10 children shared two drab bedrooms. Meals were taken at an ironing board that teetered across two chairs. (Still, there was a regal tradition: In Latin, the family name means emperor.) This was happening in West New York, where Mr. Imperatore was born on July 8, 1925. At 7, Mr. Imperatore helped his family with deliveries. He mopped floors at a candy store. He was a Western Union messenger. He was a Fuller Brush man. He had a bank account when he was 9. He never went to college. **********''My interest as a kid was in doing something, making money and putting my family on the map,'' he said. **********Trucks gave him the opportunity. In 1947, along with four of his brothers, he established the rudiments of APA Transport with two Army surplus trucks operating out of the Imperatore house. Under Mr. Imperatore's tight-fisted rule, the company flourished as one of the industry's most profitable truckers. The New York-New Jersey area is one of the most miserable in the country for labor-management squabbling (his drivers belong to the teamsters union). Yet APA became legendary for stellar management and profitability. In 1985, he says, the company earned $8.4 million on revenues of $98.7 million. **********APA's stringent hiring policies are perhaps the key to its success. Want to drive an APA truck? You must withstand endless interviews, a drug test, a polygraph test in states that allow it and a week's orientation at no pay. To weed out crooks among new applicants, APA subscribes to 45 daily newspapers, and four people work full-time clipping out stories about arrests. From these, a master roster of dubious names is compiled, which right now lists more than 1.6 million people. **********Mr. Imperatore remains APA's chairman, but the place is run on a daily basis by its president, Armand Pohan, who is Mr. Imperatore's stepson. Earlier last year, in order to grow, the company bought Sanborn's Motor Express, a Maine trucker. There have been problems melding the two together, since a lot of Sanborn drivers who are not up to APA's standards have left or been let go. **********One of the most remarkable things about APA is its reputation for being ''clean'' in an industry that is often dirty. **********''We don't stand for corruption of any people for any reason,'' Mr. Imperatore said. ''I.B.M., Ross Perot -we didn't copy any of those guys in how to be honest. We invented this stuff down here in the swamps. The Japanese didn't teach me anything. We grew up in the worst kind of crud. The teamster influence? Some of those guys are in prison right now. They tried to strong-arm us. But they didn't. We never bought peace.'' **********In fact, even the Teamsters seem to approve of Arthur Imperatore. ''He's fair, he's just, he's tough,'' says Walter Shea, an international vice president with the union, who has known Mr. Imperatore for many years. ''We rarely have a grievance with him. If everyone was like Arthur, we probably wouldn't have unions.'' **********Mr. Imperatore is tougher than nails. But he's also generous to his people. In 1973, for instance, he opened a $1 million recreation center for workers and their families at the APA main terminal in North Bergen. The basketball court is so good that the New Jersey Nets practice on it. **********Mr. Imperatore treats himself well, too. His immense office at APA is a splendid replica of the drawing room of a 17th-century Venetian prince. ''Nice office, huh?'' he likes to say to visitors. ''I deserve it.'' **********Until recently, he lived in a mansion perched on a bluff in Fort Lee, N.J., though now he rents an apartment in Manhattan while quarters are being prepared for him in the Arcorp Properties headquarters. He's still separated from his wife and lives alone; he has a son and daughter, who are both in graduate school. He owns a 141-foot yacht, the Imperator, which contains artwork by Boudin, Monet and Pissarro. He likes to float in the yacht down the Hudson, peering at his acreage and smiling contentedly to himself. **********Mr. Imperatore had to meet someone at the office of a marina that operates on his property. Walking in, he noticed the carpeting was soiled. He barked at the attendant: ''Why is this carpet dirty? That's grease.'' **********The phone trilled. The attendant picked it up. ''Listen to me,'' Mr. Imperatore snapped. ''Tell whoever it is you'll call back. I'm talking. Get someone to come and clean that.'' **********Tidiness is a fanaticism of Mr. Imperatore's. At any given time, his coat pockets are apt to be stuffed with sundry balled-up scraps of litter he has spied on the ground. ''You see how dirty the world is and then you come to my property and it's clean,'' he said. ''People enjoy working in a clean, neat environment. I think people deserve that.'' **********Still fuming about the greasy rug, Mr. Imperatore left the office. He noticed a crumpled Hershey bar wrapper on the ground, picked it up and stashed it in his pocket. **********''I want to show you something,'' Arthur Imperatore said, driving through the streets of North Bergen. He pulled up alongside a nondescript two-story house, swung out of the car and punched the bell. This was the house he was born in. Now he owns it. One of his brothers lives in it with his wife. **********His brother was out, but his wife answered in her bathrobe. **********''Oh, Arthur, why don't you give me warning?'' she said. **********''I didn't have warning,'' Mr. Imperatore said. **********The living room was small, plain, crowded. Mr. Imperatore paced about. ''This was where I started,'' he said. ''Ten kids in two rooms. It was a mess.'' **********''What my project is about,'' he continued, ''is I want to help the milieu in which I built my business. I made my fortune here and I believe in the community. I have an idea of perfecting a piece of the world.'' **********''Some coffee, Arthur?'' his sister-in-law interrupted. **********''No time,'' Mr. Imperatore said. ''Gotta go.'' On a gray, snowy day, Arthur Imperatore's car eased to a halt in front of APA headquarters. The letters in the company's name happen to stand for nothing, though employees quip that they are short for ''Always Please Arthur.'' As he threaded his way to his office, Mr. Imperatore called out effusive greetings to the drivers. Some of them he hugged. He asked after the health of relatives. **********As he mounted the stairs, his eyes were trained on the carpet. ''Look at this,'' he said to one of the vice presidents, and nabbed two pieces of litter. ''You guys let this place go to pot.'' Then he said, ''When I was building the company, I was introduced to a book called 'Acres of Diamonds.' It was about a man who had a great farm but he was restless and greedy and failed to work his farm. So he sold it and the man who bought it worked it and found on the farm the acres of diamonds. The moral is, if you work hard you find opportunities.' **********He plopped down in his office and stared into the distance. ''Men love to work,'' he said. ''They want leadership and to be taught their work, their craft, to make a better world, a small chunk of immortality by their work.'' **********''We bring out the heroism in people,'' he continued. ''I used to do it in a masterful way. I don't know if they're screwing it up now. I think they are, actually.'' **********After a while, he got into his car to circle the snowy yard. A rule is that drivers have 5 minutes to get their trucks on the road. Most made it. A few dawdled. **********Mr. Imperatore pulled up alongside a driver who was still getting his truck ready to roll. ''Get out of here,'' he told him. ''You can talk to the freight, but it won't walk.'' **********''I know, Arthur, I know,'' the driver said. **********''If I weren't in this car, you'd get a snowball,'' Mr. Imperatore said. ''Now get out of here.'' Mr. Imperatore headed for the exit to go to the waterfront. Suddenly, he braked, opened his door and leaned out. He snatched up a gum wrapper and put it in his pocket."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/03/world/german-blast-toll-rises-to-11.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-01-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 165, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "German Blast Toll Rises to 11", "print_headline": "German Blast Toll Rises to 11", "body_text": " **********The death toll from a gas explosion last weekend at a resort hotel in the Bavarian Alps rose today to 11.

Opposition leaders accuse Mr. Gandhi of ''selling out'' Haryana's economic interests to the Sikhs in the Punjab. **********The opposition candidate in Haryana, Devi Lal of the People's Party, has pledged to investigate corruption charges against leaders of Mr. Gandhi's Congress Party in his state if he is elected. Like many parties in India, the People's Party is organized less around an ideology than around the interests of a group, in this case Hindu peasants. 'An Even Battle' **********A senior aide to Mr. Gandhi acknowledged that Mr. Lal was staging ''a great assault on our bases'' and described the election as ''an even battle.'' But he added that he and other leaders were as worried about the possibility that dissidents within their own party would try to sabotage the Congress campaign as they were concerned by Mr. Lal's challenge. **********''The rebels are one of the biggest dangers that we face and they are defying us openly,'' said the Gandhi aide, who is a senior Cabinet minister in New Delhi. He said the national Environment Minister, Bhajan Lal, was upset because Mr. Gandhi had ignored a demand that his followers be given more electoral races to contest in the 90-seat state legislature. Mr. Lal, no relation to the opposition leader, was Chief Minister of Haryana until last year. **********The Congress Party has announced that it is expelling 29 rebels from the organization for running against its official candidates, and it has threatened to oust more. Shrinking Base **********Mr. Gandhi is said to be concerned about the Congress Party's shrinking base. Eight of the country's 22 states are controlled by opposition groups, including the entire south and much of the east. A Congress Party defeat in Haryana would bring Mr. Gandhi's foes to power at New Delhi's doorstep and would make a major inroad into an area considered the Hindi-speaking heartland of central and northern India, which the Congress Party has controlled for decades. **********Most of India's 780 million people live in this belt, and it has been the traditional foundation of national political power. A setback in Haryana would raise questions about how effectively the Prime Minister can govern during the rest of his five-year term, which is half over. **********But Mr. Gandhi's aides insist that the Government will serve its full term, and they point out that the Prime Minister still controls 402 of 542 members in the national Parliament, despite some disaffection within the ranks, Relations With Sikhs at Stake A victory for Mr. Lal of the People's Party would also mean that prospects for an accord with Punjab's Sikhs, already severely set back by the dismissal last month of a moderate Sikh government there, would become even more distant. Mr. Lal said today that a 1985 accord between Mr. Gandhi and the moderate Sikhs was ''as good as dead'' and that he would not compromise on Haryana's demands for more irrigation water, more territory from the Punjab and a new capital. **********Today, a crowd of perhaps 5,000 waited patiently in this farming village in the shade of a large tent, or outside under a blistering sun, for two hours to listen to Mr. Lal. Mandkaula is about 60 miles south of New Delhi. **********Mr. Lal, who is 73 years old and towers over his followers at 6 feet 3 inches, was received here by village leaders with garlands of marigolds and was presented with a turban and a bundle of crisp rupee notes. **********His audience responded gleefully to mild abuse of Mr. Gandhi and sharper criticism of local Congress Party leaders, whom Mr. Lal likened to ''thieves and crooks.'' **********But the crowd reserved its strongest support for Mr. Lal's declaration that he would write off all loans to farmers if he became Haryana's chief minister, its top elected official. **********''If the central Government can forgive capitalists who apologize for tax fraud worth billions of rupees, if it can permit crooks to smuggle out billions of rupees and stash the money into Swiss banks, then I can, with a stroke, free my fellow farmers of all outstanding loans,'' he announced. The audience cheered and applauded noisily. **********The reference to the Swiss banks was to an International Monetary Fund report that said that Indians held more than $1 billion in secret Swiss bank accounts. The Indian Government also has a policy of dropping cases against industrialists who apologize for past tax fraud and pledge good conduct in the future."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/31/business/patents-gauging-reactor-coolant.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy JONES", "pub_date": "1987-01-31", "snippet": "LEAD: A GAUGE that monitors the level of coolant in nuclear power reactors was patented this week by five inventors in the Pennsylvania State University's nuclear engineering department.

Congress does set public policy, and that policy is often carried out through various regulatory bodies, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. In the area of financial institutions, the basic Congressional policy, and that of the Comptroller's Office, is to promote the safety of the financial system for the public benefit. **********Where Mr. O'Connell's perception is distorted, however, is his focus on the role of the F.A.S.B. in public policy.

But this year's late Easter won't be enough to get overall consumer spending to bloom. **********While Americans may be interested in buying bonnets, baseballs and bedspreads, they are not purchasing big-ticket items like cars or houses anywhere near the rate of a year ago, says Burton Zwick, senior economist at Kidder, Peabody & Company. This spring, overall spending by debt-burdened consumers has slipped to a 2 percent real annual rate of growth, down from 4 percent in 1986. ''If this level is maintained, it will be the slowest year for spending since this recovery began in 1983,'' he said. **********This is not necessarily bad news, says Mr. Zwick. Among other things, lower spending means less demand for imported goods - and that helps to narrow the nation's trade gap. In fact, he said, getting trade back in balance may mean that ''spending growth may have to slow to 1 percent beyond 1987.'' Utilities: On the Prowl **********Electric utilities have been borrowing less and less to build new plants. Next year they will internally generate 84 percent of their new-construction costs - up from 30 percent in 1980, says Mark D. Luftig, a vice president at Salomon Brothers. **********There are a number of reasons that utilities have the cash to carry out construction under their own steam. Power companies benefit from the lower corporate tax rates in the new tax law. **********And some of their construction projects are exempt from provisions in the new law that repeal the investment tax credit as of January 1986. **********What's more, with 35 percent overcapacity in their industry, they are not building much. ''The only projects are nuclear plants that are not yet finished,'' said Mr. Luftig. **********Until they need to build more capacity - in the early 1990's - power companies are on the prowl for other investments, including acquisitions, Mr. Luftig says. Those that have the go-ahead from their public service commissions have already bought banks, cable television businesses and insurance companies. **********But utilities won't invest in buybacks of their own stock, as they have in the past. The reason: Shares are too expensive. According to Mr. Luftig, utility stocks are selling at 140 percent of book value in this raging bull market. Professional Power **********While labor unions will continue to face tough times, professional associations of white-collar workers could gain considerable clout. **********Given the recent problems in downsizing and other kinds of corporate restructuring, ''activist professional associations could grow in both membership and influence,'' said Richard Belous, a labor economist at the Conference Board. **********Most professional groups cannot yet match the power of the American Bar Association or the National Education Association, says Mr. Belous. But as they grow, white-collar organizations - representing engineers, computer technicians, even economists -will be more aggressive with Congress and corporations. The trend has reached even the smallest groups. The American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists, for example, is rallying its 8,000 members around the issue of foreign competition. **********All this means increasing competition for unions that also represent professionals. ''If professional organizations thrive, said Mr. Belous. ''it's going to be a lot harder for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to recruit.'' Fashionable Fingernails **********Fashion's current emphasis on femininity is reaching all the way to the fingertips, says David A. Weiss, president of Packaged Facts, a retail research firm. And sales of nail-care products point up the trend. Mr. Weiss expects sales of nail polish, removers, dips, creams, hardeners and decorative decals - to top $1 billion next year, up from $875 million in 1986. ''Apparently, once consumers start purchasing one type of nail-care product, they expand their purchasing to other types,'' he said. **********The key to this industry's growth, says Mr. Weiss, is a change in consumers' attitudes. ''In the 1970's, the effect of feminism and the new role of women in the workplace deemphasized the use of cosmetics,'' he said. But these days, he said, ''Once a woman has proven she is an iron-fisted executive, it doesn't matter if the iron fist has frosty pink nails.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/30/business/company-news-times-mirror-plant.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Times Mirror Plant", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Times Mirror Plant", "body_text": " **********The Times Mirror Corporation said its board had approved a $385 million investment in a new production plant and other facilities for its flagship newspaper, The Los Angeles Times.

Congress granted limited immunity to several witnesses to compel their testimony. **********Under immunity rules, Mr. Walsh cannot bring criminal charges against such witnesses based on information obtained from their Congressional testimony. **********According to law-enforcement officials, Mr. Walsh and his staff are puzzled by strategic errors made by Mr. Meese and his investigators that permitted White House officials, including Colonel North, to destroy critical documents about the Iran arms sale. Report to Congress Awaited **********Mr. Walsh's intentions are not entirely clear, although one official with knowledge of his inquiry said the special prosecutor would seek to determine whether Justice Department officials aided the White House in a criminal cover-up of the Iran-contra affair. **********Aside from looking for criminal violations, Mr. Walsh is known to be gathering Government documents and conducting witness interviews for use in a detailed report to Congress on the Iran-contra affair. **********Recent testimony before Congress has raised questions about whether Mr. Meese had advance knowledge that the Director of Central Intelligence, William J. Casey, was preparing to deliver false testimony to Congress last November about the Iran arms sales. The Attorney General has denied it. According to one official, Mr. Walsh asked in his document request for any material that made reference to Mr. Casey's testimony and any Justice Department involvement in its preparation. **********In a letter outlining the document request, officials said, Mr. Walsh asked the department to turn over documents related to the Iran-contra affair that were dated from October through December of last year. **********''It's everything from that time period,'' said a Federal law-enforcement official. 'Nothing to Hide' **********He said Justice Department prosecutors were ''uncomfortable'' with the scope of the document request because ''it makes it look like the department has some sort of smoking gun in the files when, I assure you, there isn't one.'' **********Another official said he believed that Justice Department prosecutors were ''unconcerned'' by Mr. Walsh's request. ''There's absolutely nothing to hide,'' he said. **********During an investigation late last November, Mr. Meese and a small team of his close aides turned up evidence that profits from the Iran arms sales were diverted to Nicaraguan rebel groups. A Three-Day Delay **********After discovering a National Security Council memorandum outlining the diversion plan, Mr. Meese waited three days before obtaining White House files and seeking the help of experienced criminal prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. **********The delay permitted Colonel North and others to destroy documents related to the Iran arms sale. The colonel has testified that he was shredding documents even while Mr. Meese's investigators were going through files in a nearby room in the White House. **********Admiral Poindexter, the former national security adviser, told Congress in recent days that he destroyed a Presidential decision memorandum on the arms sale within hours of learning that Mr. Meese had begun an investigation.

Regan, the former White House chief of staff, begins testifying before the Iran-contra committee on Thursday, committee members hope he will be able to explain how a ''battle royal'' erupted in the White House over the sale of arms to Iran. **********Until he resigned early this year, Mr. Regan was one of the President's closest aides, and his testimony could be important because he may be able to explain how Administration officials came to lie to and deceive each other over important aspects of the Iran arms sales. **********Both George P. Shultz, the Secretary of State, and Edwin Meese 3d, the Attorney General, have acknowledged in their testimony that other officials misled them. No New Disclosures Expected **********But beyond the glimpses of the inner workings at the White House he can offer, associates of Mr. Regan and commitee staff officials say that they do not expect him to offer much in the way of new disclosures. Like the President, he has denied knowledge of the diversion of profits from the arms sale to the contras. Most of what he has already told Congressional investigators in private about the Iran initative has already been made public. **********''I see him mainly tying down the facts,'' said one associate of Mr. Regan. ''There's not much new in that.'' **********An Iran-contra committee official said: ''How many times can you ask one guy and have him say, 'I don't know; I wasn't told'?'' **********Mr. Regan was one of the most powerful men in the White House through most of the period the Iran initiative was conducted. But in the weeks of the televised hearings, he has been the odd-man-out, seldom mentioned by the others who have testified. Questions to Be Raised **********Still Mr. Shultz's testimony about a a ''battle royal'' within the Administration over control of foreign policy makes Mr. Regan's account especially important. **********Among the questions Mr. Regan is expected to be asked are these: *********** Why did he he fail to tell the Secretary of State of a retroactive Presidential finding, signed in December 1985, allowing the arms shipment to Iran? *********** Why did he shift from opposing the arms sales in December 1985 to supporting the policy a month later, according to Mr. Shultz's testimony? *********** Did he lead White House attempts to effectively punish Mr. Shultz for not supporting the arms sale? The Secretary testified about what he believed was retaliation against him when he had difficulty gaining access to Government planes and meetings with the President. *********** What was he told about efforts in May 1986 to establish a channel for providing arms to Iran by using arms merchants, Adnan M. Khashoggi and Manucher Ghorbanifar? Mr. Shultz said he raised questions about such an arrangement and said Mr. Regan told him he would take the matter up with the President. *********** Why he was unable to persuade the President to turn over the Iran initative to Mr. Shultz in November? Mr. Shultz testified that he wrote a note to the chief of staff with that request, only to be told by Mr. Regan that ''I can't make it.'' Regan Denies Coverup **********Associates of Mr. Regan believe the most combative line of questioning could center on how he managed the White House, particularly in the critical period when the arms sales to Iran were disclosed last November. The committees have been trying to determine whether a coverup was attempted. The former chief of staff has adamantly insisted that there was no such attempt. **********But in a sharp rebuke, a Presidential commission that reviewed the Iran initative in February said that Mr. Regan shared the ''primary responsibility for the chaos'' that descended on the White House when the policy initiative was first disclosed. Mr. Reagan disagreed with that. **********The panel, headed by former Senator John G. Tower, also said Mr. Regan was partly to blame for the failure of the National Security Council staff to follow ''an orderly process'' that would have provided more internal scrutiny of its activities. **********Aides to Mr. Regan say that the testimony by Mr. Shultz, Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter, Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North and others validates the chief of staff's key response to the Tower Commission: That the staff of the National Security Council operated as a separate entity that kept him in the dark, much as it did Mr. Shultz. Access to the President **********The Tower Commission's assessment was based on the fact that Mr. Regan enjoyed access to meetings by senior officials in which the initative was discussed and that he also attended daily briefings for the President by Admiral Poindexter and his predecesor, Robert C. McFarlane. **********This picture of an involved Mr. Regan is reflected in a computer note, dated Feb. 27, 1986, from Mr. McFarlane to Colonel North released by the committee.

Profitability Is Uncertain **********The investments are not without risk, or critics. The projects are still young and their profitability not certain. And some experts think the governmental entrepreneurship could lead to charges of antitrust violations and conflicts of interest. But others argue that, for most municipalities, the total amount of dollars involved is small and that public scrutiny of government actions should help keep any project in line. **********Most experts agree that entrepreneurial government has its roots in the taxpayer revolts of the late 1970's, when voters approved Proposition 13 in California, Proposition 2 1/2 in Massachusetts and similar measures elsewhere. These initiatives put limits on property tax increases, reducing revenues for local governments. Those governments, in turn, developed innovative approaches to doing business. **********''It's taken 10 years, but the fruits of Proposition 13 are just being harvested,'' said James B. Hudak, a partner in the San Francisco office of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen & Company. **********''For the first couple of years the state bailed out cities and counties,'' Mr. Hudak added. ''Then cities implemented salary freezes, sold surplus land, employed creative accounting. But now they've run out of things to do and are forced to look at more creative alternatives.'' **********Fairfield, a city of about 73,000 that is halfway between San Francisco and Sacramento, was one of the first and most aggressive practitioners of government entrepreneurship. A Quick Profit on Land **********When Gale Wilson, the city manager, was approached by Ernest W. Hahn Inc. in 1976 for permission to build a small shopping center, he proposed a large regional mall. The city purchased the land for $1.25 a square foot and sold it to Hahn for $2.25 - a quick $1 million profit. In return, the city expedited zoning variances and building permits. **********Fairfield negotiated the deal to get increased revenue in property and sales taxes. But after Proposition 13 was passed in 1978, the city worked out a new deal with Hahn to compensate for the revenue cut. Under that arrangement, Fairfield will receive in perpetuity 10 percent to 17 percent of net cash flow after expenses from the merchants in the one-million-square-foot mall. Despite initial reservations, the company says it has had no problem with the arrangement and has made similar deals since then. **********Fairfield sold Hahn only half of the land it bought, and Mr. Wilson expects to realize far greater profits from the 66 acres surrounding the mall. The first tenant of a new development there, a Toys ''R'' Us store, has agreed to give the city 50 percent of its net cash flow in return for the right to locate on that land. **********Mr. Wilson's staff is taking a similarly aggressive posture in acquiring land and negotiating leases for an automobile dealership center. When the United States Postal Service turned down the city for a new post office, Fairfield built one anyway, and now leases it to the Postal Service. **********''I tell developers, 'You have to do things our way,' '' Mr. Wilson said. '' 'Yes, we'll make you pay, but you will make money.' '' Motivations Other Than Revenue **********Mr. Wilson said his efforts had been aided by Fairfield's size, location and rapid growth. But similar projects are under way across the United States, and the motivation often goes beyond generating revenue. **********In Cincinnati, the city will get 17 percent of the profit from a project that includes a Westin hotel and a new home office of the First National Bank of Cincinnati. **********The main objective of the deal, in which the city assembled the land and handled the financing, was to rebuild a blighted area and get a luxury hotel in the city's center. But sharing in the profit ''helps keep up with inflation and helps to sell a project to the public and the city council,'' said Nell Surber, director of redevelopment in Cincinnati. **********San Antonio is a partner in a Sheraton hotel with the Encore Company of Dallas and China's national bank, which was approached when American banks showed no interest in the project. The city's principal goal was to get more hotel rooms to make the city more attractive for conventions, but this and other investments are expected to provide it with an additional $5 million a year in revenue. ''The city is now taking a position that we have something of value, and we want something in return,'' said Louis J. Fox, San Antonio's city manager. Alarm Systems for Sale **********In Pasadena, Calif., the city plans to market telecommunications and office alarm systems. Judith Weiss, the assistant city manager, said the communications systems were expected to ''make offices in Pasadena more competitive,'' while the city hoped the alarm systems would lower the cost of providing police and fire protection. **********If some deals appear to open the door to cronyism, kickbacks and unfair competition, proponents of entrepreneurial government say the mere appearance of corruption has tended to have such a chilling effect on development that cities have gone out of their way to avoid it. **********''Cities doing this successfully are finding that they have to be cleaner than Caesar's wife,'' said John J. Kirlin, a professor of public policy at the University of Southern California's Sacramento Public Affairs Center. **********Some experts fear that not all local governments have the savvy to handle such deals. ''Some will be mesmerized by the talk of easy cash flow and will do something they'll later regret,'' said David E. Dowall, associate director of the Institute of Urban and Regional Development at the University of California at Berkeley. ''Some very sweet deals have been negotiated for the private sector.'' **********Critics of governmental entrepreneurship also question whether the supposed safeguards of public accountability are really effective. In Fairfield, some residents said they thought Mr. Wilson had too much power, and they contended that the city staff had been too secretive and too concerned with making deals. A Conflict Is Seen **********Indeed, many cities find an inherent conflict between the privacy that fosters good deal-making and the desire for an open local government. **********''In some ways there is a lot to be said for working out these deals efficiently; in principle, that makes a great deal of sense,'' said Michael Wheeler, director of education at the Center for Real Estate Development at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''The difficulty is: How can you have that kind of flexibility and still be consistent so that people are treated fairly?'' **********Professor Wheeler also noted the potential for antitrust problems. In a hypothetical situation where a city would give approval to a shopping mall in which it held an equity stake and then reject other malls, he said that ''city power would have been used to create a monopoly.'' **********A 1984 Federal law exempts local governments from damages in antitrust actions, but plaintiffs could seek an injunction to block a project. Development Entities Set Up **********Cities are circumventing conflicts by establishing separate entities that are treated like any developer. **********The largest of these, the New York City Public Development Corporation, was formed in 1966 and has grown rapidly since 1980. It has more than 100 projects under way with a total value of close to $13 billion. These include the $130 million Morgan Stanley office building in Brooklyn in which the city has invested $12 million. It will receive 25 percent of the net cash flow. **********The Public Development Corporation has been accused of being power-hungry and ramming its projects through the regulatory red tape. However, its president, James P. Stuckey, said the corporation faces the same review as any developer. **********The corporation has a staff of 160, including lawyers, planners and engineers - an advantage that few purely private developers possess. Rather than compete with local developers, Mr. Stuckey said, his organization helps them by offering low-interest loans for projects that banks would not finance. Major Players Are Cities **********While cities remain the major players in entrepreneurial government, states, counties and even transit districts are realizing they can combine their regulatory powers and real estate to generate income. **********Los Angeles County recently granted a 66-year lease for a 26-acre parcel to be called the Long Beach/ Signal Hill Business Center. A development of Goldrich, Kest & Appel, the project is expected to bring the county $1.3 billion in revenue over the life of the lease, on property currently valued at about $11.8 million. **********In Washington, the Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has developed seven revenue-producing sites above or around station entrances. These included office buildings, retail facilities and parking structures. **********Experts say that given the revenue pressures some governments face, participation in private enterprise is likely to increase, even without further limitations on taxation. **********In most cases, the governments involved are passive stakeholders, taking a share of profits but having little role in the properties' management. **********One contrary example shows the pitfalls a city can face in trying to run a business. St. Petersburg, Fla., bought a motel for $2 million and operated it from 1978 to 1985, never earning more than $100,000 in a year. **********But the meager profits were not the only problem. When local citizens arranged for guests to stay at the motel, ''if they didn't like the color of the sheets or had a problem with a waitress, they would complain to the city council and the council would complain to us,'' said Robert Obering, the city manager. ''For all the agony we went through, it just wasn't worth it.'' **********Projects in other cities have been stalled in the planning stages by jurisdictional battles, miscalculations and inadequate resources. But the advocates of entrepreneurial government say such risks are inevitable and surmountable. **********''Entrepreneurial management says you can get into and out of any business,'' said Ted Gaebler, former city manager of Visalia, Calif., which owned and operated a minor-league baseball team for several years. **********Mr. Gaebler, now a consultant to cities and counties, said the task that remained was to re-educate the public about the role of government. ''Private companies going through a restructuring don't hesitate to educate the public about what the new nature of their business is,'' he said. ''The American public is very receptive if someone takes the time to explain changes.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/27/business/dingell-bill-would-curb-hostile-takeover-moves.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1987-04-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 442, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dingell Bill Would Curb Hostile Takeover Moves", "print_headline": "Dingell Bill Would Curb Hostile Takeover Moves", "body_text": " **********Representative John D.

Woodworth, also a Bankers Trust vice president and economist, who recently returned from a trip to Japan. For the dollar, that would be a steep drop from yesterday, when there were 135.10 yen to the dollar. Further, the Japanese companies that Mr. Woodworth visited expect the dollar to fall even further in 1989, to 100 yen to the dollar. **********The bank's own economic model projects a drop in the dollar to 115 yen by the fourth quarter of 1988. The model also predicts a sharp dollar decline against the West German mark, to 1.50 marks to the dollar. Yesterday there were 1.6760 marks to the dollar. Fluctuations in Value **********On a day-to-day basis, currency dealers say, the dollar might turn, perhaps sharply, either up or down because of short-term events. **********For instance, the dollar might shoot up for a day, or even just for minutes, because of an off-the-cuff remark by President Reagan, as it did Tuesday when Mr. Reagan, in response to a question, said he thought the dollar had fallen far enough. **********In doing their job, foreign-exchange traders tend to think less about economic issues in terms of years and more about outguessing their competitors in terms of minutes. **********''No one believed the President, but what else is he going to say when asked about the dollar?'' said a leading New York trader who asked not to be identified. Despite his skepticism about Mr. Reagan's comments, the trader bought dollars as soon as he learned what the President had said. The trader explained that he expected other traders to buy dollars on the news, driving up the currency's price, and he hoped to sell later in the day after the price had risen. **********Stephen Leach, a vice president and foreign-exchange expert at the Chemical Bank, said he thinks that despite Mr. Reagan's remarks the Administration wants a weaker dollar, making American products more competitive abroad. He thinks the Government's strategy is to encourage the dollar to go lower now so that when when the major nations try to stabilize currency relationships, the Americans would be in a better position to seek a lower-value dollar. Strategy Could Change **********But that strategy could change dramatically, Mr. Leach said, if the stock market started to decline because of fears about a weak dollar. **********The fight between the Administration and Congress over how to narrow the budget deficit has been feeding the market's perception of the United States as a spendthrift nation. **********''The deficit is truly where it starts,'' said Burt R. Clark, treasurer and executive vice president of the treasury group at the National Westminster Bank USA. ''What we have is the fear that the richest coutry in the world can't control expenditures. Americans will have to take a cut in their real standard of living.'' **********Mr. Clark said he expects the yen to strengthen to 133 to the dollar within the next week or two. But he said he could not say whether he thought the dollar would collapse completely. **********''If you sell the dollar, what will you buy?'' Mr. Clark asked. ''At some point the fall has to stop.'' But like other foreign-exchange dealers, Mr. Clark wants to see action. ''The more the Administration tries to jawbone the dollar up, the more the market will test the downside,'' he said. **********A trader for a large Swiss bank, asking not to be identified, agreed. ''The main reason the dollar can't go up is that the people in charge are only talking,'' he said. ''They don't do anything but talk. It's too late. People are too disappointed.'' Focus on Budget Talks **********This trader described the dollar's recent decline as a ''collapse'' and said he thought it would fall further. **********At Morgan Stanley & Company, J. David Germany, senior economist, said that ''there will be tremendous focus on the budget negotiations'' because a reduced deficit would lead to a sounder economy in the United States, making it easier to create a more stable relationship between the dollar and other currencies. **********But some economists blame the Europeans and the Japanese. **********''With the stock market crash worldwide, the expectation of inflation has been dramatically reduced,'' said Alan Reynolds, an economist at Polyconomics Inc. of Morristown, N.J.

This guest did not seem shy about appearing to upstage her hostess. **********While their husbands were smiling and already calling each other ''Ron'' and ''Mikhail,'' their strong-willed wives remained locked in a verbal tug-of-war that even official interpreters could do little to disguise. **********From the first stop on the White House tour, when Mrs. Reagan pointed out a rather ethereal portrait of Pat Nixon, Mrs. Gorbachev made it clear that she wanted to set the agenda. Changing the Subject **********Swinging away toward a portrait of Lady Bird Johnson, the former professor of Marxist-Leninist theory assumed a schoolteacher tone and asked: ''This picture that we face, to what century does it belong? I would say it's a typical picture of the 20th century.'' **********Undaunted, Mrs. Reagan explained that the Nixon portrait was painted by Henriette Wyeth Hurd, Andrew Wyeth's sister, which prompted Mrs. Gorbachev to note that an exhibition of paintings by the Wyeth family was recently shown in Moscow. **********The two women were careful to dismiss reports that they disliked each other. 'It Seems Smaller Today' **********Before the tour began, Mrs. Reagan told reporters she found such reports ''so silly, so silly,'' adding, ''I assume she feels that way.'' **********But Mrs. Gorbachev, whose main home is believed to be an apartment in downtown Moscow, was just assertive enough to give some listeners the impression that she was sparring. **********''This is where we were last night,'' Mrs. Reagan said when they entered the State Dining Room. ''It seems to be smaller today,'' Mrs. Gorbachev replied. **********When Mrs. Reagan showed her the Red Room, Mrs. Gorbachev replied: ''Yes, we were in this room yesterday. Mrs. Shultz was quite an active guide for me.'' She was referring to a brief tour of the room by Secretary of State George P. Shultz's wife, Helena. **********When Mrs. Reagan acknowledged that an Albert Bierstadt landscape was difficult to see because of the television cameras, Mrs. Gorbachev readily agreed, adding, ''I see the light here is a problem.'' **********Peppering Mrs. Reagan with questions as if the First Lady were a graduate student facing an oral examination, Mrs. Gorbachev at times seemed to test Mrs. Reagan's composure. 'What a Big Help I Am' **********Asked when the White House was built, Mrs. Reagan apparently could not give an answer, leaving it to Betty Monkman, the White House assistant curator, to tell Mrs. Gorbachev the dates - between 1792 and 1800. **********''What a big help I am,'' Mrs. Reagan said to reporters with a sigh. **********Several times during the 45-minute tour, Mrs. Reagan let Ms. Monkman do the talking. **********At times, Mrs. Gorbachev seemed more interested in the television cameras than in the tour or her hostess. She greeted reporters with a cheery ''Good morning,'' the only English she used during the day. **********Turning toward the cameras, she told Mrs. Reagan, ''I invite you to come to Leningrad and to Moscow because you know how rich those cities are.'' Snapping at Reporters **********She did not invite Mrs. Reagan for a reciprocal visit to the homes she shares with her husband, which include their main Moscow apartment, another in the Kremlin and a dacha in the country. **********Mrs. Reagan, perhaps unwilling to show displeasure with her guest, lost her patience instead with the reporters who kept asking Mrs Gorbachev personal questions and delaying the tour. **********When one reporter asked Mrs. Gorbachev whether she would go shopping, and Mrs. Gorbachev said no, Mrs. Reagan snapped, ''I'm not going to be able to show her the rest of the house.'' **********And when Mrs. Gorbachev spoke at length about Soviet education after a reporter asked whether she had studied American history and English before the trip, Mrs. Reagan interjected, ''Regrettably, we have to move on.'' **********An unstoppable Mrs. Gorbachev refused to budge. 'I've Answered This 5 Times' **********At one point, in the East Room, Mrs. Gorbachev interrupted Mrs. Reagan in mid-sentence, telling her how much the pianist Van Cliburn, who played at the State Dinner Tuesday night, is liked in the Soviet Union. **********''Well, he is very much liked here,'' Mrs. Reagan replied. When Mrs. Gorbachev was asked again during a visit to the Blue Room whether she got along with her hostess, an exasperated Mrs. Reagan turned to the reporter and said: ''Oh, I've answered this, I think, five times.'' **********In a moment of solidarity, Mrs. Gorbachev replied: ''Well, everything is all right. It seems to me Mrs. Reagan gave the answer, and that was her word.'' Discussion of Problems **********And the two women apparently had a fruitful discussion about the drug problem in the United States and alcoholism in the Soviet Union, over coffee in the Red Room. **********By the end of the morning visit, however, White House aides were so miffed by Mrs. Gorbachev's performance that they were reduced to sniping about her clothes. **********''A bit cocktailish, don't you think?'' said one White House aide about Mrs. Gorbachev's outfit: a black crepe dress with satin collar and cummerbund and rhinestone buckle, black suede stiletto shoes and clutch bag and rhinestone applique on her baggy hose. **********Mrs. Reagan wore an understated Oscar de la Renta Glen plaid dress and a simple gold collar necklace and earrings. The Patient Husbands **********Mrs. Gorbachev's comments took so much time that President Reagan and the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, had to wait in the Diplomatic Reception Room for 10 minutes after their morning meeting while their wives finished coffee. **********While they were waiting, Mr. Reagan told a group of reporters later in the day, he and Mr. Gorbachev planned a little joke. **********''I suggested something to him,'' the President said, ''and we both did it -that when finally they came around and through the door, he and I were both looking at our watches. We got a laugh.'' **********Mrs. Gorbachev then went to visit the National Gallery. **********Tonight, as the President and Mrs. Reagan entered the Soviet Embassy for dinner, Mrs. Reagan was asked what she discussed with Mrs. Gorba-chev were as good friends as their hus-bands seemed to be, Mrs. Reagan said, ''I never said we weren't.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/14/world/iran-contra-hearings-legislators-move-to-take-spotlight-at-iran-hearings.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-07-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1172, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LEGISLATORS MOVE TO TAKE SPOTLIGHT AT IRAN HEARINGS", "print_headline": "IRAN-CONTRA HEARINGS; LEGISLATORS MOVE TO TAKE SPOTLIGHT AT IRAN HEARINGS", "body_text": " **********The Congressional committees investigating the Iran-contra affair reached out today, in full view of a national television audience, and tried to take back control of their hearings from the man who so dramatically dominated them last week. **********Today it was the Senators and Representatives who made the speeches, not Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North. Legislators from both parties seemed determined to show that they had thought just as deeply about the conflict between the executive and legislative branches and about patriotism, freedom and democracy as had the Marine officer who lectured them last week. Senator Sets the Tone **********Senator George J. Mitchell, a Maine Democrat, set the new tone at the outset. ''Of all the qualities the American people find compelling about you,'' he told Colonel North, ''none is more impressive than your obvious deep devotion to your country. Please remember that others share that devotion, and recognize that it is possible for an American to disagree with you on aid to the contras and still love this country just as much as you do.'' [ Excerpts, pages A10 to A12. ]  Mr. Mitchell continued: ''Although He's regularly asked to do so, God does not take sides in American politics, and in America, disagreement with the policies of the Government is not evidence of lack of patriotism.'' Colonel North had urged Congress to maintain aid to the contras ''for the love of God and for the love of country.'' Constitution Is Cited **********Answering questions from the committee today, Colonel North said the plan to make him the ''fall guy'' for the Iran-contra operations was first suggested by William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, as early as 1984. He had previously testified that he had discussed such a plan with Mr. Casey last fall. It was also announced today that Robert C. McFarlane, the former national security adviser, would be the next witness, testifying again at his own request.  [ Page A10. ]  If not as dramatic as last week's ses-sions, today's offered an unusual chance to hear legislators stating their governmental philosophies and reaching back into history to buttress their arguments. The political stakes were considerable, with many committee members believing themselves in danger of seeming like a hanging jury that cared little for the broader questions of the national interest. **********The same theme as that of Senator Mitchell was sounded later by Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, who argued that ''the essence of our constitutional system is that it gives us a process by which we can resolve these sharply held differences among ourselves.'' **********''The substantive goal does not justify compromising the means.'' **********Looking straight at Colonel North, who sat solemnly as the lawmakers delivered their homilies, the Maryland Senator quoted Justice Louis Brandeis to the effect that ''the greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachments, by men of zeal, well meaning, but without understanding.'' **********But Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, cited the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and the Israeli-Egyptian conference at Camp David in 1978 to demonstrate that ''secrecy has its uses.'' **********Nearly every one of the questioners praised Colonel North for his testimony - even those who also criticized what he did while working at the White House. Mr. Hyde declared that everyone remembered Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell for his advocacy of air power, but almost no one remembered the prosecutor at his court-martial in 1925. **********Another defender, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, told Colonel North: ''I don't want you prosecuted. I don't. I don't think many people in America do. And I think there's going to be one lot of hell raised if you are.'' **********But tempers frayed later in the afternoon, and Representative Jack Brooks, Democrat of Texas, a cigar-chewing former marine, told Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., Colonel North's relentlessly aggressive lawyer, to quit telling the committee how to conduct its business. **********The committee chairman, Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, who had expressed the intention to complete the colonel's testimony today even though that would have meant continuing well into the evening, changed his mind after the shouting match between Mr. Brooks and Mr. Sullivan and ordered an adjournment shortly after 5 P.M. **********Earlier, in a long monologue, Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, came closer than anyone else to summarizing the questions that will have to be resolved at some point. as a result of Colonel North's activities and testimony. Among them were these: *********** Can any Administration avoid compliance with the law by simply launching a covert operation? If so, can a President decide, ''in his sole discretion,'' to delay notifying Congress as long as he likes? *********** Should deception ''be practiced upon Congress by deletion, or official documents reduced to confetti, while false statements are given to public officials,'' even in covert activities? *********** Can the executive branch ''authorize the sale of United States assets, inflate the prices to be paid, and then fund programs that were either not known or authorized by Congress, and in fact, had maybe even been rejected by Congress?'' *********** Should Congress ''adopt policies that deal as severely with members of Congress who reveal our country's secrets as they would with those who lie'' about those secrets? **********But it was Mr. Hyde, the white-haired legislator from the Chicago suburbs, who seemed to some in the room to best sum up the background to the whole effort to divert funds from arms sales to the contras. **********''When you have a liberal Democratic Congress,'' he said, ''God bless them all, the people elected them and that's democracy and all that good stuff, and you have a conservative Republican President, you've got a recipe for gridlock. Nothing will happen. And that is the problem we have to deal with here in our Central American policy.'' **********Senator Warren B. Rudman, Republican of New Hampshire, who is the vice chairman of the Senate committee, rounded out the day by delivering his own speech to the witness because, he said, ''everyone else has had something to say to you.'' Himself a supporter of contra aid, he cited poll figures and the views of his own conservative constituents to support his contention that ''people in this country just don't think'' that contra aid ''is a very good idea.'' **********''The American people have the constitutional right to be wrong,'' he said. ''What Ronald Reagan thinks or what Oliver North thinks or what I think or what anybody else thinks makes not a whit'' of difference ''if the American people say, 'Enough.' And that's why this Congress has been fickle and has vacillated - that is correct.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/07/world/copenhagen-airport-struck.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Copenhagen Airport Struck", "print_headline": "Copenhagen Airport Struck", "body_text": " **********A strike by fuel transport workers at Kastrup Airport in Copenhagen today caused delays and cancellation of some flights, airport officials said.

Calls for Individual Rights **********Most politicians in the so-called transitional Government argue that minority rights are best safeguarded by the protection of individual rights. **********Although there have been three interim governments since local rule was established in 1980, South Africa continues to rule the former German colony - in defiance of a United Nations independence plan dating from 1978. **********The interim governments have had no real leverage on Pretoria other than reminding President P. W. Botha of his public commitment to allow the territory's people to determine their own future without outside interference. **********Blacks have majorities in the interim Cabinet, the Constitutional Council and the National Assembly, but their political power is academic. The real power rests in segregated authorities that represent 11 racial or ethnic groups, one of which represents whites. Whites Run Institutions **********Each of these authorities technically has the power to block Government moves that would effect them. But the white authority is the most powerful since it runs most of South-West Africa's institutions, such as schools and hospitals. **********South Africa also maintains an Administrator General in Windhoek, the capital, who has limited veto power over legislation. **********The 16-member Constitutional Council was assigned to draft a constitution that did not discriminate on the basis of race. **********The proposed constitution, whose provisions have not been published, is reportedly based on a system of one person, one vote, with a bill of rights. But it is said to omit any specific reference to minority rights, a phrase President Botha regards as essential to protect the white minority in a country where 87 percent of the population is black, 7 percent white and 6 percent of mixed race. The Guerrilla War **********Pretoria's plan for South-West Africa has included a series of constitutional provisions over the years to bolster the position of so-called internal leaders who are willing to cooperate with Pretoria at the expense of the South-West Africa Peoples Organization, or Swapo, the biggest opposition party. **********Swapo, which is recognized by the United Nations as ''the sole and authentic representatives of the Namibian people,'' has a military wing that has been fighting a 21-year guerrilla war from bases in Angola, more than 450 miles north of Windhoek. **********President Botha installed the territory's latest interim Government amid much fanfare two years ago, and since then it has been promoted by a $2 million-a-year international public relations campaign. **********But now the appointed leaders of the multiracial but mostly black coalition Government are once again at loggerheads with Pretoria over its preoccupation with retaining absolute control here. This preoccupation has insured that the constitutional experiment has merely eliminated racial discrimination on the periphery, while leaving political apartheid's fundamentals intact. Segregation Remains **********Laws outlawing interracial marriage, restricting black labor mobility and demarcating racially segregated residential areas for South-West Africa's 1.2 million people have been abolished. **********But schools and medical facilities remain segregated on the insistence of the Windhoek Government's white authority, which is controlled by the South-West Africa National Party, an offshoot of South Africa's ruling National Party. **********Windhoek's Finance Minister, Dirk Mudge, who has been a top leader of the pro-Pretoria forces, has had increasingly strained relations with President Botha in recent months over the proposed constitution and other issues. **********Mr. Botha recently cut South Africa's vital annual contribution to the recession-plagued economy from $254 million to $154 million - reportedly after a clash with Windhoek leaders over the ''apartheid-free'' constitution. Afterward, Mr. Mudge warned that ''the road to constitutional and political independence would be accompanied by greater economic and financial self-sufficiency.'' 'A War Economy' **********A truly independent South-West Africa would also remain heavily dependent on the South African-trained security forces and civil service. **********Pretoria retains control of the military and the police and the responsibility for foreign affairs. The interim Government is not allowed to negotiate beyond the territory's borders on the international status of South-West Africa or send diplomatic representatives abroad. **********''Namibia is effectively a war economy,'' an economist said. ''If the military was to withdraw, the economy would collapse.'' **********Even if the proposed constitution is approved by the interim Government, after public comment, it still would face formidable hurdles. The document would have to be approved by voters. Then it could not form the basis for true independence until it was approved by all the parties to the United Nations independence plan. The Question of an Election **********Overshadowing the constitutional debate, the central question in South-West Africa remains whether President Botha is prepared to move toward an internationally supervised election. Swapo would almost certainly emerge from such an election with an outright majority because it is drawn largely from the territory's biggest ethnic group, the Ovambos, and has the prestige accruing from leading the visible struggle against Pretoria. **********Analysts of South African politics say the swing to the right in South Africa's whites-only election in May makes Mr. Botha less likely to risk a white right-wing backlash by endangering white control in South-West Africa. They also say he would be stoking the fires of black resistance in South Africa by allowing a liberation struggle to be won on Pretoria's border. **********There have been signs that three years of heightened black resistance in South Africa - including the efforts of the African National Congress, the main guerrilla group fighting to end apartheid there - have brought the constitutional laboratory closer to home. **********There are also signs that Mr. Botha is likely to continue playing for time in South-West Africa, as he has done since he took office in 1978. **********''We may yet have to ask an African National Congress government in Pretoria for our independence,'' a Swapo official joked."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/15/business/us-official-leaves-gulf.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Official Leaves Gulf", "print_headline": "U.S. Official Leaves Gulf", "body_text": " **********Energy Secretary John S.

''People seeing rates rising will panic and buy a home quickly,'' said Jay Charles Goodgal, a Paterson, N.J., money manager.

First American has only about 2.75 million shares outstanding, and Mr. Goodgal cautioned, ''It's very thinly traded, with a large spread'' between bid and asked prices. ''I won't pay more than a point spread,'' he said. The first quarter will get a one-time boost this year from a $9 million tax credit, according to Mr. Goodgal. That is equivalent to about $3.27 a share and could lift earnings toward $4 a share. For the year, he expects First American at least to match 1986's results, before the tax credit, and perhaps do much better. ''They're in the best markets possible, one of the biggest title insurers in California, with limited exposure to Texas,'' he said. ''And their business in the Northeast is dramatically increasing.'' **********The biggest risk? That a sustained, sharp increase in rates knocks the props from under housing demand. But a rate rise that does not stall the industry can bolster the insurer's results by lifting yields on its investments."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/01/business/the-wildcatter-s-tale.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Applebome", "pub_date": "1987-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2618, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE WILDCATTER'S TALE", "print_headline": "THE WILDCATTER'S TALE", "body_text": " **********''FRED, I think we've got a sissy here,'' said Duke Rudman to his chauffeur, Fred Washington. At the time, Mr. Rudman, clad in peach-colored jogging pants and a gray hooded sweatshirt, was digging in his toes and traipsing across an interviewer's back to demonstrate the Oriental acupressure massage therapy he had learned in Japan. **********This session in Mr. Rudman's den did not seem to be a run-of-the-mill opening for a discussion about the oil industry, but very little is run of the mill about Mr. Rudman, from his remarkable vigor to his contrarian instincts to his eye-catching attire. At 77, he is a legend in the oil industry, a maverick who has made his fortune by following his instincts. And now that exploration efforts have slowed to a virtual standstill in the depressed oil patch, the venerable oilman is once again moving against the crowd, spending millions of his own dollars to drill new wells. **********Mr. Rudman, whose career dates to back the 1930's, is an independent operator in a field increasingly dominated by corporate behemoths, a health food devotee in a world more attuned to t-bones, an aficionado of plumed hats and red velvet tuxedos in an industry that prefers conservative suits or blue jeans. And as unremitting gloom shrouds his fellow oilmen, he also stands out as an optimist. **********''I've been waiting 56 years for this,'' said Mr. Rudman. ''It's the greatest opportunity that has ever existed in my lifetime. The way I figure is that if the price of oil is 50 percent of what it was and your drilling cost is 50 percent of what it was, you're in the same situation only the deals are so much better now.'' During the boom years, he said, too many investors were crowding each other out of the best opportunities. ''Right now, I figure I'm going to go at it as hard as I can. I'm spending every dime of my income on drilling wells.'' **********Other oilmen maintain that Mr. Rudman's optimism should be taken with a few grains of salt. He can afford to be enthusiastic, they say, because he scored a remarkable coup in 1981, at the height of the oil boom, by selling off all his producting wells to the Petro-Lewis Corporation. In a debt-ridden industry, he is one of the last of an endangered species, a cash-rich oilman. He said he is investing millions of his own dollars in approximately 70 wells this year. **********Mr. Rudman bases his optimism on the lowered costs of drilling wells in a depressed industry. With the number of active oil rigs in the United States down to 839 from a peak of 4,530 in 1981, rigs can sell for 10 cents on the dollar. Promoters who once charged fat fees for oil deals are now desperate for investors. Most of the wells that could be drilled for $1 million to $3 million a few years back can be done for half that now. Mr. Rudman figures he has more chance of getting in on a deal that could turn into a major find, and he is certain the current carnage in the industry will eventually lead to shortages and substantially higher prices. **********His colleagues in the industry take a somewhat different view. ''As far as timing, I agree with Rudman,'' said George Mitchell, a Houston oilman. ''But it's going to take two or three years for the industry sentiment to change. Most oilmen are stressed, the banks are stressed, the participants are pulling back because of the new tax law. They don't feel this is the time to move in the oil business. Most people are too busy battling debt and a downward price spiral.'' **********In fact, Mr. Rudman's optimism may be as much a matter of temperament as of economics. It is not easy to find much romance in the oil industry these days, but Mr. Rudman is a throwback to an earlier era when any young man with enough moxie could turn himself into a wildcatter. Those days seem long gone, and independent oilmen have been among the worst casualties of the current oil price collapse. As such, his perspective may have as much to do with where the industry has come from as where it is going. **********''A lot of people ask me why I'm still drilling wildcat wells,'' Mr. Rudman said. ''Well, the older guys in the business have a feeling of living by the sword and dying by the sword. Living a little recklessly when all the odds are against you. It's something you can't feel unless you've done it. It's like playing football and running through 11 guys the entire length of the damn field. You got 11 guys trying to tackle you and no one gets you. You have to do it to know how it feels.'' **********Mr. Rudman, whose full name is Mayer Billy Rudman, was born in Bonham, Tex., in 1909, the son of a Russian clothier who arrived in Galveston near the turn of the century. His mother, Rose, who will turn 100 this year, was born in St. Louis. Eventually, his father got into the oilfield supply business, and the family spent Mr. Rudman's youth living in a series of Oklahoma oil towns, alighting over the years in such places as Drumright, Okmulgee, Okemah and Henrietta. **********He learned at an early age how to box, he said, because it was not easy being the only Jewish boy in a small Oklahoma town. Growing up, he worked in the oilfields every summer. After high school he spent a year at the University of Oklahoma, but soon grew restless. He dropped out after his freshman year and started hustling up oil exploration deals in southern Oklahoma and East Texas, living for a time in a pipeyard to make ends meet. Back then you could drill a well for as little as $5,000, so he was able to put together deals giving him a small share of wells financed with other investors' dollars. IT was not an auspicious beginning. He says he drilled 29 dry holes before he finally hit his first one, around 1932, at a time when oil was selling for about 10 cents a barrel. He went back and forth between Texas and Oklahoma, but spent most of his time in East Texas, where the late H. L. Hunt and thousands of other would-be tycoons were plying the 80-mile-long field that would turn out to be the richest ever found in the United States. **********By the age of 30, he had interests in 175 wells, and $5,000 in monthly income to plow back into new ventures - a relatively modest sum even then for a player in the high-stakes oil business. Mr. Rudman slowly built up his activity until 1951, when he became the first independent to drill successfully in the Williston Basin, kicking off two fields with combined production of 188 million barrels of oil and 484 billion cubic feet of gas. The strike made him, at age 42, a major independent player. ''You can say it took me out of the jerk class,'' he said. **********His best move after the Williston Basin probably came on June 30, 1981, when he sold all his producing properties to Petro-Lewis, the aggresive Denver-based oil and gas company. Mr. Rudman declines to specify how much the sale was for, saying only, ''It was enough to get my teeth fixed, and dentists are pretty expensive.'' But it included properties he had accumulated over 50 years, and industry gossip puts it in the neighborhood of $150 million. At the time he sold, oil was selling for about $36 a barrel, having peaked a few months earlier at $38, and has since skidded to a current price of less than $17. Petro-Lewis has spend much of the last year trying to stave off bankruptcy proceedings. **********Along the way, Mr. Rudman has come to be known as much for his exotic wardrobe and oratorial skills as for his business success. He was first nicknamed ''Duke'' back in the 1930's, a tribute to his sartorial splendor even in those early years when his budget was limited. In the 1960's, when his taste tended toward spats and Edwardian suits, he won some international fashion awards. These days he still dresses for work with the care most people reserve for major evening outings, picking one of his favorite Lord's San Franciscan hats off pegs on his bedroom wall before leaving for his office in a chauffeur-driven Lincoln limousine. At night, he turns up at social and sporting events ranging from charity balls to the Dallas Mavericks' basketball games. **********Outside oil and fashion, he has been an active anti-smoking crusader since 1935. He and his wife, Josephine, have been married for 53 years and have two sons, Wolfe, a former antiques dealer who recently joined his father's oil company, and Michael, a director with the National Theater in London. **********Over the years Mr. Rudman has been acquainted with most of the legendary names in the oil business, and says the best of them all was the late H. L. Hunt. ''He was one of the most brilliant men I ever met,'' Mr. Rudman recalled. ''He would have been successful at anything. A lot of people begrudge him his success, but they shouldn't. He was brilliant. He was a hard worker. Even when he was worth a fabulous amount of money, you would find him at every strike. He was always ahead of everybody.'' In 1969 Mr. Rudman decided that oilmen were not getting the recognition they deserved, so he founded the All-American Wildcatters Association, an informal oil industry fraternity that meets one weekend a year to hear a speaker and swap industry gossip. Its membership roster includes T. Boone Pickens, Bunker and Herbert Hunt, Pennzoil chairman Hugh Liedtke, former Exxon chairman J. K. Jamieson, Kerr McGee's Dean McGee and other industry giants. There are about 105 members in all, although with the passage of time there are fewer independent wildcatters and more oil industry potentates, reflecting the shift in the industry. ''I knew the public would never honor us, so I figured we could at least honor each other,'' Mr. Rudman said. ''I felt we were heroes, and I still do.'' **********That is a common refrain in the Southwest, but it is recited with particular fervor these days, in light of the current economic carnage in the industry. Like most of his fellow oilmen, Mr. Rudman is convinced that today's low energy prices must eventually lead to shortages, as American producers continue to go out of business. A recent study by the National Petroleum Council predicted that severe price shocks could be only a few years away, and that by 1995 as much as 60 percent of the nation's oil needs would have to be supplied from foreign sources, up from 27 percent in 1985. **********''Sooner or later there is going to be panic, and I mean real panic,'' Mr. Rudman said. ''Eventually people are going to get down on their hands and knees to the oilmen. It's either us or the Arabs, and I guarantee they can reason with us a lot better.'' **********Mr. Rudman's operations are now relatively simple. He buys shares in promising oil drilling activities around the nation, including some in frontier areas where no oil and gas have been found. He does not travel to do the drilling himself, but solicits and evaluates the deals that are brought to him. He is doing fewer deals than he did at the peak of the boom, when he participated in as many as 170 wells in a year, but often he is taking a larger share of them. **********Mr. Rudman says that one great discovery - like the East Texas field or Williston Basin - can make up for dozens of dry holes, particularly at today's relatively low drilling costs. **********But few of his peers in the industry or the All-American Wildcatters Association share his optimism. Most oilmen are more worried about servicing debt at a time of collapsing prices than expanding in hopes of a big hit or an eventual price rise. More important, although individual deals can be done cheaper now, the oil industry's future lies either offshore or in remote areas where only the biggest players can compete. **********Last week Conoco Inc. announced a $400 million offshore venture, adding that the industry's future will increasingly be found in deeper waters offshore. Roy Huffington, a Houston oilman and current chairman of the wildcatters' group, said it can cost as much as $150 million for one wildcat well and $1 billion in acreage to become a player in the Alaskan frontier. **********''The rewards in the business are no longer commensurate with the risks,'' Mr. Huffington said. ''You spend that kind of money and the odds are maybe one in 10 you'll find something. It takes a lot of economic staying power to play in a game like that. It was more fun when you could roll the dice with $50,000 and maybe find an East Texas field. Now you can spend $1 billion and find absolutely nothing. That stings a little bit.'' EVEN the more modest plays are less accessible to an aspiring operator than they were in Mr. Rudman's youth, because the fields are likely to be smaller and the oil found at deeper levels. ''There was just a lot more oil to be found back then,'' said Steve Schneider, a Dallas oilman and a founding member of the wildcatters' organization. ''If you have an Easter egg hunt with ostrich eggs and hummingbird eggs, you're going to find the ostrich eggs first. Then it dwindles down to the smaller things. If you found an East Texas field that was 80 miles long and 15 miles wide, a lot of people could get in on it. Nowadays a big field might be 300 to 500 acres, and it might be pretty well buttoned up before anyone can drill on it.'' **********Mr. Rudman both agrees and disagrees. He figures times are tough now, but no tougher than in the Depression era when oil was selling for 10 cents a barrel. He has seen enough booms and busts to figure there is light at the end of the tunnel. Whether the industry will ever again be a place where a boy with no money can drill 29 wells before hitting on one is open to question. But no one makes it in the oil business without being a believer, and Mr. Rudman figures the big hits are still there for those who can manage to keep looking for them. **********''If you find enough oil, price doesn't matter,'' Mr. Rudman said. ''I guess that's something that's ingrained in guys like me. We're still looking for that big one. Of the thousands of wells I've participated in, I've only been involved in five or six major fields, but if you don't have the guts or the fortitude to keep going after them, the chances of staying in this business are very slim.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/12/world/thatcher-calls-june-11-elections-buoyed-by-a-big-lead-in-the-polls.html": {"writer_name": "Howell Raines", "pub_date": "1987-05-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1021, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THATCHER CALLS JUNE 11 ELECTIONS, BUOYED BY A BIG LEAD IN THE POLLS", "print_headline": "THATCHER CALLS JUNE 11 ELECTIONS, BUOYED BY A BIG LEAD IN THE POLLS", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today called a general election for June 11, a year ahead of schedule, and thus tied her political fortunes to an improving economy and her rising position in public-opinion polls. **********The Conservative Prime Minister ended weeks of increasingly feverish speculation shortly after noon when she went to Buckingham Palace and formally advised Queen Elizabeth II to dissolve Parliament. **********Under the schedule announced today, Parliament will have until next Monday to wind up its business. At that point, the parties will publish their manifestoes for the campaign in the 650 parliamentary constituencies in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Thatcher Ahead in the Polls **********According to the public-opinion polls, Mrs. Thatcher is positioned to lead her party to another substantial majority. Consolidated figures from the 10 most recent nationwide surveys put the Conservative Party at 41.7 percent, Labor at 30.4 percent and the Alliance parties at 25.5 percent. If evenly distributed throughout the country, that popular vote would give her a majority of about 90 seats. Her majority now is 138 seats. **********The Labor leader, Neil Kinnock, said today, ''This election is about saving our country from industrial decline, social division and the destruction of community services.'' **********The Alliance, a union of the Social Democratic and Liberal parties that is bidding to emerge as a centrist third force, condemned Mrs. Thatcher for catering to wheeler-dealers. But David Steel, the Liberal leader, said voters would also reject the ''state socialism which Mr. Kinnock offers.'' **********Another victory would make Mrs. Thatcher, who took office in 1979, the first Prime Minster in this century to win three consecutive terms. With another full term, Mrs. Thatcher would also become the century's longest serving Prime Minister, surpassing Herbert Asquith and Winston Churchill, both of whom served almost nine years. Looking to a Fourth Term **********In interviews after her announcement today, Mrs. Thatcher even raised the possibility of a fourth term. ''I hope to go on and on because I believe passionately in our policies, and I believe they are right for Britain,'' she said. She added, in response to a question: ''A fourth term? I would like to be able to, but we have first to win the third term.'' **********Conservative strategists plan to emphasize the historical shadings of this contest as they lay out two main themes for the re-election campaign. **********First, they will argue that Mrs. Thatcher needs a third term to institutionalize her free-market economic policies and prevent a return to the state ownership and economic control instituted by the Labor Government after World War II. **********Second, the Conservatives will argue that the Prime Minister will use a third term so she can extend what they call the ''Thatcher revolution'' from economics into new areas of social policy, like education, health care and housing. **********The Tory manifesto, for example, is said to include a plan to transfer rental housing from state to private ownership. **********''I think it really is a manifesto to set a course to go up to the next century,'' Mrs. Thatcher said today. ''We ought to set Britain's course for the next century, as well as this.'' Opposition Seems Eager **********The opposition leaders said they were eager to join the campaign debate on the terms outlined by the Conservatives. They see this as an opportunity to hammer at the issues of compassion and fairness and to emphasize Mrs. Thatcher's image as an uncaring ideologue. **********''Will we have a modern welfare state with Labor or end up with a poor law state under the Tories?'' Mr. Kinnock said today, sounding a central opposition theme that Thatcherism has divided Britain's haves against its have-nots. **********Mr. Kinnock said Britain's booming consumer economy, low inflation and declining interest rates had been achieved at the price of an industrial decline and rising unemployment. Although unemployment has decreased for eight months in a row, it is still over three million, or 11 percent, compared with 1.1 million, or 4.3 percent, when Mrs. Thatcher took office. **********Labor is also warning the nation's 43.6 million voters that Mrs. Thatcher's emphasis on social programs amounts to a ''hidden agenda'' to dismantle Britain's elaborate welfare system and coarsen its social conscience, so that savings on social spending can be used to finance tax cuts for the wealthy. The Alliance's Stand **********Mr. Steel's partner in the Alliance, David Owen of the Social Democrats, said the Alliance offered a ''government committed to both the competitive market economy and a concerned, compassionate society which would unite the nation.'' **********Talk of Labor and the Alliance working together in a campaign of ''tactical voting'' to deny Mrs. Thatcher a majority in a ''hung Parliament'' has recently waned as the Alliance has become more frank about its hopes of displacing the Labor Party as the main opposition force. Still, a dip below 38 percent in the total Conservative vote could cost Mrs. Thatcher her majority and open the way for her opponents to form a coalition government. That is regarded as the major risk she takes in calling an election at this point. **********By law, Mrs. Thatcher could have called an election as late as July 7, 1988. But in deciding to go to the voters with 13 months left in her five-year term, she was responding to election fever in Parliament and a series of good political and economic omens. These were capped by a strong Conservative showing in local elections last Thursday. **********Mrs. Thatcher is now Europe's longest serving elected Prime Minister and will be the senior leader at the economic summit meeting of major non-Communist industrialized nations June 8-10 in Venice. Today, advisers said she would interrupt campaigning for a one-day visit to Venice, probably on June 8."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/03/business/new-commerce-post-stirs-up-storm.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1987-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 466, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Commerce Post Stirs Up Storm", "print_headline": "New Commerce Post Stirs Up Storm", "body_text": " **********A power struggle has broken out in the Commerce Department under its new Secretary, C.

Mr. Dean is now the senior director of international programs and technology affairs at the National Security Council. **********But the choice has upset Senator Jake Garn, senior Republican on the Senate Banking Committee and one of the most persistent critics of the Commerce Department's management of export licensing programs. These programs are aimed at preventing advanced technology and other products that could have military use from reaching the Soviet Union and other unfriendly countries. **********The Utah Senator wants the new job to go to a former economist on his staff, Paul Freedenberg, who for the past two years has been Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration and is now the Acting Under Secretary. **********Administering the export rules is very sensitive because of opposing positions taken by the business community and the Pentagon.

Previously, management of the controls came under the Under Secretary for Trade Administration. The Garn amendment made export administration an autonomous unit within the Commerce Department and outside the trade administration office. **********''Since the post was created by Garn, and he already had his own man as Assistant Secretary, it was only natural that he would fight to have that man elevated to Under Secretary,'' said an official who asked not to be identified. **********Senator Garn is reported to have written a letter to Secretary Verity urging that Mr. Freedenberg be named.

That polite, unspoken arrangement ends next week. **********On Tuesday, Microsoft is planning to introduce Excel, its innovative, graphics-heavy spreadsheet program, specifically designed to exploit the best features of the International Business Machines Corporation's new PS/2 line of personal computers. **********In the minds of many in the industry, Excel may pose the first serious challenge to Lotus's 1-2-3, the spreadsheet program whose longevity has shocked even its creators. **********For Microsoft, Excel is one of the most expensive, and by some measures one of the riskiest, in the company's 10-year history. Lotus, which dominates the spreadsheet market, has sold more than two million copies of 1-2-3. Faithful Customers **********Among numbers-crunching accountants, corporate planners and business school students the program has developed the kind of loyal following usually reserved for Madonna and the Boston Red Sox. **********''We don't expect to make a huge impact right away,'' said Jeff Raikes, who is in charge of marketing applications programs at Microsoft, which is based in Bellevue, Wash. ''But we are heading into a technology transition, and over the long term we have a major opportunity.'' **********In fact, Excel is something of a grand experiment in the software industry. The first major program designed specifically for the power, graphics and memory of I.B.M.'s new machines, it will be an early test of whether I.B.M. personal-computer users are willing to do more than trade up their hardware; it will be a test of whether they are also willing to shake old habits and rethink how they deal with information on their computer screens. **********''This will be the first glimpse of what the next generation of applications will look like,'' said Michelle Preston, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. But the power of familiarity is enormous, Ms. Preston noted. ''So to displace Lotus, this will have to be not just a little better but a lot better,'' she said. The Natural Look **********Lotus's approach seems natural to anyone who has ever used graph paper to record and tally columns and rows of related numbers, such as an inventory list or a sales projection. What the program does, however, is total the results itself, establishing mathematical relationships between figures that reside in different ''cells'' where the columns and rows meet. **********If the number in one cell changes, the values in related cells are recalculated instantly. Lotus was also the first spreadsheet with the capability to graph the results of its calculations. **********Ever since it was introduced in 1982, Lotus's computer-screen appearance has become a much copied industry standard, and spreadsheet maestros can manipulate a Lotus screen like a master pianist plays a keyboard. **********Excel's approach is different. Originally designed for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh, it makes use of small graphics characters called ''icons'' to establish links between cells and to move data around. **********Unlike 1-2-3, Excel can link multiple spreadsheets - one for each month of regional sales reports, for example, to obtain yearly totals -and make use of scores of colors to distinguish different types of numbers and charts. **********In the lingo of the computer industry, rarely known for coining graceful phrases, this Macintosh-like approach is known as a ''graphical user interface.'' Having learned a lesson from Apple, I.B.M. is wholly adopting that interface in the PS/2 line. **********Most new programs for the PS/2 line will share the same on-screen look, running under a uniform program that I.B.M. calls the Presentation Manager. (In fact, the Presentation Manager is derived from Microsoft Windows, a program that has caught on among I.B.M. PC users only in recent months.) A Popular Feature ''We think this is a case where a competitor's strength is also its greatest weakness,'' said Mr. Raikes of Microsoft. ''In the case of Lotus, the strength is an interface that people are very used to.'' He was referring to the Lotus-like spreadhseet grid and the sequence of keystrokes used to convey instructions to the computer. **********''But the world is moving toward a graphical interface,'' Mr. Raikes said. ''And Lotus is hoping that people won't want to switch.'' **********Lotus, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., and whose sales should hit $375 million this year, is hardly standing still. When Microsoft, with projected sales in the calendar year 1987 of about $400 million, recently displaced it as the largest personal-computer software company, more than a few egos were bruised in Lotus's brick-and-glass headquarters on the Charles River, overlooking Boston. **********So early next year Lotus plans to release the third and totally revamped version of Lotus 1-2-3. Among its features will be three-dimensional spreadsheets, similar to a pad of spreadsheets, many with related data. **********''It will have all kinds of powerful performance advantages,'' said Ed Belove, the head of research and development at Lotus. ''That means better graphics, including features to allow the user to define their own graphic and chart types.'' **********It will also include elements that allow companies and sophisticated users to customize versions of 1-2-3 for their own uses - currently a complex task that has spawned something of a sub-industry in the software business. **********''Remember, 1-2-3 hasn't changed much since it first came out,'' one Lotus insider said recently. ''There's a five-year-long wish list of stuff that's going to get crammed into this thing. Some of it will blow you away.'' Graphics Version to Follow **********By midyear, Lotus plans to follow up with 1-2-3G, a graphics-oriented version of 1-2-3 that will also make use of I.B.M.'s Presentation Manager. ''We aren't complacent and we never are,'' Mr. Belove said. ''But we feel comfortable that the improvements we are making in 1-2-3 will make it the most attractive spreadsheet on the market.'' **********Nonetheless, most analysts feel that Lotus's market share has no place to go but down. It commands a remarkable 80 to 90 percent of all I.B.M. PC spreadsheet sales sold today. The remainder goes to older programs and low-cost alternatives, such as Paperback Software Inc.'s VP Planner, the subject of a copyright-infringement lawsuit between Paperback and Lotus. (Another low-cost spreadsheet, Borland International's $195 Quattro, was introduced earlier this week.) Even at $495, Excel could grab 10 percent almost right away, analysts said, and do better if Lotus stumbles. ''Excel could be a $20 million product in the next 12 months,'' Ms. Preston said. ''That would be a fine performance, and still might not do much to disrupt Lotus's business.'' Powerful Computers Required **********Still, most experts expect Microsoft to face an uphill battle. Excel's heavy use of graphics means the computer's processor must constantly refresh virtually every point on the computer screen, too big a task for all but 5 to 10 percent of the older members of I.B.M.'s line. Thus, the program will only run on computers with an Intel 80286 or 80386 processor -and it will run fast only on computers with more than a million bytes of memory. **********''It's the first program that also tries to get you to buy faster hardware,'' said Steven A. Ballmer, a senior Microsoft executive. In other words, until the PS/2 line begins to infiltrate the corporate marketplace, Excel is likely to make slow progress. **********Lotus could also throw Microsoft some curves. While Excel is compatible with Lotus spreadsheets and small programs called ''macros'' that make Lotus easier to use, most experts expect Lotus to make substantial changes in its new version. That would send Microsoft back to the laboratory to keep up. **********And many analysts question whether corporate customers, who have spent millions of dollars to teach their employees how to use 1-2-3, are willing to change - no matter what hardware they buy. Losing Ground in Japan **********History is little help is judging who will prevail. Microsoft's early Multiplan spreadsheet, now aging and slow, was wiped out by 1-2-3 in the United States and is losing ground in Japan, where it was once the market leader. But the version of Excel that runs on the Macintosh, introduced two years ago, easily defeated Lotus's Jazz - an ''integrated'' program that included word-processing and communications programs, but featured a spreadsheet with too little power and flexibility. **********''One can argue that we mispositioned Jazz,'' Mr. Belove said. ''People were looking for 1-2-3 on the Macintosh, and that is not what we gave them.'' **********While Lotus won't talk about it, 1-2-3 on the Macintosh is expected soon, perhaps next year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/30/business/no-contest-plea-made-by-posner.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 637, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No-Contest Plea Made By Posner", "print_headline": "No-Contest Plea Made By Posner", "body_text": " **********Victor Posner pleaded no contest today to charges of evading more than $1.2 million in Federal income taxes by inflating the value of land donated to a Miami Bible college. **********United States District Judge Eugene P.

In 1984, Congress barred the Government from spending money in direct or indirect support of the contras. **********Government officials said they believed Mr. Walsh would also take charge of investigations by the F.B.I. and Customs Service into Southern Air Transport, a Miami-based carrier that has been linked to the contra supply network and the effort to sell weapons to Iran. **********The Justice Department recently acknowledged that it delayed the inquiries for several weeks last fall because the White House was concerned that investigators might interfere with delicate hostage negotiations in the Middle East. **********At the time of the delay, the department said, prosecutors were unaware of any connection between arms sales in Iran and events in Nicaragua, except that Southern Air Transport might have been somehow involved in transporting equipment to both nations. **********Mr. Walsh, the officials said, appeared to be moving quickly to begin his investigation and had already tentatively selected several lawyers to serve as his assistants.

Consumers, burdened by high levels of debt and weak growth in income, have sharply cut back on purchases of such discretionary items as cars and furniture. **********Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity, has been the driving force behind the nation's recovery from the 1981-82 recession. Recovery Could Be in Danger **********Spending this year is expected to increase by only 2 percent, half the growth rate of 1986. Analysts said that if this scaled-back forecast proved to be too optimistic, the recovery could be in danger. **********''The retail sales report makes me nervous,'' said Sandra Shaber, economist at the Futures Group, a Washington forecasting firm. ''I would have liked to have seen more activity outside of autos, and we just didn't get it.'' **********The weakness last month was led by a 3.8 percent drop in car sales, the largest monthly decline since January. Excluding autos, retail sales would have risen only three-tenths of 1 percent, but analysts said most of this advance resulted from higher prices rather than from greater sales volume. Figures 'Look Pretty Weak' **********''The retail sales figures look pretty weak,'' said Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch in New York. ''Consumer spending will rise much more slowly than it did in 1986 because income growth is very weak and savings are virtually nonexistent.'' **********Deborah Johnson, senior economist at Prudential-Bache Securities in New York, predicted that overall economic growth, as measured by the gross national product, would probably not exceed 2 percent this year. That would be even less than the 2.5 percent growth in the G.N.P. in 1986, a year in which the economy was suffering from a slump in manufacturing. **********''Now we are beginning to see a little bit of an upturn in the industrial sector, but that will probably be offset by a weak consumer,'' she said.

The dollar was weak in Europe on Thursday night and in New York yesterday morning. Bond Yields Less Attractive **********''A strengthening of the dollar and a lower-than-expected rise in the Consumer Price Index had sustained the bond market's rally until the end-of-the-quarter Treasury mini-refunding,'' Mr. Tung said. He added that bond yields, which have dropped substantially in recent weeks, were now less attractive to many investors, so that a further rally at this time would be more difficult. **********After opening lower, bond prices eroded through the afternoon to the close, hurt by the mixed results of the Treasury auctions. Yields on the three new issues in the $24.25 billion financing have generally risen since the issues were sold. **********The two-year notes, which sold at an average yield of about 7.46 percent on Tuesday, were up to 7.52 percent early yesterday afternoon and by late in the day were at 7.49 percent. The four-year notes, which sold at 7.89 percent on Wednesday, were at 7.93 percent at midafternoon and 7.89 percent late in the day.

This was in line with what had been expected until just before the auction, when optimistic market talk raised the estimate of the Japanese buying to as much as 30 percent of the refinancing.

The officials said yesterday that the firm was considering whether it would make another bid. **********''We are examining all of our options,'' said Jack Perkowski, director of investment banking at the firm. **********Paine Webber's first offer was presented on Monday to a group that included bankers from Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., Jim Walter's investment adviser, and members of Jim Walter's board who are not part of management. **********That offer was to merge the companies at $69 a share, or $2.8 billion. Of that total, $60 was in cash, $5 in subordinated debt securities and $4 in equity securities. Debt Burden Cited **********That offer was withdrawn after the management at Jim Walter told Paine Webber a merger deal would take too long and would burden the company with too much debt, a disincentive for managers who would participate in a leveraged buyout. **********''There are two pulls on management in a leveraged buyout situation,'' said one Wall Street analyst, who asked not to be identified. ''First, they want to maximize payment to shareholders. But they also want to maximize their own opportunity as participants in the leveraged buyout. The more you pay up front the less you have available later.'' **********The second Paine Webber offer, submitted late Wednesday, was a tender offer of $62 a share, or $2.52 billion. That offer was composed of $52 in cash and $10 in securities. It was rejected in favor of the all-cash offer from Kohlberg, Kravis on Wednesday evening. Proxies and Votes Required **********Tender offers, like the ones made by Kohlberg, Kravis and Paine Webber, can be completed in as few as 20 days. Mergers, by contrast, can take as long as three months to complete because they require that the company send out proxy statements to shareholders and that holders vote. **********Yesterday Mr. Perkowski and Joseph Flom, the firm's outside counsel, went to pains to argue that the offer of $69 a share presented greater value to shareholders than the one from Kohlberg, Kravis. **********But Stephen Waters, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said yesterday that the $69 offer was not a viable one when the final deliberations began. ''We specifically asked them if the $69 offer was on the table,'' he added. ''They said no, it is withdrawn, and we have a $62 proposal.'' **********Meanwhile, Jim Walter was busy preparing tender documents that will go to shareholders on Wednesday. ''A document will go out to shareholders in less than a week laying out the particulars of how this transpired and the facts of the agreement,'' David L. Townsend, a spokesman for Jim Walter, said. ''Until that time we cannot comment.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/23/business/market-turmoil-big-board-amex-set-shorter-hours.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Labaton", "pub_date": "1987-10-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1089, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Big Board, Amex Set Shorter Hours", "print_headline": "MARKET TURMOIL; Big Board, Amex Set Shorter Hours", "body_text": " **********The New York and American stock exchanges, responding to the frenzied pace of trading, announced yesterday that they would shorten their hours today, Monday and Tuesday, halting at 2 P.M. instead of 4 P.M. **********The Chicago Board Options Exchange also said it would close two hours early on those days. Other markets are expected to follow, including the over-the-counter market. **********The crush of business this week will also mean that workers at the New York and American exchanges will be called in over the weekend to help clear out the paperwork that backs up each trade. **********The decisions were an enormous relief to Washington and to many of the investment houses, which had been under heavy strain from the wild fluctuations plaguing the market and the avalanche of trading activity. Since Friday, volume on the Big Board alone has topped 2.3 billion shares, nearly as much as was traded in all of 1967, and leading indexes of the markets have closed lower on five of the last seven trading days. **********''The system needs time to catch its breath,'' said John J. Phelan Jr., chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, at a hastily arranged news conference yesterday. He said any further decisions to curtail trading later next week would be made ''on a day-to-day basis.'' **********While the market was open, the New York Stock Exchange also announced that it had curbed certain program trading. Requests of Members Cited **********Mr. Phelan said that the markets ''behaved extraordinarily'' in the face of unprecedented trading activity but that during the past few days member firms had requested shortened trading days. He said Thursday's trading had shown signs of ''being less volatile.'' But he also said there were ''at least three or four Congressional investigations under way'' on the origins of the selloff and that the Securities and Exchange Commission would also explore trading problems. **********Major brokerage houses also announced that they expected their staffs to report to work on Saturday to help with the backlog. **********Merrill Lynch & Company, E.F. Hutton Group Inc. and Shearson Lehman Brothers said they would also extend the hours of their branch offices this weekend to respond to investor inquiries. **********''I asked that the exchanges be closed,'' said Nathan Gantcher, president of Oppenheimer & Company. ''I just think the people physically cannot take what's happening. The system is not built to handle the things that have happened in the past few days. At the rate it was going, it was going to kill people. Those people it did not kill, they would be making a lot more mistakes.'' **********One problem pointed out by Mr. Phelan concerns what traders call making comparisons. The so-called back-office procedure works when buyers and sellers of the same trade compare notes on what each side did. But problems can arise, for instance, when one trader thinks that he has sold 10,000 shares of Exxon, while the buyer from a different firm assumes he has bought 10,000 shares of American Express. **********Despite some feeling that the shorter hours should not be allowed to continue too long, money managers endorsed the move. **********''I think it's a great idea,'' said Charles R. Utoft, trading director of I.D.S. Financial Services, the mutual fund arm of the American Express Company. ''Everybody kind of needs a rest.'' **********Still, Jefferies & Company of Los Angeles, which provides a ''third market'' for trading when the exchanges are closed, said it would offer that service as usual today, Monday and Tuesday. A Balancing Act **********Directors of the New York Stock Exchange met yesterday morning to decide how best to handle the enormous volume and volatility of the market in the past week. **********''The board felt that it had a certain amount of balancing to do,'' said Roberta S. Karmel, one of the directors. ''There is always a fear that given the general nervousness of the world, that this could somehow trigger a greater nervousness. But we had to balance that with the orderly settlement of these transactions.'' **********Mr. Phelan, who ultimately made the decision to curtail trading, has been in touch with Government officials at the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. He is also said to have discussed curbing hours with senior officials at the White House. **********At his news conference last night, President Reagan said he had approved the move. And immediately after the exchange's announcement was made, it was endorsed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********The move to curtail hours is not without precedent. In the 1960's, the New York and American exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers, which is responsible for the over-the-counter market, cut trading time and, during the summer of 1968, even closed the markets for four days to clean up logjams. Saturday paperwork sessions were introduced in the 1980's during periods of heavy volume. The New York exchange also shortened trading days in the 1970's, when it suffered problems while it changed to a computerized system. Problems Seem Even Worse **********But this week's problems seemed worse. At certain points the market reporting system was two hours late. Many investors have complained that they have been unable to reach their brokers.

But as the local butcher put it, nobody could have been expected to recognize her. **********''Sure,'' a local policeman said, ''we were instructed to be on the lookout'' for Ms. Menigon and Jean-Marc Rouillan, two of France's most wanted terrorist suspects, ''because it's well known that the forests around here would be ideal hiding places. But, you know, it's not easy. For us they seemed to be just another couple from Paris with a country house.'' **********Ms. Menigon and Mr. Rouillan, the two leading members of the French urban guerrilla group Direct Action, were captured here Saturday night along with two other members. The arrests were carried out in a police raid on an isolated farmhouse on the edge of Vitry-aux-Loges, where the couple had lived for three years. **********In the end, according to investigators, Mr. Rouillan and Ms. Menigon were turned in by an informant who telephoned the police, giving them the exact location of the farmhouse here. The investigators said the informant received a reward, posted some months ago, of nearly $180,000. **********Perhaps more surprising than the arrests was that Ms. Menigon and Mr. Rouillan - objects of one of France's most intense police searches - were able to live more or less openly here as long as they did. The village, 20 miles east of Orleans, is not far from some of the Loire valley's noted chateaus, although it is relatively obscure itself. **********The villagers say Mr. Rouillan and Ms. Menigon, who called themselves Robert and Nadine, blended in so well that nobody, including the members of the local gendarmerie, ever suspected them of being fugitives. **********''There are 5,500 country houses in the township,'' said a local police officer, standing across a pasture from the long, low-slung farmhouse, backed by clumps of trees, where the couple lived. ''And there are only 10 policemen.'' The local butcher said of Ms. Menigon: ''I think I saw her once or twice, but I didn't know it was her. She doesn't look like her picture.'' **********Somewhat faded black-and-white photographs of Ms. Menigon and Joelle Aubron, who was also arrested on Saturday, have been posted in some 80,000 public places in France since November, after Direct Action took responsibility for the slaying of Georges Besse, the chairman of Renault, in front of his home in Paris. The two women are suspected by police of having carried out the killing. **********The identity of the informant who telephoned the police has not been disclosed, but he is assumed to have been in the small circle of friends and supporters that have surrounded Direct Action since it emerged in 1979. **********After the informant's call, an anti-terrorist squad observed the farmhouse with binoculars from across fields and surrounding woodland. After 36 hours, when two other members of the group, Georges Cipriani and Ms. Aubron, turned up on Saturday night, several dozen officers moved in to capture all four without firing a shot. **********Both Mr. Rouillan and Ms. Menigon have been in police hands before. The two were arrested in May 1980 when the police lured them into a trap after Direct Action had carried out several bomb attacks against Government and corporate buildings. Mr. Rouillan gave up without a struggle, but Ms. Menigon, shouting ''I am Direct Action,'' emptied two .45-caliber pistols in the direction of the police. She missed. #16 Freed Under Amnesty A year later, as part of a general amnesty, the newly elected Socialist Government freed 16 imprisoned members of Direct Action, including Mr. Rouillan. Ms. Menigon, because she had shot at the police, was not included, but she was released several months later after a three-week hunger strike. **********Two reasons were given for the amnesty: the group's attacks had not at that point caused any casualties, and the Socialists believed that a gesture toward radicals would deter them from resuming terrorist activities. **********But investigators say Mr. Rouillan has told his interrogators that he resumed his activities almost immediately because he preferred the life of a guerrilla to legal political activity. **********Mr. Rouillan, who is 34 years old, has long been a radical leftist. In the early 1970's he founded the Internationalist Group for Revolutionary Action, which carried out bomb attacks in Paris. **********In 1977, after three years in jail, he met Ms. Menigon, a bank clerk with radical political views. They formed Direct Action in 1979, bringing together several underground splinter groups. A Close Call in Belgium **********In 1982, after their release from prison, the Government formally banned Direct Action and the two went into hiding. In early 1984 the police spotted them crossing into Belgium. The Belgian police picked up the trail, but Mr. Rouillan and Ms. Menigon escaped by taking a policeman hostage. **********In the meantime, Direct Action's attacks became more deadly. In addition to the killing of Mr. Besse, it took reponsibility for the killing of a French Army general, Rene Audran, in January 1985, and a bombing at a Paris police headquarters last July that killed an officer and wounded 22 others. **********According to residents of Vitry-aux-Loges, including two farm families who lived within sight of the farm where Mr. Rouillan and Ms. Menigon lived, the two of them were quiet and polite but distant and little seen. **********Neighbors say Ms. Menigon, 29, raised two goats and several hamsters. At one point she helped to care for the aging grandmother of one of her neighbors. She told them that she was a Belgian citizen and had worked as a Government researcher. They rented the farmhouse for $600 a month from its owners, who lived in Paris. **********''She was adorable with Grandma,'' a neighbor told Le Monde. ''She liked animals. I would never have thought her capable of killing. She had me sign a paper saying I would take care of her two goats, Lucy and Nova, if anything happened to her.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/27/business/about-real-estate-congregatecare-project-in-yonkers-for-the-elderly.html": {"writer_name": "Diana Shaman", "pub_date": "1987-11-27", "snippet": "LEAD: It is more fitting than it might seem that a three-acre site in Yonkers once occupied by a secondary school should be developed as an apartment complex for the elderly.", "word_count": 828, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ABOUT REAL ESTATE;\n'CONGREGATE-CARE' PROJECT IN YONKERS FOR THE ELDERLY", "print_headline": "ABOUT REAL ESTATE;\n'CONGREGATE-CARE' PROJECT IN YONKERS FOR THE ELDERLY", "body_text": " **********LEAD: It is more fitting than it might seem that a three-acre site in Yonkers once occupied by a secondary school should be developed as an apartment complex for the elderly. **********It is more fitting than it might seem that a three-acre site in Yonkers once occupied by a secondary school should be developed as an apartment complex for the elderly. **********River Towers, a $35 million, 208-unit luxury apartment house that is to be constructed on the site, has been designed for healthy old people who are active and young at heart. **********What Noah Berley, a Brooklyn developer, has in mind for the property, which is on Riverdale Avenue and meanders over the New York City line into Riverdale, is a residence for people in their 70's who wish to live independently in their own apartment but have central dining facilities and on-site opportunities for recreation and social events. **********Such ''congregate-care'' projects have become popular housing alternatives for older people elsewhere in the country. But River Towers will be one of the first of its kind in the metropolitan area. A similar luxury complex is under construction in Plainview, L.I., by Darren Enterprises of Plainview, and others are planned in Brookhaven, L.I. **********''We expect to fill a vacuum in the market, by appealing to people who want the companionship of their contempories and who are interested in doing and learning and participating,'' Mr. Berley said. ''This is not a nursing home. You have to be capable of independent living.'' **********Construction of the building is expected to start in the spring and will take about 18 months to complete. Because it is an as-of-right project, requiring no variances or city assistance, it will not be affected by a Federal court order that has postponed other Yonkers real estate projects. **********One reason that developments of the kind Mr. Berley is planning have lagged has been the difficulty of finding suitable sites, he said. Proximity to transportation and location in a good neighborhood are essential. **********''This is the best kind of location because it's full of activity, young people, life, and a sense of neighborhood,'' he said, indicating with a sweep of his arm the campus of the College of Mount St. Vincent, a small liberal arts college adjoining his property. **********The new residential tower will sit on a hill overlooking the Hudson and Palisades, shielded from urban congestion by a greenbelt of trees and small public park to the west and by the college campus to the south. But it will also be in the mainstream. At its doorstep will be Riverdale Avenue, with shopping within walking distance, and public bus service to midtown Manhattan. **********The L-shaped, 12-story building will have a red brick facade with precast concrete trim. It will contain a mix of studios and one- and two-bedroom apartments. The units will vary in size from 378 square feet for a studio to 938 square feet for a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment. **********Rents will start at $2,500 monthly for a studio and will range up to $3,800 monthly for a two-bedroom unit. The price will include two meals a day, social activities including trips, housekeeping services and some laundry service. A couple would pay an additional $350 a month. To meet those rents, tenants would need an annual income of $35,000 to $45,000. **********The architects are Samuel and David J. Paul of Forest Hills, Queens. What they want to achieve with their design, David Paul said, is a dynamic flow between common areas that will encourage residents to mingle. **********The focus of the building will be toward a landscaped rear garden with paths and sitting areas. Terraces will lead to the garden from the dining room and lounges, which will be on the first floor adjoining the main lobby. A card room and a snack bar will also be on the main floor. Each of the upper floors will have a lounge area. Apartments, on the second floor will be reserved for people who may need help with dressing and personal care. **********A 23,000-square-foot lower level will be the center for social and recreational activities. It will contain an auditorium, library, rooms for arts and crafts and an exercise and physical therapy center. There will also be a beauty salon, a convenience store and a bank branch. **********On Long Island the Greenbriar in Plainview is similar in concept to River Towers. The Greenbriar is already under construction, with occupancy to begin early next year. Rents have not yet been established, said Donald Monti, the president of Darren Enterprises. The 150,000-square foot building will contain 100 studio and one-bedroom apartments. Amenities will include and indoor pool and an outdoor pool. **********Other such projects are in the early planning stages in Brookhaven, after new zoning was adopted last summer by the Long Island town. **********''There is a real need out here that we want to encourage developers to meet,'' said Thomas Cramer, the town's deputy commissioner of planning, environment and development. **********Developers of projects that provide congregate facilities and meet Brookhaven's guidelines will be permitted a density of 20 units to the acre, almost double the density allowed under other zoning categories."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/31/world/4300-opponents-of-regime-reported-held-in-bangladesh.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 155, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "4,300 Opponents of Regime Reported Held in Bangladesh", "print_headline": "4,300 Opponents of Regime Reported Held in Bangladesh", "body_text": " **********Security forces have detained 4,300 opposition leaders and workers in a five-day sweep intended to silence demands that President H.

''You have to suspect that they found everything they wanted to know.'' **********The Russians' first priority would probably have been to photograph the surroundings and available documents, and to try to figure out what coding devices were being used. **********''In short, the first thing you would do would be to go after everything that eavesdropping cannot get you,'' Mr. Murray said. **********Nevertheless, Mr. Murray and others in his field believe that Soviet agents would also have exploited their access to plant surveillance devices. 'There Are Thousands of Ways' **********''There are thousands of ways to bug a building like the embassy,'' a Pennsylvania security expert said. ''The two sides are close technologically speaking, but the war is not won electronically. It depends on the ingenuity and sneakiness of the spies. By letting them get such a clear picture of where to focus their efforts, we have given them a huge advantage.'' **********The simplest bugs act as microphones or tiny transmitters and can be attached to equipment, furniture or decorations. These devices, which can be attached to wires thinner than a human hair, have been miniaturized to the point that the naked eye would be unlikely to notice them. **********''You are talking about things the size of a pinhead or grain of rice,'' said William Sharek, spokesman for Communication Control Systems Inc. of Portchester, N.Y., which has made debugging sweeps at embassies. **********A bug can be a simple passive device, such as a thin metal, glass or plastic membrane that vibrates with the sound of voices or typewriter keys. The device can be read by an outside power source, which might be anything from a microwave beam to laser light. A Mixture of Energy Waves **********The beam reflected from the bug is a mixture of the waves of energy from the power source and the pattern of vibrations caused by sound waves in the room. When the signal is received. computers break it down into its parts and enhance anything unusual for further study. **********Such passive systems have drawbacks. The information can be garbled by competing noises, for instance, by equipment that randomly bangs water pipes. And laser systems fail when window shades are drawn. **********The windows themselves vibrate with conversations, but the patterns are often disrupted by outside sounds and by deformities in the windows, which are often made with deliberate bulges. Moreover, sensitive embassy activities are transacted in specially shielded interior rooms. **********Some techniques rely on bugs with their own power source. Some have miniature batteries. Others tap into the building's power sources. The bugs broadcast a signal on a radio or microwave frequency on which sounds in the room are superimposed. But the smallest bugs tend to have limited range and all are vulnerable to discovery. Advanced Detector Described **********The most advanced detector, known as a nonlinear junction detector, is a box attached to a boom and antenna and is used to beam microwaves at surfaces that may have been bugged. The bug's transmitter echoes back with a signal at twice the frequency when struck. **********The detector can be countered by covering the transmitters with copper shielding or, more recently, by switching to fiber optics. The microscopic filaments of glass fiber can be connected to an infrared transmitter on an outside surface. **********''It could be disguised as a brick,'' said Samuel W. Daskam, president of Information Security Associates of Stamford, Conn., a manufacturer of nonlinear junction devices. ''It is a real pain to detect.'' **********Another twist is to equip the bug with the ability to record information, perhaps in digital form, and to transmit it only when told to do so by an external signal or an internal program to minimize discovery. **********Such short-burst transmissions are used by American and Soviet embassies to communicate with satellites and are described by security experts as all but impossible to intercept. Typewriter Episode Recalled In previous Moscow bugging episodes, in 1984, the Americans discovered that the Russians had mounted bugs inside the hollow frames of IBM typewriters and that the bigs magnetically recorded what was being typed and transmitted the information through electrical wires in bursts. **********The bugging apparently occurred when the typewriters were being delivered to the embassy as ordinary cargo, either by actually installing devices in the typewriters or by substituting bugged typewriters for those orderd by the embassy. **********In gaining access to the embassy in the most recent episode, the Russians would have been able to form a clear picture of which objects would be the best targets for such switching operations. They also would have had the opportunity to design bugs for them that would be hard to detect unless debugging experts knew where to look. **********For example, one counterintelligence expert said he had encountered a thin receiver capable of picking up telephone conversations embedded between plastic layers in the casing around a telephone jack. Debuggers would need X-rays or some other technology for subsurface probing to discover such bugs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/16/business/advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1987-10-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 44, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; People", "print_headline": "Advertising; People", "body_text": " *********** Paul Kurnit and Leonard Leokum have been named chief operating officer and executive vice president/ creative director, respectively, at Griffin Bacal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/12/world/the-99-word-statute-that-may-trip-officials.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1987-05-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 843, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE 99-WORD STATUTE THAT MAY TRIP OFFICIALS", "print_headline": "THE 99-WORD STATUTE THAT MAY TRIP OFFICIALS", "body_text": " **********Buried in the hundreds of pages of the Federal Criminal Code is a 99-word conspiracy statute that law enforcement officials say may become the principal legal instrument in unraveling the Iran-contra affair. **********The law, which makes it a crime to conspire ''to commit any offense against the United States,'' will probably form the basis of new indictments brought by the special prosecutor in the case, Lawrence E. Walsh. **********The statute, labeled ''Conspiracy to Commit Offense or to Defraud the United States,'' is so broadly worded and has been so liberally interpreted over the last half-century that many current and former Reagan Administration officials are believed to be vulnerable to criminal charges. **********Two Washington fund-raisers who sought donations for the Nicaraguan rebels have already pleaded guilty under the conspiracy statute and agreed to cooperate with investigators. They named a co-conspirator: Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, the former National Security Council aide. Inquiry Is 'Accelerating' **********The statute was used to prosecute more than two dozen officials involved in the Watergate scandals, including President Nixon's two chief White House aides, John D. Ehrlichman and H. R. Haldeman. Mr. Nixon was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in covering up the Watergate break-in. **********Mr. Walsh, formally called an independent counsel, has talked very little about his legal strategy, although his aides have described the investigation as ''accelerating and expanding.'' **********Officials with knowledge of Mr. Walsh's plans say he is considering a variety of criminal charges, including perjury, obstruction of justice and theft of Government property. **********More important, they say, Mr. Walsh is apparently trying to prove that Administration officials joined in a conspiracy to violate Federal tax laws and Congressional restrictions on foreign arms sales and aid to the rebels, including the Boland Amendment. **********The amendment, named for Representative Edward P. Boland, Democrat of Massachusetts, barred American intelligence officials from offering aid of any kind to the rebels, known as the contras, from October 1984 to October 1986. No Criminal Penalties **********While the amendment carried no criminal penalties, prosecutors could charge that the officials misused Government authority by joining - conspiring - to undermine the will of Congress. **********Recent evidence suggests that Reagan Administration officials did seek ways to provide possibly illegal military aid to the contras. **********Asked to speculate what could happen under the wide scope of the conspiracy law, legal specialists said even President Reagan and Vice President Bush had reason to fear criminal charges in the Iran-contra affair. (There is no indication that Mr. Walsh is considering action against either man.) ''The fact is that once you start out on a conspiracy strategy, a lot of people can be brought in by connection or reference or statements of a co-conspirator,'' said Samuel Dash, a Georgetown University law professor who was chief counsel to the Senate committee that investigated the Watergate affair. Law Called Too Broad **********There has long been criticism that the conspiracy law is too broad and can be used unfairly. **********Under the statute, suspects can be prosecuted for joining in a conspiracy even if little was done to carry it out. Penalties under the law can be tough: up to five years in prison for conviction on each felony count. **********Mr. Dash noted that the statute's origins are in English common law. ''Back then,'' he said, ''you didn't even have to prove that what people were conspiring to do was a crime, so long as it was somehow harmful to the public good.'' **********The law can still be broadly applied. In a conspiracy case today, prosecutors need to show that at least two people joined and agreed to violate Federal law or misuse Government authority, and that some action was taken to carry out the plan. The act itself need not be criminal. **********Prosecutors appreciate the law's flexibility. The acts of one conspirator can be used as evidence of the guilt of any other conspirator. Two Implicate North **********Colonel North has been named as part of a tax conspiracy that helped funnel illegal military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. **********He was implicated by the two fund-raisers, Carl R. Channell and Richard R. Miller, who have already pleaded guilty. Mr. Channell and Mr. Miller confessed that they had sought millions of dollars in tax-deductible contributions for the entirely nondeductible purpose of arming the contras. **********If prosecutors can prove that Colonel North was part of the agreement to violate tax laws, it is possible that he could be convicted strictly on the basis of acts by Mr. Channell and Mr. Miller. **********''Mr. Walsh has a lot of freedom in this,'' said Philip B.

It was hit in a French air attack last February after what the French called Libyan-supported attacks south of the Red Line. **********The Libyan raids on Sunday, which were reported to have killed one person and wounded four, were militarily insignificant, French analysts said. They were termed a ''mosquito bite'' by Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, but there were nonetheless seen here as a provocation by the Libyans in defiance of warnings by France that it would reply to any military moves south of the Red Line. **********In a radio interview here Tuesday, Mr. Chirac said the Libyan raid on Sunday ''could not remain without a response from France.'' He called French policy ''neither hesitation nor a wish for escalation,'' but he said ''France will be respected by Libya.'' **********Mr. Habre's Government, capitalizing on the rupture between Libya and the former rebels led by Mr. Goukouni, launched an offensive roughly three weeks ago in an effort to put the northern half of the country under Chadian control. Government spokesmen in Ndjamena claimed earlier this week to have captured the northern oasis town of Fada from the Libyans, although there was no independent confirmation of this. **********Government officials in Ndjamena have claimed that about 100 Libyan soldiers have been captured in recent fighting, and yesterday in Ndjamena 22 captives were paraded before angry crowds who pelted them with stones. **********Libya's raid on Sunday south of the Red Line was seen as a response to its losses on the ground to Chadian forces. **********France has rejected requests by Mr. Habre that it join in the offensive but both France and the United States have supported the move by airlifting military supplies to the Chadian forces. **********Agence France-Presse reported here today that two American C-141 transport planes loaded with jeeps and trucks took off from an airport in the western French city of Nantes and were believed to be headed for Chad. **********Mr. Goukouni and Mr. Habre were originally allies in the Chad National Liberation Front, a northern-based Arab rebel group known as Frolinat that had Libyan support, but broke with each other in 1976.

The pilot appeared to be dead. **********Within seconds, Mr. Randall recalled, the plane was swallowed by the water late Saturday night and ''we were four people alone in the sea.'' Battled the Thrashing Sea **********For the next 36 hours, Mr. Randall and his daughter, who live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, battled the thrashing sea, an unrelenting tropical sun and their own fears before Haitian villagers caught sight of them bobbing, battered and delirious, a few hundred yards off the southwestern tip of Haiti. **********United States Coast Guard rescue crews have been unable to find the two women, Anna Rivera, 41, of Manhattan and Delia Clarke, 38, of Ledyard, Conn. The Coast Guard stopped searching late Thursday afternoon, but resumed its efforts this morning after an inquiry from a member of Congress. **********As night fell last Sunday, a wild storm blew up, tearing Mr. Randall and his daughter apart, with her floating in the lone life jacket they had been sharing. It was the last they saw of each other until they were fished out of the sea 15 hours later. Mr. Randall said he had thought his daughter was dead.

I tried to do that.'' **********The four Americans had been vacationing at the Club Med in Haiti - it was a birthday trip for Ariane - and when their American Airlines flight to New York on Saturday was canceled because of anti-Government protests, they decided to charter a small twin-engine plane to the Dominican Republic. The pilot, Elias Katime, became disoriented and flew west instead of east toward Santo Domingo. Eventually, they ran out of gas. Reluctant to Question Pilot **********Mr. Randall, whose wife, Laura, an economics professor at Hunter College, was researching a book in Mexico, said he could see the constellations in the dark sky and realized the plane was going the wrong way. But he said that he believed the pilot spoke only Spanish and that one of the women who knew the language was reluctant to question the pilot. **********For the first seven hours in the water, the four Americans clung together. As the plane was going down, the pilot tossed his life jacket to Mr. Randall, who strapped it on his daughter, hoisted her onto his lap and held onto her. There was one other jacket for the two women. **********Somehow, Mr. Randall said, they managed to contain their hysteria. No one screamed or cried. Ariane got seasick. Sea Snails Left Welts **********They were all terrified of sharks and they agreed, Mr. Randall said, ''not to mention fins.'' **********They never saw any sharks. The worst creatures they had to contend with were sea snails that left welts on their legs like horsefly bites. **********As dawn broke the first morning, at sea, the four Americans saw a strip of land on the horizon that proved to be Haiti. One of the American women was a poor swimmer. The other had suffered a broken arm and a concussion. **********''We had a terrible decision to make,'' Mr. Randall said. ''Could two of us swim and try for the coast or should all of us try and stay together and hope that some one would find us?'' **********''If two of us went,'' said Ariane, ''we would come back with a boat. We thought the land was a lot closer.'' **********Finally, father and daughter decided to go. They had the blessing of the two others, Mr. Randall said. But, he added of one of the women: ''I can't say she really wanted us to go.

She appealed for a ''large majority'' from what she described as a country newly united in middle-class prosperity by her ''popular capitalism.'' **********''Home ownership, second pensions, share ownership, choice in education -all these were once the privileges of the few,'' she said. ''They are now being extended to the many.'' **********The polls indicate that there is enough potency in this message - and enough nervousness about Labor's plan to scrap Britain's nuclear weapons - to give Mrs. Thatcher a third consecutive term as Prime Minister when Britons vote Thursday in 650 parliamentary constituencies. Reduced Majority Predicted **********The latest poll, by Robert M. Worcester of MORI, put the Conservatives at 44 percent, Labor at 32 and the Alliances parties at 22. Such a breakdown in the popular vote would give Mrs. Thatcher a reduced majority in the House of Commons, down to about 100 seats from the 144-seat majority she gained in 1983. **********Other late polls have put Mrs. Thatcher's lead at only half that, and Neil Kinnock, the Labor leader, predicted today that late shifts in the marginal constituencies would yield ''massive gains for the Labor Party, which will be enough to give us government.'' In a typical finale to his energetic campaign, Mr. Kinnock said Mrs. Thatcher's claims of prosperity amounted, in the face of 11 percent unemployment, ''to the self-deluding vanity of a fading empress and her courtiers.'' **********Both major parties asserted today that the election could deal a crippling, perhaps deadly blow to the Alliance, a centrist political coalition formed by the Liberals and the Social Democrats in 1981. Capping a dispirited campaign, David Steel of the Liberal Party, held out hope of a ''very late'' surge toward the Alliance. But analysts agreed that the Alliance performance had exposed strains in its dual leadership - Mr. Steel and Dr. David Owen of the Social Democratic Party - and raised questions about its ability to continue. **********But the main area of speculation today had to do with the conduct of the Tory campaign. It is a question of such sensitivity that when it arose today, Norman Tebbit, the Conservative Party chairman, who joined Mrs. Thatcher at her news conference, reacted like a man trying to stamp out a fire on an expensive carpet. **********''Shall we assess the campaigns on Friday?'' he said sharply, maintaining that the expected Thatcher victory would answer all criticism. But a variety of Conservative officials and independent commentators disagreed, saying that the unevenness of the Thatcher campaign has raised questions about her heretofore unassailable dominance of the British political scene and about the viability of her dream of going ''on and on'' until the end of the century. **********Two influential columnists, Peter Jenkins of The Independent and Geoffrey Smith of The Times of London, concluded today that this campaign had dimmed rather than enhanced Mrs. Thatcher's prospects of a fourth term. ''The Conservatives have run a rather lackluster campaign,'' acknowledged Robert D. Waller of Harris Research, a poll taker for the Conservatives.

'Too Many Cooks' **********In any event, accounts from several sources provide a behind-the-scenes glimpse of a Conservative organization that saw itself as hobbling unhappily toward victory and being second-guessed every step of the way by an anxiously autocratic Mrs. Thatcher. **********''The truth is we've had too many cooks,'' said one official. ''It's not been a happy campaign.'' According to several people, the trouble began early, when Mrs. Thatcher got cold feet about the ability of Mr. Tebbit, a believer in the ideological bludgeon, to manage a nuanced campaign. **********On Mrs. Thatcher's orders, Lord Young, the Employment Secretary, was sent into Conservative Central Office to oversee the Prime Minister's campaign schedule. John Wakeham, the Tory whip and a rival of Mr. Tebbit to succeed Mrs. Thatcher, was assigned to oversee television. **********Another problem was late-night telephone calls to Mrs. Thatcher from outside advisers that put her into a ''frenzy'' of unhappiness over management of her campaign. At one point, she personally ordered three recuttings of a campaign film within 72 hours. **********Mrs. Thatcher's rating in the polls stayed remarkably steady despite the disarray behind the scenes.

Dutton, another retired Air Force officer involved in the contra supply network; Robert W. Owen, a former Senate aide who served as Colonel North's link with the contras; and Fawn Hall, Colonel North's White House secretary. **********Earlier this year Congress granted limited immunity from prosecution to Colonel Gadd in exchange for his cooperation with the Congressional inquiry.

Colonel Gadd added, ''I was told to protect both his name and the White House.'' **********In October 1985, Colonel Gadd said, he met with Colonel North and was asked by the White House aide to study the feasibility of creating a secret contra airfield in Costa Rica. Also at that meeting, the colonel said, were General Secord and his business partner, Albert Hakim. **********According to his account, Colonel North asked General Secord to arrange a $150,000 advance to Colonel Gadd to cover the initial expenses for building the airfield.

A quarter of its people are from the poorest and lowest castes and aboriginal tribes. **********In India, nearly 40 percent of the people are said to have incomes below the official poverty line of $500 a year for a family of four.

Hunger and malnutrition are rampant also in Orissa and West Bengal states, as well as in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh. **********For this entire area, India's antipoverty strategy under Prime Minister Gandhi is twofold: to rely on the private sector to create jobs, and to use increasing Government revenue for investment in poverty programs and infrastructure in places like Bihar. **********Since 1980, India has achieved an economic growth rate of 4 percent to 5 percent, its highest since independence in 1947.

It reported $2.5 billion in sales last year and operating income of $147 million. The company manufactures confectionaries, snacks, processed meats, beverages and other food products and is engaged in wholesale and retail distribution of food, groceries and household products. **********TLC will own 55 percent of the business, which would make it the largest black-owned company in the country in annual revenue.

In a leveraged buyout, a company's cash flow is used to repay the debt taken on to finance its purchase. **********People familiar with the transaction said the management of Beatrice's international food business would have a small stake in the new company.

In three years, TLC has grown from an investment group with $1 million in equity to majority owner of one of the largest international food businesses. **********Mr. Lewis formed the TLC Group to acquire other companies. Its most notable deal previously was the purchase of the McCall Pattern Company, a maker of sewing patterns. TLC purchased McCall for $1 million in 1984 and sold it last month for $90 million to the John Crowther Group, a British textile conglomerate. **********The Beatrice transaction makes Mr. Lewis a much more prominent player on Wall Street. **********Before selling McCall, TLC was ranked sixth on Black Enterprise magazine's list of the nation's largest black-owned companies. With the acquisition of a controlling interest in Beatrice's international food business, TLC would far outpace what has previously been the nation's largest black-owned business, the Johnson Publishing Company.

That deal would also be structured as a leveraged buyout by the Onex Corporation, Canada's largest leveraged buyout group, and the management of Beatrice Canada. TLC will retain a 20 percent interest, the companies said. **********The Canadian company had 1986 sales of $367 million and operating income of $27 million, accounting to about 18 percent of Beatrice International Food's operating profit. **********Mr. Lewis's group said it planned to sell other units of Beatrice International Food, possibly those in South America and Australia. TLC said it would retain Beatrice's core businesses in Europe, which last year accounted for $1.7 billion in sales and $98 million, or about 67 percent, of the food company's operating earnings. **********Completion of the sale, which TLC and Drexel said was expected by Oct. 1, is subject to approval by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and some foreign governments in countries where the company operates. **********BCI Holdings will use the proceeds from the sale to reduce the debt it incurred last year from its acquisition of the Beatrice Companies, which went private in a $6.2 billion leveraged buyout organized by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company. Brand Names Kept Private **********Beatrice has since said it would spin off a consumer products and specialty foods company to the public while keeping its brand-name foods company private. **********In May, Beatrice said the new public company, to be called E-II Holdings Inc., would consist of its nonfood operations, including Samsonite luggage and the Culligan water-treatment service, as well as its specialty-foods businesses, such as Aunt Nellie's pickles. **********E-II Holdings is expected to have sales of $1.57 billion, compared with Beatrice's total sales of $8.93 billion in the fiscal year ended Feb. 28. **********There had been much speculation about what the company would do with its international food business. A year ago, Beatrice said it was considering spinning off its international food group into a separate corporation and offering stock to the public. But so such plan materialized. Billions in Assets Sold **********Beatrice officials said later that they had held discussions with several parties, including the Pillsbury Company, but talks broke down. **********Since it went private in April, Beatrice has sold more than $3.6 billion of its assets, including the Avis Inc. car rental unit, Coca-Cola bottling operations and International Playtex Inc.. **********After the spinoff and the sale of the international food business, BCI Holdings will consist of most of Beatrice's current domestic and international food businesses. Its brands include Tropicana fruit juice, Peter Pan peanut butter and Orville Redenbacher's popcorn. **********Mr. Lewis began searching for acquisitions after the sale of McCall, which left him with an abundance of cash. **********''The things he was able to do at McCall, coupled with his creativity, made it easy for us to decide to participate in this with him, '' said Dean C.

The statement was carried under a banner headline on the front page of the official Sandinista newspaper, Barricada, last Nov. 20. **********Reacting to that announcement, opposition leaders began preparing for a campaign.

He said it was not certain whether mayors would be directly elected or chosen by councilors. **********Mr. Ramirez said the Sandinistas would present candidates in every municipality. **********''In local elections it is important to have candidates who are respected, and we are going to consider each case separately,'' he said. ''We expect to come up with good candidates.'' Sandinista Victory Predicted **********''As a member of the Sandinista Front,'' he added, ''I would have to predict that the Sandinista Front is in a position to win the large majority of municipalities.'' **********Whenever local elections are held, much attention would certainly focus on the campaign in Managua. Mr. Ramirez for the first time suggested that the current Sandinista Mayor, Moises Hassan Morales, a former mathematics professor who holds a doctorate from North Carolina State University, was likely to be the party's standard-bearer in the capital. **********''I personally think that Moises Hassan is a good candidate, a person known for leadership,'' the Vice President said. ''I don't see how we could lose in Managua.' **********Municipal governments have been run by appointed officials since the Sandinista takeover in 1979, and Mr. Ramirez said a change was needed. **********''The system of hand-picking people from Managua has unfortunately led to a reduction in the authority of local governments and their ability to get things done,'' he said. **********On another matter, Mr. Ramirez dismissed recent statements by American officials portraying rebel groups as growing in strength to the point where they may be able to topple the Government. **********''The counterrevolutionaries are having trouble finding recruits and are not doing well,'' Mr. Ramirez said.

They note, for instance, that the import totals have been swollen by price increases that conceal an underlyingshift favorable to the United States. Over the last 12 months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, import prices have risen by 14.5 percent while export prices have gone up a much more modest 3.3 percent. **********Thus, if the $15.7 billion deficit reported on Wednesday had been calculated with 1986 prices for imports and exports, the number would have been a much improved $12 billion, said Robert Ortner, the Commerce Under Secretary for Economic Affairs. **********''Trade has already begun to contribute to real economic growth and jobs,'' Mr. Ortner said. ''The darned trouble is that price increases are still very big in imports, covering up the underlying shift and disturbing financial markets.'' Slow Economic Growth **********Nonetheless, persistent problems are still holding back the faster export growth that will be needed to solve the trade problem. For one thing, economic growth in many world markets is just too slow to generate a thirst for American goods. For instance, austerity programs have cut demand in the debt-strapped developing countries that normally take a third of American exports. **********Moreover, West Germany and Japan have placed their priorities on cutting inflation and reducing fiscal deficits. These moves have weakened consumption, causing a decline in American exports despite more competitive pricing. So far this year, American sales to Japan have fallen by 4 percent. This weak consumption comes on top of persistent regulatory problems in penetrating Japan and other protected markets. **********As part of its strategy to reduce the trade deficit, the Administration engineered a sharp drop in the international value of the dollar, causing imports to rise in price and making American exports more competitive. **********The dollar, as measured against many major currencies, is now 40 to 50 percent below its level when it started on its downward course in February 1985. In theory, that much devaluation should have spurred export sales because the dollar price of American goods has become cheaper when calculated in foreign currencies. Both Imports and Exports Rise **********But the lower-priced dollar has not yet had the trade impact that many experts expected. To be sure, overall exports are higher than they were last year. They have rested on a plateau for the last six months at slightly more than $20 billion. But imports are higher as well, averaging around $35 billion in recent months. **********The dollar has not fallen much, however, against the currencies of some very important trading partners. In fact, the trade deficit has worsened most with the countries that have been the biggest markets for American exports. These include such newly industrialized Asian countries as Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong. **********American exports to these countries rose by 16 percent this year, but imports from them are up by 19 percent. **********One reason why their products are selling so well in the United States is that these countries have refused to permit their currencies to rise significantly against the dollar. As a result, their prices have not gone up dramatically in the United States. Displacing the Japanese **********Analysts said these countries' exports to the United States are displacing products from Japan, whose yen has appreciated against the dollar by about 50 percent in the last two years. **********A similar trade situation exists in Mexico, where exports are up 12 percent, but imports have risen by 14 percent. **********In other Latin American countries, exports are down from last year's levels because of new financial problems associated with their crushing debt burdens. **********In the oil-exporting countries, American exports have been hurt by falling demand, while American imports are rising in dollar terms primarily because of increased oil prices. In the first half of 1987, the deficit with these countries worsened by $2 billion. **********In a report to the National Association of Manufacturers, Stephen L. Cooney, an N.A.M. economist, predicted that the United States would improve its trade balance with Canada and Europe. But, he said, the American trade balance would remain stable with Japan and worsen with other regions. Rising American Exports **********Despite the disappointments, economists report that in volume terms American exports so far this year have risen by about 12 to 15 percent, or about three to four times the growth rate for world trade. **********''That's not a bad record,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, ''but considerably more is needed.'' **********He has called on both Europe and Japan to stimulate domestic demand by 2 percent over where it is now. Should such action be taken, he said, it would reduce the American trade deficit by $40 billion a year. **********Many analysts say that the most effective way to redress the trade deficit is by increasing exports of American manufacturers. **********In 1980 the United States ran a $5 billion surplus in manufacturing trade, while last year the deficit was around $125 billion. **********''There is no way the trade deficit can improve without a pickup in manufacturing,'' said C.

The letters are both a courtesy and a threat - a courtesy to defense lawyers and a final threat to their clients: cooperate now or face charges. Whether indictments may come within days, weeks or months is not clear because different prosecutors send target notices at different points. **********Law-enforcement officials have said previously that Admiral Poindexter, Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North and others were under investigation on charges that they conspired to violate a host of Federal laws, including statutes involving obstruction of justice and aid to Nicaraguan rebel groups.

But in the space of a few days, it forced into public view the angry divisions within the Church of England over theology and clerical promotions. **********On Monday, Dr. Gareth V. Bennett, a conservative Anglican priest and Oxford don, killed himself. Twenty-four hours later, church officials reluctantly confirmed that Dr. Bennett was the author of an anonymous attack on the Archbishop of Canterbury that was published last Thursday as the preface to the new issue of Crockford's Clerical Directory, the church's who's who. **********On Thursday, the church's powerful policy committee will convene to try to sort things out. Church officials say they may reprimand two high-level lay employees for allowing Dr. Bennett to use a church publication to criticize the Archbishop, Dr. Robert Runcie, and a ''liberal establishment'' that Dr. Bennett said was leading the church astray on issues like homosexuality and ordination of women. **********Also up for debate at the meeting on Thursday will be the longstanding custom of printing an anonymous essay on the state of the church in the opening pages of the church directory. Some priests, deeply shaken by the 58-year-old bachelor's suicide, see the practice as tainted because it has brought death and division to the church. Hailed by Traditionalists **********But no one expects a quick resolution to the deeper questions of why Dr. Bennett killed himself and what his death means for the power struggle in the Church of England between his fellow Anglo-Catholic traditionalists and the dominant modernist wing of the troubled church. **********Traditionalists today hailed Dr. Bennett as a martyr who killed himself in despair over being unable to halt the decline of a state church that now claims only 5 percent of the British population as communicants. **********''He was one of those people who manifestly ought to be a bishop and who has been passed over in favor of very, very inferior people,'' said John Gummer, who holds the No.2 agricultural post in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Goverment and is a lay member of the church's governing General Synod. ''He was a saintly, gentle figure. It was his friends who were bitter about his being passed over for people who had not his conviction in the faith of the church.'' **********A Labor member of Parliament, Frank Field, another lay Synod member, said Dr. Bennett was ''an example of the blackballing'' of conservative theologians by ''the Runcie group.'' Only seven or eight of Britain's 43 bishops are regarded as reflecting conservative theological positions and social values. Defeat for Anglo-Catholics **********As an adherent of the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church of England, Dr. Bennett emphasized its Roman Catholic roots on issues such as an all-male priesthood. But the Anglo-Catholics suffered a defeat in February when the General Synod approved preliminary steps that could lead to the ordination of women by 1991. **********Liberals privately cited Dr. Bennett's thwarted ambitions to be a bishop and the defeat on ordination as the reason for his attack on Dr. Runcie, the head of the Anglican Church. His preface described the Archbishop as a practitioner of ''elitist liberalism'' who lacked sound theological training and avoided tough issues by going with the crowd. **********''His influence is now probably at its height,'' Dr. Bennett wrote. ''It would therefore be good to be assured that he actually knew what he was doing and had a clear basis for his policies rather than taking the line of least resistance on each issue.'' **********The harsh tone of the article caused a storm of controversy. There were charges of ''back stabbing,'' and before Dr. Bennett's authorship was disclosed, the Archbishop of York, Dr. John Habgood, denounced the article as ''scurrilous, sour and vindictive.'' Today, Dr. Bennett's friends said he might have killed himself because of this critcism from Dr. Habgood, widely regarded as the leading candidate to succeed Dr. Runcie, and because of the growing ''witch hunt'' for the author by the press. Coroner Insisted on Knowing **********Those eager to make a hero of Dr. Bennett have been trying to excuse his repeated false statements to reporters and priests who asked him if he was the mystery author. The Rev. Philip Ursell, an Oxford colleague, said today that Dr. Bennett believed that ''the fulfilling of a contract to remain anonymous is not the telling of an untruth'' and he likened what some have labeled Dr. Bennett's ''lies'' to protecting the confidentiality of a confession. **********In the end, church officials were forced to reveal Dr. Bennett's role because of pressure from the Oxford coroner, who considered the question of authorship germane to his inquest into the cause of death. **********There is an underlying political motif to the entire episode. Anglican traditionalists are generally regarded as supporters of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and she is sympathetic to their effort to hold the church to traditional values. In the British system, Mrs. Thatcher selects from a list of two nominees each new bishop to be appointed by the Queen. **********In September Dr. Bennett was appointed to the six-member selection committee that picks the nominees for Mrs. Thatcher's consideration. In killing himself, Dr. Bennett seemingly missed a chance to use this powerful position to seed the nomination lists with conservatives. **********But Mr. Gummer suggested that Dr. Bennett may have despaired because the liberal domination of the selection committee itself meant that Mrs. Thatcher would never have the opportunity of choosing conservative bishops. ''If you put up two liberals or one liberal and one impossible you soon make sure that the hierarchy is entirely liberal,'' Mr. Gummer said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/30/world/new-clash-in-jerusalem-on-films-on-sabbath.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1987-08-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 696, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Clash in Jerusalem on Films on Sabbath", "print_headline": "New Clash in Jerusalem on Films on Sabbath", "body_text": " **********Israeli riot policemen broke up demonstrations at dusk today by hundreds of rigorously Orthodox Jews protesting the showing of movies on Friday nights.

They shook their fists, spat and shouted ''Sabbath, Sabbath'' at passing motorists, who were driving before the end of the Sabbath at sundown.

Moreover, they say, they resent being told by the religious that they have to behave in a certain way. Barricaded Neighborhoods **********Rigorously Orthodox Jews make up 25 to 30 percent of Jerusalem's population. Their own neighborhoods are blocked off with barricades from Friday night to Saturday night to prevent cars from driving through. **********Israel operates on a six-day workweek, with Sunday being a normal workday and Saturday the only day off.

When children played with wooden spoons or pots, their parents not only didn't have to spend any money but, more important, didn't have to make any choices. (They also didn't have to squirm around under couches and beneath dish washers, days later, rooting for mislaid pieces from the Erector set.) By the late 1800's, the toy business was in full swing. Besides dolls and stuffed animals, stores were offering Jack-Straws, the Roaming Turtle, the Jester, the Electric Experiment Box and the Tom Stout Marble Game. **********These days, upward of 4,000 new products annually come wobbling and whirring and squishing out of toy factories, many of them just in time to find a spot under the Christmas tree. The country's 800 toy makers engage in pitched battles to try to get their products under enough trees to win a bigger piece of the $12.5 billion toy market. No wonder guards patrol Mattel's R & D building in Hawthorne, Calif., as if it were a missle silo. **********Over the decades, a plenitude of toys has been put on the market - about 150,000 different toys now clog store shelves. Some sell well for years and are known as classics - Lionel trains, Crayola, Play-Doh, Barbie, G.I. Joe, Tinkertoys, Cabbage Patch dolls. Others never sell and are known as just plain duds. **********In the end, of course, it doesn't matter what the toy designers or the parents think about a toy. Its success comes down to the whims of the children who play with it, and there's no predicting what they'll like. **********Here's a look at a few of the toys that, over the years, a lot of them did like. *********** Hot day. Nothing much to do. A restless John Lloyd Wright, the son of Frank Lloyd Wright, was in Tokyo, accompanying his father on a business trip. This was 1916, when John Wright was 24. While his father was tied up with a client, he watched workmen move timbers into place for the Imperial Palace Hotel, intended to be an earthquake proof building. As he watched, he drifted off and dreamed of a toy that children could use to build little versions of some of the structures of America's past - the log cabins, the forts, the bridges. **********Returning to his home in Merrill, Wis., John Wright worked out the details for a construction toy, and, in 1918, he put Lincoln Logs on the market; the name was meant to bring to mind the logs in Abraham Lincoln's old home. But there wasn't much interest. Not until 1924, in fact, did children really nag their parents to buy them the logs. **********By the 1930's, however, children all over the country were building log cabins. In 1943, Playskool acquired the rights to Lincoln Logs from Mr. Wright, immediately making the company a very large housing developer. The logs continue to be steady sellers, Playskool said; this year, it expects that more than 500,000 sets will be bought. In fact, it takes four train carloads of Ponderosa pine from Oregon every month to make enough Lincoln Logs to satisfy demand. *********** While Richard James, a marine engineer, was aboard ship in 1943, a torsion spring - a coiled, circular spring - fell off a table and begin rolling around the deck. Its wild gyrations amused him. When he came home, he told his wife, Betty, that he thought a nifty toy could be made out of a spring. Mrs. James went on with what she was doing. **********For two years, Mr. James tinkered with various metals, thicknesses and proportions, before he perfected a coiled steel spring (80 feet long if stretched taut) that could quiver its way down a flight of stairs. His wife flipped through a dictionary to come up with a name for it and stopped when she arrived at ''slinky.'' **********Motionless in the store, Slinky looked like something misplaced from the hardware department. ''It looked like nothing sitting there,'' Mrs. James said. ''You had to see it move.'' The Jameses persuaded the Gimbels store in Philadelphia to allow them to set up a sloped board in the toy department where they could let Slinky ''walk.'' Within 90 minutes, all 400 Slinkys in stock were sold. **********In 1945, the Jameses started a company, James Industries, and they were pretty happy. But how long could a coil of steel sell? Mrs. James figured Slinky was good for a few years, at best. Year after year, though, Slinky kept selling. In the last few years, it has sold at an annual rate of more than two million springs. **********Beginning in the late 1970's, the line has been extended to include a Slinky Junior, a Plastic Slinky, a Slinky Cater-Puller and Slinky Eyeballs. The original steel version, though, still outsells the others. **********In 1960, Mr. James apparently had seen enough Slinkys for one lifetime. He left the business - and Mrs. James - to join a religious cult in Bolivia (He died in 1974.) Mrs. James continued to own and run the business, as she does to this day, in the small town of Hollidaysburg, Pa. Now 69 years old, Mrs. James rides around town in a car bearing the license plate: ''SLINKY.'' *********** The thing should never have been invented. During World War II, scientists at General Electric were searching for a rubber substitute to make tank treads and G.I. boots. No luck. They discovered a pink, taffy-like goo that was good for absolutely nothing. **********G.E. people used to take it to cocktail parties and joke about it. It was at one of those parties in 1949 that Peter Hodgson, a Connecticut marketing man, saw it. He noticed the delight people took in stretching it and bouncing it off walls, and decided it might make a good toy. He ordered a batch, stuck it in a toy catalogue he was writing for a local store and called it Silly Putty. **********It did well enough that Mr. Hodgson formed a company in New Haven in 1950 so he could make and market the blobs himself. Millions of half-ounce dabs of Silly Putty, packaged in plastic egg-shaped containers, sold every year. People found they could bounce it like a ball. They could stretch it like taffy. When they struck it with a hammer, it shattered like glass. **********At first, Mr. Hodgson marketed Silly Putty as an adult toy. It moved slowly, until it began to pick up some free publicity. Steve Allen started to play with it on his nightly Tonight show, and ''The Big Story,'' a detective series, built a murder mystery around it. **********In 1957, hoping to expand sales, Mr. Hodgson began a television advertising campaign aimed at children. They especially liked the fact that the stuff would pick up pictures from comic books. In time, it became mainly a children's toy. **********In 1977, Binney & Smith, a Pennsylvania toy maker, bought the rights to Silly Putty. Sales had been tapering off, though increased distribution by Binney & Smith helped rebuild them. Of late, two million eggs of Silly Putty are sold each year. **********Silly Putty is one of those toys that lend themselves to versatility. Parents use it to strip lint from their clothing. Others scrub typewriter keys with it or stick it under table legs to stop the wobbling. In 1981, the Columbus Zoo selected it to take hand and foot prints of its gorilla population. Receivers for the New England Patriots football team squeeze it to strengthen hand muscles. Silly Putty even went into space; the Apollo 8 astronauts used it to hold tools in place. **********Peter Hodgson died in 1976. He left an estate of $140 million. *********** John B. Tigrett was an executive of a Chicago bus company, and, as a sideline, he took flings with novelties. He did okay with a dunking duck that squatted on the edge of a glass of water and kept dipping its beak in and out of the water. In 1950, however, he found a toy that got him out of buses for good. **********Sitting on a plane, he began talking to the man next to him. The passenger mentioned that a salesman in Rutherford, N.J., had invented a toy for his little girl out of adding-machine paper. Mr. Tigrett contacted the man and arranged to license the product. The salesman had already thought up a name - Zoomerang. **********The Zoomerang consisted of tough red, white and blue paper wrapped around one end of a stick that was a bit smaller than a pencil. Holding on to the other end of the stick, you flicked your wrist and whipped the coil out in a spiral for a distance of up to eight feet. The paper then sprang back into place. In another version - endorsed by Hopalong Cassidy - the paper spiral shot out of the barrel of a plastic revolver. **********When Mr. Tigrett introduced the Zoomerang, it didn't sell. He wrote to Arthur Godfrey, who mentioned it on his radio show, and that did it. **********By 1954, Mr. Tigrett had sold about 20 million Zoomerangs. It was the biggest-selling toy in America. ''The surprise element did it,'' Mr. Tigrett said. ''That's what sold everything then.'' **********After about four years, the zoom was about gone from the Zoomerang. By then, Mr. Tigrett was pretty well off. He had another big hit with a bird that wallked up and down walls and then he got into the boat business and other things. In 1964, when Zoomerang sales were virtually gone, he sold everything and moved to Europe. **********He has since acted as a financial consultant to such people as the Hunt brothers and J. Paul Getty. For the last 20 years, he's been a partner in business ventures with Sir James Goldsmith, the European financier. Today, at 75, he lives in Memphis, Tenn., and London. It amuses him that his Zoomerang still shows up, made by some company or other in Taiwan. ''I bought one in New York the other day,'' he said. ''It didn't work well at all.'' *********** Mr. Potato Head has never been content to be just a toy. He has always insisted on a full-fledged life. **********Perhaps that's because television went to his head. Mr. Potato Head, according to toy industry lore, was the first toy ever advertised on television; that happened when he starred in some local commercials in California in 1952. (The first toy to hit national TV is thought to be the Mouse Guitar, which was put on the air in 1955.) In 1953, a year after Mr. Potato Head was introduced - as a set of metal-tipped eyes, ears, noses and mouths that could be stuck onto a real potato - he met Mrs. Potato Head. According to the fanciful publicity distributed by Hasbro, Mr. Potato Head's manufacturer, they had an incredibly fast courtship, were married and spent their honeymoon, logically enough, in Boise, Idaho. **********Hasbro was one of the first companies to recognize the value in endowing a toy with a fantasy life, a practice that has become increasingly commonplace. Every few years, it seemed, consumers received some more details on what the Potato Heads were up to. In the early 1960's, Mr. Potato Head went on a buying binge. He bought a convertible, boat, trailer, airplane and locomotive. **********In 1966, after the company started selling plastic bodies along with the appendages, Mr. Potato Head became drawn to recreational activities. A wind-up spring was installed inside him so he could jump, fish, play with a jackhammer and fly kites. Mrs. Potato Head started jumping, too. She could move a feather duster, floor polisher, dinner bell and vacuum cleaner. (This was before female potatoes were liberated.) In 1974, Mr. Potato Head was getting older. He couldn't jump and, worse, he had doubled in size. (He still hasn't lost the weight.) In February 1985, the Potato Heads had a child. Even with Baby Potato Head around, Mr. Potato Head soon found time to campaign (unsuccessfully) for mayor of Boise. Ads billed him as the first vegetable to run for public office, ''a man of the soil.'' The publicity hasn't hurt. Hasbro estimates that 40 million heads have been sold, with about a million kits bought each year. **********Mr. Potato Head still makes news. At a press conference last month he announced that, after puffing on a pipe for 35 years, he was giving up smoking. ''It's a bad influence on the kids,'' he said, ''let alone what it must be like for my wife, a non-smoker. *********** If you can do more than one thing with a toy, it helps. If you can do a few trillion things, it really helps. **********That's what the Christiansens figured. Ole Kirk Christiansen ran a carpentry shop in Denmark. It began in 1916, making ladders and ironing boards, then toys. In the 1930's, Mr. Christiansen sold an awful lot of Yo-Yo's, until the Danes got Yo-Yo'd out. He switched to toy trucks and then, in 1949, came up with little plastic building bricks with round studs. **********In the 1950's, his son, Godtfred Kirk Christiansen, took over the company, now known as Interlego A/S, and bet everything on the bricks. He named them the Lego System of Play. Lego arrived in this country in 1961. The bricks lend themselves to the imagination. Just six bricks, the company says, can be combined in 102,981,500 ways. If you've only got three bricks, you can fit them together in 1,060 ways. A statistican once figured out that every year European children spend five billion hours playing with Lego bricks. **********Initially, the bricks were designed for 5-year-olds, but with time the age range has been expanded. There are also Lego people and all sorts of items to make a whole Lego city. Larger bricks are made for 3-month-old babies and the upper range is listed at 14 years. However, plenty of people several decades older get a kick out of them. Norman Mailer, when he was 37, built a 15,000-brick ''city of the future'' in his Brooklyn living room. **********Lego Systems, the Connecticut-based American division of Interlego, sells the bricks in this country, the toy's largest market. Lego doesn't give out dollar numbers, but estimates have put annual sales in this country at as much as $115 million. More than half the households with children under 15 are thought to own the bricks. **********All sorts of things have been built out of Legos, by people at home, for contests or displays: the U.S. Capitol, Mount Rushmore, Sitting Bull, Ronald McDonald, the Port of Copenhagen and quarterback Joe Montano. *********** It was really disgusting. It was a pea-green blob. One look at it made you want to throw up. **********It was Slime. **********For whatever reason, kids were ready for a drippy, clammy piece of yechhh in 1977. Within months of its introduction by Mattel, which developed it in one of its Hawthorne, Calif., labs, Slime had become one of the country's 10 biggest selling toys. **********The stuff was 95 percent water; the rest was sugar and a bunch of secret ingredients that Mattel executives wouldn't divulge even if you pointed a Zoomerang at them. Slime could be messy, but Mattel assured parents that water ought to get it out of clothing. Still, in one publicized case, a Chicago mother had to cut some of her son's hair out after she couldn't extract Slime from it. **********Some adults liked to spill Slime on co-workers' desks. Down in Washington, Jim King, the White House personnel chief under Jimmy Carter, once poured some in Hamilton Jordan's office. **********Slime did nicely for a few years before fading. Then, in 1980, Mattel tried to give it a lift by offering two new versions: Rainbow Slime, streaked with different colors, and Slime It's Alive, with plastic eyes. Neither went over big. Slime disappeared from the market in 1981. **********There's no keeping a yucky blob down. In 1986, Slime reappeared as an accessory for Mattel's Master of the Universe action figures. Any warrior who isn't careful might be snatched by the fearsome claw of the Slime Pit, which then pours gruesome Slime all over him.

''I have been underestimated for decades,'' the West German Chancellor said with a big smile. ''I've done very well that way.'' **********Five days before national parliamentary elections, Mr. Kohl seemed to have good reason for his contentment. Every polling organization in the country has found that his center-right coalition is headed for re-election on Sunday - the Chancellor predicted with 54 to 55 percent of the vote - confirming him in the stewardship of West Germany for four more years. **********In Bonn, a small city where the large and restless Mr. Kohl has never felt at ease, the scent of imminent victory is especially sweet. For it has been here above all that he has been derided as a bumbling, inarticulate and pratfall-prone provincial. Dramatic Shift in Mood **********Yet as he and others struck the balance of his four years and five months in power it was difficult to avoid the conclusion that West Germany's national mood had dramatically shifted from torment and doubt to satisfaction and mild optimism. **********A visitor to his spacious office overlooking a snow-covered park remarked that the winter election campaign had been dull and issueless. ''What you call boring,'' the Chancellor retorted, ''is that we have a good record in office. And the people see it.'' Quite consciously, Mr. Kohl has presided over a calming of West Germany's political life, which in 1983 was acutely polarized over the deployment of American medium-range nuclear missiles and an agonizing debate about sovereignty and a German national identity caught between East and West. **********Wolfgang Bergsdorff, one of the Chancellor's closest advisers, said of his chief: ''He has two visions, and they are both covered by the word 'normality.' The excited climate in the country should be calmed down, and he has certainly accomplished that.'' **********''The other part is our relationship to our history,'' continued Mr. Bergsdorff, ''and with what happened in the German name between 1933 and 1945. His feeling is that the German memory should not be occupied solely with this period and that we should overcome our troubled relationship with ourselves.'' **********It is not certain that Mr. Kohl has achieved this second goal, which has kindled controversy. The world still associates this country with such gestures as President Reagan's wreath-laying at the military cemetery at Bitburg, where members of the SS are buried, or with the Chancellor's off-the-cuff comment that Kurt Waldheim, now President of Austria despite a searing investigation of his war record, was a ''great patriot.'' Holds to His Position **********Klaus Hofmann, a journalist who has known Mr. Kohl for almost four decades, said that even more than West Germany's first Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, Mr. Kohl was determined to cement the alliance with the United States. ''He has held to this position even when opinion polls and other fashionable indicators have been against it,'' said the journalist. ''I think he will go into history as a big integrator of the Federal Republic in the West.'' **********This is a friendly judgment. Yet even Mr. Kohl's foes concede that his great political strength lies in his unchallenged command of the Christian Democratic Party apparatus, which he patiently built up during nine years as an opposition leader. As Chancellor he has kept his doors open to the likes of county-level party treasurers, who return to the provinces convinced that the man at the top cares. **********It is suggestive of Mr. Kohl's populist style that he has drawn up a little-known testament stating that should he ever be taken hostage he does not want the state to be put in a situation where it could be blackmailed to secure his freedom. **********The Chancellor horrifies his bodyguards by his determination to be seen moving normally among his countrymen. It is not unusual to see him strolling about Bonn or, at home in Ludwigshafen, attending a local Roman Catholic church with hardly any protection. Comparisons to Truman **********Michael Sturmer, a historian who has occasionally advised the Chancellor, speculated that Mr. Kohl might one day be put in the category of Harry S. Truman, ''a vastly underrated politician who almost came through the side door and left the stage having accomplished a lot.'' **********''His real strength,'' said Mr. Sturmer of the Chancellor, ''is touching the ground and having that feeling of the ground - and appealing to the man who wants simple home truths. In this way his petit bourgeois background, and even his gaffes, help him. He is regarded as a real human being, authentic.'' **********Reading a speech to Parliament or on television, Mr. Kohl looks stiff and uncomfortable stumbling through someone else's words. But election campaigns appear to have an almost liberating effect, allowing him to abandon the persona of the statesman for that of the politician and to speak his own folksy idiom. **********At a rally in Wurzburg on Saturday, Mr. Kohl appeared shortly after 8 P.M. at the rear of a big hall and picked his way down the aisle, reaching into the crowd and grabbing hands. On the speaker's dais, a young protester with a sweater rushed the Chancellor with a petition and was violently hustled off the stage by bodyguards. **********''That's no cause for excitement!'' the Chancellor boomed into the microphone as a group of Communist hecklers, who have been disrupting his campaign regularly, sounded a chorus of boos and whistles. Mr. Kohl drowned them out with a one-liner: ''If they were real Marxists they would know the famous sentence of Rosa Luxemburg - that freedom is always the freedom of the other!'' **********The set Kohl speech is an extended homily on the virtues of hard work (''The future is more important than leisure''), freedom and traditional Christian values that he sees leading to ''a renaissance of the family.'' **********''All the principles that are valid for private life must be valid for public life,'' he said in his speech, ''and this must be German politics.'' **********He vowed continuity in foreign policy and discussion with the Soviet Union and its allies, but, as he has recently, struck out harshly at East Germany for holding political prisoners. ''The decisive reality is that we are part of the Western world and we will not accept Soviet or Communist hegemony over the Federal Republic,'' he declared to loud cheers. An Hourlong Conversation **********An hourlong conversation in German with Mr. Kohl in Bonn at the tail end of the campaign was in some ways like a continuation of his speech, with some of its themes, such as the need for West Germany to embark on more basic research, being developed in quieter tones. **********The Chancellor noted that this was the first January election ever held here, a wintry variable that might reduce the turnout. But he said he would be ''fully satisfied'' if his coalition of Christian and Free Democrats won 54 to 55 percent of the vote. **********''I have never believed this fairy tale about the absolute majority,'' he said, referring to earlier speculation that his party might get an overall majority of Bundestag seats. ''Absolute majorities are very unpopular with us.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/14/world/18-reported-dead-as-troops-clash-with-salvador-rebels.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "18 Reported Dead as Troops Clash With Salvador Rebels", "print_headline": "18 Reported Dead as Troops Clash With Salvador Rebels", "body_text": " **********Eight soldiers and 10 rebels died in a seven-hour night battle for the town of Delicias de Concepcion in eastern El Salvador last night, the armed forces press office said today. **********In a statement it said 12 soldiers and 3 civilians had been wounded.

This is why investors and traders in all the financial markets pay so much attention to the report - and, correspondingly, why the prices of stocks and bonds and the value of the dollar in relation to other major currencies can rise or fall, depending on how the actual figures stack up against expectations. **********For instance, a ''good trade figure'' - one (like September's) that is on the low end of what economists had been expecting or even lower - instills confidence in the economy. **********Why? For one thing, it indicates that American corporations are becoming more competitive in world markets, a development that itself has broad implications. By indicating that the devaluation of the dollar that already has taken place is working to improve the competitiveness of American companies, favorable trade figures reduce protectionist sentiment in the United States. In addition, by indicating that the rate of dollar outflow because of imbalances between exports and imports is being reduced, they decrease the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates to attract money from abroad. **********How the trade figures affect the various financial markets, though, is even more complicated. At least as important as the actual numbers, is how the figures jibe with expectations. Explaining yesterday's rise in the stock and bond markets and the increase in the value of the dollar, some analysts said that reports of progress in the Washington negotiations to cut the Federal budget deficit played at least as important a role as the trade figures did. **********But even though the trade report was not a big surprise and was not good in absolute terms - a $14 billion monthly trade deficit is still extremely large - it was better than many experts had been predicting. **********''The overriding common denominator in the markets was that the trade number came in on the optimistic end of the spectrum,'' said Jay N. Woodworth, vice president and economist at the Bankers Trust Company. **********If the statistics released yesterday turn out to be a new trend (which no one can know for sure at this time) the effects could be salutory for the economy for a variety of reasons. **********First, it would mean that the United States would not feel compelled to drive the dollar's value down further to make American goods more competitive. That would bode well for holders of dollars who would feel less compelled to sell them out of fear that they would drop further in value. **********Second, with a smaller merchandise trade deficit, fewer dollars flow out of the country. Thus, the nation's foreign debt would grow more slowly, which means that the United States would be perceived to be financially stronger. **********Foreigners, feeling more confident, thus would be more willing to hold dollars. **********''This country is a debtor nation,'' said Burt R. Clark, treasurer of the National Westminster Bank USA. ''Increases in the trade deficits will increase those debts. How much credit will the world give you, and with what do you repay those debts?'' **********Third, if the dollar maintains its relative strength, it would reduce pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to prop up the dollar. High interest rates encourage foreigners to buy dollars that can be invested in American securities, driving up the value of the dollar. One major reason why the Federal Reserve does not want the value of the dollar to decline too far is that it makes imports more expensive, and that leads to inflation. **********But although raising interest rates might shore up the dollar, it can also cool, or even cripple, the domestic economy - and that could cause corporate earnings and stock prices to drop. **********On the other hand, if the Federal Reserve does not have to worry about the dodlar's value, it can keep money readily available at low rates. That would stimulate economic growth, keep corporate profits strong and, in turn, encourage higher stock prices. **********Fourth, because higher exports create more jobs for Americans, continued improvement in the trade balance would reduce pressures for adoption of protectionist policies. Many economists believe that such policies were largely responsible for the Great Depression of the 1930's. The smaller trade deficit ''shows that a decline in the dollar could help stop the erosion of American jobs to foreigners,'' said Stephen Leach, a foreign-exchange expert at the Chemical Bank. ''We are seeing a turnaround. It's taken a long time, but there is solid improvement.'' **********Finally, just the sense that progress is being made creates a more buoyant mood among investors, in both stocks and bonds. That was reflected in the financial markets yesterday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/17/business/new-de-larosiere-post.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New De Larosiere Post", "print_headline": "New De Larosiere Post", "body_text": " **********Jacques de Larosiere, the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, took over today as the governor of the French central bank.

''It was a hard blow.'' He said he fought ''hundreds'' of contras in a pitched battle in Siuna for most of Sunday morning. **********He estimated that as many as 40 soldiers were killed in the fighting here, a higher figure than that given by the Government. Civilian Toll Is High **********But the overall effect of the rebel attack was greatly influenced by the number of civilian casualties. As many as 19 civilians appear to have been killed and more than 100 wounded in the three towns, according to doctors and Sandinista officials. Almost all appeared to have been hit by mortar and small-arms fire, a doctor here said. **********In addition, although the rebels carried out their most extensive sabotage of the war, some installations that they claim to have destroyed were not damaged. They also failed to attack major military and economic targets that were easily accessible to them. **********For most of Monday, Tuesday and today, Sandinista planes and helicopters ferried reinforcements, weapons, ammunition and wounded, a great many of them civilians, across the thick green jungle of this nearly inaccessible region of northeastern Nicaragua, darting to and from the battlefield in an effort to recoup and pursue the departing rebels. Dead Buried in a Trench **********A bulldozer and men wearing gauze masks dug a trench in Siuna today to bury four dead rebels. The army dead had already been removed, but the civilian hospital remained full of wounded villagers and militiamen. **********The combined offensive began without warning at 5 A.M. Sunday when the rebels, probably numbering 2,000 to 3,000, swept into the towns of Siuna, Bonanza and Rosita, several witnesses and army soldiers said here. **********The rebels occupied Siuna and Bonanza, where they engaged Government troops and destroyed an important radar station, a large arms and munitions warehouse, an electrical plant, a police station and a militia barracks among other targets, according to Sandinista officers and residents. They said the rebels began to withdraw from Siuna and Rosita on Sunday night and from Bonanza on Monday. Mine Works Not Destroyed **********The three mining towns, all in Zelaya Department, produce gold and silver, which is economically important to Nicaragua, and hold significant military installations. The rebels damaged the mine works in Bonanza but not, as they asserted, in Siuna, according to evidence seen by reporters and accounts by Sandinista officials and residents. **********The coordinated raids indicate a new level of military sophistication, a will to fight and the ability to use what appears to have been highly accurate intelligence. The attacks also indicate that the guerrillas have largely neutralized the threat from Sandinista helicopter gunships with American-provided missiles. **********The rebels now appear to be able to strike targets at a time of their choosing in this rugged country of few roads and then set up ambushes against Sandinistas sent in as reinforcements. Rebel Claim Is Denied **********This is the second successful major attack since October by the rebels, who claim to have killed or wounded more than 200 Government troops. **********Maj. Ramon Sosa, the Sandinista army commmander for this region, disputed the contra claim in a briefing here today. He contended that 49 soldiers had been killed and 76 wounded and that 137 rebels had been killed. In addition, he said, 19 civilians were killed and 93 wounded. He said also that several civilians had been seized by the rebels. **********The figures given by both sides were impossible to verify by reporters, who did not see bodies to back up the claims. **********Major Sosa showed only a few rifles that he said had been captured from the rebels, a seeming anomaly if more than 100 guerrillas were killed. But the fighting occurred in a dispersed area and it is possible that not all weapons were collected for reporters to see. **********The Government did not allow reporters into the battle area until Wednesday, when they were permitted to enter Siuna for a few hours but not Bonanza or Rosita. **********In Siuna, Major Sosa gave an account of the battle that was contradicted by several soldiers, by villagers and by the evidence of fighting. Other reporters were allowed to fly briefly over Bonanza and Rosita. They reported seeing heavy damage in Bonanza, where the rebels fought for almost two days. **********Major Sosa asserted that the rebels had not occupied Siuna, that Sandinista ''crossfire'' had destroyed the radar site here and that a arms warehouse that was blown up held only antiquated weapons. Town Reported Bombed **********But 14 separate army and civilian witnesses said that the rebels had occupied Siuna so completely that the Sandinista air force bombed the town in an effort to rout them. The bombs were apparently defective; two sat in their craters today, unexploded. **********Several witnesses, including four soldiers, also contradicted Major Sosa by giving convincing accounts of how the rebels blew up the radar station. They also said the destroyed warehouse was full of new, not antiquated, weapons and ammunition. **********Accounts by soldiers and villagers indicate that the guerrillas dominate this zone of Zelaya Department. Reporters were taken to Siuna in Sandinista air force planes that flew at treetop level - to avoid rebel rocket fire, a pilot said. **********Several eyewitness accounts gathered in Siuna indicate that more than 1,000 rebels struck from five directions before dawn, catching about 360 government defenders by surprise. They almost immediately destroyed the radar station and arms warehouse, according to local residents, soldiers and evidence seen by a reporter. Trucks Not Destroyed **********But for reasons that are not clear, they did not destroy several heavy trucks and the mine works here. They also failed to attack or shell the headquarters of the 366th Sandinista Army Brigade, even though it was immediately in front of them. **********One villager, Nelson Antonio Giron, said townspeople gathered in the church had implored the rebels not to destroy the mine works, a major source of work here. Ten residents said in separate interviews that the rebels held the town for about eight hours and walked around the center talking to townspeople. They said there was no looting or abuse of civilians. **********Dr. Klaus Helber, a West German who is head of the hospital and who has lived here for two years, said the rebels refrained from entering the hospital when asked not to, even though wounded Sandinista soldiers were inside. **********Dr. Helber, who described himself as a Government supporter, said the contras told two nurses at the hospital: ''We don't want to hurt civilians. We know you are suffering hunger and we are here to bring you liberty.'' **********The rebels then told people not to join the militia, warning that they would attack again soon, townspeople said. One villager said the rebels had taken away four local residents, but Dr. Helber, who knows the town well, made no mention of villagers' being missing. Help From Local Peasants **********The rebels say that they have extensive support in this area and that local peasants provided them with key intelligence and helped guide their surprise approach on the towns. Those claims appear credible. ''It is clear the contras know very well where to eat and where to sleep,'' Dr. Helber said. ''There are people who help them.'' But the rebels appear to have won few friends in the towns by causing so many civilian casualties. It is not easy to prove whether civilians were hit by rebel or Sandinista weapon fire since part of the battle took place inside the towns. **********Most of the more than 70 wounded civilians whom Dr. Helber said he treated appeared to have been hit by shrapnel.

Atkins, the New York financier accused of engineering one of the largest illegal tax shelter conspiracies in history, was described by prosecutors yesterday as a man who descended into a ''world of fraud'' because of his own ''greed and lies.'' **********But lawyers for Mr. Atkins, the managing partner of the Securities Groups, an umbrella organization for several investment partnerships, said that their client had never made a transaction without the approval of lawyers and that much of what the Government said was a conspiracy was nothing more than the normal course of business for modern investment houses. **********Mr. Atkins is charged with 31 counts of conspiracy and fraud to produce what the Government says were more than $350 million in fraudulent deductions for wealthy investors. He is being tried along with William S. Hack, president of Kale Holding Corporation, and Ernest M. Grunebaum, who headed a division of the securities group. They were both indicted on several charges. **********Yesterday's opening session of the trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan included an explanation of Wall Street jargon by Federal District Judge Edward Weinfeld and the presentation of charts by defense lawyers to explain Government securities trading.

Tisch, chief executive of CBS Inc.; Preston R. Tisch, the Postmaster General of the United States; Andy Warhol, the artist, and the actors Lorne Greene, Michael Landon and Sidney Poitier. None of the investors are charged with any crime. **********In opening statements for the Government, Stuart E. Abrams, the chief of the major crimes unit in the United States Attorney's office, described the case as being about ''greed and lies.'' **********''Once Mr. Atkins turned to fraud, success came very easily,'' Mr. Abrams said.

Moss, denied that Securities Groups paid fees to individuals in outside companies to provide documentation of ''bogus'' losses that could be used for deductions by the firm's investors. **********''There were fees,'' Mr. Moss said. ''For any broker or dealer the payment of fees is common.'' **********Lawyers for Mr. Hack and Mr. Grunebaum both denied that their clients had done anything improper. Mr. Grunebaum's lawyer, John H. Doyle, stressed that his client had not been in the inner circle of Securities Groups.

Heileman Brewing Company, the nation's fourth-largest brewer. **********But Heileman's stock soared $8.25, to $42.125, an indication that Wall Street expects a higher bid. **********The cash offer by Bond Corporation Holdings Ltd. was valued at $1.2 billion. Heileman issued a statement urging shareholders to do nothing about the bid until the board and management have decided whether to accept it. No National Brand **********George Dahlman, an analyst with Piper Jaffray & Hopwood, of Minneapolis, said Heileman is worth as much as $45 a share. He praised the company's performance and its management, despite a 4 percent drop in earnings in the first half of the year. **********''The only thing they haven't done is to get a national brand,'' Mr. Dahlman said. **********Heileman, a regional brewer whose brands include Old Style, Colt 45 and Henry Weinhard, has about 8 percent of the nation's beer market, according to Jerry Steinman, editor and publisher of Beer Marketer's Insights, a New Jersey newsletter. **********The beer business is dominated by the Anheuser-Busch Companies, maker of the top-selling Budweiser brand. The company has 38.5 percent market share of the market. Trailing Anheuser-Busch are the Miller Brewing Company, a subsidiary of the Philip Morris Companies, with a 20.3 percent share, and the Stroh Brewing Company, with a 12 percent share. 'He's Buying Distribution' **********Paul Shain, a beer industry analyst with Dain Bosworth Inc. of Minneapolis. speculated that the Bond Corporation, which owns the Swan Brewery, the second-largest beer manufacturer in Australia, might want to use Heileman as a distributor for its own brands. **********''He's buying distribution,'' Mr. Shain said of Mr. Bond's offer. ''Beer is sold through wholesalers, distribution is highly unionized, and it's not easy to break in with a new product. With Heileman, you've got product slots, you've got shelf space.'' **********However, Mr. Steinman said, new brands face extraordinary difficulties and $1.2 billion is a high price to pay just to enter the market. He said Australian beers, largely the Foster's brand, represented only 1.7 percent of imports and one-hundredth of a percent of the total American market. **********The Bond Corporation, which also has interests in energy, broadcasting, films and property in Australia, Hong Kong and elsewhere, bought its first American beer company in 1986, when its Swan Brewery subsidiary paid $28 million for the Pittsburgh Brewing Company. Mr. Bond said in a statement that the acquisition of Heileman would create the world's fourth-largest brewer in the world, after Anheuser-Busch, Miller and Heineken N.V., a Dutch company. Heileman Chief 'a Fighter' **********Don Deaton, a spokesman, said Mr. Bond personally presented the buyout bid to Russell G. Cleary, Heileman's chairman and chief executive. **********Mr. Steinman of Beer Marketer's Insights said he thought Mr. Cleary would struggle to stay independent if he could. ''I think of him as a fighter,'' Mr. Steinman said. Bond Corporation's Amber Acquisitions Corporation conditioned the offer on Heileman's removing its so-called ''poison pill,'' a legal mechanism installed two years ago to discourage takeover bids, and on the tender of 75 percent of Heileman's outstanding common stock. **********Clare Zempel, an analyst with Robert W. Baird, in Milwaukee, said the poison pill goes into effect within 10 days of a hostile offer and essentially dilutes the equity of shares the buyer might acquire. **********A Bond spokesman said the 75 percent stock requirement was included to overcome takeover restrictions in Wisconsin. Small Brands, Big Business **********Heileman, which earned $48.3 million on sales of $1.3 billion in 1986, itself has a reputation as an aggressive acquirer of small brands. It has done well with Henry Weinhard's Private Reserve, a beer aimed at an upscale market on the West Coast, and Colt 45, a malt liquor. But success in the national market has eluded it. **********Antitrust considerations helped thwart two Heileman bids for the Pabst Brewing Company and one for the Jos. Schlitz Brewing Company, now part of Stroh. Nor could the company push its biggest beer into the big leagues by sheer promotional effort. **********''They attempted to take Old Style national, and it just didn't work,'' Mr. Shain of Dain Bosworth said. **********Mr. Bond, a native of Britain, is a self-made man. He is famous for his sponsorship of an Australian yacht that won the America's Cup. In the year ending June 30, his Bond Corporation had an operating profit of $116 million on revenues of $1.8 billion. **********Bond Corporation said it would raise the cash for the deal from its own reserves as well as from financing provided by a group of banks and by Salomon Brothers Inc.

Key Issue Is State of Emergency **********When the peace plan was first put forward in Costa Rica last month, Nicaraguan officials portrayed it as an attack on their Government. The Foreign Ministry called the plan ''truly lamentable'' and said countries that backed it were becoming ''neo-colonies of the United States.'' **********The Arias plan would require all Central American countries to guarantee ''full observance of civil rights'' and ''real pluralistic and democratic processes,'' including free elections overseen by foreign teams. **********Diplomats said that to comply with these clauses, Nicaragua would have to lift its state of emergency, which restricts many civil liberties.

''This is a very delicate time,'' an American diplomat said. **********At the center of the stir is the Reagan Administration's determination to provide Pakistan with a new military aid package, including an advanced air surveillance system, despite indications that Pakistan is developing a nuclear bomb. **********American military aid to Pakistan, which has fought three wars against India, has long been the major irritant in Indian-American relations, but officials say several other issues have aggravated the problem. Among them have been snags in the proposed sale to India of a sophisticated American computer and a move in the House of Representatives to cut American aid to New Delhi. Citing the Afghan War **********American officials say Pakistan needs protection against the 115,000 Soviet troops in neighboring Afghanistan. But this has also led to doubts in Pakistan about Washington's reliability, with rising fears there that the United States would cut off aid if the Afghan war were somehow resolved. **********To reassure Pakistan, Washington has lately said that it would continue to provide military help even if the war is settled. India charges that these assurances show that Washington is looking for a long-term military ally. **********American officials, meanwhile, are irritated because Mr. Gandhi has begun blaming his domestic problems on a plot by ''foreign forces'' to discredit him and undermine Indian democracy, as he did in a speech Saturday. Although not mentioning the United States by name, he has made it clear that he was accusing Washington of being part of an attempt to destabilize the country. **********''This is the kind of thing we used to hear from Indira Gandhi,'' an American official said, referring to Mr. Gandhi's mother and predecessor, who often angered the United States with talk of a ''foreign hand'' working against India. Mrs. Gandhi was assassinated in 1984. 'Purely Political Reasons' **********''It's not what we expected from Rajiv,'' the official said, noting that earlier under Mr. Gandhi cooperation with the United States, even in the military area, had risen to its highest level in 20 years. ''I don't even think he believes this stuff. He is doing it for purely political reasons.'' **********Mr. Gandhi has been under fire lately because of a feud with the Indian President, Zail Singh, as well as charges that his Government took payoffs from West German and Swedish arms contractors and accusations connected with trying to protect a Bombay textile concern against charges of business fraud. **********His Congress Party issued a statement last month warning against a conspiracy of multinational corporations and unnamed Western countries to destabilize India. American officials were understood to have conveyed their displeasure to Mr. Gandhi's aides and asked him to stop using such language. **********Instead, the Prime Minister repeated the charge in a fiery speech before 200,000 supporters on Saturday. The crowd roared in approval when he vowed to teach a lesson to Pakistan and ''its patrons.'' **********''We're going through lean times now,'' an Indian diplomat said. But he and others cited a recent speech in Parliament by Deputy Foreign Minister Singh in which he said India hoped to ''further promote, deepen, strengthen and widen'' its relationship with Washington. Good Ties in Some Respects **********Indian and American officials say the relationship remains strong in other respects. The United States is still India's largest trading partner, and Indians still flock to the United States to live and work. The United States also wins praise here for its efforts to arrest Sikh terrorists. **********Cooperative ventures are also continuing in education, technology and health as part of an improvement in relations that began in 1982 and increased after Mr. Gandhi took office in late 1984. India also remains interested in American military technology and plans to send a team of experts to investigate possibilities of buying electronics for a proposed Indian jet fighter. **********But Indian officials said that although they expected Washington to continue to help Pakistan, its efforts to rush ahead with highly sophisticated equipment, such as a possible air warning defense system, violated what they considered to be pledges of a new sensitivity to Indian concerns. **********Officials agree that relations worsened after the visit last October of Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, which an American official called ''a disaster.'' Mr. Weinberger infuriated India by not warning Mr. Gandhi or his aides that, on the next stop of his trip, he was going to come out in favor of sending Awacs radar planes to Pakistan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/07/business/anti-boesky-lawsuit-loses.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 192, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Anti-Boesky Lawsuit Loses", "print_headline": "Anti-Boesky Lawsuit Loses", "body_text": " **********A Federal judge dismissed a lawsuit today that contended the arbitrager Ivan F.

Even the Big Boys, using their Big Computers, were stunned by the magnitude of the tremors that shook Wall Street. **********But an investor with a PC and the appropriate programs could have avoided the sense of helplessness that many people felt as the markets moved swiftly and vital news about them seemed to slow down. **********Before making a trade, investors want information. Using a modem and communications software, personal computers can tap much of what is available to brokers and big institutions - and they can do it from a home, office or pay phone. This can be particularly soothing when your broker vanishes behind a barrier of busy signals. **********The PC user can get up-to-the-minute stock quotes, detailed financial information on any public company, data on interest rates, foreign exchange rates, futures prices and other economic indexes, current assessments from a wide range of analysts and wire service reports that won't appear in the newspapers until the following morning. And when it's time to execute a trade, the computer can file the order with a broker. **********For calmer moments, there are programs that allow the average PC user to chart and analyze both individual stocks and broader markets with a surprising degree of sophistication. It would be a mistake, however, to rely exclusively on these programs for an investment strategy. If they all did what they were advertised as being capable of, everybody would have been smiling last week, right? **********Many analysts blame a technique called program trading for the wild plunges and rocketlike increases in the Dow last week. The computers Wall Street uses for program trading are brutes that allow pension plans and other big institutions to make thousands of calculations and, simultaneously, to hurl millions of dollars into the market, playing the futures against the actual stock prices. Program trading is no place for sissies. **********In a sense, though, these institutional computers are not doing anything that the humble PC cannot do. If you want to fight fire with fire - even if it is a match against an inferno - you can run similar programs and see the same signals that the technical analysts use. **********Analysis programs are also available that evaluate individual issues, and they might have told you, for example, that I.B.M. was at $170 but a bargain at $103, or that the Dow had skated onto thin ice the instant it crossed above 2,250. If nothing else, learning to use these programs will make an investor more knowledgeable about the market. **********While there are an estimated 50 million investors nationwide, there are only about 10 million PC's in use. Thus the computer can be a tool that gives you an advantage over the unequipped. What follows is an examination of some of the software available for stock analysis. Next week we'll look at the PC as an information tool about the markets and underlying economic conditions as well. **********There are, in general, two classic techniques for following the market: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. **********Fundamental analysis tries to identify companies that are undervalued or fairly valued, with good prospects for long-term appreciation. It looks at companies not as quick-profit possibilities, but as the sort of businesses you would want to own and pass on to your children. **********TECHNICAL analysis is for investors who want to get in and out of the market quickly, taking profits based on split-second timing, using a collection of complex market indicators. Technicians love charts. **********Dr. Fred Shipley, a professor of finance at DePaul University in Chicago and the editor of the newsletter Computerized Investing (published by the American Association of Individual Investors), said he believed that fundamental analysis could help most investors, and he was particularly keen on two programs. **********His choices were Stockpak II from the Standard & Poor's Corporation ($275 to $1,010 for a year, depending on how many stock exchanges you want to monitor and whether you want your data updated once or twice a month, for I.B.M. and Apple II's; 25 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10004, 800-852-5200), and Value/Screen Plus (a two-month trial is $39, which rises to $169 quarterly and $309 a year for monthly data updates, or $1,500 a year for weekly electronic delivery of updated company information, for I.B.M.'s, Macintoshes and Apple II's; Value Line Inc., 711 Third Avenue, New York N.Y. 10017, 212-687-3965.) Dr. Shipley said Value/Screen Plus was somewhat easier to use, but it is limited to tracking the 1,600 most heavily traded stocks on all the exchanges. Stockpak, on the other hand, has access to everything in the S.& P. register, so if you're interested in obscure securities, this might be a better choice. **********''I'm not a strong believer in technical analysis,'' Dr. Shipley said, ''and I don't feel that most people will benefit from a lot of trading.'' But, he said, the reviewers at Computerized Investing have been impressed by a new technical analysis package called Criterion STS ($688, Criterion Software Inc., 916 Southwood Blvd., Incline Village, Nev. 89450, 800-332-2999). ''It does basically what it says it will do,'' he said. **********CRITERION just introduced a somewhat different program at half the price, known as Criterion MTS. On Oct. 1, Criterion MTS suddenly flashed an alert: on a 1 to 100 scale, with 100 being, in effect, ''sell everything and head for the life rafts,'' the program signaled a 99. As of Thursday, it was not advising investors to return to the market. **********Membership in the American Association of Individual Investors (612 North Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Ill. 60611, 312-280-0170) is $48 a year; a subscription to Computerized Investing is $24 extra. **********Another group of interest to those who want to combine computers and investment is the Microcomputer Investment Association (902 Anderson Lane, Fredericksburg, Va. 22405, 703-371-5474).

Gianacakes, who is 62, will remain chairman and chief executive. Some company officers, including Mr. Gianacakes, have been invited to invest in the venture. **********The stock movement, however, seems to indicate that Wall Street expects a new bidder to emerge and push the offering price higher. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Research-Cottrell jumped $5.25 yesterday, to $44. It was the third-most-active issue, with 1.54 million shares changing hands. **********Jeremiah P. Cronin, Research-Cottrell's chief financial officer, said that, after a board meeting Friday evening, the company endorsed its sale to the Odyssey-Allen-First Chicago group as the highest bidder after its adviser, the First Boston Corporation, arranged a bidding contest among several potential buyers. **********Mr. Cronin said the company was originally approached with a pair of buyout offers a couple of months ago but ''the board decided it didn't want to look at just those two.'' They were not identified. Mr. Cronin stressed, however, that management had not initiated the sale. **********According to the Value Line Investment Survey, Research-Cottrell has been revamping its operations over the last four years to enter the lucrative business of upgrading waste water and waste management systems and to work with the Government in converting such services as municipal waste plants to private interests. Last year more than half the company's new business came from such growth areas. **********The deal would be the second investment of this kind for Odyssey Partners, formerly called Oppenheimer & Company and still headed by Leon Levy and Jack Nash as senior partners. Last year Odyssey bought control of Gundle Environmental Systems of Houston, a producer of heavy-duty plastic liners to contain toxic wastes. It has since sold some of the Gundle stock through Drexel Burnham Lambert. **********One person close to the bidders described Research-Cottrell as ''part of a growth industry.'' But he noted that ''it also has some risks'' because the company must bid for jobs and could bid too low. Also it has to post large performance bonds for some projects. **********Research-Cottrell has been bidding on jobs for 75 years, the company pointed out, and is familiar with the process. None of the company will be sold to finance the venture, it added. Novel Financing Twist **********In a novel twist to its role as financial adviser to the buyers, Drexel will provide its own funds for the deal on a temporary basis - known as bridge financing - which it will subsequently replace with new money to be raised through the sale of high-yield securities generally called ''junk bonds.'' **********Drexel has long been the unquestioned leader in raising money through junk bonds, but other Wall Street houses have devised bridge financing to compete with Drexel. Now Drexel, in turn, has adopted bridge financing itself to prevent the loss of clients. **********When junk bonds are involved, Drexel typically gives lenders a letter saying it is ''highly confident'' it can raise the money. With bridge financing, it issues a commitment letter guaranteeing to provide the money. Safer Procedure Sought **********Bridge financing is being used in this instance, it is understood, because the parties insisted on it as somewhat safer, though more expensive because of the commitment fees that borrowers have to pay. **********Under the terms of the definitive agreement, the investor group will ''shortly'' make a tender offer of $43 a share."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/02/business/securities-issues-set-a-record.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1987-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 669, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SECURITIES ISSUES SET A RECORD", "print_headline": "SECURITIES ISSUES SET A RECORD", "body_text": " **********An environment of generally steady, low interest rates proved fertile for securities underwriters in the first quarter, and the volume of bonds and stock issued by corporations soared to a record. **********A total of $87.7 billion in corporate securities was issued from January through March, the largest sum ever in a three-month period and up 29 percent from $68 billion in the first quarter of 1986, according to IDD Information Services. **********Most of that gain came from an increase in the amount of corporate bonds sold. Volume of this nonconvertible debt rose 29.4 percent, to $67.7 billion, from $52.3 billion a year earlier, according to IDD. Rate Drop Is Impetus **********The impetus for bonds was the drop in interest rates from levels of the last several years. Many corporations used the proceeds of their bond offerings to repay higher-rate bonds issued several years ago. They were also enticed to issue long-term bonds at rates with which they were comfortable, analysts said. **********''There's nothing like low interest rates to bring out the issuers,'' said James A. Stern, co-head of the primary markets group at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., adding, ''There was also tremendous demand by investors who wanted the long-term securities.'' **********The unusually heavy flow of stock offerings was the result of the bull run in the stock market. A total of $11.5 billion in stock was issued during the quarter, IDD said, up 32.2 percent from $8.7 billion. **********Even with such big increases, competition intensified among underwriters. Salomon Brothers Inc. hung on to its position as the biggest underwriter, but just barely. According to IDD, Salomon underwrote $13.26 billion in securities, down 19.6 percent from $16.5 billion a year earlier. **********More important, the firm's share of the market fell to 15 percent in the first quarter from 24 percent the year before. Salomon's underwritings of both debt and stock slipped, according to IDD. A Last-Minute Rush **********The firm did report a strong increase in underwritings of mortgage-related securities, but still gave up market share. Those numbers were bolstered by a flurry of offerings of mortgage-related securities late Tuesday, the last day in the quarter, in an effort to maintain its lead over First Boston Inc. **********First Boston also released a late rush of mortgage-related securities, but it could not catch its rival. First Boston finished with $12.63 billion in underwritings overall, according to IDD. **********There were some big shifts in the rankings. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets jumped to third from fifth, and Bear, Stearns & Company leaped from 16th to ninth. Drexel Falls Two Places **********Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. slipped to sixth place from fourth but maintained its dominant position in the market for higher-yield, lower-quality ''junk bonds,'' in spite of being the subject of a Government investigation. Drexel's junk bond underwritings jumped 59.5 percent, to $3.35 billion, from $2.1 billion during the first quarter of 1986, IDD said, giving it a 50 percent share of that market. **********The market for municipal securities also jumped. The total new offerings of municipal securities rose 119.5 percent, to $29.2 billion, from $13.3 billion, according to IDD. Sixty-three percent of these municipal bonds were used in refinancings to replace older, higher-rate bonds, IDD said. **********Most of that was accounted for by tax-exempt bonds.

Many, such as the California State Teachers Retirement System, are shifting their funds away from active managers whose records in the last five years suggest they cannot consistently predict the direction of interest rates and bond prices. **********Instead, these institutions are hiring index-fund managers who design bond portfolios that will match some index measuring the bond market. **********''There is still a widespread feeling that fixed-income securities are a reasonable asset class to be invested in,'' said Thomas E. Klaffky, a managing director at Salomon Brothers. But he added that some investors have been dissatisfied with indexes that merely duplicate the mix of maturities and types of securities that are outstanding. ''Investors are asking why they should buy the mix of securities that issuers want to sell,'' he said. Indexes matching the mix of outstanding debt securities are especially inappropriate, he added, for investors whose liabilities have a longer duration than the duration of a market index. The Latest Product **********For investors who like the low cost of an indexed portfolio and are convinced that over time it will offer a better return than one that tries to outguess the market, Salomon Brothers yesterday introduced a new wrinkle called the Targeted Index Matrix. **********In effect, the new product is a formalized version of what many investment managers have been doing informally - creating a special index that matches the needs of a particular investor. For example, the pension fund of a new high-technology company with no retired workers ought to emphasise longer-term securities becaue its liabilities are much more distant than those of a steel company with many retired workers. **********The matrix offered by Salomon allows each investor to select a mixture of corporate, mortage and Treasury securities that matches the desired duration of the portfolio (which will vary depending on the duration of the liabilities of the investor). **********After the investor selects how much is to be held in a core portfolio of corporate and mortage securities, which currently have a duration of about five years, a portfolio of Treasury issues is designed to create the desired duration for the entire portfolio. Because the Treasury market is the largest and most liquid part of the credit markets and offers securities with durations ranging from one day to 30 years, it is the sector of the market best suited for the frequent transactions needed to keep the portfolio in balance. **********Although Salomon Brothers is not an investment-management firm, it hopes that institutions using its indexes will end up doing their trading through the firm. Because index-fund managers must pay close attention to the changing composition of an index and often adjust the mix of their holdings,''there is opportunity for a lot of dialogue that can mean business'' for the bond-trading and underwriting activities that are Salomon's bread and butter, one executive at the firm said. **********Following are results of yesterday's auction of two-year Treasury notes: **********(000 omitted in dollar figures)  Average Price 99.800  Average Yield 7.86%  Low Price 99.800  High Yield 7.86  High Price 99.873  Low Yield 7.82%  Accepted at low price 79%  Total applied for  $31,414,400  Accepted  $9,807,105  N.Y. applied for  $27,005,905  N.Y. accepted  $7,869,015  Noncompetitive  $1,251,000  Interest set at 7 3/4%  The two-year notes mature Aug. 31, 1989."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/19/business/dow-rises-only-2.13-but-sets-record.html": {"writer_name": "John Crudele", "pub_date": "1987-03-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 654, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Rises Only 2.13 but Sets Record", "print_headline": "Dow Rises Only 2.13 but Sets Record", "body_text": " **********What seemed destined to be a historic day on Wall Street turned into only a slightly memorable one as the Dow Jones industrial average rose above 2,300 for the first time but did not stay there. **********When the session was over, the Dow was at its highest closing level ever, but the gain was only 2.13 points, to 2,286.93.

Witching Hour Looms **********Most of the unpredictability, market experts said, is the result of tomorrow's ''triple witching hour,'' when stock index futures, index options and regular stock options all expire and when the stock market has been subject to dramatic swings and extremely heavy trading. **********Some experts still think tomorrow's session could bring wild swings in prices. But most are coming to the opinion that this triple witching hour could turn out to be dull. **********''I think you are getting a little bit of premature unwinding'' of option and futures contracts, Mr. Deutsch said. ''Friday could be a bit of a non-event.'' **********Yesterday was not very eventful either, in spite of the fact that various important indexes inched their ways to new highs.

European Influence **********''Europeans got excited in the morning, and they were buying stock,'' said John Havens, head of the trading desk at Morgan Stanley & Company, who said stock index futures prices at one point were high enough to pull Wall Street along. **********Soon afterward, however, programs to buy large amounts of stock turned into programs to sell. ''The buyers,'' Mr. Havens said, ''just pulled away.'' **********Oil stocks, however, continued to interest investors who believe that the recent rise in crude prices might benefit the industry. Phillips Petroleum, for instance, led the consolidated active list, gaining 5/8, to 15 3/8, on volume of 4.4 million shares. **********USX, which is deeply involved in the oil business, rose 1 1/4, to 27 7/8, and was the second-most-active issue. Its volume was 4.1 million shares. Other energy-related issues on the active list were Occidental Petroleum, up 1 1/8, to 33 1/4, and Schlumberger, up 5/8, to 40. Management of Schlumberger's Fairchild Semiconductor unit plans to acquire that business. Gencorp Gains 18 **********The biggest gain of the day was turned in by Gencorp, which rose 18, to 106, in busy trading. A group led by AFG Industries and two Texas investors made a $100-a-share tender offer for Gencorp stock. Speculators are obviously expecting higher offers and bid the stock past the offer price. **********American Express, an active issue, rose 1, to 78 5/8. The stock was moved in part by speculation that the company would soon sell a stake in its brokerage unit to a Japanese insurance company. American Express declined comment. **********Bristol-Myers gained 4 5/8, to 107.

The accord included, among other things, partial repayment by France of a large debt to Iran and the eventual restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries, which have been severed since July. Ransom Is Denied **********At the European summit meeting in Copenhagen Friday and Saturday, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac assured Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that no ransom was paid for the release, and the British leader said she accepted the assertion as true. **********In an interview here today, a senior French diplomat denied that the deal included a pledge to withdraw the French fleet patrolling the Persian Gulf to guard against Iranian mining and attacks on neutral shipping. **********''We have not polluted French foreign policy,'' the diplomat said, pointedly adding that France, unlike the United States, had not agreed to supply Iran with weapons. **********The diplomat said that contrary to recent press reports, a payment of $330 million to Iran had not been made, but would be soon. As for the expulsion of the Iranian dissidents, the source went on to say that this was ''a small price to pay, especially that the only thing they are good at is propaganda, not real opposition.'' **********The group's leader, Massoud Rajavi, was himself induced to leave France in June 1986, abandoning his headquarters at the village of Auvers-sur-Oise, a distant suburb of Paris, as part of an earlier deal to release hostages.

At Least 20 Are Held **********Habib Naweb, a spokesman for the group, said that at last count at least 20 members had been arrested. He said they were held in detention centers at police stations and the police headquarters here. ''It is another phase of the normalization of relations between Khomeini and France,'' he said in an interview. ''This isn't of any benefit to France. Khomeini will only ask for more. The French are paying a heavy ransom to the Iranian regime.'' **********According to the New York office of the group, the Mujahedeen members who were arrested in France began a hunger strike to protest the action. Activities of Dissidents **********The People's Mujahedeen has had the highest profile among all the Iranian groups opposed to the regime of Ayatollah Khomeini that are active in the United States, France, and Western Europe.

Edelman and Dominion Textile Inc., which is Canada's largest textile concern. The latest sweetener adds roughly $64 million to the Morgan group's $2.5 billion deal. **********Earlier in the day, Burlington's stock closed at $74.875, down 37.5 cents. Morgan Stanley's lenders said they would not provide financing for the deal if Burlington posted a $500 million bond in keeping with a ruling, issued last Friday, that grew out of a suit brought by Burlington in Federal District Court in Greensboro, N.C. $500 Million Bond a Prerequisite The bond is a prerequisite for a preliminary injunction that would bar the Edelman-Dominion team from buying shares under its offer. **********Burlington has charged the investors with misappropriating inside information by relying on the help of a former Burlington executive, James J. Ammeen, in preparing a raid on the company. The bond would compensate the investors in the event that the court later determines that the charges have wrongly kept the Edelman-Dominion group from buying the company. **********Burlington has returned to Federal court to challenge the size of the bond, and the rival bidders have appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond. Former Employee Speaks Out **********In an interview yesterday, Mr. Ammeen, who had left Burlington in November 1985, responded to questions raised about his work with the Edelman-Dominion group in the early stages of the takeover fight. Mr. Ammeen said he had not violated confidentiality agreements he signed with the company.  [ Page D4. ]  Meanwhile, the litigation has clouded both bids. Shareholders are concerned that Mr. Edelman might be hamstrung by the injunction at the same time that Morgan Stanley is having trouble soothing its lenders' fears about a huge potential liability if the lawsuit is dismissed. **********By raising its offer, Morgan Stanley still leaves open the question of why its lenders would welcome a $78-a-share bid when they previously had concerns about a $76-a-share offer. **********A Morgan Stanley spokesman said the company was confident it could get the bond reduced in court. But the announcement suggested at least to some outsiders that Burlington had chosen not to post the bond -rather than upset Morgan Stanley's financing. Edelman Group in Study **********''At first glance, it would appear that they're not posting the bond,'' said Corey Horowitz, a partner of Mr. Edelman, ''and if they don't post the bond, that means we're not enjoined, and that means we could raise our bid.'' **********The takeover battle began on May 6, when the Edelman-Dominion group offered to buy the remaining Burlington shares for $67 a share. Since then, the group has raised its offer three times, first to $72 and then to $77. In a defensive move before the Morgan Stanley proposal, Burlington said on May 11 that it would buy back up to eight million of its common shares at $80 a share. **********Representatives of Mr. Edelman and Dominion, who own 3.4 million shares altogether, or about 12.3 percent, have met in the past with their counterparts at Morgan Stanley to discuss a possible settlement of the battle. The question now is whether the outside bidders will settle for the $6.8 million in additional profit that the newest bid would give them, or press their fight. **********One person close to Burlington said he expected the Edelman-Dominion team to accept the latest proposal.

On an annual basis, the increases so far this year translate into an inflation rate of 6.2 percent. **********Although the overall rise in the index was the same as in February, several economists pointed to other figures that suggest, they said, that price increases are a source of concern. **********''I'm getting a little uncomfortable,'' commented Robert G. Dederick, a former Commerce Department official who is now executive vice president of the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. ''This is going to have to be closely watched.'' **********Prices in the New York and northeastern New Jersey area rose five-tenths of 1 percent in March.  [ Page 39. ]  Economists said that even when food and energy, two of the most volatile components, were excluded, the index advanced in the first quarter at an annual rate of 5.2 percent, up from 3.7 percent in the quarters ended last Sept. 30 and Dec. 31. **********The Reagan Administration said that inflation remained well under control and that the increases this year have resulted mainly from a rise in oil prices, which had fallen to unsustainably low levels. **********Asked about today's report, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d declared, ''In our view, that reflects primarily what we have been saying would be the case for quite some time, and that is an increase in oil prices.'' **********The price of gasoline and heating oil rose in March, though at a slower pace than in February. But there were also substantial price increases for a broad array of goods and services. **********The index for apparel and such related services as dry cleaning, for example, leaped 1.7 percent last month, the biggest jump since August 1974. **********The Labor Department said the introduction of new, higher-priced spring and summer merchandise, particularly women's clothing, was mainly responsible. Private analysts noted that the increase for clothing also reflected the dollar's weakness against foreign currencies. **********Clothing is imported in large quantities, and the low value of the dollar allows domestic producers to raise prices, too. The price of infants' and toddlers' apparel soared 5 percent last month while women's and girls' clothes climbed 2.4 percent. Footwear was up 1.7 percent. 'Disturbing' Figures **********Today's report prompted an economist at one New York bank to say he would ''have to rethink'' his prediction that consumer inflation would climb no higher than 3 1/2 to 4 percent this year. A 1.1 percent rate was recorded in 1986, with the aid of collapsing oil and gas prices. **********This analyst, who asked not to be identified, said he was still evaluating the report, but he called the figures ''disturbing.'' **********The rising cost of imports has clearly become an important factor in assessing inflation trends. Thursday's report on the gross national product disclosed that the price of imports, which includes a substantial amount of oil, climbed at a 13.5 percent rate in the first quarter. **********''I'd keep an eye on that area,'' Daniel Friel, economist at the North Carolina National Bank, said. Transportation Costs Up **********Prices in the important transportation sector rose six-tenths of 1 percent last month. The price of gasoline was up 2.3 percent; used cars rose 2.1 percent, and automobile insurance rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, bringing its 12-month increase to 9.5 percent. The rise in used-car prices was the third in a row, after 11 monthly declines. Prices of new cars were essentially unchanged after falling 1 percent in February, the department said. **********The cost of housing rose four-tenths of 1 percent, the same as the month before, as the prices of heating oil and electricity rose while natural gas declined. Charges for cable television, which jumped 1.2 percent last month, are now 4.5 percent higher than in December. Only Decline Is for Food **********Food and beverages made up the only one of the index's seven main components to show a price decline, minimal though it was. The cost of food in grocery stores fell four-tenths of 1 percent after rising by that amount in February. Declines for fruits and vegetables, dairy products and other items more than offset small rises for cereal and bakery products and meats, poultry, fish and eggs. Restaurant meals rose at a rate of four-tenths of 1 percent. **********The indexes for medical care, entertainment and other goods and services all rose by either four-tenths or five-tenths of 1 percent, the Labor Department said. **********The C.P.I.-U, which covers all urban consumers, now stands at 335.9, which means that a basket of goods and services that cost $10 in 1967 now costs $33.59. The ''old'' index, using 1972-73 expenditure patterns instead of the new 1982-1984 patterns that were introduced in February, also rose four-tenths of 1 percent last month. **********The C.P.I.-W, which covers urban wage earners and clerical workers, rose five-tenths of 1 percent, the Government said. **********Today's C.P.I.-U report also showed no acceleration in the price of services, which rose by four-tenths of 1 percent for the third consecutive month. Commodities rose by five-tenths of 1 percent for the second month. **********Upward pressure on prices was most evident in the Northeast and North Central states. In the Northeast, cities with populations between 500,000 and 1.2 million showed an increase of nine-tenths of 1 percent in March.  CONSUMER PRICE INDEX  Percent change       $      Index   Pct.

After an up-and-down day, the popular yardstick of 30 blue-chip stocks finished with a small gain for a 13th consecutive advance, its longest string ever. **********The 1.97-point rise in the Dow, to a record 2,104.47, masked a day of price swings and bouts of heavy profit taking that left most other indicators signaling that the extraordinary market advance might be running out of steam. **********One signal was the lack of clear direction. The market's direction turned several times during the day and the Dow was down by as much as 10 points early in the afternoon. Advances led declines only slightly on the New York Stock Exchange, with 849 issues up and 811 down. Also, the Dow transportation average, which often serves to confirm the trend in the industrial average, fell 4.72 points, to 877.79. Turnover soared to 224.8 million shares, from 162.8 million shares Monday, when the Dow jumped 25.87 points. **********The market ''sort of has lost some of that sharpness, that sense of relentlessness,'' said Monte Gordon, director of research for the Dreyfus Corporation. ''It seems to be struggling a little bit to keep its momentum.'' Other money managers agreed, saying they expected to see the market pull back for one of its classic corrections after a fast march upward.  [ Marketplace, Page D8. ]  Also holding back the Dow average yesterday was the downturn of one of its key components, International Business Machines, which fell 2 1/2, to 122 3/4. The company announced fourth-quarter earnings early in the session that were considered slightly worse than expected. **********The failure of the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks to advance to a new high ''indicated to us that even the issues that have been carrying the market are now tired,'' said John M. Blin, who heads a company bearing his name that designs trading programs. The S.&P. 500 declined 0.30 point, to 269.04. **********But the ''flashing red light'' to Mr. Blin was the uncommonly sharp drop in the prices of stock index futures after the Big Board closed. Stock index futures trading ends 15 minutes after the exchanges close at 4 P.M. New York time.  ''In that 15 minutes, many big institutions were heavy sellers of index futures,'' Mr. Blin noted. ''It could mean that the institutions believed the market will break Wednesday and were eager to hedge their portfolios with index futures. If the market does break, they hope to balance their portfolio losses with the gains from the shorting of futures.'' Selling short in the futures market involves a promise to deliver a certain number of contracts at a specific price at a future date. If the contracts are priced lower at the time of delivery, the seller makes a profit. **********But if the market opens sharply higher, Mr. Blin expects that the hedgers will quickly buy out of their index futures contracts and move more cash into actual shares, at least for another day. **********Donald. M. Selkin, Prudential-Bache Securities' head of stock index futures research, agreed and pointed out that the two key index futures, the S.&P. 500 and the Major Market Index, were so heavily sold short after the stock exchanges closed that their normal premiums over their underlying indexes had shrunk to abnormal levels. Those levels typically attract speculators who sell stocks and buy futures to lock in a profit. ''Wednesday could witness an abrupt end to the current market advance,'' Mr. Selkin said.  Newton D.

The vote on the bill, whose retaliatory provisions would fall heavily on Japan, came as Japan's Prime Minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, met with President Reagan and Senate leaders. **********The strong vote reflects the political pressure to act on trade, not support for some of the bill's main provisions, over which members are split. **********''Regardless of the substance, everyone knows where the politics are,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn. ''The political pressure is all in one direction on this.'' **********Nonetheless, some members said that if the proposal were not moderated, they would not vote to override a Presidential veto. **********The legislation goes to the Senate, where the Finance Committee is working on a less retaliatory version. The full Senate is expected to debate a bill in June. Many members supported the House bill while hoping that changes will be made in the Senate or in the eventual House-Senate conference. Gephardt Amendment Included **********The trade bill includes the amendment offered by Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, that requires retaliation according to a rigid formula against countries that have built up large trade surpluses and are found to have shut out American products. **********That amendment was narrowly approved Wednesday, by a vote of 218 to 214, and House Speaker Jim Wright, Democrat of Texas, acknowledged today that the close vote means the amendment will be modified in the Senate or in conference to ease its retaliatory effect. **********But there is much more to the trade bill. The overall legislation is a broad list of remedies, many of which are opposed by the Reagan Administration, that supporters say would bring a new tough stance to American trade policy even if the Gephardt amendment is weakened. **********''I think it sends a strong signal that the House is determined to respond to the demand of the American people for an assertive trade policy,'' Mr. Wright said.  The vote on the Gephardt amendment in the House reflects a division about both the substance of trade policy and the political strategy needed to approve a bill the President could eventually accept. The main disagreement is over how strong retaliation should be against unfair trade practices. **********Today's vote closely followed party lines, as only 43 Republicans voted for the bill and only 6 Democrats voted against it. But Republicans and Democrats in the House are more in agreement on trade than the vote shows. In an alternative they offered today, Republicans endorsed most provisions of the bill that was ultimately approved. **********The Reagan Administration is opposed to most of the bill's major provisions, including those endorsed by the Republican legislators. The opposition was outlined in a letter signed by the President's Cabinet secretaries Wednesday. **********This means it might not be as easy as the Administration thinks to use the split over retaliatory policy to win major changes in the bill, as the Senate acts and the two versions go to a conference where a compromise will be worked out. Congress, therefore, could approve a trade bill that the Administration still opposes, setting up a major confrontation this summer. **********''From the Administration's point of view, the split is not meaningful,'' Mr. Gephardt said of the votes on his amendment and the overall bill. ''It isn't much of a division that the Administration can exploit.'' The Republican Alternative **********Before final approval, the House defeated the Republican alternative on a party-line vote of 268 to 156. The provisions that it dropped included the Gephardt amendment, registration of foreign investments, mandatory exchange rate negotiations and a ''Buy America'' ban on Government purchase of goods from countries that discriminate against American suppliers. **********But the Republicans did keep a provision, which the Administration opposes, that requires some mandatory retaliation against the unfair trade practices of countries with large trade surpluses. The retaliation, in tariffs or quotas, would equal the dollar amount of American trade lost because of closed markets. **********The Republicans did drop the Gephardt portion, which is a second step of retaliation against nations with ''excessive'' surpluses. It requires reduction of these trade surpluses if the unfair trade practices persist. **********In votes on other amendments today, the House, by 232 to 183, approved revoking most-favored-nation status for Rumania, meaning that imports from that nation would no longer be subject to the lowest tariffs possible. While current law prohibits most-favored-nation status for countries that do not allow their citizens to emigrate, Rumania has received annual Presidential waivers. **********Supporters of the amendment argued that the vote would send a message to Rumania to pay attention to human rights. Opponents said it would make it more difficult for Americans to help people in Rumania. **********An effort to delete the provision in the bill requiring disclosure of foreign investment in the United States was defeated, 230 to 190. Opponents of the disclosure argued it would discourage foreign investment. **********An amendment to strike the ''Buy America'' provision lost on a standing vote of 17 to 8.  Major Provisions of Trade Bill  Following are the main provisions of the omnibus trade bill approved in the House of Representatives yesterday:  RETALIATION  Requires mandatory retaliation against unfair trade practices on a case-by-case basis and gives the Administration discretionary power.  Separately, requires retaliation against countries whose large trade surpluses with the United States are based on unfair trade practices. If negotiations to remove the practices fail, the Government first imposes tariffs or quotas equal to the value of U.S. trade lost. If the unfair practices persist, the Gephardt amendment requires the Administration to take action, through import bans or cancellation of trade agreements, to reduce the country's trade surplus by 10 percent a year.  IMPORT AND EXPORT AID  Establishes an Industrial Competitiveness Council to promote U.S. competitiveness and productivity.  Expands the existing Trade Adjustment Assistance program for retraining workers displaced by foreign competition.  MARKETS  Pressures Japanto open its financial markets to U.S. firms. If not, Japanese firms in U.S. lose their primary dealership, which allows them to buy and sell Government bonds.

Such requirements ''are almost certainly unconstitutional,'' he said, adding that the time has come to challenge the constitutionality of aspects of decades' worth of other corporate regulations. **********He also said that, unlike political speech, the First Amendment did not and should not protect false or misleading statements by businesses. **********One Federal judge in New York, who not too long ago ruled in a landmark case involving the constitutionality of a Federal securities law, took Mr. Neuborne's position a step further. ''I don't see any reason why a corporate issuer of securities has to be silent during the period between a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the time in which the sale is approved,'' said the judge in an interview, speaking on condition that he not be identified. Federal securities laws limit what an issuer of a stock or bond may say between the date the offering is filed with the S.E.C. and the date it becomes effective. **********''I think that amounts to an improper prior restraint,'' the judge said. ''That's not to say that officers shouldn't be punished for committing fraud or being deceptive or something like that. But there is a strong tradition in the law that it be used to punish someone after they've acted wrongly, not to chill them beforehand.'' **********But Kenneth J. Bialkin, a corporate lawyer at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, disagreed. He said the limitations before a stock offering were not really restrictions on speech, but an effort to prevent the sale of a security before a registration statement with the S.E.C. becomes effective. **********In a direct response to Mr. Neuborne, Prof. Frederick Schauer of the University of Michigan School of Law said that those who advocated the use of the First Amendment in order to deregulate the marketplace might be seriously undermining free expression in other areas. **********''Burt wants less paternalism,'' said Mr. Schauer, ''and the economic analysts want more of a free market. Those views ought to be argued about in the political arena and perhaps under other constitutional provisions. I do not see the First Amendment as the appropriate lever for general views about Government regulation. If we do use it as that lever, we may discover that it snaps.'' **********The Supreme Court only began shaping the constitutional guidelines on the speech rights of companies about a decade ago, during the Burger Court. The area has become known as commercial speech, and a majority of the cases have concerned the manner in which businesses can advertise. **********The Court has struck down laws restricting advertisements for drugstores, lawyers and abortion clinics. It has also upheld restrictions on advertisements by casinos in Puerto Rico and a law that required The Pittsburgh Press to print certain classified advertisements. **********Congress is considering measures that would restrict the speech of some companies. House and Senate committees have held hearings on proposals to either ban or tax cigarette advertisements. **********At the judicial conference, which ended yesterday morning, Floyd Abrams, the noted First Amendment lawyer at Cahill Gordon & Reindel, said that it was only a matter of time before free speech arguments would be used by top corporate officials involved in takeover battles. **********''Elections of company leaders, like political elections, involve some of the most important choices that are made in society,'' said Mr. Abrams. ''I think it's not too far off to foresee a case in which there is a corporate takeover and one side will claim that the other is providing less than full information, and the other side will step up to the plate and say that the S.E.C. has no authority to demand all this information.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/16/business/cadillac-s-allante-is-struggling-to-find-its-niche.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1987-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cadillac's Allante Is Struggling to Find Its Niche", "print_headline": "Cadillac's Allante Is Struggling to Find Its Niche", "body_text": " **********The two-seater, $55,000 Allante model was billed as the ''new spirit of Cadillac'' when it was introduced last March. But judging from sales thus far, the spirit may still be willing, but consumer interest is weak. **********Cadillac officials concede that they are disappointed by the sales figures, but insist that the Allante is accomplishing its primary goal: re-establishing the Cadillac brand as the equal of European models like Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar. **********The success or failure of the Allante may have important implications for Cadillac and its parent, the General Motors Corporation - both of which have been suffering from lackluster sales and a declining market share. First Move In a Larger Plan **********The introduction of the Allante marked the first move in a larger plan to push all Cadillac models up into the highly profitable, ''ultra luxury'' segment. Sticker prices range from about $40,000 to $75,000 in this segment, which is now dominated by the Europeans and is soon to be invaded by the Japanese. **********Unlike most Cadillacs, which have been known for their plush interiors, soft rides and gas-guzzling engines, the Allante was intended to be a taut, European-style roadster. Indeed, Cadillac bypassed its own designers and signed up Pininfarina, the Italian company best known for its Ferrari designs, to do the exterior styling and actually build the bodies for the new car. **********Cadillac officials confidently predicted they would sell 6,000 Allantes a year, or about 500 a month. Early sales did not reach this target, but were respectable, ranging from about 250 to 280 a month. But in September sales plunged to 107 cars and rebounded only slightly in October and early November, raising questions outside G.M. about the model's long-range prospects, particularly since the stock market's collapse has thrown the outlook for all high-priced cars into question. Customers Balk at Price **********Dealers generally praise the car, but say customers are having trouble accepting the Allante's stiff price. ''It is going to take awhile for American buyers to get used to paying over $50,000 for a domestic car,'' said David A. Banks, a Cadillac dealer in Concord, N.H. **********Rob Mancuso, a Cadillac dealer in the Chicago area, agrees. ''There does appear to be price resistance to a Cadillac in this range,'' he said. ''If it said Maserati on the side of the car, there would be no problem.'' **********General Motors once defined automotive luxury in this country, with its big, chrome-bedecked Cadillacs, Buicks and Oldsmobiles. But younger, affluent buyers have shown a preference for cars with nimble handling, like Mercedes and BMW. In recent years these brands, despite their costs, have stolen sales from G.M.'s more expensive models and contributed to the company's lackluster earnings, according to analysts. **********''The main objective of Allante is, and always has been, what it can do for Cadillac as a whole, not mass production,'' said John O. Grettenberger, the general manager of the division. **********With just two seats, a 130-mile-an-hour top speed and removable soft and hard tops, the Allante is clearly patterned after the Mercedes-Benz 560SL roadster, which sells for $61,000. ''It is accomplishing the image effects we hoped for,'' Mr. Grettenberger said. ''Dealers are proud that we have a car of that caliber.'' **********But some outsiders disagree, saying the Allante does not make a bold enough statement to set a new tone for the division. ''The Allante did not proclaim anything new, interesting or different,'' observed Leon Mandel, a columnist with Autoweek magazine. ''But nothing else would have gotten approved. It had to adhere to G.M. orthodoxy.'' **********Despite the recent sales slump, Cadillac is taking a long view toward the Allante, Mr. Grettenberger insists. ''My No. 1 objective is to establish the car as a credible competitor in the ultra luxury segement. We are intending to establish it and grow and enhance our position in the marketplace through only the highest-level promotion and refinements to the car,'' he said. G.M., he added, would not try to increase sales by means of special promotions or incentives that might undercut its image. Incentive Leasing Campaign Set **********Nevertheless, Cadillac has quietly mounted an incentive leasing campaign to clear out the unsold 1987 models. The incentives include 6.5 percent financing on 48-month leases, compared with 10.6 percent on standard leases, and payments of $100 to sales managers and $100 to $1,000 for salesmen for each Allante moved out of the showroom. **********To reassure prospective buyers, Cadillac is considering adopting a program intended to guarantee the resale value of the car - just as the Ford Motor Company did when it introduced its German-made Merkur Scorpio model earlier this year. **********The Ford program ties the value of used Scorpios to Mercedes-Benz 190's of the same vintage. If the Scorpio sells for less, Ford has pledged to make up the difference. The Allante's value would be tied to the Mercedes Benz 560SL, if such a program is offered, Mr. Grettenberger said. **********The Allante has been a learning experience not only for the division but for the Cadillac dealers who are faced with the task of luring customers in and getting them to pay $50,000 for a domestic car. ''It's not something people just walk in and order,'' Mr. Grettenberger said. ''In many cases the sales are being consummated in their offices, restaurants and homes.'' Buyers Are Often Fussy **********Cadillac officials have also found that buyers in this price class are much more fussy about color than the average consumer. At introduction, the car came in white, silver, gold and maroon. White and silver sold well, gold moderately well and maroon hardly at all. Most of the leftover 1987 models being offered under the incentive are maroon. **********For 1988, Cadillac dropped the maroon and added red and black as colors. As Maryann N. Keller, an auto industry analyst observed, ''After all, people who spend $55,000 for a car want to be noticed.'' **********Most Allante buyers so far have been men who live in large cities and have an appetite for the new and unusual and the income to indulge their interests. ''We're taking exotic cars in trade, things like Merkurs and Jaguars,'' said Bill Symes, a dealer in Pasadena, Calif. He described the buyers as ''car nuts'' who feel compelled to drive the latest model. Because the car has two seats, ''it's not very practical as a family car,'' he noted. **********Cadillac officials say they intend to refine the Allante gradually in the European fashion to broaden its appeal. In addition, plans are being considered to expand the line. **********''Cadillac deserves to be in the ultra luxury segment,'' Mr. Grettenberger said. It remains to be seen, however, whether consumers agree with him."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/20/business/industry-reluctant-to-spend.html": {"writer_name": "Louis Uchitelle", "pub_date": "1987-04-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1861, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INDUSTRY RELUCTANT TO SPEND", "print_headline": "INDUSTRY RELUCTANT TO SPEND", "body_text": " **********The Exxon Corporation's petrochemicals business is enjoying good times. Profits are rising, demand is brisk and most of its plants are operating nearly flat out. **********In days gone by, Exxon would have almost automatically built a new plant or two so that impatient customers would not be tempted to take their orders elsewhere. **********No more. Instead of expansion, Exxon is squeezing additional production from existing facilities through small and inexpensive steps such as installing pipes with wider diameters, reducing maintenance downtime and teaching staff to operate high-tech equipment more efficiently. **********Investing billions of dollars in new capacity on the basis of forecasts of significant growth ''has proven to be a terribly painful experience'' for the chemical industry, said Kenneth N. Robertson, a vice president of Exxon Chemical, whose overcapacity forced it to sell one plant and close another in 1985. A Reluctance to Build **********If Exxon is more cautious about capital investment, so are many other manufacturers. In industries ranging from autos to electric utilities to appliances, there is a reluctance to build factories or replace the equipment used in production. **********That reluctance, if it persists - and there is strong evidence that it will -could hobble the economy for years. Capital spending has been a powerful engine of economic growth in the postwar years, and the stimulus it can provide is especially needed now. With so much concern that the other engine, consumer spending, is cooling off, capital spending or the lack of it could determine whether the economy continues to grow or slides into recession. **********Many economists and business executives are convinced that the years of robust capital investment are over for a while. ''Long term, the trend is slowly down, not up,'' said Irwin Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Bank. Even Paul A. Samuelson, the Nobel laureate in economics who considers himself an optimist on capital spending, does not look for a rapid expansion. ''I do not see a collapse,'' Professor Samuelson said, ''but I don't see a new era either. In fact, I'm quite surprised that we are doing as well as we are.'' **********Capital spending climbed a hefty 17 percent in 1984 and another 9 percent in 1985 as the nation worked its way out of a recession. That provided a mighty contribution to growth early in the current recovery. Modest Growth Is Forecast **********This spending surge, however, followed a two-year period of decline. And the recovery was short-lived: Last year, capital spending fell by 3.1 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars, and the Commerce Department, in a survey of capital spending plans released last week, forecast a rise of only 1.8 percent for this year. **********While spending is increasing in paper, textiles, and food, some big guns of capital investment - auto, steel, computer and utility companies, for example - are shrinking their outlays, and the oil industry has no plans to increase spending significantly. **********Most forecasts see capital spending increasing again in 1988. After next year, however, it is expected to subside. Neither the Commerce Department nor such private forecasting services as Wharton Econometrics and McGraw-Hill's Data Resources Inc. hold out hope that capital investment will grow at more than a 4 percent average annual rate before the mid-1990's. **********That would keep it just ahead of the expected annual increase in the gross national product - hardly the stimulant that spending has been in the past, when it climbed at two or three times the rate of economic expansion. A Range of Roadblocks **********But too many obstacles are piling up for history to repeat itself: *********** The chief obstacle is the emergence of the global marketplace. With efficient, low-cost producers in such countries as Taiwan, Korea, Brazil and Japan competing against them, American corporations are under intense pressure to lower their prices. For that reason, American executives are demanding that a given investment reduce their companies' manufacturing costs. They also insist that such projects generate higher financial returns. The upshot: Fewer capital-spending projects are winning approval. *********** Worldwide production overcapacity in many industries is taking its toll. Because of the overcapacity, American business has abandoned a traditional reason for capital investment: Having enough factories on hand to stay a step ahead of the seemingly insatiable market. ''The thinking that prompted us to buy three machines instead of one, to allow for growth, is gone'' said John Hackett, chief financial officer at The Cummins Engine Company. *********** The growing tendency to buy parts and components abroad, rather than make them in-house, is cutting into capital spending, particularly in the auto, steel and electronics industries. *********** The volatile dollar and the big trade deficit add to the risk of capital investment and inhibit it. A plant that might be cost-competitive in the world market with the dollar at its current low level could easily become a money-loser if and when the dollar rebounds. Optimists assume American companies will capture a larger share of both domestic and international markets because of the weak dollar and therefore will expand production. Others, such as Robert Ortner, Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, are not sure that foreign competitors will be so easily dislodged. ''There has been some pickup in manufacturing activity from an improvement in our trade position,'' he said, ''but not enough yet to justify much capital investment.'' *********** After a decade of disappointing productivity gains from automating their factories and offices, companies are much more wary about investing in high-tech equipment. High-tech equipment accounted for more than 30 percent of capital expenditures last year, up from a 12 percent share in the early 1970's. But this spending is now being cut. *********** The expanding service sector does not require as much capital outlay as manufacturing because its principal tool, the computer, is not as costly as heavy machinery. *********** The new tax law is hurting capital spending - although it is still unclear what the ultimate impact will be. Executives in the steel and paper industies, for example, argue that their cash flow, upon which capital investment depends, will be hit hard by the elimination of such measures as the investment tax credit. **********One doomsayer, the Harvard economist Lawrence H. Summers, said the new law would raise the effective tax rate on most types of investment by 20 percentage points, which means an investment's yield would have to be higher to offset the tax bite. ''In the long run, this may well reduce the stock of plant and equipment by 10 to 15 percent,'' Professor Summers wrote in the current issue of the Harvard Business Review. **********Four examples follow of the sea change in capital spending: Cummins Engine A maker of diesel motors for heavy trucks, Cummins is disillusioned with high-tech investment. Partly as a result, its capital spending will decline this year to $150 million, from $280 million in 1986. **********''Earlier, we jumped too quickly into robotics on the assumption that the way we got productivity was to eliminate employees,'' Mr. Hackett said. ''Now we think in terms of work flow: how to reduce the handling of material so that we don't need so much hardware.'' **********Work-flow improvements, in fact, permitted Cummins to close a components plant in Columbus, Ind., its headquarters city, without reducing the company's overall production. **********The key was the elimination of a number of unnecessary procedures. ''We found, for example, that we were machining parts, moving them to a warehouse for storage, then bringing them back to complete the motor assembly,'' Mr. Hackett said. ''We've eliminated the warehousing.'' **********Cummins is also eliminating high-based stackers - expensive, computerized, vertical storage bins that automatically deliver parts for assembly. ''It was a good idea in the 70's but an inefficient use of capital today,'' Mr. Hackett said. ''Just-in-time delivery is better.'' Ford Motor **********A tougher emphasis on profitability to get through periods of slack demand is causing Ford to forgo capital-spending projects it once would have undertaken. **********For example, it has given up manufacturing paints for its vehicles after deciding that the return on the investment required to upgrade its paint factory in Mount Clemens, Mich., would be too low. **********So last August, the paint factory, with 500 employees, was sold to E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, which already has a paint-making business and could absorb the Mount Clements plant with less of an investment than Ford would have had to make, said William Selover, an executive in Ford's diversified products and components division. **********Like so many other big companies, Ford is also going abroad for parts. It entered into a joint venture in Mexico in 1982 to manufacture plastic dashboards, mostly for cars sold there. Now Ford draws on the Mexican plant for nearly all the plastic dashboards installed in vehicles made in the United States. Champion International **********A major goal of Champion, the nation's largest paper company, is to get more production - and thus more profit - from existing equipment. Although most of Champion's paper mills are running at more than 90 percent of capacity, the company is resisting plant construction. **********At its Bucksport, Me., white-paper mill, the strategy has meant a $100 million investment to improve the paper-coating process and to rebuild the existing machinery. The incremental new tonnage is the most profitable because it comes with little additional operating cost. **********In a similar vein, more than $500 million in new machinery or improvements to existing equipment are under way or under study for plants in Upper Michigan and Canada. Champion's last new mill came on line more than a year ago, and the company, which acquired St. Regis in 1984, has no plans for more. Goodyear Tire **********Capital spending is seen as a bigger risk at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, which amassed a mountain of debt to shake off Sir James Goldsmith, the British raider. To ward off his takeover attempt last year, Goodyear bought back half its stock at a cost of $2.6 billion. **********The outlay more than doubled the company's debt, to $4 billion. The considerable cost of servicing this debt means that Goodyear, based in Akron, Ohio, cannot afford to take a chance on any project that might lose money, said Mark Blitstein, its director of investor relations. **********''We have to be more conservative than ever about capital investment and also research spending,'' he said. The downside, he acknowledged, is ''that companies that can't afford risk don't make the breakthroughs'' in technology and productivity. **********Goodyear's capital investment fell last year to $582 million, from $619 million in 1985, and will continue to decline slowly through 1989, Mr. Blitstein said. While Goodyear has completed a $250 million conversion of its Tyler, Tex., plant into a state-of-the-art radial tire manufacturer, it is not likely to undertake a similar endeavor before the 1990's, executives said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/10/world/israelis-who-met-with-plo-deny-aid-to-terrorists-charge.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-03-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 165, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israelis Who Met With P.L.O.

Strikes 'Cruelly Repressed' **********In a letter sent to the Pope last month, workers here charged that strikes to raise ''starvation wages'' and to protest ''unjust'' labor laws had been ''cruelly repressed.'' **********The economic crisis afflicting Latin America has also been strongly felt here.

The action could impede Texaco's ability to operate and could cause hardship for creditors, customers and shareholders, bankruptcy experts and analysts said yesterday. **********By virtue of Texaco's size and the scope of its operations, the possibility of bankruptcy is ''shuddering,'' said Robert Weiss, an analyst at the Standard & Poor's Corporation. **********Texaco is the third-largest oil company in the United States and does business in about 150 foreign countries. At the end of last year it had nearly 52,000 employees worldwide. According to court papers filed by the company, Texaco pays suppliers more than $1 billion a month. **********Texaco's chief executive, James W. Kinnear, reiterated on Monday that the company would file for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code if its efforts in the courts and discussions with Pennzoil ''fail to provide Texaco with the reasonable relief it requires to continue its appeal on the merits of the case.'' **********The statement followed a ruling by the United States Supreme Court that reversed a Federal court's decision exempting Texaco from posting an $11 billion bond while it appeals a damage award that Pennzoil won in 1985. On Tuesday, a Texas appeals court barred Pennzoil from seizing Texaco assets until a hearing could be held next Monday in Houston. **********If Texaco and Pennzoil do not settle the case or come to an agreement on the bond, action by the Texas appeals court could induce Texaco to choose to file for bankruptcy if it could not win more time from the courts. Effect on Day-to-Day Operations **********If Texaco should file for protection, its day-to-day operations would continue under the supervision of a bankruptcy judge, with input from creditors. Analysts said the company would then face trouble dealing with some suppliers, who would ask for guarantees that their bills would be paid. For example, shipments of crude oil are often financed with letters of credit from banks, and lenders would be reluctant to issue such credit with Texaco in bankruptcy proceedings, analysts said. **********Some of Texaco's drilling and exploration activities may also be halted or delayed while the company, the bankruptcy judge and creditors work out a plan to keep the company running. Analysts said the company's stock dividend would almost certainly be suspended, as would interest payments on its debt. **********A number of businessmen, government officials and politicians have filed affidavits in the case, saying that Texaco would be severly damaged if it had to file for bankruptcy. **********But since Texaco is in sound financial health except for the uncertainty of the Pennzoil battle, most analysts think the company would eventually settle into something approaching business as usual. While it would have problems in the credit markets, the suspension of the dividend and of interest payments would free large amounts of cash to help keep the company running, analysts said. **********''The problems Texaco would face would be of a short-term nature until the judge works things out,'' Mr. Weiss said. Rapid Filing Possible **********Texaco has hired a bankruptcy lawyer to represent it, and bankruptcy experts said Texaco would undoubtedly be prepared to make the necessary filings in the Federal Court for the Southern District of New York virtually instantaneously if it decided to enter Chapter 11 proceedings. The chief judge of the district is Charles L. Brieant, the judge whose ruling was overturned by the United States Supreme Court on Monday. **********Texaco's suppliers and creditors are jittery about the situation, and their relationships with the company would only worsen in bankruptcy. **********Manufacturers Hanover and Bank of America have informed Texaco in the last two months that they would not lend to the company on an unsecured basis, and Security Pacific has said it would not undertake foreign currency transactions pending an internal credit review of Texaco. Southern California Edison is demanding weekly payments for electricity. **********Other suppliers, however, remain calm about the possibility of Texaco's entering bankruptcy. **********Ron Turner, a spokesman for the Baker International Corporation, the oilfield services concern that is merging with the Hughes Tool Company, said the company's business with Texaco was ''quite meaningful'' in financial terms. But he said the company was not terribly worried about losing Texaco's business if it enters bankruptcy because the first priority of the judge and the creditors will be to keep Texaco's oil flowing to insure that its cash flow will remain healthy. **********''Suppliers and vendors like us who help Texaco keep its oil flowing will not be cut off,'' Mr. Turner said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/19/world/iranian-vessels-said-to-fire-on-chemical-tanker.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 284, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iranian Vessels Said to Fire on Chemical Tanker", "print_headline": "Iranian Vessels Said to Fire on Chemical Tanker", "body_text": " **********Two Iranian patrol boats fired at a Liberian-registered chemical tanker today just outside the Persian Gulf, smashing a porthole with a bullet, shipping officials reported. **********They said the first information was that the tanker, the 20,578-ton Osco Sierra, had been hit by a missile.

[ Page A10. ]  Reaction to Newspaper Article Mr. Rowny, a retired Army lieutenant general who has spent the last 15 years in arms control work, prompted the debate on Monday when he praised a commentary by former President Richard M. Nixon and his Secretary of State, Henry A. Kissinger, on the need to link a missile treaty with reductions in Soviet conventional forces. The article was published Sunday in The Los Angeles Times. **********Mr. Rowny did not endorse their position, but he said the Administration's negotiations with Moscow should not be focused solely on the issue of medium- and short-range missiles and should also deal with such matters as conventional arms, regional conflicts and human rights. **********He said the Soviet offer on medium- and short-range weapons was a ''pretty good deal.'' But he added: ''That's the small picture. We have to look at the big picture.'' **********''We don't have a consistent strategic policy,'' said Mr. Rowny, who underscored that he was talking about policy of recent Administrations and not just that of President Reagan.

But White House officials have said the Administration would probably try to attach an ''understanding'' to any arms pact, asserting that both sides will make a special effort to negotiate a reduction in conventional arms in separate talks. **********Mr. Rowny has been one of many figures in recent days warning that the Administration had not been sufficiently concerned about the Warsaw Pact's sizable advantage in conventional military forces. This advantage, the critics say, would leave Western Europe vulnerable to attack if nuclear missiles stationed there now are removed as part of an arms accord. **********''We recognize that we must keep in mind the conventional balance,'' the President said today, ''and as a matter of fact, ever since I've been here we have been, as you know, in negotiations with the Soviet Union on that matter of conventional weapons.

'Practical Ends' Emphasized **********Both sides, he said, are taking a realistic, unemotional view of the talks. ''If it suits their practical ends to have some arms reduction,'' the President explained, ''and it suits our policies also, then let's get together.'' **********The United States and the Soviet Union have tentatively agreed to remove all medium-range missiles from Europe, with each side retaining 100 warheads outside the continent. Earlier this month, Moscow also proposed removing from Europe all short-range weapons, those that can travel 300 to 600 miles. **********The Administration is considering its response to the Soviet offer, and consulting with both its European allies and with Congressional leaders. **********One of Mr. Rowny's criticisms was that the Administration seemed overly eager for an accord and overly optimistic about the chances for achieving one. **********The President replied that ''most of us have have tried to keep from expressing an optimism,'' and that his Administration has been ''expressing a hopefulness, rather than optimism.'' Shultz Shows Enthusiasm **********In recent days, the Administration has been playing down its enthusiasm for the Soviet offer and stressing the hard bargaining still ahead.

Shultz first returned from Moscow, Administration officials made no attempt to hide their enthusiasm for the latest turn in the arms control negotiations. **********Mr. Baker, the chief of staff, said that ''big things are in the offing,'' and added, ''I remain optimistic that we've got an historic opportunity to get meaningful arms control agreements with the Soviet Union.'' **********Soviet and American leaders have said that a summit meeting in the United States could be held this year if an agreement on arms control, can be worked out in advance. **********Mr. Rowny, who was the chief negotiator on strategic arms at the beginning of the Reagan Administration, was replaced in 1985 and since then has served in Washington as a senior adviser to President Reagan.

Canada has argued in the past that the practice helps control drug prices, but the developers of the original drug say that the practice leaves them without adequate protection for the profitable sale of their products.

At the same time, Reagan Administration officials and powerful figures in Congress (including Bob Dole of Kansas, leader of the Senate's Republicans) have said that better patent protection for American drug companies is a priority in the free-trade talks that are under way between the two countries and that no trade agreement should be reached if the drug issue is not satisfactorily resolved. **********In recent remarks, Mr. Mulroney defended the patent bill on the ground that major drug companies have promised to spend $1.4 billion (Canadian) in additional spending on research and development at their Canadian plants, mostly in Montreal, Mr. Mulroney's political base. But the 1,300 jobs that the Prime Minister says this would produce may be a less important factor than the pressures in the trade talks, which are widely regarded as crucial to the Ottawa Government's hopes of winning re-election in 1989. Nader Takes a Stand **********A letter from Ralph Nader, the American consumer advocate, provoked the Prime Minister's ire last week. In the letter, Mr. Nader urged that the Canadian bill be scrapped as ''anti-consumer,'' and he said it would be a bad precedent for people in the United States who are fighting for lower drug prices. **********In response, Mr. Mulroney said: ''We do Canada's business. Mr. Nader is an American whose life's work is to protect American interests, and he's done that quite well.'' **********In the bill that emerged last year, the major feature was a 10-year patent arrangement for new drugs, followed by compulsory licensing, on a 4 percent royalty payment, to companies wishing to copy the drugs. Features that offset the patent provision, including removal of patent protection for any company found to be overcharging for its products, were removed after pressure from the Reagan Administration. In Ottawa the bill finally reached the Senate, in what was expected to be the final step to its enactment, earlier this month. **********To the Government's surprise, the opposition Liberals defied a tradition of not rejecting major Government bills by cutting the 10 years of patent protection to 4 years. As a compensating measure, the Senate voted to raise the proposed royalty payments to 14 percent, but the Government and major drug companies were not mollified. Some companies renewed threats to cease manufacturing and selling their products in Canada or to cut research and development expenses, already sparse, still further. A Legacy of Trudeau **********The law permitting the drug copying was passed by the former administration, led by Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, which had decided that major drug manufacturers were overcharging Canadians for their products. The removal of the patent protection led to rapid growth among so-called generic drug manufacturers, who were able to copy brand-name products in Canada and sell them for as much as 50 percent less than the originals. **********A study done a few years ago for the Government by a University of Toronto economist, Harry Eastman, found that the savings to Canadians on their drug bills amounted to a minimum of $211 million (Canadian) a year. Other studies have shown that drug prices on average are 20 percent lower in Canada than in the United States, a reversal of the situation that existed before the law was changed in 1969. **********The lower prices being paid by Canadians represent a loss to foreign drug companies, mainly American, that account for 80 percent of the Canadian market. But more than that, from the drug companies' viewpoint, the existing Canadian legislation, with no effective patent protection, has undercut efforts to gain better patent protection in the huge markets in developing countries. **********Government officials have said that the patent protection is necessary not only to raise the amounts that multinational drug companies spend on research here but also to remove the ''bad boy'' image that they say Canada has developed in many parts of the Western world as a result of offering less protection to so-called intellectual property rights than is available elsewhere. According to the officials, most Western European nations offer 10 to 15 years of patent protection to drug companies. In the United States the figure is 17 years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/24/business/company-news-kidder-peabody-fined-300000-by-big-board.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1987-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 436, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kidder, Peabody Fined $300,000 by Big Board", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Kidder, Peabody Fined $300,000 by Big Board", "body_text": " **********The New York Stock Exchange fined Kidder, Peabody & Company $300,000 yesterday on charges that the firm violated exchange rules and Federal regulations. **********According to the exchange, the violations included improperly computing net capital, filing inaccurate reports to the Government and mixing customers' securities with its own as collateral for loans. **********The exchange also penalized two Kidder, Peabody executives.

The only agreement signed so far involves the sale, for $80 million, of 270 7-Eleven stores in its Houston division. **********Southland's holdings include the High's Dairy Stores and Chief Auto Parts chains and 50 percent of the Citgo Petroleum Corporation. **********Edward G. Gagnon, a retailing analyst with Rauscher, Pierce, Refsnes Inc., in Dallas, said Southland would step up its efforts to find buyers for all its assets on the auction block. **********Cash obtained from those sales would give a clearer picture of current market values for the more than 6,000 convenience stores Southland intends to retain, he said. That, in turn, should make it easier to find buyers for the high-yield bonds, he said. **********Mr. Gagnon said he did not believe the turmoil in the stock and junk bond markets would have much impact on prices Southland could obtain for the properties up for sale. **********''Rates are lower and maybe some deals can be cut,'' he said. **********Goldman and Salomon are each carrying bridge loans to Southland of $100 million that are to be repaid when the buyout plan is completed. Several banks hold an additional $400 million in bridge loans. **********Mr. Rosenfeld of Salomon said his firm's potential exposure in the Southland transaction ''is in no way any risk to the financial well-being of the firm.'' A spokesman for Goldman, Sachs said officials of the firm were not available. **********In the early stages of the buyout offer, Southland's outside auditing firm, Touche Ross & Company, had prepared a document in which it officially agreed that Southland had the assets and prospects to afford the $4.9 billion refinancing. **********Richard H. Murray, executive director of Touche Ross International and the firm's former general counsel, denied a report published yesterday in The Wall Street Journal that Touche Ross could be judged liable to the banks if Southland was unable to repay money provided by the banks to finance the buyout. **********Mr. Murray said the specific terms of the letter, which he declined to disclose, did not now apply to the transaction because of the volatility in the junk-bond market.

SINOWITZ, a studious-looking, barrel-chested stockbroker in the Prudential-Bache Securities office near Grand Central Terminal, was trying to reassure a client about his drug-stock holdings, which had plunged more than 20 percent in the market's two-week blood bath. **********BARRETT N. SINOWITZ, a studious-looking, barrel-chested stockbroker in the Prudential-Bache Securities office near Grand Central Terminal, was trying to reassure a client about his drug-stock holdings, which had plunged more than 20 percent in the market's two-week blood bath. **********''Look,'' he said on Thursday, staring at the computer screen in his 12-foot by 12-foot private office, ''just because the market is down doesn't mean that people are going to stop taking medicine. In fact, with the market going down this fast, people are probably going to take more medicine, not less. You want to own drug companies - particularly the ones that make tranquilizers.'' **********It was hardly a rollicking joke. The cataclysm that hit Wall Street last week shook investors all around the country and made even the staunchest bull wonder if the five-year joy ride had come to an end. While the 17.5 percent decline thus far from the August high of 2,722.42 might be viewed as just a monstrous correction in an ongoing bull market, many investors may be unable to think of it as anything but a reminder of an earlier October massacre - the Crash of 1929. **********The Dow plunged 108.36 points on Friday, 57.61 points on Thursday and 95.46 points on Wednesday, losing 10.4 percent in those three days - a number which put the fall within range of the one-day performance of Oct. 28, 1929, when the market swooned 12.8 percent. Rightly or wrongly, many investors picked last week to panic - and they swarmed into the market with sell orders, sending the volume well past previous records. **********On Thursday, the day sandwiched between the two largest one-session point declines in market history, a visitor sat in on Mr. Sinowitz's calls to see how clients were coping with the carnage. Surprisingly, most seemed to handle the slaughter with something approaching equanimity. Or at least stunned silence. Only 30 of his 500 clients bothered to call. **********To be sure, there were some hysterical calls - one woman thought she had a 50 percent loss in Syntex, the drug company, because she forgot the stock had split 2-for-1 - but over all, Mr. Sinowitz succeeded in convincing his flock that the week represented a buying opportunity, albeit a terrifying one. **********On Thursday, while the market zig-zagged nervously before plunging to a 57-point loss, most of it in the final half-hour, Barry Sinowitz bought $132,000 worth of stock for clients and sold not a single share. Some clients called to sell, then wound up buying or standing pat after hearing the broker's soothing words. It was a day for practicing the ancient art of hand-holding. **********In the past two weeks, Mr. Sinowitz's clients have poured almost $2 million into the market. ''Of course,'' he said on Thursday, ''as it stands now I was wrong. I should have sold all these stocks. That's why I'm going to go jogging and try to forget.'' **********With hindsight, it is easy to say that Mr. Sinowitz should have abandoned his bullish stance several weeks ago - at least temporarily. As it happens, the anguish some of his clients felt during the recent market debacle was made more extreme by his very basic market strategy. Mr. Sinowitz does not believe in stop-loss orders, or in buying puts as insurance. He says such techniques rarely work. **********On Friday, when the market was spiraling downward, Mr. Sinowitz's phone rarely rang. He spent a lot of time reading the newspaper. Just before the close, he said he might change his strategy a bit on Monday and suggest that some of his clients sell call options as a hedge. He was starting to worry. **********But all through Thursday and Friday, his clients were bravely - or foolishly - buying stock as the market continued its vicious decline. On Friday, though, one client had the audacity to override Mr. Sinowitz's protestations and sell. ''He'll regret it, '' said Mr. Sinowitz.  In many ways the 50-year-old Mr. Sinowitz is an old-fashioned broker. He is relatively conservative and has little interest in quick trades, options or futures. He is proud to point out that not one of his clients owns stock on margin. **********Arriving in the office at 6:30 most mornings, he does much of his own research, as he has throughout his 14 years as a broker. He got into the business after being an international management consultant and running his family's plumbing and electrical supply business. **********Today most of his clients are upper-middle-class professionals, although the size of his accounts ranges from $500 all the way up to $2.5 million. Almost all are long-term investors. The advice he gives directly affects the allocation of $30 million and this year his efforts will net him a bit over $200,000. **********A passionate jogger, Mr. Sinowitz finds that he runs more when the markets are volatile. ''This has been an absolutely wonderful year for jogging,'' he said. ''I'm now doing so much that I've entered the Marathon for the first time.'' **********That sweat-inducing volatility - which of late has been primarily in the wrong direction - had clearly spooked Mr. Sinowitz's first lunch-time caller on Thursday. The man wanted to sell his 200 shares of a leading entertainment company, which had slumped 15 percent from their high. **********HEARING doubts about this stock, Mr. Sinowitz acted like a man who had heard America besmirched and must rise up to defend it. ''No,'' he said firmly. ''Don't sell. Nothing has changed. Nothing has changed.'' **********He was almost shouting. ''This isn't a time to panic; this is a time to buy. Before you sell, at least let me ask you something. Why does a stock go down?'' The client, apparently, didn't know what to make of the question, so Mr. Sinowitz repeated it, then answered. **********''It goes down because a company's prospects are bad or because they have worsened. Now let me read you something.'' **********He called up the company's latest quarterly report on his computer screen and read off the glowing numbers. Revenues up 26 percent, profits up 61 percent, margins improving dramatically. ''Does this sound like a company in trouble? So why would you want to sell it?'' **********The answer: Because Robert Prechter, the reigning market guru, had said earlier this month that Dow might drop as low as 2,300. ''That's only 4 percent more,'' said Mr. Sinowitz, a statement which, alas, was true at the time. ''Hang in there.'' **********It was more an order than advice, and the man did as he was told. ''He thinks he would get back in at a lower price,'' Mr. Sinowitz said, ''but in practice that rarely happens.'' **********THE other problem with the ''follow-the-seer'' strategy, he said, is that all forecasters are stupendously wrong eventually. ''You're a lot better off watching quarterly earnings statements than listening to some star-gazing guru.'' **********Mr. Sinowitz doesn't think much of anyone's market forecast, although he is willing to predict that the selling will cease in a week or less. What he truly believes in is the value of good stocks, top companies in leading industries like drugs and pollution control. He does not think one should sell such worthy equities until the fundamentals change significantly. (It is worth pointing out that most of these good stocks are 20 to 30 percent lower than they were earlier in the month. Mr. Sinowitz is of the opinion that they now have added goodness.) With the market off 10 points, another would-be seller called, and the defender of the faith again responded. ''Last quarter's write-off was a one-time thing for Banc One,'' he said. ''Rollins Environmental just came through with excellent numbers and it's a very recession-proof company. I'm writing out four buy orders as we're talking. Yeah, things don't look so good now, but eventually they will, once all this emotionalism disappears. When will that happen? If I knew exactly when I wouldn't need you as a client.'' **********And then came the clincher. ''Look, it's to my benefit to call you up and ask you to sell and then get you back in later, but I'm not doing that.'' **********She found this so convincing that she decided to add 100 shares of Syntex, the drug maker, to her holdings. **********''Please buy 200,'' Mr. Sinowitz said, in a tone clearly indicating he would be personally wounded by anything less. ''And 100 more shares of Banc One.'' She did. MR. SINOWITZ swayed clients with surprising ease, illustrating that they really do rely heavily on his opinions. They have remained bullish partly because he has told them the party will be over only when inflation truly kicks up - and he insists it hasn't yet. **********As soon as he expressed this upbeat view of inflation, naturally, the market plunged again. ''Wow,'' he said, like a little kid. ''It's down 15 points and it was just up 5 two minutes ago. Gosh, that's fast.'' **********''Gosh'' is not quite what clients said on Jan. 23, the day the market sank 114 points in little more than an hour. That's when clients were most frantic and most eager to make telephone contact. (Bullish for Nynex.) ''They really worried that it was all over,'' he said, ''but I think that day - and the market's rise immediately afterward - taught people that they're going to have to live with volatility. It's part of the game.'' **********Again, as if on cue, a call came from a client who cannot cope with the volatility. ''I'm not worried about the companies we're in,'' he told her. ''I'm worried about your psyche.'' No dice.  ''If I were you I wouldn't sell here,'' he said with a big sigh. He had told her this the day before - and on many other occasions. She suggested that calamity was just around the corner. ''What can I tell you, I just don't think the world is coming to an end.'' **********Bingo. He had hit the hot button - the global perspective. Her personal storm passed. **********For most of the day, however, it was business as usual for Mr. Sinowitz. Sometimes he was on two phones at once, but there were lulls when the phone did not ring for 30 or 40 minutes. He told a first-time buyer a few basics about the market, bought him an $11,000 investment in three companies, and then bought some four-month CD's and some two-and-a-half-year municipal bonds for other clients. (By midday Friday, that first-time buyer wanted to sell and take his $500 loss. Mr. Sinowitz convinced him to hold on - and the loss mounted.) What Mr. Sinowitz also did Thursday was play host to his regular lunch-hour visitor, Gabriel Torre. Mr. Torre is a dapper, 80-year-old lawyer with a portfolio that totals more than a half-million dollars. He comes by to get the feel of the market, and what he felt this day was mostly positive. ''You know,'' he said, ''my father and I got wiped out by the Crash, but I don't think anything like that will ever happen again. There are too many safeguards.'' **********Mr. Sinowitz seemed comforted by his client's view that we have learned from history. **********After the market's close on Thursday, while Mr. Sinowitz was changing clothes for his evening run to his Upper East Side apartment, the voice of Hildegard Zagorski, Prudential-Bache's associate vice president, came over the squawk box next to Mr. Sinowitz's computer. ''Well,'' she said, ''at least today's agony is over. We think the market is searching for a bottom here.'' She sounded as if she could use some hand-holding herself. As for Mr. Sinowitz, he made about $600 net on Thursday and became even more convinced that the devastation would help shake out some weak holders of stock. ''Right now,'' he said, ''many people are concentrating on panicking and not on the opportunities they have, and that's too bad.'' **********When more desperate phone calls come in the next few days, Mr. Sinowitz will continue to offer reassurance. He will try mightily to keep people in their stocks, but he knows he will sometimes cave in. ''If a person is really going over the edge, I'll say, 'Look, if it makes you feel better, sell. But 12 months from now you'll be sorry.' '' **********That was what Mr. Sinowitz said on Thursday. When he said it again the next day, however, there was a great deal more doubt in his voice."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/12/business/purchasing-chief-expected-to-quit-at-defense-dept.html": {"writer_name": "John Cushman", "pub_date": "1987-09-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 970, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PURCHASING CHIEF EXPECTED TO QUIT AT DEFENSE DEPT.", "print_headline": "PURCHASING CHIEF EXPECTED TO QUIT AT DEFENSE DEPT.", "body_text": " **********Richard Godwin, the Under Secretary of Defense for acquisition, will resign because he is frustrated with the working of his year-old office, Government and arms industry officials said today. **********Appointed as a procurement ''czar'' with centralized and sweeping powers over Pentagon purchases, Mr. Godwin reportedly now feels that his authority was not adequate and that the Pentagon has failed to streamline the labyrinthine bureaucracy that develops and buys weapons. **********His resignation marks the latest of several times during the Reagan Administration that the job of supervising the military's purchases, which cost about $170 billion a year, has changed hands - usually amid disagreement over how much authority to place in what part of the bureaucracy. Major Issues Unsettled **********Mr. Godwin will leave office when several major procurement policy issues, notably the appropriate levels of profits to be earned by military contractors, remain unsettled. **********Mr. Godwin could not be reached for comment today, but associates said that he informed Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger of his plans this week and that he would hand in his resignation next week. The Armed Services Committees of the House and the Senate both plan to ask him to appear as a witness in hearings that could lead to new legislation clarifying the responsibilities of his office. 'Disturbing Development' **********''It is a very disturbing development,'' said Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Committee. **********Another influential committee member, Larry J. Hopkins, a Kentucky Republican, said Mr. Godwin's departure called into question the commitment of the Pentagon to the organizational reforms enacted last year. ''I knew that the family had been arguing,'' he said. ''I'm sorry it is leading to divorce.'' A former executive of the Bechtel Group Inc., Mr. Godwin was named to take the high-level post, nominally one of the four most powerful assignments in the Pentagon, after it was created by Congress last year in answer to weapon procurement scandals. **********But since taking office, he has lost a number of policy disputes, and members of Congress and the Packard Commission on procurement reform have complained that he did not have enough authority. One industry wit tagged him ''Under Secretary for acquiescence,'' in the belief that he was not aggressive enough in defending his prerogatives. **********''Turf and personality have nothing to do with it,'' one of his associates said in describing Mr. Godwin's departure. ''It's how you run the company. The company ought to be run like a business.'' **********Congress created Mr. Godwin's office last year as part of a sweeping package of legislation reorganizing the Pentagon. Advocates of a streamlined system of acquisition said that, by naming a single executive in the top ranks of the office of the Defense Secretary, the Pentagon would be able to build weapons more quickly and cheaply while avoiding costly duplication of efforts by the individual military services. **********Before the new position was established, there were as many as eight senior officials in the Defense Department with some responsibility over various aspects of acquisition - and none who worked full time on the task. Findings Endorsed **********The Packard Commission was a Presidentially appointed panel of experts headed by David Packard, a former Pentagon official and chairman of the Hewlett-Packard Corporation. Last year, the commission recommended establishing Mr. Godwin's post and streamlining the bureaucracy, and the Pentagon endorsed the panel's findings, which were enacted into law. **********A year after the commission made its recommendations, though, Mr. Packard reviewed the progress to date and wrote to President Reagan that Mr. Godwin ''has not been given adequate authority.'' For example, he said, auditors responsible for reviewing the performance of military contractors had not been put under Mr. Godwin's control. **********People involved in military procurement said today that Mr. Godwin's ascendancy on the crest of a reform wave backed by a large majority in Congress and by a Presidential blue-ribbon panel of experts may, in the end, have cost him leverage inside the Pentagon. **********''This place is not attuned to taking on the reforms,'' said one Pentagon official who asked not to be named. **********Mr. Godwin's authority was undermined when the individual service secretaries, who control weapons procurement for the Army, the Air Force and the Navy, continued to argue that they should be in charge of their respective weapon projects. His role, they argued, should be limited to supervision and policy formulation. Influence Was Restricted **********At the same time, Deputy Defense Secretary William H. Taft 4th, the department's No. 2 official, restricted Mr. Godwin's influence over procurement expenditures by making himself responsible for key decisions, relegating Mr. Godwin to an advisory role in the budgetary process. **********''It's just clearly not going to work,'' one of Mr. Godwin's associates said. **********The vacancy comes at a time when the Pentagon is having difficulty winning Senate confirmation of several nominees to serve as assistant secretaries, the level of authority one notch below Mr. Godwin's. Nominees for these positions would be in charge of policies ranging from arms control to commando warfare. The Pentagon has expressed continuing frustration at the delay in confirming the appointments. **********Mr. Godwin will depart just as the Senate begins consideration of next year's military spending bill, which was held up for several months in a dispute over arms control policy. **********It is possible that senators who favor changes in the military bureaucracy will seek to toughen last year's legislation to force the Pentagon to give Mr. Godwin's successor more power over procurement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/29/business/bonanza-at-the-top-of-disney.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1987-08-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1200, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BONANZA AT THE TOP OF DISNEY", "print_headline": "BONANZA AT THE TOP OF DISNEY", "body_text": " **********The Walt Disney Company has proved a magic kingdom of incredible proportions for its chairman, Michael Eisner, and its president, Frank Wells. **********Stock in Disney is currently trading near $80 a share, and has climbed $16, or 25 percent, since early May.

Neither Mr. Eisner nor Mr. Welles has exercised a significant number of his options. **********Still, the two executives are obviously in a highly lucrative situation. ''The numbers are absolutely staggering,'' said one Wall Street executive who asked not to be named. **********There is no doubt that Disney's performance has been among the most stunning in the entertainment industry. Since the end of 1983, annual net income tripled to more than $257 million, on $2.5 billion in revenues, for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. That profit was easily surpassed in just the first nine months of this fiscal year, with net income at $309.4 million, on sales of $2.3 billion. **********Adding to the momentum, Disney's two newest films, ''Stakeout'' and ''Can't Buy Me Love,'' are both doing well, following a series of other hits. **********Disney's stock has reflected its earnings performance. Adjusted for a 4-for-1 stock split in 1986, Disney stock has risen from $15 in September 1984, when Mr. Eisner and Mr. Wells joined the company. The shares closed yesterday at $78.75, down $1.75, on the New York Stock Exchange. An Unusual Situation **********The situation is clearly a bonanza for Mr. Eisner and Mr. Wells, and to a lesser extent for Gary Wilson, the chief financial officer, who joined the company in July 1985 and holds an options package valued at $74 million. Their situation reflects both Disney's turnaround and the unusual deal they were offered, in which they received a more substantial opportunity to obtain stock than is typical in such programs, according to consultants on executive compensation. Envy of the Industry **********Inevitably, their deal is the envy of other executives. As Gerald Roche, the chairman of Heidrick & Struggles, an executive search firm, put it, ''Everybody else is looking at them and saying, 'Wow, how can we do that, too?' '' **********Several compensation consultants agreed that the potential gain for the Disney executives might be a record. But Pearl Meyer, the executive vice president of Handy Associates, a search firm that also acts as consultants on executive compensation, pointed out: ''This was a turnaround situation. Partially the numbers look obscene because the company has done so well.'' **********The Disney executives, Mrs. Meyer added, ''are getting entrepreneurial rewards without the commensurate financial risks of starting a company themselves.'' **********Erwin Okun, a Disney spokesman, said that roughly 7.4 percent of Disney shares had been allocated to Disney management as options or stock grants. Over all, 500 executives participate in the option program. But nearly half the allocated equity, 3.6 percent, is in the hands of Mr. Eisner, Mr. Wells and Mr. Wilson. **********The percentage of equity allocated to management is higher at some companies, even as high as 16 percent, Mrs. Meyer said. But in cases where it is higher, such as at Johnson & Johnson or the Data General Corporation, the equity is generally spread among several hundred executives. **********What is unusual at Disney, Mrs. Meyer said, is that the three top executives control such a huge share. **********''Normal stock options for people in the Fortune 500 are not that high,'' said Louis Brindisi Jr., chairman of the Management Compensation Group, a firm that analyzes executive pay and benefits. ''It can only be related to the shareholder value they helped create.'' **********Both Mr. Eisner, who was president of the Paramount Pictures Corporation, and Mr. Wells, a former vice chairman at Warner Brothers Inc., are highly regarded in the entertainment industry. The dismal earnings performance of Disney at the time they were hired helps explain the leverage they had in negotiating their contracts. **********According to the 1986 proxy, Mr. Eisner was granted options to buy 510,000 shares at $57.43 a share when he agreed to join Disney in September 1984. Mr. Wells received 460,000 options. On Jan. 13, 1986, Disney declared a 4-for-1 stock split. That brought the option price to $14.36. There had been at that time about 32.4 million shares outstanding. The split and several adjustments changed that number to about 131 million shares. Salaries and Bonuses **********Mr. Eisner was given an annual salary of $750,000 and Mr. Wells, $400,000. In addition, Mr. Eisner received a cash bonus last year of $2.6 million, the result of an incentive formula that gave him 2 percent of the amount by which Disney's net income exceeded a 9 percent return on stockholders' equity. Disney's return rose to 19 percent in the 1986 fiscal year, from 8 percent in 1984. Under the formula, Mr. Wells got 1 percent. **********Mrs. Meyer believes that the Disney plan has adequate safeguards for shareholders. The hurdle rate of a 9 percent return on equity is relatively high for such compensation packages, she said. **********Mr. Okun, the Disney spokesman, noted that only 20 percent of the options could be exercised each year for five years. Also, the shares obtained cannot be sold for six months. **********High salaries are not unknown in the entertainment industry. Steven J. Ross, for example, the chairman of Warner Communications Inc., has a complicated contract that could bring him cumulative compensation of as much as $142 million by 1996. His salary is $1.2 million annually and the bonuses are dependent on the company's performance. **********But situations within the industry are difficult to compare. For one thing, Mr. Ross was the architect of Warner Communications as it exists today, making him in essence the founder of a company. Warner has a number of directors whom he brought on the board, and they are the people who approved his contract. **********In the case of Mr. Wells and Mr. Eisner, they were in effect hired from the outside. Disney, which was generally regarded as a sleeping giant, had such properties as Mickey Mouse and Sleeping Beauty waiting to be exploited."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/20/world/india-seizes-four-after-immolation.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 387, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INDIA SEIZES FOUR AFTER IMMOLATION", "print_headline": "INDIA SEIZES FOUR AFTER IMMOLATION", "body_text": " **********The father-in-law of a young Hindu woman who was burned to death when she placed herself or was placed on her husband's funeral pyre was arrested today pending charges of murder and abetting a suicide, the United News of India reported. **********Three of the man's relatives were taken into custody on the same grounds, the news agency said. **********The woman, Roop Kunwar, 18 years old, died Sept. 4 in the flames of her husband's cremation pyre in a tiny village in the northwestern state of Rajasthan.

Sherwood sold seven million of its 13 million shares outstanding at $8.50 a share. S.E.C.

The American Stock Exchange earlier had approved the shares for a listing. But an exchange official said yesterday that it was ''seeking clarification of some of the material in the prospectus'' before making a decision. **********Sherwood inherited part of its problems. It agreed last December to acquire 33 of the retail offices of First Jersey Securities, which is currently fighting S.E.C. civil charges that it manipulated stock prices, creating excessive markups. Previous Settlements **********First Jersey settled a similar set of charges with the S.E.C. in 1984 and last year settled other charges filed by the National Association of Securities Dealers. In that settlement, a number of First Jersey's senior executives were fined and suspended, including its chairman, Robert E. Brennan. **********In addition, Mr. Brennan agreed earlier this year to pay $10 million to settle a class-action lawsuit by First Jersey customers who had contended that they had been defrauded through manipulative pricing practices. **********Some of the grand jury subpoenas relate to activities that had taken place in the branches while they were still owned by First Jersey. However, Sherwood's filing also says that the grand jury is looking into some activities that took place after the branches became part of Sherwood. **********''The key element here is that Bob Brennan is no longer involved in the company,'' said Fredric Rittereiser, First Jersey's former chief executive and now Sherwood's chief executive.

We're still early in the process.'' **********When First Jersey sold its branches to Sherwood, neither brokerage firm would disclose the price.

Newspapers have been running editorials about it. And people, aware of the increased supply of food and goods that accompany the higher prices, are discussing the pros and cons of inflation in markets and shops throughout the land. **********Inflation has begun to take root as China adapts to a wide range of free-market reforms introduced over the last few years. By one of the best measures available, prices rose more than 9 percent in the first six months of this year - a very large increase for this nation, which until two years ago had experienced annual inflation of only 1 percent or less for more than 30 years. **********Lately, however, prices have been rising so fast that they have brought charges of profiteering, consumer complaints and official action, such as price controls. Like punching a down-filled pillow, however, suppressing prices in one place merely seems to plump them up elsewhere. **********The current issue of the monthly China Statistical Reports shows that food prices in cities were 19.5 percent higher in the first six months of 1987 than a year earlier. Some commodities showed particularly dramatic increases. For instance, grain products were up 46.4 percent, while fresh vegetables rose 26.9 percent. **********Several Western diplomats who watch China's economy believe its inflation has been understated. ''They don't have an index for such things as intermediate goods, things like motors for washing machines,'' said one economist with a Western embassy. ''The in-house statistics of the People's Bank of China show a higher rate of inflation.'' **********The problem of rising prices has so alarmed China's leadership that the matter was one of the major topics at the 13th Congress of the Communist Party, which ended Nov. 1. **********In his opening address to the Congress on Oct. 25, Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang called for the eventual deregulation of virtually all prices. ''We should gradually establish a system under which the state sets the prices of a few vital commodities and labor services while leaving the rest to be regulated by the market,'' he said. **********While the party's Congress - the body that formally approves policies for the country - ratified Prime Minister Zhao's position, the degree to which deregulation is put into effect will depend greatly on his ability to overcome political opposition. **********Prices are seen as the key to whether economic reforms will succeed in this land that has been undergoing a dramatic economic upheaval under Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, who has just retired from the Central Committee of the Communist Party. Many Western economic analysts - and many Chinese, too - believe that China's economy must shift to a system in which prices more realistically reflect supply and demand if the nation is to overcome the inefficiencies of bureaucratic planning. **********But to this Communist nation's ideological purists, who are still a strong force, the alarming inflation rate is a sign of creeping capitalism. **********For some of the more rigid Marxists who have retired from the Central Committee but are still expected to influence policy - including Chen Yun, the 82-year-old craftsman of China's Soviet-style economy in the 1950's - ballooning inflation gives them rhetorical ammunition to attack the methods of reformers. Complaints About Prices **********''The old guys may not understand the relationship between the money supply and prices,'' a Western diplomat said, ''but they sure understand the complaints from the people.'' **********China's people like the wider availability of many foodstuffs and goods, but that does not mean they are happy about paying higher prices. ''Trying to sell inflation to the Chinese people is tough,'' one Western analyst said. ''Needless to say, they're skeptical of this.'' **********However, the Government has managed to protect most workers by raising wages. According to the overseas edition of Liaowang (''Outlook''), a general interest weekly, wages have risen 120 percent in the last eight years. A Western economist in Beijing estimates that wages climbed 20 percent in urban areas last year and are up as much as 17 percent this year. **********Even such entrenched reformers as Mr. Deng and Prime Minister Zhao have been willing to tolerate a temporary tightening of consumer price controls as a way of marshaling their forces, allaying consumer complaints and mollifying some of the hard-line party members. Control of Basic Factors **********The reformers also have called for more sophisticated control over elements of the economy that can fuel inflation, such as the money supply. Major banks, in both urban and rural areas, have announced tighter control over loans. **********Indeed, no matter what people think of the economic reforms, they see inflation as a matter of national concern. Deputy Prime Minister Yao Yilin has spoken with urgency about surging prices. ''Price fluctuations are still a problem which is caused by an imbalance between supply and demand,'' he said bluntly at a meeting on national planning last month. ''We could face big problems in China's economic development and reform if we fail to solve this problem.'' **********But a sizable and growing number of younger party people, committed to reform, are distressed by the price controls that the Government has imposed. They reason - correctly in the eyes of Western economists - that the controls do nothing but forestall the need to address broad economic adjustments. **********All reformers agree that economic growth is not possible in the long term without deregulation of prices throughout the economy. Increase Called 'Inevitable' **********Prof. Xiao Zhuoji, a member of the economics faculty at Beijing University, said China's inflation rate, while too high, is a natural consequence of reshaping the economy. ''The increase in prices is inevitable,'' he said, ''because of the unreasonable pricing in the past. It is normal, and it promotes production. In the past, prices were stable, but people couldn't find what they needed.'' **********For this reason, the Government seems to be having some trouble enforcing its price controls. If it is a choice between paying higher prices or having nothing to buy, consumers, shopkeepers and market managers all seem to prefer higher prices. **********On the first day of September, Yao Wenhuan posted fixed prices for tomatoes, cucumbers, garlic and corn on a notice board in the center of the Yonganli market that he manages. But the prices were so low that farmers just stopped carting in their produce to sell. Only near the end of September, after Mr. Yao had torn down the price list, did the vegetable growers reappear."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/14/business/inventories-off-in-december.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 437, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INVENTORIES OFF IN DECEMBER", "print_headline": "INVENTORIES OFF IN DECEMBER", "body_text": " **********Business sales, aided by a year-end spurt of car buying, jumped 2.9 percent in December and inventories fell five-tenths of 1 percent, the largest decline in more than three years, the Commerce Department said today. **********The department said that inventories held on shelves and in backlots dropped to $587.17 billion in December, after adjusting for normal seasonal variations.

This was down from an already low 1.35 months in November. **********''Usually a drop in the inventory-to-sales ratio is a very clear signal that strong economic expansion is coming down the road,'' Mr. Handler said. **********The decline in inventories was led by a 1.2 percent dip in stockpiles held by retailers.

Federal Reserve Purchases **********Besides hopes that the dollar's strength will attract more foreign buyers, market participants said Treasury prices were supported by purchases by the Federal Reserve of notes and bonds for its own account. The Fed's purchases were anticipated and did not signal any change in monetary policy. **********The Treasury's announcement of a three-part note financing next week also buoyed the markets. The size of each issue was reduced $250 million from the similar financing three months ago, and was a reminder that the Treasury's borrowing needs have been greatly reduced by the drop in the budget deficit to around $170 billion in the current fiscal year from more than $220 billion in the fiscal year 1986. **********The Treasury said it would auction $9.75 billion of two-year notes next Tuesday, $7.5 billion of four-year notes on Wednesday and $7 billion of seven-year notes on Thursday.

As data accumulate showing that the economy is not continuing to expand at the brisk pace of the first quarter, he said, the Federal Reserve might eventually encourage a modest drop in overnight interest rates. **********Not all experts share Mr. Braverman's optimism, especially regarding the future of the dollar. **********Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, said in a speech to the National Press Club in Washington that the dollar might remain stable, or even strengthen for the next few months. But he said the American trade deficit remains so large that ''the basic trend of the dollar over the next couple years is down.'' **********While activity in the corporate market has increased recently, interest rates are still uncomfortably high for many potential borrowers. **********The Pacific Gas and Electric Corporation, for example, yesterday postponed a $250 million sale of 30-year bonds. In May, Pacific Gas and Electric delayed a similar financing, only to reappear a week later after interest rates had dropped about 1/4 percentage point. **********In the mortgage market, officials at Salomon Brothers said they had placed with investors a two-part $127 million mortgage financing divided into senior and subordinated pieces. Mortgages have previously been used to back packages of senior and subordinated securities, but the issuers were required to retain the subordinated portion, at least initially. **********The new financing by the Residential Funding Corporation was the first of its kind where both the senior and subordinated portions were sold to investors. The ability to divide a pool of mortgages into various classes of securities was hailed by securities dealers as one of the primary benefits of legislation last year that created real estate mortgage investment conduits. Selling a subordinated class of securities is an alternative to purchasing mortgage pool and special hazard insurance, analysts said. Home Mortgage Pool **********Holders of the subordinated securities will bear the loss from delinquencies and defaults on the pool of conventional 15-year home mortgages up to the amount of their investment, which was $6.35 million, or 5 percent of the mortgage pool. Because of that risk, the subordinated issue, which was not rated and was privately placed with thrift institutions and life insurance companies, was sold with an interest rate of around 13 percent. The 95 percent of the pool consisting of senior securities was sold two months ago, is rated double A, and trades in line with other high-quality mortgage pass-through securities. **********Elsewhere in the mortgage securities market, officials at the First Boston Corporation offered $500 million of collateralized mortgage obligations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/15/business/pacific-telesis-president.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-07-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 167, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pacific Telesis President", "print_headline": "Pacific Telesis President", "body_text": " **********The Pacific Telesis Group today named Sam L.

But in concluding a bilateral commercial accord here on Friday, Mexico and the United States showed that an enormous gap remains between that dream and current reality. **********The agreement, signed by the United States trade representative, Clayton K. Yeutter, and his Mexican counterpart, culminates six years of negotiations between the two countries. It establishes a nonbinding mechanism to resolve trade and investment disputes and calls for annual Cabinet-level consulations between the two Governments. **********The pact with Mexico comes a month after the United States and Canada signed a sweeping trade agreement that, if approved, would end tariffs by the end of the century. As Mr. Yeutter, speaking in Spanish, noted Friday, the two accords are ''very different'' and illustrate what he called ''the many obvious barriers'' that stand in the way of continent-wide economic integration. Gap in Economies Cited **********Mexico's Minister of Commerce and Industrial Development, Hector Hernandez Cervantes, addressed that point directly when, after signing the trade accord, he pointed out that the American and Canadian economies are ''at the same level'' of development. ''But with Mexico, in relation to the United States, that is not exactly so,'' he added. **********The result of that gap is that Mexico is ambivalent about the benefits of closer and more formal commercial links with the United States. On one level, the American agreement with Canada ''gave the Mexicans a great deal of heartburn,'' one diplomat here said, because ''it reinforced their preoccupation with a North American common market from which they would be excluded.'' **********But the burst of optimism that followed the Canadian agreement has also reawakened traditional Mexican suspicions that the United States has designs on its natural resources and productive capacity. For the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, which presents itself as a defender of ''national sovereignty,'' the issue is especially delicate and potentially explosive with an election year looming. New Common Market Sentiment **********In fact, when initial reports from Washington following the Canadian accord indicated a resurgence of common-market sentiment, the reaction in the press and in political circles here was so strong that Foreign Minister Bernardo Sepulveda Amor was compelled to assure the Mexican Congress that no such arrangement was in the works. He said the Mexico agreement was modest in scale and limited in scope. **********''This is not, I repeat, an agreement that will lead to a free trade plan between the United States and Mexico, nor is it an agreement that will lead to the establishment of a North American common market.'' Mr. Sepulveda said. ''It is merely and exclusively an understanding that contains principles to begin consultations on matters of trade and investment.'' **********Traditionally, Mexico has been the third-largest trading partner of the United States, after Canada and Japan. Mexican exports to the United States reached $17.7 billion in 1986, while Mexican imports amounted to $12.5 billion, according to American Embassy statistics. **********A little more than two thirds of all Mexican imports are supplied by the United States, and 62 percent of Mexico's exports go to the American market. The United States is also the largest foreign investor in Mexico, with $10.1 billion, or 60 percent of all foreign investment as of 1986. Resistance to Change **********When talks on the trade agreement first began, the United States had hoped Mexico would ease restrictions on foreign investment and make its regulations more flexible and ''transparent.'' But Mexico proved resistant to fundamental changes, and the matter has been deferred to the next round of trade consulations, scheduled to begin in 90 days. **********''We are not ready for such an arrangement,'' said one Mexican official who deals in trade issues. ''It is somewhat precipitate to be talking of such things, given the differences that exist.'' But Mexico is not alone in its reservations on the subject of a common market. While the Reagan Administration favors free trade, it is more reluctant to open up some other areas of interest to Mexico. **********As Mexican officials point out, a true common market implies free movement of labor as well as of investments. The United States, they contend, pointing to recent legislation aimed at curbing flows of illegal immigration, is simply not prepared to accept millions of Mexicans crossing the border to work in American factories, offices and farms. Some Progress Made **********Some progress, however, has been made toward integrating the two economies. The most notable and promising example is a program that permits American companies to assemble materials in Mexico and then send them back across the border for final processing, avoiding high duties while making use of cheaper Mexican labor. **********More than 1,000 such plants now operate in Mexico, mostly along the northern border. But officials of both countries now seem to recognize that the United States and Mexico are decades away from achieving the relationship of mutual confidence and equality that the United States maintains with Canada. **********''This is something that must evolve,'' Mr. Yeutter said of closer ties with Mexico. ''It is necessary to study, evaluate and analyze this year by year.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/20/world/captain-of-stark-and-two-others-relieved-of-duty.html": {"writer_name": "John Cushman", "pub_date": "1987-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 707, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CAPTAIN OF STARK AND TWO OTHERS RELIEVED OF DUTY", "print_headline": "CAPTAIN OF STARK AND TWO OTHERS RELIEVED OF DUTY", "body_text": " **********The captain of the frigate Stark and two other officers were relieved of duty today because of their performance during an attack on the ship last month by an Iraqi jet in the Persian Gulf. **********The Pentagon said the senior military commander responsible for the region, Gen. George B. Crist, had taken the step ''based on his lack of confidence'' in the men. **********General Crist, who is a Marine officer, also forwarded to the Navy and the Defense Department the report of a naval board of inquiry into the episode, in which the Stark took no action to defend herself and 37 sailors were killed. **********The action today left open the possibility that the officers, who had been named as ''interested parties,'' or subjects, of the investigation, will be court-martialed by the Navy. No Action on 4th Officer **********The officers who were relieved of duty were Capt. Glenn R. Brindel, the ship's skipper; Lieut. Cmdr. Raymond J. Gajan Jr., the executive officer, or second in command, and Lieut. Basil E. Moncrief Jr., the tactical action officer, who was in charge of the ship's combat functions during the episode on the night of May 17. **********No action was taken against a fourth, unidentified officer, who was responsible for some of the ship's weapon systems and had also been named as a party to the investigation, conducted by Rear Adm. Grant Sharp. **********In the board's investigation, which took place in Bahrain, where the badly damaged Stark is under repair, the Navy learned that Captain Brindel left the bridge a few minutes before the Stark was struck by two Exocet missiles, in what was described by Iraq and the United States as an mistaken attack. Failed to Maneuver Ship **********In the captain's absence, the other officers in charge of the ship's operations failed to take a series of actions that might have prevented the attack or allowed the Stark to use her sophisticated anti-missile weapons to defend herself. For example, they waited too long before signaling the ship's identity to the approaching Iraqi plane, and they failed to execute standard air-defense maneuvers such as turning the ship to give her guns a clear shot at the missiles. **********As these facts were disclosed in recent weeks, Navy officers have privately commented that the ship's captain and other officers might be found culpable. The Navy traditionally holds ships' officers directly responsible for everything, including accidents, that occurs under their command. **********The decision to relieve the officers of duty was made today, the Pentagon said, after General Crist arrived in Washington to discuss the matter with qother senior Pentagon officials. As commander in chief of the Central Command, which is responsible for deploying military forces to the Persian Gulf region, where the United States has no permanent installations, the Marine general is based in Florida and has authority over units drawn from all the military services. Courts-Martial Up to Navy **********General Crist has decided to leave up to the Navy the question whether to press court-martial charges against the officers he relieved. If the Navy decides to press charges, Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger will personally review the recommendation, officials said. **********Captain Brindel, who has been an officer for almost 22 years, had commanded the Stark for just over two years. He was due to be given a new assignment soon, but the announcement today made clear that his replacement was a rebuke. He will be replaced as skipper of the Stark by Cmdr. John B. Noll, the Navy said. **********The three officers affected by the action today are now in Bahrain. Captain Brindel's previous orders to join a testing organization in Norfolk, Va., have been postponed until resolution of his case. In the meantime, he has been assigned to the staff of the Atlantic Fleet in Norfolk. Commander Gajan and Lieutenant Moncrief have been assigned to staff positions in Mayport, Fla., the Stark's home port."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/world/haitians-voting-today-on-a-new-way-of-life.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 733, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Haitians Voting Today on a New Way of Life", "print_headline": "Haitians Voting Today on a New Way of Life", "body_text": " **********In the most decrepit slums of this impoverished country and in the cool hills where the rich live in luxurious villas, there was a rare mood of ebullience today as people prepared to vote Sunday on a constitution that defines a new way of life in Haiti. **********The new constitution contains dozens of specific measures creating obstacles to any future dictatorship and promising personal liberties and such previously nonexistent features as the right to free education, decent housing and a fair day's pay. **********It creates an independent commission to conduct presidential elections, scheduled for November, and bars from participation in the elections anyone in the armed forces as well anyone closely associated with the Duvalier family dictatorship, which ruled Haiti with an iron hand for nearly 30 years. **********The constitution may not be able to deliver all it promises in a poor country with no democratic tradition. But in contrast to the timid interim Government that has presided since street protests brought down President Jean-Claude Duvalier in February 1986, the new constitution has given voice to the Haitians' most passionate hopes and is expected to be approved by a wide margin. **********''People like it because it embodies the spirit of the revolution,'' a foreign diplomat said. **********''It is a useful healing document,'' he said. ''It may not be a useful operating document.'' **********The most influential political groups have given their endorsement, and the Roman Catholic Church, a key shaper of public opinion, has issued a veiled statement that is being widely interpreted as supportive. **********Eighteen small nationalist and leftist groups are urging abstention from voting, and at least two leftist organizations have threatened protest demonstrations. There have been reports that some of those who were close to the deposed dictator have been campaigning against the constitution, warning that its approval would open the way for a Communist takeover of Haiti. **********But Leslie Manigat, a former professor of political science and one of the leading candidates for president, said he believed approval was a certainty. **********''I don't see how anybody can change the overwhelming trend toward a yes vote,'' he said in an interview at his headquarters. **********The most common objection to the constitution is that in their zeal to protect Haiti from the evils of the past, the authors may have created a government so hobbled with checks and balances that it cannot govern. Power is distributed among a president, a prime minister, a chamber of deputies and a senate. How they will relate to each other is not entirely clear. **********Many political leaders said they were temporarily putting aside the question of how the government would work and accepting the constitution as a tool for guiding the country through the transition to an elected president. **********The provisional Government suspended the last Duvalier Constitution and has been governing by decree. **********''Without this constitution there are no rules of the game,'' Mr. Manigat said. ''We just leap into the unknown.'' **********Some oppose the constitution because it formally establishes the provisional administration as the official government until Feb. 7, 1988, when the next president is to be inaugurated. This, critics say, further entrenches a de facto government. The constitution also, for the first time, recognizes the universally spoken Creole as an official language, along with French, and eliminates a widely ignored curb on the practice of voodoo, the blend of Catholicism and African beliefs unique to Haiti. **********Fair elections have been rare in Haiti's history, and the referendum is regarded as a learning exercise. **********Last October, in the country's first election since the fall of the dictatorship, there was great skepticism and little publicity, and fewer than 10 percent of those eligible voted. **********But excitement built as the 40 people who were chosen then, along with 20 appointed by the interim Government, worked for several months on drafting the constitution in sessions that were broadcast live over national radio."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/12/business/texaco-pennzoil-reach-high-court.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1987-01-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1018, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TEXACO, PENNZOIL REACH HIGH COURT", "print_headline": "TEXACO, PENNZOIL REACH HIGH COURT", "body_text": " **********Texaco Inc. and the Pennzoil Company will take their tangled, three-year-old legal dispute before the United States Supreme Court on Monday. **********At issue is whether lower Federal courts acted correctly last year in ruling that Texaco did not have to put up a $12 billion bond before proceeding with its legal battle with Pennzoil in Texas. Texaco has said that if it had to put up the bond it would be forced into bankruptcy. **********The Supreme Court is not expected to rule on the issue for six months or more. The Monday hearing will be closely watched for any indication of how the justices may be leaning in their views on the highly publicized case. If there is any indication of how the case may be decided, it could increase or decrease pressure on the two companies to negotiate a deal. Suit Filed in 1984 **********Pennzoil sued Texaco a month after Texaco reached an agreement to acquire the Getty Oil Company in January 1984. Pennzoil argued that Texaco's action breached a previous, verbal agreement Pennzoil had to merge with Getty, and asked for $15 billion in damages. **********After a trial lasting more than four months, a jury in Houston unanimously ruled in favor of Pennzoil on Nov. 19, 1985. Three weeks later, a Texas district judge entered a judgment of $10.53 billion against Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company, after Exxon and Mobil. **********It was the biggest damage award in history, causing many Texaco supporters to question the fairness of the Texas judiciary. With interest mounting at $2.6 million a day from its effective date of Jan. 5, 1985, the total judgment facing Texaco is now approaching $12.5 billion. **********Under Texas law, Texaco was required to post a bond in the amount of the judgment, plus interest, to appeal the ruling. But Texaco, arguing that a bond of that magnitude would push it into bankruptcy before it could press its appeal, avoided possible calamity when a Federal judge in White Plains, Charles L. Brieant, ruled that Texaco did not have to post the bond. Instead, he required security of $1 billion, which Texaco posted on Feb. 5. Court 'Intrusion' Cited **********The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, agreed with Judge Brieant on Feb. 21. Pennzoil then asked the Supreme Court to review the decision, arguing that the Federal courts made ''an unprecedented intrusion'' into the procedures of Texas courts by eliminating the Texaco bond. **********In its brief, Texaco countered that it was ''within days of bankruptcy,'' and therefore unable to exercise its right to appeal, before the bond requirement was lifted. It argued that Pennzoil's request for a Supreme Court review was mainly an effort to increase pressure on Texaco to settle the case. **********Although the two companies have discussed settling the case without further court action, Baine Kerr, a Pennzoil director and former president, said late last week that no serious talks were now under way. He said officials of both companies had talked by telephone recently, but no meetings had taken place. A Texaco spokesman, Lois Johnston, said the company's policy was not to comment on its dealings with Pennzoil in relation to the case. Texas Ruling Awaited **********Meanwhile, the two companies are awaiting a ruling from the Texas First Court of Appeals on Texaco's effort to have the verdict against it and the $10.53 billion judgment overturned. A source close to the case said the Houston appellate court had informed both sides before New Year's Day that a decision was imminent. **********Texaco has said it would appeal the case to the Texas Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court, if necessary. **********Still, a ruling against Texaco by the Texas appellate court would likely increase Texaco's incentives to settle the case, Wall Street analysts said, adding that Texaco probably would not fare better with the Texas Supreme Court. There was little agreement, however, on the likely size of a settlement, with estimates varying from as little as $1 billion to as much as $5 billion. **********Kathryn Cox, clerk of the First Court of Appeals, said Friday that a ruling could be issued any day. The court ''is trying to get it out,'' she said. **********The appellate court has had the case since August, and had been expected to rule as early as October. The months of waiting have prompted speculation about the possibility of unresolved disputes among the judges, and the prospect that they may want to review Monday's hearing for any sentiment by the Supreme Court justices. **********One source close to the case said that if the justices express skepticism about the verdict against Texaco and the size of the damages, the appellate court might decide to reconsider its position. On the other hand, a tough questioning of Texaco's position might suggest an acceptance of Pennzoil's arguments. **********Laurence H. Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard, will be the sole representative speaking for Pennzoil. David Boies, a prominent trial lawyer with Cravath, Swain & Moore, in New York, will argue Texaco's position. **********The stock prices of both companies continue to reflect the legal battle. Texaco's shares closed Friday at $38, up $1.25 for the week, on the New York Stock Exchange. Pennzoil closed at $68.50, off 25 cents for the week. **********Barry C. Good, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company, said James W. Kinnear, who became Texaco's president and chief executive on Jan. 1, may want to move quickly ''to get this settled'' after the Texas Court of Appeals rules. **********At Pennzoil, J. Hugh Liedtke, chairman and chief executive, reaches his 65th birthday on Feb. 10.

''On the contrary, it's getting nastier.'' Mr. Titov was released Oct. 9 from the special psychiatric hospital in the Russian city of Oryel. **********Mr. Titov said his most vivid recollections were of two strong psychotropic drugs that caused fever, pain, slurred speech and left him unable to lie, sit or stand comfortably. He also spoke movingly of dissidents still inside, while other human rights advocates at the news conference played a tape of another patient, Sirvard Avakian, an Armenian dissident, asking in a trembling voice for Western help in releasing her from what she described as the abuse of her doctors. **********This account of the dark side of the Soviet psychiatric system - which differs hardly at all from the horror stories told a decade ago by a dissident psychiatrist, Anatoly Koryagin, and other human rights advocates - comes just as Soviet medical authorities seem eager to rehabilitate their image. **********Two events of the last year seemed, to some observers, to offer Soviet doctors a chance to end their five-year ostracism from the world psychiatric profession. A Series of Articles **********The first was Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, which this year produced a series of articles in the Soviet press detailing unsanitary and crowded conditions in psychiatric hospitals, and revealing the practice of doctors' accepting bribes from criminals in return for a diagnosis of mental illness - saving the criminals from serving sentences in labor camps. **********Most surprising was an Izvestia article that described with outrage instances of local police and bureaucrats who tried to force the psychiatric commitment of two women who had simply argued too long with authorities. One was committed and one evaded it by barring herself in her bedroom while the family fended off doctors and their aides. **********''Although the subject of the article isn't dissidents,'' the Soviet historian Roy A. Medvedev said in a recent interview, ''the mechanics of psychiatric abuse become perfectly clear because in these articles the diagnoses are disputed.'' **********''And if this sort of thing can be done to an average woman who complains about simple matters, it's all the easier to do it to a dissident,'' he added. **********Another article, in the weekly ideological journal Arguments and Facts, said that in 1985, 1,923 of every 100,000 Soviet citizens were registered as having psychiatric disorders, indicating that more than 5 million in the country have such disorders. **********The other supposed opening for changes in Soviet psychiatry came with the death last summer of Andrei V. Snezhnevsky, the Soviet psychiatrist widely seen as being responsible for designing and defending a system of diagnosis that equated nonconformity with illness. **********To some experts, Dr. Snezhnevsky's death offered Soviet doctors a chance to repudiate his legacy and construct a new theoretical underpinning for Soviet psychiatry. There has even been a recent suggestion, during Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's recent visit to the United States, that Soviet psychiatrists might strike from their textbooks a key Snezhnevsky diagnosis. **********This diagnosis, called ''sluggish schizophrenia,'' is said to manifest itself in obsessive desires ''to seek social justice'' and said to be camouflaged by seemingly normal behavior. It was this diagnosis that was made in the case of Mr. Medvedev's twin brother, Zhores, during his brief forced commitment in the early 1970's, and also in the cases of the women profiled in the Izvestia article. **********Leading doctors who have long defended Soviet psychiatry took umbrage at the Izvestia article, responding in an interview with the Novosti press agency that both the women in question were indeed ill. **********''In the instances described, the two women were in conflict with many people,'' said Marat Vartanyan, a corresponding member of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences. ''They suffered themselves and caused suffering to others. They not only made unsupported complaints but accused others of conspiracies.'' **********''Psychiatrists have a duty to safeguard society from disorganizing and sometimes dangerous steps by the insane,'' Dr. Vartanyan added. Transfer Is Considered **********Dissidents assert that the K.G.B. runs the system - an accusation supported by the fact that the Ministry of Internal Affairs controls the 18 special psychiatric hospitals. However, there have been reports in the Soviet press that authorities are considering transferring this responsibility to the Ministry of Health, already responsible for the management of ''ordinary'' psychiatric hospitals and clinics. **********And the doctors interviewed by Novosti said a new law was being formulated to delineate mentally ill persons' rights to housing and employment, and to clarify procedures for involuntary examinations and hospitalization. **********But Mr. Titov and members of the Frankfurt-based International Committee on Human Rights, whose Moscow branch sponsored today's press conference, argue that management or theoretical changes will have no effect on curbing psychiatric abuse, any more than the recent release of several dozen dissidents in psychiatric hospitals. **********''The structure doesn't have to be changed,'' said Aleksandr Podribinek, who has written a book on Soviet psychiatric practices. ''Psychiatric abuse is the result of bad politics, not bad psychiatry. To stop abuse we have to change the politics.'' K.G.B. Came to Hospital **********If the diagnosis of ''sluggish schizophrenia'' were eliminated, he said, ''this might be taken as a sign of some change - but a very unreliable one -and they're committing healthy people using other diagnoses as well.'' **********Mr. Titov said that when he was released from the hospital Oct. 9, ''it was the K.G.B. who came to the psychiatric hospital to talk to me and to try and persuade me to give up my convictions.'' **********Mr. Titov, whose 1982 reports of convict labor on the Siberian gas pipeline were cited as partial justification of the American-led embargo on pipeline equipment, said he was freed on condition that he immediately emigrate to Israel. Mr. Titov, who is not Jewish, has no relatives in Israel. **********In general, Mr. Titov and other members of the committee said Monday, dissidents evoke particular ire on the part of authorities and are often given harsher punitive ''treatment,'' in the form of injections, than the other inmates of the country's 18 special psychiatric hospitals. **********Mr. Titov spent the last five years in psychiatric hospitals as a result of the pipeline revelations, and in total has spent 12 of the last 18 years in such confinement. **********Sergei Grigoryants, the editor of the magazine Glasnost, said yesterday he could not estimate the scope of psychiatric abuse in the Soviet Union, but added that anecdotal information about recent commitments led him to believe the system is still widely abused. **********''We're not doctors,'' added Vladimir Pimonov, a member of the human rights group. ''We can't say that all these people who are committed are healthy. But to shut them in a special psychiatric hospital is inhuman. They're not murderers or terrorists. Their only crime is speaking their minds.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/03/world/anti-military-protests-continue-in-panama.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 211, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Anti-Military Protests Continue in Panama", "print_headline": "Anti-Military Protests Continue in Panama", "body_text": " **********Hundreds of people demonstrated against the military-dominated Government here today, and armed men set fire to a building owned by the publishers of the opposition newspaper La Prensa while riot police watched. **********It was the second day of protest since Tuesday, when the Government lifted a state of emergency. **********A few hours later, the authorities ordered an opposition radio station to be closed down indefinitely, asserting that it had incited public disorders. **********A spokesman described broadcasts by the station from June 8 to 10 as anti-Government and said they were believed to have violated the country's penal code. **********Riot police officers had clashed with students earlier today near the University of Panama.

''They are dealing with such paper-thin profit margins that any relief they can get will improve their earnings outlook.'' Long-Distance Costs Down 30% **********The F.C.C. has estimated that the average cost of making a long-distance telephone call has declined about 30 percent since A.T.& T. was forced to sell off its local phone companies in 1984. **********MCI's filing represents a sudden change of thought for the nation's second-largest long-distance company, which has long supported the F.C.C.'s regulation of A.T.& T., the industry leader. **********Analysts who follow MCI said they were not surprised by the move, considering the heavy losses the Washington-based company has suffered in the last year. They tie the losses in part to the drastic price-cutting that was spurred by the F.C.C.'s decision last year to lower the rate of return it would allow A.T.& T. on its long-distance business. **********To remain competitive, discount long-distance companies such as MCI and the U S Sprint Communications Company have consistently undercut A.T.& T., which still controls about 80 percent of the market.

He expects the increase in non-farm inventories to be $12 billion higher this year than in 1986. **********That is generally considered a modest rise, but a ''turnaround from the second half of 1986,'' Mr. Cohen said. Last year the swings were extreme, reflecting the rise and then the fall of auto inventories and the effect of a weakening dollar on the demand for American goods. In the first quarter, non-farm inventories built up at an annual rate of $37 billion, but by the fourth quarter they were falling at an $8 billion rate. **********This year the widespread use of Japanese inventory techniques - in which goods are ordered at the last minute - will help to moderate inventory growth, Mr. Cohen said. In addition, if inflation remains low, there will be no need to stockpile goods in anticipation of higher prices. A danger signal would be rapid inventory buildup. ''That means inflation,'' he said. A Non-Existent Nest Egg? American consumers could collectively save nothing at all this year. **********''It's never happened before,'' said Edward Yardeni, senior vice president of Prudential- Bache Securities. ''But if consumption exceeds disposable income, the savings rate would be negative'' - and Americans are getting close to that point, he said. **********The nation's personal savings rate, he points out, dropped to only 2.5 percent of disposable income in the fourth quarter of 1986. For all of 1986, it was 3.8 percent, down from 5.1 percent in 1985. ''And the trend continues downward,'' Mr. Yardeni said. **********He cites several reasons for the decline. A large percentage of America's population is under 40, an age group that saves relatively little. What's more, the recent appreciation of stocks and real-estate, whose values are not calculated in disposable income, has created a sense of wealth, encouraging spending. **********Perhaps more important, the new emphasis on low-interest home-equity loans has prompted more consumers to borrow a portion of their real estate appreciation, and spend it. ''If everybody starts to tap the market value of their homes by taking out a homeowners' equity loan,'' said Mr. Yardeni, ''spending could, in theory, exceed income.'' Switching to Methanol **********Methanol, an alcohol made from natural gas, was widely considered a good alternative to gasoline or diesel fuel when the prices of those two fuels were at record levels a decade ago. And now that petroleum prices are rising again, methanol is back in the news. **********But even without higher fuel prices, Environmental Protection Agency emission rules that go into effect in 1988 and 1991 favor methanol over diesel fuel, says Karl Springer of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. That's because ''it may not be practical to adapt some high-emission diesels to meet the 1991 particulate limit,'' he said, adding that in anticipation of the new standards, methanol-powered buses are being tested in northern California. In many cases, gasoline is not an alternative, because it is more expensive than methanol and not as pollution-free. **********But methanol has its drawbacks. It provides about 60 percent less power per gallon than diesel fuel or gasoline, and this requires a larger tank for the same performance. On the other hand, methanol is relatively cheap: It costs only 30 to 52 cents a gallon, whereas diesel fuel has only recently slipped below $1 a gallon and gasoline costs roughly the same."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/04/business/company-news-telex-set-back-in-legal-fight.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 243, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Telex Set Back In Legal Fight", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Telex Set Back In Legal Fight", "body_text": " **********A Federal judge issued a temporary restraining order today that prevents the Telex Corporation from using a state anti-takeover law to block the New York financier Asher B.

As a result, the cable went on, there was no change in the official position that Israel should try to negotiate directly with its Arab neighbors through an international conference.

This is a war.'' **********Indeed, the factions of the Israeli Government may soon need of a peace conference as much as the countries of the region. Matters reached a point today where Mr. Peres and Mr. Shamir were having a disagreement over what they disagreed about. **********Mr. Peres, the leader of the Labor Party, insisted that he was free to continue pursuing the conference since the 10-member inner Cabinet was deadlocked over whether the Government should endorse his proposal and since no vote had been taken. **********Mr. Shamir, the head of the Likud bloc, argued that the conference idea was dead since Mr. Peres had refused to bring the conference issue to a vote - because he knew the Cabinet was deadlocked 5 to 5 and a tie vote would legally be a rejection. **********Yosef Ben-Aharon, the director general of Mr. Shamir's office, now visiting Washington, said in an interview on Israeli radio today that he had ''met people in the White House and, in the name of the Prime Minister, I informed them that following the debate in the Cabinet, the subject of an international conference is finished.'' Mr. Shamir declared on Israeli television Wednesday night that all officials and world leaders who speak to Mr. Peres about the proposal ''will know that Mr. Peres does not speak in the name of the Government.'' **********Mr. Peres responded: ''The Prime Minister can dismiss me if he likes. This does not frighten me. I am acting for peace. I took over a Government with 600 percent inflation, with an army in the Lebanese mire, with tremendous civil hatred and without a peace policy. Am I eating the bread of charity? Was I not elected lawfully?'' **********Mr. Peres was Prime Minister in the national unity Government for two years, beginning in September 1984, before exchanging positions with Mr. Shamir last October. Peres Leaving for U.S. Mr. Shamir's assertion that Mr. Peres does not speak for the Government was timed to coincide with the Foreign Minister's trip to the United States, which begins Friday. **********Mr. Peres said before departing that he would meet with Secretary of State George P. Shultz and other senior American officals to discuss ways to ''keep the peace process alive.'' Mr. Peres emphasized, however, that he had no intention of dragging the Americans into the internal Israeli political fray by seeking any kind of endorsement from them. **********Mr. Peres is clearly going to Washington in a low mood, judging from people who saw him today. Despite his insistence that the question of the conference is still open, political commentators here feel that Mr. Shamir adroitly outmaneuvered him, at least in this round. **********Mr. Peres hoped at first to win over some Likud members of the Cabinet to his proposal, as he had done in previous votes about Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon and economic policy. But Mr. Shamir blocked this path by maintaining a united front. **********Then Mr. Peres planned to call for new elections by putting together a 61-seat majority in the 120-seat Parliament to force Mr. Shamir into dissolving the coalition Government. But Mr. Shamir beat Mr. Peres to the punch and put together a bloc of 62 seats, upsetting Mr. Peres's demand for new elections. Mr. Shamir, whose term runs until November 1988, opposes new elections. The Price of Victory **********Mr. Shamir's victory comes at a price, however. **********Political analysts say that Mr. Shamir may have quashed Mr. Peres's conference plan in the Cabinet but that he did so without ever presenting a realistic alternative peace proposal. The Labor Party will now seek to portray Mr. Shamir, both at home and abroad, as being more interested in holding on to the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip than in bringing about peace with the Arabs. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Shamir's staff was in a celebratory mood at his office this morning, while Mr. Peres was counseling patience. Mr. Peres is said to believe that all he needs to put together a majority in Parliament for new elections is to win over either the small Shas religious party or the National Religious Party.

Their 1985-86 grain harvest was estimated at 192 million tons, which forced them to import about 20 million tons, and if the winter reduces the wheat crop, they may have to buy much more.'' In a metric ton, there are 36.7 bushels of wheat, the same of soybeans, and 39.3 bushels of corn. U.S. Called Logical Supplier **********With supplies of grain from Australia, Canada, Argentina and Western Europe either sold out or contracted for, the United States has become the biggest potential supplier, Mr. Levin said. **********''When our statistical wheat year ends May 30, we will have 1.1 billion bushels of wheat left over from past harvests,'' he noted. ''By the end of the corn year, Aug. 31, the surplus should be 5.7 billion bushels, and on the same date we should have 615 million bushels of soybeans.'' **********Given this supply situation, the news that the Soviet officials were coming to Washington for grain talks and the reports of the corn purchase helped to lift grain and oilseed prices in Chicago and Kansas City, Mo., last week to their best gains since the Soviet Union's Chernobyl nuclear accident in May 1986.  IMPASSE IN GRAIN TALKS **********WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 (Special to The New York Times) - American and Soviet agricultural trade officials today completed two days of talks without resolving their differences on a five-year bilateral grain pact. They discussed supply, demand and market situations for grain and reviewed prospects for sales. **********The Soviet Union had timed its new corn purchase to coincide with the consultations in Washington. Such talks are scheduled to take place twice a year under the terms of the agreement, but last fall the Russians refused to participate."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/18/business/last-minute-maneuvers-can-reduce-tax-bills.html": {"writer_name": "Gary Klott", "pub_date": "1987-02-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1682, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Series", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LAST-MINUTE MANEUVERS CAN REDUCE TAX BILLS", "print_headline": "LAST-MINUTE MANEUVERS CAN REDUCE TAX BILLS", "body_text": " **********This time of year, as April 15 draws closer, is when the motivation to find ways to trim income tax bills is greatest, though the options available for legally outwitting the tax collector are the smallest. **********There are, however, a few 11th-hour strategies that can shrink the size of a tax bill by hundreds or even thousands of dollars. **********Depositing money into a personal retirement account is the most notable and typically the most lucrative way to cut tax bills at the last minute. But considerable savings can also result from the way people fill out their tax returns, including how they choose among the various options for calculating tax benefits and the effort spent searching through personal records for overlooked deductions. **********Even the Tax Reform Act of 1986 has created a new last-minute tax saving opportunity for people who bought a computer or some other piece of business equipment. **********For this filing season, the new tax law safeguarded what has been a sacred and valuable ritual for millions of Americans scavenging for last-minute tax-cutting maneuvers - contributing to an Individual Retirement Account. Although the new law imposes restrictions on I.R.A. deductions, the restrictions do not affect 1986 returns. **********As a result, every worker has until April 15 to make a deposit of up to $2,000 to an I.R.A. and claim a deduction for the amount contributed on their 1986 tax return. One-income couples can contribute up to $2,250. Two-earner couples can contribute up to $4,000. **********For millions of middle- and upper-income Americans who are covered by a company pension plan, this will be the last chance to claim a full I.R.A. deduction because of the new law's curbs covering 1987 returns. **********Although the new restrictions raise questions as to whether I.R.A.'s will remain a worthwhile investment in the future for those no longer eligible for the deduction, tax advisers are encouraging their clients to take full advantage of I.R.A.'s this filing season as a way to save hundreds of dollars in taxes. **********''This year the answer is clear,'' said Peter Elinsky, a tax partner at the accounting firm of Peat Marwick. ''Even if you have to borrow, you probably want to contribute to an I.R.A. this year.'' **********The tax-saving opportunities are even richer for the self-employed, including workers with sideline businesses. In addition to making contributions to an I.R.A., they can make tax-deductible deposits to a Keogh retirement plan of up to 13.043 percent or 20 percent of their self-employment earnings, depending on the specific type of Keogh plan they have. In either case, the maximum contribution is $30,000 a year. Requirement on Timing **********The one proviso is that the Keogh plan must have been set up by last Dec. 31 in order for a contribution made this year to qualify for a deduction on 1986 returns. **********Yet there is salvation for people who did not make such advance arrangements. They can establish a Simplified Employee Pension Plan. These plans, which tax professionals often refer to as SEP's, are not as well-known or as widely used as Keogh plans, but they are similar in many respects. A key advantage of a SEP is that self-employed individuals can establish one any time until April 15 and still qualify for a deduction on their 1986 tax return. **********''A SEP is not for everybody, but it's good for the self-employed individual who wanted a Keogh plan but didn't get around to setting one up,'' said Mr. Elinsky. The maximum tax-deductible deposit that can be made to a SEP is 13.043 percent of self-employment income, up to $30,000. **********Investors who sold stocks at a profit in the closing days of 1986 have the unusual tax-saving option of reporting the gain on either their 1986 or 1987 return - whichever the taxpayer finds more beneficial. This special option applies only to stock sold between Dec. 24 and Dec. 31. As a rule, long-term gains from such stock sales should be reported on 1986 returns and short-term gains delayed until 1987 returns. Use of Income Averaging **********For investors and others who had an exceptionally large increase in income last year, the ''income-averaging'' method of calculating tax liability may prove of help in reducing their tax bill. Income averaging, which becomes extinct after this filing season, effectively spreads last year's income gain over a period of four years. **********Similarly, various options exist for calculating a number of deductions. **********For example, individuals have the option of figuring the size of their state and local sales tax deduction either by adding up all their sales tax receipts or by claiming a fixed allowance set forth in I.R.S. tables. Taxpayers who bought a lot of merchandise last year and saved their receipts might well get a bigger deduction by adding up actual sales taxes paid rather than claiming the I.R.S. allowance. **********In the same vein, people who used their car for business have the option of deducting actual operating expenses or a fixed I.R.S. mileage allowance. In most cases, actual operating expenses will provide a bigger deduction than the mileage allowance. **********If you purchased a computer or other equipment for your business, there are a few choices to figuring the write-offs, some better than others. Some Write-Off Choices **********For a computer, the cost can be written off over a period of five years, using the old law's depreciation formula. As an alternative, taxpayers are allowed to start taking advantage of the new tax law's depreciation schedules for writing off business equipment placed in service between last Aug. 1 and Dec. 31. In the case of computers, this option can provide larger deductions in the early years than the old formula. **********Still another alternative is a provision that allows taxpayers to immediately deduct up to $5,000 of the cost rather than depreciate the expense over a period of years. **********Tax savings can also be found by poring through personal records, including checkbooks, monthly credit card statements, receipts, appointment calendars and bills. The objective is to find deductible expenses that may have been overlooked. **********A glance through monthly phone company bills, for instance, will often uncover business calls made from home, a deductible expense. Last month's credit card statement will show the total amount of finance charges paid last year, which is fully deductible as interest expense on 1986 returns. And rummaging through canceled checks will often uncover such deductible items as dues paid to professional associations and subscriptions to professional or investment publications. Finding Arcane Benefits **********''Little things like that add up,'' said Albert Ellentuck, national tax partner at the accounting firm of Laventhol & Horwath. **********There are also some arcane benefits buried in the labyrinth of the tax code. For example, taxpayers who bought a new diesel-powered automobile can claim a one-time tax credit of $102 by filing Form 4136. **********If time permits, wait a few days after going through your personal records before sending in the completed return because some other deductible expenses may come to mind, recommends Stuart R. Josephs, a tax partner at the accounting firm of Seidman & Seidman. ''A week later people often remember something they didn't think of before,'' he said. **********Many of the tax benefits uncovered in plowing through personal records are available only to those who itemize deductions. But the point at which it pays to forsake the standard deduction and itemize is easier to reach than many taxpayers think. Homeowners often pay enough mortgage interest to make itemizing advantageous. And residents of high tax states will often find itemizing worthwhile just because of the deduction for state and local taxes. For 1986 returns, the point at which itemizing becomes beneficial is when itemized deductions exceed $2,480 for individuals and $3,670 for married couples filing a joint return. Fairly Liberal Deadlines **********For taxpayers who were working up until the closing hours of 1986 trying to maximize their deductible expenses, the tax law provides fairly liberal deadlines. If payment was by check, the expense qualifies for a deduction on 1986 returns so long as the check was placed in the mail by midnight Dec. 31 - regardless of when the recipient received it or cashed it. If payment was made by credit card, the deduction qualifies on 1986 returns as long as the charge was made by midnight Dec. 31 - even if the charge did not show up on your credit card statement or was not paid for until this year. **********Filing the return at the right time can also save a few dollars. As a rule, if you expect to receive a refund, file early. The earlier in the season your return is filed, the quicker the I.R.S. is able to process the refund. And the earlier the money is in your own hands, the earlier you can put it to work earning interest. **********On the other hand, if you owe the I.R.S. money, procrastination can pay. By waiting until the last minute to send in the check, you can keep the money profitably invested in your own account. **********Next: Personal deductions. **********PHONING THE I.R.S.  The Internal Revenue Service operates a telephone assistance program to answer taxpayer inquiries about Federal income tax returns. The New York Times is not equipped to handle personal tax questions and asks that they be directed to the I.R.S. Phone numbers for the metropolitan area are:  Manhattan/Bronx/Staten Island - (212) 732-0100  Brooklyn/Queens - (718) 596-3770  Nassau - (516) 222-1131  Suffolk - (516) 724-5000  Westchester/Rockland - (914) 997-1510  If you live in neighboring states, or in other areas outside the above, call the general toll-free number: 1-800-424-1040"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/02/business/market-place-medical-goods-look-profitable.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1987-01-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 753, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Medical Goods Look Profitable", "print_headline": "MARKET PLACE; Medical Goods Look Profitable", "body_text": " **********Numerous companies in the medical supplies industry have good prospects, according to an analysis by the Value Line Investment Survey. **********''A weaker dollar should stimulate sales abroad, while a more stable hospital admissions rate augurs well for domestic performance,'' the investment advisory service said.

Tobacco Stocks Favored **********Tobacco stocks have consistently been one of the equity market's most profitable groups during the 1980's and Salomon Brothers expects this pattern to continue in 1987. **********For the five years ending in 1985, for example, the tobacco industry showed the highest return on equity of all groups in Standard & Poor's 400-stock industrial index. During this period, the industry's return on equity averaged 20.3 percent. The drug industry ranked second with a return on equity of 19.2 percent, followed by the publishing group with 18.6 percent. **********The average showing for 29 industries was a return on equity of 12.1 percent for the five years. **********''We believe that the tobacco industry will continue to be one of the leaders in profitability, based on projected earnings growth of 16 percent in 1986 and 26 percent in 1987,'' said Diana K. Temple, who follows tobacco issues for Salomon Brothers. ''This would compare with the flat earnings we expect for the S.& P. 400 in 1986 and the 22 percent expansion - before write-offs - we look for in 1987.'' **********According to the firm's investment coding, stocks of four tobacco companies are expected to outperform the general equity market during the next 6 to 12 months. These are the Loews Corporation, Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco and U.S. Tobacco. Two other issues - American Brands and Universal Leaf Tobacco - are expected to match the market's overall performance. Merrill Turns Cautious **********Merrill Lynch suggests a cautious approach to investing as the new year begins. **********''We sense that 1987 will be a year of change and greater risk but not the end of the bull market for financial assets,'' said Robert J. Farrell, Merrill Lynch's chief market analyst, in assessing prospects last week. ''We think it makes sense to move cautiously at the outset and hold reserves, even though we think a good rally to start the year, as stocks rebound from tax selling, could be appealing to traders.'' **********Mr. Farrell has an extensive list of stock groups that he favors for the new year. The sectors include electrical equipment, airlines, auto accessory, chemical, paper and forest products, containers, pollution control, computer software and services, tires, mobile homes, office supplies, telephone, natural gas and selected drugs. **********Recently, Merrill Lynch market analysts have cited the likelihood that the Dow Jones industrial average could decline to as low as 1,700 or 1,750 -possibly in the first quarter of 1987 - before the bull market moves to new highs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/04/world/delhi-s-poor-get-2-blankets-but-little-else.html": {"writer_name": "Sanjoy Hazarika", "pub_date": "1987-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 985, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DELHI'S POOR GET 2 BLANKETS BUT LITTLE ELSE", "print_headline": "DELHI'S POOR GET 2 BLANKETS BUT LITTLE ELSE", "body_text": " **********Shivering in the biting evening cold, hundreds of poor and ill-clad men, homeless and anonymous, slip every night into the warmth of a huge concrete dormitory next to the Delhi railroad station in the old walled sector of the capital. **********Inside, they stand in lines to collect their quota of two blankets apiece from the dormitory supervisor and then look for a sleeping place. **********When they find a space that is unoccupied by a huddled, prostrate form, they quickly settle down, putting down their blankets and making themselves as comfortable as possible.

They take in about 5,000 people every night in the winter, although social workers familiar with the problem say this is only a fraction of the homeless population. **********''We have no families or homes in Delhi,'' said Ram Prasad, from the Garhwal district in the state of Uttar Pradesh.

Now the appeal is to a much broader spectrum of office space users, as exemplified by two current projects in lower Manhattan in which old buildings are being recycled as condominiums. **********In TriBeCa, at the corner of Hudson and Harrison Streets, a development company, Rockefeller Properties, is turning the 101-year-old former Mercantile Exchange Building into six full-floor condominium units. **********A few blocks to the north and east, at 121 Sixth Avenue, at Broome Street, a warehouse building is being converted into condominium spaces for nonprofit organizations. The developer of that project is the Center for Alternatives, a nonprofit group in Manhattan that operates programs for disadvantaged youths. **********''It was a matter of finding a long-term solution to our space problems or maybe being forced to close,'' said Charles D. Terry, executive director of the Center for Alternatives. The group draws financial support from more than 100 foundations, corporations and government agencies. **********The organization's office space and center, known as The Door, are currently situated in the former Cooper-Siegel department store at Avenue of the Americas and 18th Street. From that 55,000-square-foot space the organization offers a spectrum of after-school programs that include health care and career counseling. **********When the organization signed its lease in 1975 the space cost $2 a foot. But that was when the neighborhood had little appeal for most office tenants. Now the stretch of Avenue of the Americas below 23d Street is undergoing a transformation. Owners of the grand old department store buildings there are turning them into luxurious office and showroom spaces. **********A renewal of the Center for Alternatives lease, Mr. Terry said, would have required a rent increase of more than 300 percent.

The six condominium units there range from 7,000 to 12,870 square feet. **********Meile Rockefeller, president of the company that is developing the condominium project, said the high cost of the restoration and renovation work meant that if the space had been offered for lease the rents would have been higher than for the space in other renovated buildings in the area. **********''We decided that the project was much more viable as a condominium,'' Ms. Rockefeller said. ''But office condos are not for every company. They are generally more suitable for private or closely held companies that are asset-based and do not have to answer to shareholders concerned with bottom-line reports.'' Ms. Rockefeller is a granddaughter of Nelson A. Rockefeller, the late Governor and Vice President. **********So far two of the six units have been sold. Saks International, a commodity trading company, has signed a contract for the third and fourth levels of the building. The developers are close to making a deal for the fifth floor.

Lambert, the independent real estate deal maker who last year sold half his company, Eastdil Realty Inc., to Nomura Securities and then disappeared from the marketplace, has come out of hibernation. **********After nine months of total submersion in Japanese ways of looking at real estate, Mr. Lambert has returned to New York armed with a longer perspective on the market and a hoard of cash from Japanese investors eager to acquire assets in the United States. **********His first deal as a Nomura affiliate, a $325 million mortgage on an office building on Third Avenue at 55th Street, is vintage Lambert with an Asian flavor - complex, innovative and long-term. It provides the investors, who are clients of Nomura, with a favorable fixed rate of return for 10 years and a chance to make a killing in 1997 by converting a portion of the mortgage into a 49 percent share of the building at today's price. **********The deal, which closed last month, symbolizes the increasingly sophisticated methods being used by Japanese investors to acquire real estate in the United States. After drawing widespread attention in 1986 for the record prices they were paying for property in New York and elsewhere, the Japanese have increasingly turned to American partners to guide the placement of their real estate investments through more indirect channels. **********Though they have drawn far less attention this year than last, Japanese buyers have doubled their rate of investment in American real estate. After pouring $6 billion into the market in 1986 - and then watching its value erode as the dollar continued to decline against the yen - the Japanese are expected to invest more than $10 billion in the United States before the end of this year, according to several industry estimates. It will be the fourth consecutive year that the Japanese investment has more than doubled. A Shift in Investors **********As the scale of investment has grown, the nature of it has changed. The first Japanese entrants into the American market in 1984 and 1985 were the giant institutions: major banks, insurance companies and trading organizations. The next, the wave that started arriving in the middle of last year, was represented by private family corporations with mountains of cash reserves and access to low-interest financing. Their investments ran to the hundreds of millions of dollars each, usually in prime office properties that were fully leased. **********In New York, Japanese institutions bought the Exxon Building and the Tiffany Building on Fifth Avenue, among other properties, at prices nearly double those that had prevailed two years earlier. In Los Angeles, another buyer set a record for a single property with the purchase of the ARCO Towers for $620 million. Other deals forced up market prices in Atlanta, Washington and Boston. **********While those institutional and large private investors are still in the market, they are not alone. The tier of investors tapped by Nomura for Mr. Lambert's deal includes those prepared to buy units of $10 million each but who wish to have no direct involvement in negotiating the deal or managing the property. These players, generally private business operators, prefer to treat real estate as just another asset in a portfolio. 'That Makes a Good Fit' **********''Because there is plenty of capital available in Japan, the interest rates are very low,'' Mr. Lambert said. ''As a result, Japanese investors are often satisfied with a yield of less than 9 percent.'' For American borrowers, by contrast, a mortgage interest rate at that level is a bargain. ''That makes a good fit,'' Mr. Lambert said. **********The debt-for-equity option also takes advantage of the long-term view of real estate held by many Japanese investors. Property owners in Japan tend to hold on to their real estate for generations. ''Add to that the expanding population and the scarcity of land on which to build and you have an inflation rate for property of 50 percent a year,'' Mr. Lambert said. ''Given their perspective, they don't mind locking in the price at the present level and then waiting for as much as a decade to take ownership.'' **********The new wave of Japanese investors has as its primary focus the same market as its predecessors, Manhattan. The sales materials prepared by Nomura to interest its clients in Japan featured the skyline of midtown with the 47-story skyscraper at 919 Third Avenue circled in red. ''Manhattan Real Estate'' read the cover, in English. **********In many ways the arrangement resembles the real estate syndication deals of the 1970's, in which private investors, primarily Americans, poured billions of dollars into property deals put together by finance specialists. As the popularity of syndication deals spread, the money fueled a speculative boom in real estate that was driven by tax advantages rather than demand. **********The syndication business collapsed in 1986 as outlines of changes in the Federal income tax laws emerged, and it became obvious that Congress intended to eliminate many of the tax advantages of real estate investment. **********The Nomura syndication deal, however, is not tax-driven. Its economics are based on the interest from the mortgage and the ownership option that will allow the investors to cash in on any rise in the value of Manhattan real estate. Owners Also Gain **********The agreement also offers advantages to the owners of the building, a private limited partnership whose members include partners in Lazard Freres & Company and Lazard Realty Inc. They will gain access to the value that had been tied up in the 17-year-old tower without paying income taxes and without relinquishing ownership, at least for now. If the market continues its bullish climb for another 10 years, they will still own more than half of the building. **********While the deal opened up the Manhattan market to a new tier of Japanese investors, it also opened up the capital base of Nomura, the world's largest stock brokerage house, to Mr. Lambert, fulfilling a dream he envisioned 20 years ago when he created Eastdil. **********''I always wanted to operate an independent investment banking organization focusing on real estate,'' he said, ''and I wanted to do it with other people's money.'' Large Financing Role Sought **********If all goes according to plan, Eastdil will complete at least an additional $700 million worth of deals with Nomura clients in the next 12 months and will double that pace in 1989. By then, Mr. Lambert said, he expects Eastdil to have leaped back into the forefront of real estate finance, alongside of Goldman, Sachs & Company and Morgan Stanley & Company, the American investment banks. **********Mr. Lambert helped create such now-common financing mechanisms as sale-lease-back deals, in which a company sells its property and then leases it back from the new owner. He talked other companies into joint venture deals with real estate developers, giving the companies a stake in the completed project. **********In the process he earned a reputation on Wall Street as the dean of real estate, not so much for his age (he is 49 years old) as for his imagination, his mastery of the business and his courtly approach. **********In the last few years, however, he had been overtaken by the larger Wall Street houses whose emerging real estate departments could draw on the capital, the broad client base and the sales abilities of their organizations. **********To many in the industry, his sale last December of half of Eastdil to Nomura for $50 million represented Mr. Lambert's decision to take his winnings and run. Run he did, to Tokyo, where he huddled with Nomura's senior staff to plot a new assault on the American market. **********''There is no shortage of capital,'' Mr. Lambert said. ''It's just a matter of putting together the right structure for the right piece of real estate.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/10/business/advertising-jobs-for-cabot-and-ammirati.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1987-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 157, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jobs for Cabot And Ammirati", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Jobs for Cabot And Ammirati", "body_text": " **********Ammirati & Puris's direct marketing unit has been tapped to work for Chemical Bank's Consumer Finance Group, while up in Boston, Cabot Advertising is taking on Northeast Savings, the largest savings institution in New England. **********Both accounts will probably bill in the neighborhood of $4 million. **********The business from Chemical, which in its present form really did not have a previous agency, will be for a direct-marketing effort in behalf of its Gold Mastercard and Premier Visa card. **********Northeast Savings, which operates in New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts, previously worked with Muir, Cornelius, Moore.

Kaunda, under pressure from the International Monetary Fund, has instituted what are considered some of the toughest economic measures in Africa.

The centerpiece of the program is a weekly auction of about $9 million of Zambia's meager foreign exchange reserves, attended by business executives, importers and others in need of hard currency. Vital Imports Increased **********The auction has increased the availability of vital imports to industry, heightened the volume of nonmineral exports because of more attractive prices and made access to foreign exchange more equitable. **********Prices for basic commodities have skyrocketed - inflation is running at 50 percent - and the price of food is out of reach for many. One resident said it was increasingly difficult to buy ground up bones for dogs at the market. These days, people are eating the bones. **********Crime has become a constant threat. Motorists, fearing that they will be mugged, have taken to running through red traffic lights at night. The police, aware of mounting attacks, look the other way. Creed of 'Humanism' **********Fundamental questions being asked here include to what extent President Kaunda can carry out the economic measures without shelving his personal creed of ''humanism,'' a blend of Christian principles and African socialism that puts man at the center of development and advocates a classless society. **********In addition, can President Kaunda, chairman of the so-called front-line states neighboring South Africa, go ahead with his pledge to impose sanctions against South Africa, which would undoubtedly cause even greater economic suffering here? **********And in a nation of a tiny elite and so many poor, can Zambia put in place such a sweeping program of change without ripping apart the country's fragile social and political fabric? **********The fabric began to tear last month after President Kaunda abolished certain food subsidies, resulting in a 100 percent increase in the price of high-grade breakfast meal, the staple diet of urban Zambians. Riots in Copper Belt **********The decision led to three days of riots in the industrial copper belt of northern Zambia, where the average miner makes about $16 a month. The riots left at least 15 people dead in some of the worst street violence since this former British colony known as Northern Rhodesia became independent in 1964. **********The President, leader of the most peaceful and politically stable country in the unsteady southern African region, was clearly shaken by the riots. He restored the subsidies. **********Mr. Kaunda's decision caused concern among Western donors over how seriously the move could hurt economic initiatives. By introducing the subsidies, according to economists, the Government would add about $13 million a year to a deficit already far above the International Monetary Fund's target. Finance Ministry officials said last month that the budget deficit would be more than $240 million, about 30 percent of gross domestic product. The I.M.F. target was 9 percent of gross domestic product this year, economists said. Copper Slump a Factor **********Zambian and Western economists say the economic initiatives are all the more critical because of the sustained slump in the copper industry, which provides Zambia with at least 90 percent of its export earnings. Experts predict that the nation's copper reserves will be virtually exhausted in 15 to 20 years. **********Western donors say that Zambia's long-neglected agricultural sector, plagued by lack of capital and expertise, is the short-term salvation for the economy once copper reserves are depleted. Zambia, with rich arable land and reasonable rainfall, has tremendous agricultural potential. **********''People were being killed, so Kaunda had to do something,'' said one Western economic specialist. ''This does not mean that he is ending the reform effort, because he is still extremely committed to it. People have to keep in mind that the subsidies are just one component of a broad array of reforms taking place."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/17/business/gains-at-lotus-and-microsoft.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 198, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gains at Lotus And Microsoft", "print_headline": "Gains at Lotus And Microsoft", "body_text": " **********Buoyed by strong sales of core products and gains in overseas sales, the two leading personal computer software companies - Microsoft and Lotus Development - reported record revenues and earnings today. **********Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., had third-quarter net income of $19.1 million, or 69 cents a share, up 80 percent from $10.6 million, or 42 cents a share, a year ago.

They are Colgan Airlines, a commuter airline out of Dulles, and Key Airlines, a charter carrier, which will also feed Continental's flights. **********Continental said that it had paid $13 million for the 10 existing Presidential gates and that it had assumed construction obligations of $8.7 million for five more gates. **********Continental yesterday staged an elaborate news conference in a ballroom of the Marriott Marquis Hotel at which Mr. Lorenzo; Tom Plaskett, president of Continental; Donald C. Burr, president of People Express, and Douglas C. Birdsall, president of New York Air, held wads of bills from a pile, said to be of $5 million in cash, stacked around the podium. The $5 million, Mr. Lorenzo said, symbolized what travelers would save daily when they flew Continental after Feb. 1, when the carrier will absorb People Express and New York Air. **********But Mr. Plaskett acknowledged that fares to some People Express destinations would rise after it was absorbed and most of its operations were transferred to Terminal B at Newark International Airport. **********Continental, in a bid to attract new customers, said it would offer a 2-for-1 ticket sale in January for flights in February from New York City area airports."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/04/business/van-study-set-by-ford-and-nissan.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Chira", "pub_date": "1987-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 731, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VAN STUDY SET BY FORD AND NISSAN", "print_headline": "VAN STUDY SET BY FORD AND NISSAN", "body_text": " **********The Nissan Motor Company and the Ford Motor Company have agreed to study a joint venture to develop and produce in North America a version of the popular mini-van. **********The feasibility study, announced Friday by Nissan, could lead to a joint venture between the two companies and eventual production of a mini-van line by the early 1990's. The two companies will discuss the location of a plant, whether to build a new plant or use an existing Ford plant, and parts procurement. A final decision on the venture will be made next spring, when the feasibility study ends. **********The project could help Nissan, which has been suffering from the strong yen and losing market share to Japanese rivals. Nissan has long been eager to link up with one of the Big Three American auto makers because of the Toyota Motor Company's relationship with the General Motors Corporation. Moreover, analysts see a huge potential mini-van market. Joint Design Cited **********Nissan executives said that, because the two companies would jointly design a new mini-van and assemble it in North America, the scope of the project could exceed that of the ambitious joint venture between G.M. and Toyota. In that venture, G.M. and Toyota are assembling cars based on an existing Toyota design at G.M.'s former plant in Fremont, Calif. **********''The depth and scope of this cooperative project in North America between the U.S. and Japanese auto industries is unprecedented,'' said Yutaka Kume, Nissan's president. ''We sincerely hope that the feasibility studies will produce satisfactory results for both companies, making it possible to go ahead with the project.'' **********Yukihito Eguchi, a spokesman for Nissan, said that the company envisioned yearly production of about 200,000 mini-vans. Nissan and Ford would produce a new, larger version of the existing mini-van, a scaled-down van that has become popular for shopping, family trips and commuting. Nissan already markets a version called the Stanza Wagon, and Ford sells a model called the Aerostar. Mr. Eguchi said that Nissan expected demand for mini-vans to increase to at least one million models, compared with 630,000 sold last year. Effect on Competitive Position **********Benjamin J. Moyer, an auto analyst for Merrill Lynch's Tokyo branch, said that Nissan could benefit from the venture by learning new technology about the mini-van from Ford, as well as bolstering its competitive position against Toyota. **********''Nissan is interested in strengthening its ties with one of the Big Three, which would help balance the relationship G.M. has with Toyota,'' he said. ''The market is a promising one, and it's a lot easier for Nissan to enter that market with help from Ford than to enter it on its own.'' **********Mr. Moyer said, however, that he had reservations about whether it was best for Nissan to extend itself and spend more money on a new project at a time when it is suffering from financial losses and struggling to cut costs and improve its market share in Japan. ''Perhaps Nissan might be able to use the money in a more productive way,'' he said. **********Nissan is expected to report a loss for the fiscal year that ended March 31, its first since the postwar recovery. The strong yen has hurt Nissan more than other auto maker, coming at a time when Nissan was losing market share in Japan and the United States and producing less-innovative, less-stylish new models. Mr. Moyer said that he expected Nissan to lose 30 billion yen, or $214 million, in its fiscal year. In September, Nissan reported a $121.9 million loss for the first half of the year. **********But Mr. Moyer said that Nissan had moved very rapidly to restructure its dealerships and cut costs, so rapidly that he reduced his previous estimate of Nissan losses. The company has stopped overtime work, cut utility costs, reduced bonuses to its dealers and wrested large price reductions from its parts suppliers, he said. **********Ford also has a long relationship with Mazda, in which it owns a substantial stake. Calls to Mazda's head offices in Hiroshima were not answered Friday. Many offices were closed for an extended Japanese holiday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/21/business/advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1987-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 30, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; People", "body_text": " *********** Douglas K.

The move amounted to an acknowledgment that the Government could not prove that a crippling security breach occurred at the embassy. **********The 21-year-old Marine corporal, Arnold Bracy of Queens, was freed from the Marine brig in Quantico, Va., and immediately accused investigators of coercing his confession and misusing the results of a lie-detector test. **********Charges similar to those against Corporal Bracy were dismissed last month in a case against another Marine guard, Sgt. Clayton J. Lonetree, although he still faces a court-martial on other espionage counts. Guards Worked as a Team **********Sergeant Lonetree, who set off the spying investigation last year when he confessed to an affair with a Soviet woman, is still accused of providing Soviet agents with secret American documents, including embassy blueprints and the names of American intelligence officers. **********The two guards, who worked as a team, were originally charged with allowing Soviet agents to roam through the United States Embassy. **********The charges, now dismissed, accused them of turning off embassy alarms as the Soviet officials rummaged through some of the most sensitive areas of the American compound, including the communications room and the military attache's office. **********Those charges were considered the most serious because such actions could have compromised United States intelligence sources within the Soviet Union. 'Feeling Pretty Good' **********The Marine Corps said it had dropped the case against Corporal Bracy because it was unable to corroborate the purported confession he later recanted. **********At a news conference this afternoon at Quantico, however, Corporal Bracy said he had been coerced into confessing and denied allegations that he had sexual contact with a Soviet woman who has been linked to the K.G.B., the Soviet intelligence agency. **********He asserted that Naval Investigative Service agents had forced him into a confession by threatening that he would otherwise lose his rights as an American citizen and as a member of the Marine Corps. **********''They told me my life would be over at 21 years old,'' Corporal Bracy said. ''I wouldn't have a decent job, wouldn't eat a decent meal.'' **********''I'm feeling pretty good right now,'' Corporal Bracy said. ''I knew I didn't do it.'' **********He added: ''I didn't feel the Government was going to just drop it. I was figuring they were going to push it as hard as they could to save face.'' **********The decision today prompted expressions of concern about the quality of the investigation against the two Marines. **********American officials said they were unsure of the extent of espionage in the embassy. 'Horrifying Confusion' **********Although senior Administration officials pointed to the original confessions and said they still believed Soviet intelligence agents entered the embassy, prosecutors reportedly were convinced that the charges would not hold up at court-martial. The Marine Corps left open the possibility that Corporal Bracy might face charges in the future. **********A Federal law enforcement official said that although there was now ''horrifying confusion'' about the facts of the case, embassy officials in Moscow ''should continue to assume a worst-case scenario.'' **********''They just have to assume that the Soviets ransacked the place,'' the official said. **********Another Federal official, however, said investigators had found no evidence that Soviet agents had placed bugs on American communications equipment in the embassy, as was originally feared. **********Based on the confession that Corporal Bracy later recanted, the two Marines were charged with escorting Soviet agents through the compound in early 1986. Sergeant Lonetree was charged in January and Corporal Bracy in March. No Physical Evidence **********A Pentagon officer said today that investigators had been unable to find any physical evidence to back up Corporal Bracy's original confession that Soviet agents had roamed through the embassy in Moscow. **********''When Bracy recanted, we had nothing left to go on,'' the officer said. **********A law-enforcement official said equipment from the embassy's communications room had been brought back to the United States. Bracy's Account **********At his news conference today, Corporal Bracy said he was approached in June 1986 by a Soviet cook who worked in the Moscow embassy and was apparently trying to recruit him as a spy. He said he immediately rebuffed the woman and later reported the incident to his commander. **********About three weeks after the original encounter with the cook, the corporal said, he went to a diplomat's home, where the cook worked, to tell her he was angry that Soviet officials would even consider him as a potential spy. He said he failed to report that incident to his commander. **********''I made my mistake when I tried to act on my own,'' Corporal Bracy said. **********It was his former partner at the embassy, Sergeant Lonetree, who set off one of the largest espionage investigations in the nation's history. **********Last year Sergeant Lonetree went to Marine commanders and acknowledged having had an affair with Violetta Seina, a Soviet woman who worked as a secretary at the Moscow embassy. **********According to records detailing the confession, the affair had evolved into an espionage relationship with her purported uncle, who called himself Sasha. Lie Detector Tests an Issue **********After Sergeant Lonetree made his statements, Corporal Bracy was called in for questioning. He said the two guards had allowed Soviet agents to enter sensitive areas of the embassy - a statement he has since recanted. **********At the news conference today, Corporal Bracy's chief defense lawyer, Lieut. Col. Mike Powell, contended that naval investigators improperly used lie detector, or polygraph, tests to coerce the confession last March. **********Defense lawyers have asserted that polygraph examiners mislabeled the results of tests administered earlier this year to Corporal Bracy. **********The lawyers said that the device showed the Marine guard was truthful when he denied espionage activities, but that the test results described him as deceptive. **********The Naval Investigative Service, which handles criminal inquiries for the Navy and Marines, declined comment today. Concern About Inquiry **********Military officials said privately that there was concern that the spying investigation had been mishandled. They would not be specific. **********In a written statement, the Marine Corps said that the investigation ''was conducted in a correct and professional matter'' and that Corporal Bracy remained a suspect in the investigation. **********According to military officials, Corporal Bracy was found deceptive on some, but not all, questions asked during polygraph tests. Under Defense Department polygraph rules, they said, if a suspect is found deceptive in answering one major question, all of the answers are considered deceptive. **********The Marine Corps said it was unclear where Corporal Bracy would be assigned within the service.  MARINES IN MOSCOW: HOW THE CASE HAS EVOLVED  Jan. 7 1987: The Marine Corps discloses that a former embassy guard in Moscow, Sgt. Clayton J. Lonetree, 25 years old, is being held; he is said to have confessed in December that he gave secrets to a woman who was a K.G.B. agent who had a custodial job at the embassy and reportedly seduced him.  Jan. 31: The Marines formally charge Sergeant Lonetree with having given the Russians the names and photographs of C.I.A. agents in the embassy and floor plans of the embassies in Moscow and Vienna.  March 24: The Marines announce the arrest of a second former embassy guard, Cpl. Arnold Bracy, 21, on suspicion of espionage as a result of the investigation of Sergeant Lonetree.  March 26: A second espionage charge is lodged against Sergeant Lonetree, based on information supplied by Corporal Bracy. Administration officials say women who were K.G.B. agents trapped them into providing secrets.  March 27: The Marines charge that Sergeant Lonetree and Corporal Bracy allowed Soviet agents to roam through sensitive sections of the embassy on ''numerous occasions'' in 1986. Sergeant Lonetree is also accused of allowing Soviet agents to enter a room where classified messages are decoded. The Marines assert that Sergeant Lonetree paid Corporal Bracy $1,000. There are reports, however, that Corporal Bracy has recanted his confession.  March 30: The Marines announce that all 28 guards at the embassy will be replaced in April. William Kunstler, the defense lawyer, makes public a record of the questioning of Sergeant Lonetree in which the sergeant says he cooperated with a Soviet agent because he was interested in ''knowing what the K.G.B. wanted to know,'' but found himself in over his head.  March 31: The Marine Corps arrests Staff Sgt. **********Robert S. Stufflebeam, who served as a guard at the embassy, on suspicion that he violated regulations against social contacts with Soviet women. He is later charged with socializing secretly with Soviet women and his case is given to a military inquiry. Pending a decision on whether to prosecute, he is assigned to a unit at Quantico, Va.  April 8: The Marines announce that Sgt. John J. Weirick, 26, who was a guard at the United States Consulate in Leningrad before returning to the United States, is being detained on suspicion of involvement in espionage. He is held for questioning at Camp Pendleton, Calif., but is not charged.  April 22: Corporal Bracy is offered immunity from prosecution but rejects the offer.  May 10: Corporal Bracy says the incriminating statements he made were coerced by agents from the Naval Investigative Service.  May 15: The Marines announce that they are dropping the most serious charge against Sergeant Lonetree - that Soviet agents had been allowed inside the embassy - but that espionage charges involving the passing of documents have been upheld. Sergeant Lonetree is still to be court-martialed and remains in the brig at Quantico, but no longer faces the death penalty. The Marines say the charges that were dropped were based on hearsay.  May 20: The Marines announce they are releasing Sergeant Weirick because military law does not permit prosecution for an espionage offense more than two years old.  June 12: The Marines dismiss espionage charges against Corporal Bracy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/21/world/senate-split-on-gulf-debates-compromise-on-war-powers.html": {"writer_name": "Linda Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1987-10-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 650, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Senate, Split on Gulf, Debates Compromise on War Powers", "print_headline": "Senate, Split on Gulf, Debates Compromise on War Powers", "body_text": " **********Amid deep divisions over how to formulate policy on the Persian Gulf, the Senate began debate today on a compromise approach to the War Powers Resolution. **********The Senate took up the bipartisan compromise after voting 67 to 28 to cut off debate. Those on both sides of the debate had expected the cloture motion, which requires 60 votes, to fail because of a filibuster threat by some Republicans who oppose any assertion of Congressional authority over the President's conduct of foreign policy. **********The Senate was then scheduled to turn to the debate over the confirmation of Judge Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court. **********Instead, 17 Republicans joined 50 Democrats in voting for cloture, and the Bork debate was put aside. Senators attributed the unexpected success of the cloture vote to growing concern over recent events in the gulf. The measure is expected to come to a vote Wednesday. Measure of Senate Unease **********This evening, the Senate voted 92 to 1 in favor of a resolution supporting the President's retaliation against Iran on Monday. The only vote against was that of Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon. **********The compromise War Powers legislation is itself a measure of the Senate's unease over how far to assert itself in the face of the Reagan Administration's refusal to comply with the 1973 law. The legislation is sponsored by the Senate majority leader, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, and the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, John W. Warner of Virginia. **********Under the War Powers Resolution, American military forces that are deployed in ''hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated'' must be withdrawn after 90 days unless Congress declares war or extends the deadline. The Reagan Administration regards the law as unconstitutional. **********The Byrd-Warner compromise does not itself mention the War Powers Resolution. Nor would it require Congress at this time to decide what it wants to do about the Persian Gulf. Rather, the measure would guarantee a vote, 90 days from now, on a resolution to be submitted at that time. **********The measure does not specify the nature of the resolution, which could range from an invocation of the full War Powers Resolution at its most sweeping to a much narrower expression of congressional concern. Partnership in Policy **********In effect, the measure would simply guarantee that Congress in January would have a legislative vehicle, if it wished to use it, for insisting on some sort of partnership in formulating policy in the gulf. **********''If we're going to put lives at stake in a conflict, we do that much better as one nation than as one man,'' said Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a Connecticut Republican. **********Mr. Weicker has tried and failed several times to persuade the Senate to invoke the full War Powers Resolution. On the Senate floor today, he described the Byrd-Warner compromise as ''watered down,'' an ''evasion'' of the law on the books. Nonetheless, he said he would support it. **********''I suppose half a loaf is better than none,'' he said. ''At least it can get passed, and around here there is much merit in that.'' **********The measure would also require the President to make a full report, in classified and unclassified form, on the situation and American policy in the Persian Gulf. **********It also contains two statements of policy: an expression of Congressional support ''for a continued U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf,'' and an expression of ''reservations about the convoy and escort operations of U.S. naval vessels'' in support of the Kuwaiti oil tankers now flying the American flag."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/15/world/us-grand-jury-indicts-2-men-on-smuggling-to-south-africa.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 234, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Grand Jury Indicts 2 Men On Smuggling to South Africa", "print_headline": "U.S. Grand Jury Indicts 2 Men On Smuggling to South Africa", "body_text": " **********Two California men have been charged with trying to smuggle sensitive military manuals to South Africa in an indictment that asserts they were given their orders by the naval attache at the South African Embassy in Washington, officials said Friday. **********The indictment, issued Wednesday by a grand jury in Los Angeles, charges that the California men, George M.

They appealed to the Reagan Administration for financial support. **********The consortium is a dramatic move by the semiconductor makers, usually an intensely competitive group, to pool their resources in the bruising war with Japan's electronics giants. **********The announcement ended weeks of frantic negotiations over the form and the goals of the prototype plant, called Sematech, for Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology Institute. Cost Is Uncertain **********Supporters of the venture conceded that in their rush to achieve consensus about the formation of Sematech, they left unanswered some important questions. For example, they could provide no estimate of the overall cost of the project, although participants in an industry meeting here quoted figures of $300 million to $400 million a year. **********Sematech's organizers said they had yet to establish with the Justice Department that the project does not violate antitrust regulations. ''It is conceivable that there is a major antitrust issue here,'' said Charles E. Sporck, the chief executive of the National Semiconductor Corporation, who played an influential role in the formation of the effort. **********Irwin Federman, the chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group that has been lobbying heavily in recent weeks for Federal assistance in the venture, called the project critical to saving ''an industry vital to this nation's economy, national security, and its role as a technological leader.'' **********''Our problems today result from the fact that we are individual companies engaged in a battle against nations,'' he said. Choice for Administration **********Government officials involved in talks with the industry's leaders said the consortium plan could force the Administration to choose between its desire to hold down spending and its concern with national security. **********The Defense Science Board, a Pentagon advisory group, recently urged the Government to contribute $200 million a year for chip-manufacturing development, saying the failure to act would threaten national security. Semiconductors are critical components in computers, weapons and sensor systems. However, the proposed Pentagon budget for 1988 sets aside only $50 million for semiconductor technology initiatives. **********Some officials outside of the Pentagon are hesitant to provide direct support to a project they believe is too late and perhaps doomed. And such involvement would appear to run counter to the Administration's view, at least until now, that the industry should revive itself. **********The goal of the prototype plant, according to industry officials, is not to produce semiconductors. Rather, it will develop advanced manufacturing techniques and equipment that can be transferred back to the member companies - an area where Japan has excelled. The plant is expected to be running within 18 months. Emphasis on Manufacturing Sought ''We have tended to put a higher prestige on the engineers who have done chip design that on those who have done the nitty-gritty of manufacturing,'' said Robert Noyce, a founder of the Intel Corporation, at a news conference here today. ''That has to change.'' **********While the Semiconductor Industry Association's board provided few details of their negotiations on Sematech, the plan appeared to mark a defeat for Intel and a victory for the International Business Machines Corporation, which owns about a quarter of Intel. **********Intel officials had argued that in addition to developing manufacturing techniques, Sematech should produce chips in high volume in order to verify that the techniques had industrial applications. But I.B.M. was fearful that it might face pressure to buy any chips produced in volume at the plant, even if other chips of higher quality or lower cost were available. The prototype facility, I.B.M. said, should only make samples of the chips, as ''a vehicle to test our manufacturing skills.'' **********In the end, I.B.M. prevailed. That appears to pave the way for it to contribute heavily to the project, and some speculate it will provide the design of one or more advanced chips to speed the facility's start. **********''We're quite happy with the result,'' said Paul R. Low, the president of the company's general technology division. He said it was too early to say what I.B.M. would contribute, because operating plans for Sematech will not be prepared until June 1. **********The consortium may be too late to save some of the industry's most vulnerable members, Mr. Low said. ''But wringing one's hands over the past is not all that useful,'' he said.

Family income, rather than the particular achievement of a husband or wife, then, is becoming the key to making a living and to job success. **********''The spotlight is on the two-earner family, in which the husband and wife are highly committed to the labor force,'' says Gordon Green, a Census Bureau official. Audrey Freedman, a labor specialist at the Conference Board, a business-research organization in New York City, added: ''One of the first things to do is to get married, or remarried, and stay that way.'' **********The statistics tell the story. After more than a decade of stagnant incomes, only 17.7 percent of the 115.8 million Americans employed last year earned $30,000 or more, despite an unemployment rate that has fallen to its lowest level in this decade. Those who broke the $30,000 barrier were mostly corporate executives, or doctors, engineers and lawyers, or in banking and finance. But about 36 percent of the nation's jobholders brought home between $15,000 and $30,000. And the types of jobs they held - as salesmen and clerks, craftsmen, medical specialists, television and computer repairmen and paraprofessionals - are among those multiplying most rapidly in the American economy. **********While most American workers appear to be stuck in jobs that pay below $30,000, family incomes are another matter. There were 64.5 million families, people who are related and live together, in the United States last year, accounting for most of the nation's population, according to the Census Bureau. Some 26 million of these families, or 40 percent, had incomes above $35,000, which many experts consider a sort of minimum level today for entry into the middle class in most parts of the nation. **********The great majority of these families - 21.6 million in all -were grouped in the range of $35,000 to $75,000, and nearly 80 percent of the families had two or more wage earners. **********In the postwar years until 1973, two wage earners were not so necessary, though women had begun to enter the work force in large numbers. The median family income, adjusted for inflation, grew steadily from 1947 until 1973, when it reached $28,200 (as measured in 1984 dollars). After that watershed year family income reversed course, declining steadily until 1983 and rising modestly since then, but only to $27,906 last year. Meanwhile, home ownership, one of the great definers of the middle class, became ever more costly. **********''If you were earning in this median range, with two kids and college ahead, you would be scratching your head and wondering if you were in the middle class,'' said Frank Levy, a University of Maryland economist and the author of the recent book ''Dollars and Dreams,'' a study of American income distribution. ''That's because there is no longer the income growth that characterized earlier periods and gave people a sense of improving their lot. You have to be a two-earner family today to qualify for the middle class.'' **********A recently announced Labor Department survey illustrated the point. It showed a dramatic increase in the number of working women with children under a year old. Only 31.6 percent of these mothers held jobs in 1977. But the percentage rose to 43.3 in 1982 and 51.9 as of last March. **********''These families need the money to maintain what is perceived as the ideal life style,'' said Howard Hayghe, a Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics economist. ''In a sense, the wife brings along a dowry to the marriage, and the dowry is her job.'' **********That job, however, usually brings in less than the husband's. Only rarely does a blue-collar husband - a man working in construction or in a factory or as a craftsman or supervisor -find himself married to a woman employed as an executive or as a doctor or lawyer. In most cases, to reach the high end of the $35,000 to $75,000 income spread, one spouse, usually the husband, often is a corporate executive, or the owner of a business, or a doctor or a lawyer, Mr. Hayghe said. **********Roughly 20 percent of men in this top managerial category are married to women in similar work, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. But in the majority of cases, the wives are teachers, nurses, secretaries, clerks, receptionists, travel agents and computer operators. **********Aside from having a second wage earner in the house, income potential today is affected more by education than it was a decade ago. In the early 1970's, baby boomers were still entering the labor force and there was an oversupply of workers, which damped wages. As a result, the spread between the incomes of a high school and college graduate were not that great, Mr. Levy noted. Both had roughly an even chance of climbing into middle-class incomes. **********But today, the much smaller post-baby-boom generation is just coming of age and young workers are in short supply. College graduates are particularly sought after in an economy dominated by service-sector jobs, and the unemployment rate among the college-educated is almost zero, labor experts say. The changing dynamics are reflected in the growing income gap for high school and college graduates. The median income of men with five years or more years of college was $34,731 last March, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, and that for women with the same education was $26,399 - making a total of $61,130. By comparison, the median incomes of a man and woman with only high school degrees totaled $36,888. **********But a middle ground is beginning to develop - one occupied by people who can be trained at community colleges as paraprofessionals, or as skilled office personnel who can be assigned to a variety of administrative jobs and data-processing tasks. **********The paraprofessional is a particularly promising trend, according to Richard Belous of the Conference Board. ''If you go to Harvard and became a brain surgeon, you are obviously in,'' he said, ''but for the people who don't go to Harvard, there can be relatively good careers as paraprofessionals in law, medicine, accounting, even engineering.'' **********As Mr. Belous sees it, the paraprofessional is coming into his own because American companies, facing stiff global competition, are seeking less-expensive ways to get work done. Many high-priced lawyers, for example, spend a great deal of time filling out forms and doing other routine work that can be handled by paralegals, Mr. Belous said. **********''The same is true in accounting, where bookkeeping is a big factor, and in medicine,'' he said. ''The model for the future, in fact, is the visit to the dentist, where five minutes is spent with the receptionist, twenty with the hygienist and only five with the dentist. Similarly, in law, you will come to see the senior partner, but the paralegal will do the work.'' (As an accompanying listing shows, the percentage gain in openings for paralegals is expected to be the highest among all occupations during the rest of the century.) Already in Washington, paralegals in top law firms earn more than $15,000. And the salary range for paraprofessionals in various fields might in time rise to between $15,000 to $20,000 a year in various parts of the nation, ''once American companies accept the concept of the paraprofessional,'' Mr. Belous said. **********That is not the level of income generally associated with middle-class status. ''But it does not take very exalted jobs, if two people hold them, to get above the $35,000 level,'' said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. **********It does, however, take patience. Hundreds of thousands of two-earner couples are holding jobs that might start at $15,000 or so and climb over the years to the mid-$20,000 level. This slow progress is reflected in the age breakdowns of wage earners in multi-income families. **********''The key is stability,'' said Stephen J. Rose, an economist with the Washington State Senate and an expert on income distribution. ''Even without a high level of professional training, if you move up the seniority ladder as a salesman or a factory worker or a school teacher or a paralegal, and stay with your family, you can make it into the upper income levels.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/10/world/saudi-businessman-in-iran-affair-tells-of-playing-games-with-us-aides.html": {"writer_name": "Jeff Gerth", "pub_date": "1987-03-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2486, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SAUDI BUSINESSMAN IN IRAN AFFAIR TELLS OF 'PLAYING GAMES' WITH U.S. AIDES", "print_headline": "SAUDI BUSINESSMAN IN IRAN AFFAIR TELLS OF 'PLAYING GAMES' WITH U.S. AIDES", "body_text": " **********The Saudi businessman who helped finance the sale of arms to Iran, Adnan Khashoggi, says he played ''games within games'' with William J.

But a Federal law-enforcement official with knowledge of the Iran-contra investigation understood that there had been communication between the Justice Department and the Saudi Embassy in Washington regarding permission to seek the records in Saudi Arabia. **********He declined to elaborate, but he added that Mr. Khashoggi had presented ''pretty wild stories'' about the location of his financial records and assets. **********''As best we can tell from Khashoggi,'' the official said, ''his records might be in the dunes of Arabia, and they might be on the dark side of the moon.''  TRAIL OF MONEY TAKES CIRCUITOUS ROUTE **********The interviews here and a review of some selected documents that Mr. Khashoggi and Mr. Furmark permitted this reporter to examine indicated that the flow of money in and out of Lake Resources, the Panama-registered shell company used by Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, the former National Security Council aide, and his associates, are far more complicated than previously known. **********The records show that a number of previously unpublicized Khashoggi companies were used to transfer money to both Lake Resources and Mr. Ghorbanifar. **********Documents in the report of the Tower Commission, which was appointed by President Reagan, indicate that Mr. Khashoggi was at the same time receiving money from both Lake Resources and Mr. Ghorbanifar. **********Mr. Khashoggi said Mr. Ghorbanifar asked him in 1986 to raise $100 million for the contras from the Saudi royal family so that he and Mr. Khashoggi could gain ''influence in Washington.'' Mr. Ghorbanifar made the suggestion when the Administration was quietly seeking alternative funding for the contras, after Congress had declined to authorize $100 million in aid. **********Mr. Khashoggi said he rejected Mr. Ghorbanifar's proposal, but that the two men later planned to split a $100 million sale of American missiles to Iran with the guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed Afghan Government. Mr. Khashoggi said that under the scheme, which never came to fruition, half of the missiles would have been delivered to the Afghan guerrillas and half to the Iranian Government. **********The information provided by Mr. Khashoggi indicates that Saudi money was the principal source of funds for the Iran arms sales, and that the money from the Iran sales in turn supported private operations by Colonel North and his associates, including support for the contras. Both Mr. Khashoggi and Mr. Furmark continue to deny any knowledge of the diversion of proceeds from the Iranian arms sales.  A CASEY FRIEND PLANTED FALSE STORY **********Crucial questions about the money from the Iran arms deals remain unanswered. What, for example, were the sources and amounts of funds available for diversion and where did they end up? **********During the interview, Mr. Khashoggi seemed to revel in the games he had played with American officials, portraying the complicated series of financial transactions and occasional mistatements to Americans as good financial sport. **********In his discussion of the way he said he misled Mr. Casey, Mr. Khashoggi said the story about the angry Canadian investors who wanted their $10 million back was planted last fall with Mr. Casey by Mr. Furmark, a longtime friend of Mr. Casey. **********Mr. Khashoggi said the story was intended to increase pressure on the Reagan Administration to reimburse the $10 million to Mr. Khashoggi, so he could repay an associate. **********Mr. Furmark was not aware that there were no Canadian investors when he met with Mr. Casey, Mr. Khashoggi and Mr. Furmark asserted. The money came not from Canadians, Mr. Khashoggi said, but from a Saudi business associate, whom Mr. Khashoggi declined to identify. **********Mr. Furmark's discussion with Mr. Casey about the Canadian investors helped start inquiries by the C.I.A. and Congressional investigators of the Iran-contra arms sales. **********Two Canadian associates of Mr. Khashoggi's, Ernest Miller and Donald Fraser, administer a Cayman Islands company through which the $10 million in Saudi funds passed. Their names were the ones mentioned when Mr. Furmark made his disclosures last fall.  GRACIOUS HOST SHOWS ANGER OVER THE TOWER REPORT **********Mr. Khashoggi, who likes to parry with those seeking to unravel his finances, seemed relaxed throughout the evening of interviews, a gracious host who showered his guests with nuts, condiments, Perrier and arak, a strong Middle Eastern alcoholic drink. **********He was repeatedly interrupted by aides, telephone callers and other visitors. After meeting with a visiting oil minister from the Persian Gulf, Mr. Khashoggi slipped away to change from a finely tailored Western business suit into a long, flowing, white caftan that is Saudi Arabia's national dress. **********Some of Mr. Khashoggi's angriest comments were reserved for the Tower Commission. He denied a finding in the commission's report that he had billed both Mr. Ghorbanifar and Lake Resources for $20 million in payments for the arms sales. **********He said he was not aware that ''personal'' funds from the Saudi royal family had been the largest source of financing for the rebels in Nicaragua over the last two years, a conclusion that is hinted at in the Tower report. After the report was released, sources familiar with testimony before the commission said the third country referred to as being the largest source of contra financing was Saudi Arabia. **********Mr. Khashoggi has enjoyed a close relationship with various members of the royal family. The role of Mr. Khashoggi and Saudi officials in arms sales by American companies to Saudi Arabia prompted many investigations in the 1970's, though Mr. Khashoggi was never accused of a crime. **********He characterized his current relationship with the Saudi Government, as well as with other Arab nations, as ambiguous, warm when his efforts at private diplomacy succeed and cool when they do not. **********Mr. Khashoggi said he had made King Fahd aware of his intentions to improve relations between the United States and Iran from the beginning, but that the King did not want to get involved because it was too risky and sensitive.  A FABLE ABOUT RECORDS BURIED IN SAUDI SANDS **********Mr. Khashoggi said he was pleased that ''my country did not issue a statement saying we don't know you'' or take back his passport after it became publicly known that he was dealing with Israel and Iran, both officially shunned by Saudi Arabia. **********In the case of Iran, evidence in the Tower Comission report and elsewhere shows that Saudi Arabia was quietly improving its relations with Iran, at least partly in tandem with the secret United States initiative. **********Now, Mr. Khashoggi said, the United States had asked his country for help in getting information on his role in the Iran arms sales. Federal officials, he said, had asked Prince Bandar, the Saudi Ambassador in Washington, about gaining access to his records, a request that Mr. Khashoggi suggested may have been prompted by a jest he made to an F.B.I. agent. Mr. Khashoggi said he had told the agent that his records were buried in the sand under seven hills in Arabia. **********Mr. Khashoggi said the remark had been a joke, but he also said he had been ''mean'' to the F.B.I. agent who interviewed him. **********Some of Mr. Khashoggi's bank accounts have been frozen in Switzerland at the request of the United States - six accounts containing some $60 million, he said. Mr. Furmark said other related accounts in the United States may also have been blocked. Mr. Khashoggi complained that the two-month freeze had forced his American companies to petition for restructuring under Federal bankruptcy statutes. **********But, he added with a smile, Federal investigators had not been able to locate all of his accounts since they do not know their whereabouts, or even the names of all of his companies. **********''Some we were lucky, some we were not so lucky,'' Mr. Khashoggi said of the requests to freeze assets.  A BEWILDERING BLUR OF BANK TRANSACTIONS **********Some of Mr. Khashoggi's records are stored in Geneva, at Management and Control Inc., a Khashoggi-controlled company that handles his accounting and banking records. Sammy Fadel, the head of the company, which occupies an entire floor of a downtown office building, declined to discuss any of Mr. Khashoggi's financial affairs or to make available any additional records. **********The records made available by Mr. Khashoggi at the interview, compiled by Mr. Fadel and his associates, reveal an almost indecipherable series of transactions. They show that Mr. Khashoggi transferred $25 million into the Lake Resources account in the Credit Suisse bank in Geneva in 1986. **********The transfers came from various personal accounts, as well as from corporate accounts called Trivert and Garnet, some at Credit Suisse and at other banks in Monte Carlo, where the United States does not enjoy the kind of access to banking records that it has with Switzerland. **********The records further indicate that Mr. Ghorbanifar paid $20 million to Mr. Khashoggi, apparently repayment for $25 million Mr. Khashoggi had advanced to Lake Resources; $8 million to the accounts that funded Lake Resources; issued one $3 million check, whose recipient was not specified; and wrote three other checks totaling $9 million to two other companies, Kremdale and Galliot. **********Mr. Furmark, who tried to explain the recorded transactions to this reporter, said Mr. Khashoggi had told him that Kremdale, Trivert, Garnet and Galliot were all Mr. Khashoggi's companies. **********''Who knows how many companies he has?'' Mr. Furmark said in an interview on Saturday. **********The documents also show that Mr. Khashoggi paid money directly to Mr. Ghorbanifar. For example, a check for $533,250 drawn on the account of Garnet on April 16, 1986, was described by Mr. Furmark as reimbursement of Mr. Ghorbanifar's expenses. Mr. Khashoggi said, moreover, that he had bankrolled Mr. Ghorbanifar, and that last May he had taken out a $22 million short-term life insurance policy on the Iranian, whom he described as his partner and ''contact.''  DISAVOWAL OF THREAT TO KILL GHORBANIFAR **********The Tower report reproduced a memo by Colonel North dated July 30, 1986, suggesting that if the Iranians didn't receive an expected shipment of weapons, ''Ghorbanifar will be killed by his creditors (they are the beneficiaries of a $22 million life insurance policy).'' **********Mr. Furmark and Mr. Khashoggi denied this suggestion as well as many other statements contained in the Tower report. Mr. Khashoggi said, for example, that he knew nothing about $40 million to $59 million that the commission said had been paid to Mr. Ghorbanifar for an aborted missile sale in November 1985. **********Mr. Khashoggi said that he had spoken in recent days with Mr. Ghorbanifar, Mr. Furmark and Amiram Nir, the Israeli adviser involved in the Iran sales, and that they all agreed that the Tower Commission and the Senate Intelligence Committee had erred in stating that millions of dollars in profits from the American arms sales to Iran had moved through Mr. Ghorbanifar to Mr. Nir and Mr. Khashoggi. Mr. Ghorbanifar could not be reached for comment. **********Mr. Khashoggi, said by Mr. Furmark to have few records of the affair, said he considered Mr. Ghorbanifar ''the most fascinating man I've ever known,'' except, he joked, for himself."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/16/business/currency-news-congress-amenable-to-further-drop.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Kilborn", "pub_date": "1987-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 720, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONGRESS AMENABLE TO FURTHER DROP", "print_headline": "CURRENCY NEWS; CONGRESS AMENABLE TO FURTHER DROP", "body_text": " **********As the value of the dollar stabilized today, leading members of Congress said they would welcome a further decline to help shrink the nation's trade deficit - if it came in an orderly way. **********Meanwhile, West German officials said they were considering reductions in their nation's taxes.

Faster growth would increase the German demand for imports and help reduce the American trade deficit. **********The Federal Reserve Board reiterated Paul A. Volcker's view that the dollar had fallen enough, but Wall Street traders said they had found no evidence that the Fed chairman was trying to stop the dollar's fall by buying dollars and selling other currencies in the open market. **********''We need to use caution and bring it down carefully because there's always the risk it could fall precipitously, and that wouldn't be good for anyone,'' said Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee. **********An aide to Robert H.

Danforth, Republican of Missouri, said, ''I am very satisfied with the decline of the dollar so far, and I would be satisfied with more.'' **********Senator William Proxmire, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the Banking Committee, said: ''I welcome the decline. No question about it.'' Like Senator Bentsen, he said the Administration should now try to put pressure on Canada, South Korea and Taiwan, whose currencies have changed little against the dollar, to let it fall in relation to them. **********Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, introduced legislation this month directing the Administration to force a dollar decline by negotiating reductions in the currency with such countries and by selling $30 billion in the foreign-exchange market over three years. An aide said Senator Moynihan said the drop in the dollar made little difference to the proposal. ''He thinks the dollar should go lower,'' the aide said. **********The sharpest declines have occurred against the Japanese yen and the West German mark. **********Views in Congress seemed generally at odds with those of Mr. Volcker and consistent with those of the Administration - that the Government should not feed a decline by selling dollars or appealing for a lower dollar but that it also should not try to halt erosion of the currency. **********Today the White House declined to comment on its apparent differences with Mr. Volcker, which have arisen periodically throughout the retreat from the dollar's peak of two years ago. ''It's a longstanding policy that we don't try to tell chairman Volcker how to run his business,'' Albert R. Brashear, a spokesman for the President, said at a briefing with reporters. Analyst's View of Conflict **********The conflict between Mr. Volcker and Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d may be less acute than it has sometimes appeared, and it may even be intended to assure that the decline of the dollar does not run out of control, said Rimmer De Vries, chief international economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. **********Mr. De Vries said the two had been playing a harmonious duet, with one supporting a lower dollar and the other objecting but working together to guide the decline in an orderly way. ''This is a beautiful game they're playing,'' he said. **********An economics official at the West German Embassy here, Dietrich von Kyau, said he thought Bonn would decide how to deal with Mr. Baker's appeals for a more vigorous economy soon after the Jan. 25 national elections in West Germany. **********''The Government will decide what it should do for the world economy,'' Mr. von Kyau said.

Forecasts were that the surplus, if unchecked, would reach $10 billion this year. **********The Government announcement did not include a detailed program, and to some degree it rearranged in a tidy package various ideas already under discussion. Nevertheless, it represented the clearest signal to date that the Koreans, who have long worried about being treated as a ''second Japan,'' want to blunt American trade anger before it strikes them, too. **********''It is significant in that they've put it down in black and white,'' a United States official said, adding, ''Let's see if it works.'' Baldrige Visit Scheduled **********The timing of the Korean action was important. It came not only on the day that retaliatory American tariffs were imposed on Japanese electronic products but also two days before Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige was scheduled to arrive for trade talks. **********Mr. Baldrige was quoted today in reports from Washington as saying that the deficit with Seoul would persist until there was ''a significant revaluation'' of the Korean won against the dollar. After years in which Seoul allowed its steady devaluation, the won has risen 6 percent against the dollar since the beginning of 1986, and it was fixed today at 839.7 to the dollar. **********But Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn Je, who also heads the Economic Planning Board, cautioned that there would be ''no remarkable appreciation'' in the won's value. Exports 36 Percent Higher **********By keeping its currency artificially low, at least in the American view, Korea has begun to elbow Japan aside in some overseas markets. In the first three months of this year, Korean exports were 36 percent higher than in the corresponding period last year. Its current account, measuring financial transactions and services as well as trade, has swung from a deficit to a sizable surplus. **********Increasingly, the United States has expressed its unhappiness with the trade policies of Korea and Asia's other emerging industrial powers, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. In Korea's case, Washington has demanded over and over that import restrictions be lifted on a range of items, including cigarettes, agricultural products, insurance and banking services, and even movies. **********Despite these exhortations, however, the American deficit in trade with Korea has continued to soar, jumping 60 percent last year above the 1985 figure of $4.6 billion. **********In their worry about being caught in the backlash against Japan, South Korean officials have argued that they should be given special American consideration, both as a struggling junior partner and as a country with a large military burden required by the threat from North Korea. Today's announcement was a tacit acknowledgment by Seoul that emotional arguments alone would not work. Goal of $5 Billion Set **********In a statement, Mr. Kim said, ''The Korean Government is convinced that a growing trade surplus is not only unsustainable but also counterproductive for Korea's long-term economic development.'' A major goal, he added, was to fix the overall current-account surplus at $5 billion. Without interference, it is expected to rise in 1987 to $8 billion. **********Some proposals had been mentioned before, such as shortening the list of 106 products now placed under import restrictions. Specific products were not cited, though. Nor were there details in a pledge that the Government would urge companies to restrain exports to the United States and find markets elsewhere. **********To help Korean companies buy imports, especially American goods, the Government said it would extend $3 billion in special loans. Most of the money would be in foreign currency that was earned through recent trade surpluses. That means, officials said, that they will not be able to devote all the foreign exchange they had intended to repaying the country's large external debt. **********That debt, $44.5 billion at the start of the year, was reduced in the first quarter to $42.8 billion. Expectations were that it would slip below $40 billion by the year's end, but that seems unlikely now, officials said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/01/business/talking-deals-preservation-with-a-profit.html": {"writer_name": "Albert Scardino", "pub_date": "1987-01-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 989, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Preservation, With a Profit", "print_headline": "TALKING DEALS; Preservation, With a Profit", "body_text": " **********WALTER BEINECKE JR. gave himself and his family a $50 million Christmas present this year, when he sold a major portion of the town of Nantucket, Mass., to the First Winthrop Corporation. **********Mr. Beinecke had spent the last 25 years redeveloping the town to keep it from self-destructing. **********Along with his father, Mr. Beinecke had helped organize Nantucket's preservation movement in the 1950's, to save the island's Greek Revival mansions and other landmark buildings. His interest in historic properties eventually led him to the board of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. **********Beginning in the early 1960's, the partnership he managed, Sherburne Associates, bought up much of the rundown waterfront of the old whaling community on the chip of land 30 miles out in the Atlantic Ocean, then fixed it up, building by building, filling in the holes with 18th-century reproductions. **********''If we had taken this beautiful place and allowed the same kind of beachfront motels and pizza parlors that visitors could find on the mainland, there would have been no reason for them to come the 30 miles out here,'' Mr. Beinecke said yesterday. **********But he was never interested in preservation of historic architecture for preservation's sake. He always intended to make a profit - even if it took him a couple of decades to do it. On Christmas Eve, he sold the holdings of the family partnership -160 buildings, including two hotels, the Nantucket Boat Basin, 36 retail buildings and 40 cottages. **********The Beinecke partnership had accumulated the properties gradually, renovating them a few at a time. The partners took advantage of tax rules on depreciation and historic preservation to help shelter income from other businesses. ''In the early years, there was no way to justify the investment based on the returns the properties were generating,'' Mr. Beinecke said. ''But we assumed we were building capital value as the years wore on, and as the economy of the island began to revive.'' **********The revival came slowly. After a century as a whaling port, Nantucket fell into a 100-year depression after a fire burned the town in 1846, Mr. Beinecke said. Then, after World War II, tourists began to find their way to the remote island. **********''The question was whether to provide for it in a way that would save what was worth seeing in Nantucket, or just let the growth happen,'' he said. **********Even after his family had become the largest landholders on the island, Mr. Beinecke often found himself arguing before the local preservation organization for greater restrictions on development. He often contributed money to groups attempting to buy up vacant land to block development. **********Such a strategy helped make existing properties - including the Beineckes' - more valuable, but it also tended to limit the freedom, and sometimes the income, of shopowners and developers. **********Mr. Beinecke also used his control of the commercial real estate of the island to moderate the traffic. He refused to allow one ferry boat to land at his marina, the only one on the island, when the ferry operator declined to reduce the number of passengers he was bringing each day. **********Rents in the shops on the rejuvenated piers soared tenfold, to $6,500 a month, but the customers came and the island's economy boomed. **********Still, as a real estate company, Sherburne was less than a runaway success. ''It was never a free-standing business,'' Mr. Beinecke said. ''Our principal business was Christmas Club A Corporation, which organized savings clubs for banks. We used the depreciation and other tax-related benefits to offset some of the profits from that business.'' **********The only way to realize the increased value of the properties was to sell them, but after playing such a large roll in the revival of the town's economy, the Beineckes were reluctant to let go. ''There was a strong element of family pride,'' Mr. Beinecke said. ''We wanted to find someone who would manage them with the same concern as we had for maintaining the standards of design and quality.'' **********Not until November did First Winthrop learn that the properties might be available. The Beineckes had already gone to contract with another buyer, but then that deal fell through. **********''We were prepared to act quickly,'' said Jeffrey D. Furber, an assistant vice president at Winthrop Financial Associates, the umbrella partnership over First Winthrop. ''The Beineckes were eager to complete the sale before the tax rates went up at the end of the year, and we were already acquainted with the properties.'' **********First Winthrop holds more than $5 billion of real estate around the country and employs 450 people. **********Among the company's largest holdings are a group of 19 buildings in New York City purchased from the MacArthur Foundation of Chicago in 1984. Those buildings include the Gulf and Western building at Columbus Circle and commercial buildings on Fifth and Park Avenues. **********After meetings in Boston, New York and Nantucket between Mr. Beinecke and Arthur Halleran Jr., chairman of First Winthrop, the deal was sealed. ''Mr. Beinecke was looking for a buyer who would hold the properties as a group, not sell them off piece by piece to help pay for the acquisition,'' Mr. Furber said. ''That fit our strategy perfectly. Our view is that if you buy and hold real estate that cannot be duplicated, you will eventually make money.'' **********Buying and holding worked for the Beineckes. Said Mr. Beinecke, ''Whether by the grace of God or inflation, we managed to make a profit in the end.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/world/a-dissident-returns-to-seoul-from-us-with-congressman.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 155, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Dissident Returns to Seoul From U.S. With Congressman", "print_headline": "A Dissident Returns to Seoul From U.S. With Congressman", "body_text": " **********A dissident who has lived in the United States for more than four years returned to Seoul today with a Congressional escort. **********''Today, I am so proud to be a Korean,'' the dissident, Lee Shin Bom, said, referring to the Government's pledges over the last two weeks to adopt democratic changes, including direct presidential elections.

Those activities are now under investigation by Congress and an independent counsel. **********Mr. Reagan appointed Mr. Carlucci last month to succeed Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter in the aftermath of the disclosure of the diversion. Admiral Poindexter resigned and Mr. Reagan dismissed a key N.S.C. staff official, Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, who has been linked to the affair. Other Officials Sought **********The official, who discussed Mr. Carlucci's intentions in an interview with a group of reporters, said he would also try to bring officials from other agencies into policy decisions. Some senior Reagan aides have explained that change as an attempt to prevent the National Security Council staff from secretly conducting major operations unknown to other top Presidential assistants. **********Among the other moves Mr. Carlucci will undertake is the appointment of a general counsel to handle developments related to the Iran affair, the official said. In addition, he will begin several policy reviews, including one of the Middle East that will examine United States policy options toward Iran in the aftermath of the arms scandal. **********Mr. Reagan had banned the N.S.C. staff from taking part in covert operations last month, pending the outcome of a review by a Presidential commission on what the role of the agency should be. Mr. Carlucci's planned prohibition would make the ban permanent even before the commission, headed by former Senator John Tower, a Texas Republican, has completed its deliberations. **********''There is no point,'' said the senior White House official of such operations by the National Security Council staff. ''I see no role for the N.S.C. in covert operations; a procedure is set up for that. 'Better in Other Agencies' **********''We shouldn't be doing as routine matter things that could be done better in other agencies. It's not a useful expenditure of our time and it tends to create friction with those other agencies.'' **********Under the new approach, the agency could still conduct secret diplomatic missions ordered by Mr. Reagan, the official said, but he suggested that they would not include formal covert operations such as the Iranian initiative. **********At the same time, he said steps would taken to assure that Mr. Reagan received all options before making national security decisions, a practice some officials have said was absent in the case of Iran. Mr. Carlucci has ties to the key components of the national security network as a former Ambassador, Deputy Secretary of Defense and Deputy Director of Central Intelligence. **********''Without commenting on this N.S.C. or a N.S.C. 10 years ago, I don't think you'd find anybody in government who feels that the process works as well as it ought to work,'' the official said.

Shultz today that they had no intention of retreating from their economic opening to the West or their adoption of some elements of a free-market economy. **********That theme, which an American official said was repeatedly stressed in nearly seven hours of talks with five leaders, was apparently meant to reassure American businesses that are contemplating investment in joint enterprises here. **********It was highlighted by the official New China News Agency, which reported that Deputy Prime Minister Li Peng, whose Soviet economic training has reputedly made him partial to Soviet-style central planning, assured Mr. Shultz that ''China finds no reason to change its policies of reform and opening the country to the rest of the world.'' **********Besides seeing Mr. Li for nearly an hour, Mr. Shultz met with Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian, Defense Minister Zhang Aiping, President Li Xiannian and Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang, who is also Acting General Secretary of the Communist Party. Several Topics Discussed **********An American official said they had discussed the Soviet military presence in Afghanistan and the American and Chinese aid to the Afghan guerrillas, the Vietnamese military presence in Cambodia, military and technical sales to China and the Soviet-American arms negotiations. **********The subject of the arms talks took up a good deal of time, the officials said, especially the announcement Saturday by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, that Moscow was willing to negotiate a treaty eliminating medium-range ballistic missiles in Europe without linking it to an overall strategic-arms accord. **********The State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said there were no plans for Mr. Shultz to visit Moscow soon to hold talks on this. But Mr. Redman would not rule out such a trip if warranted by the progress of negotiations in Geneva. **********Chinese leaders reportedly told Mr. Shultz of their desire to see the elimination of Soviet missiles in Asia, and Mr. Shultz was said to have repeated the American desire to see the number of medium-range missiles cut to zero. No Indication of Shultz Pledge **********There was no indication, however, that Mr. Shultz had given the Chinese any pledge to hold out for such a sweeping accord. The Russians have proposed reducing the deployment in Asia to 100 warheads on their SS-20 medium-range missiles - or to 33 missiles, since the SS-20 has three warheads - which would be a cut of 80 percent. **********On economic matters, Mr. Shultz, in a dinner toast, noted that ''American investment in China, second only to Hong Kong's, now reaches nearly $1.5 billion.'' **********''Important problems remain,'' he said, ''but if they are forcefully addressed so that the investment climate in China improves, the day may come when we will look back on such figures as only a small beginning.'' **********Some Western economic analysts, however, say they see the instability in Chinese politics as raising questions about future economic policy. They said that the progress of the ''reforms'' had been slowed and that although there was no immediate suggestion that the changes be rolled back, serious struggles were taking place in the hierarchy over the best course to take. **********In recent years, China has moved from collectivization in agriculture to household farming, allowing market forces to play the major role in shaping production and income. The industrial sector has not moved nearly as far, and last fall, the leadership decided not to proceed with what is called ''price reform,'' in which many prices would be allowed to rise to market levels. An Anti-Foreign Mood **********In addition, after student demonstrations in December and January and the dismissal of Hu Yaobang as General Secretary of the Communist Party, official criticisms and dismissals of several leading intellectuals have been accompanied by denunciations in the official press of ''bourgeois liberalism.'' This has begun to translate into a new anti-foreign mood, some foreign residents of Beijing say, represented by an increased wariness among many Chinese of befriending Westerners. **********Some Western political analysts say they believe that attacking intellectuals will alienate the very people needed to advance the modernization program. **********Mr. Shultz alluded to this when he said in his toast that each country had gained ''understanding of the differences and similarities between our respective values and traditions.'' **********He seemed to be chiding the Chinese for their expulsion of two Western journalists when he went on to declare that Americans, in their ''respect for human rights and freedom of expression,'' had ''learned the importance of a free press.'' **********''Since the founding of our Republic,'' he said, ''American journalists have sometimes been a thorn in the side of Government officials. But our history has also demonstrated their indispensable importance in safeguarding freedom and justice and in insuring the health of our democratic system. They also have a vital role to play in strengthening mutual understanding between our two peoples.'' **********An American official said the Secretary had also raised the subject in his private talks. Last year, John F. Burns of The New York Times was arrested and expelled, and more recently, Lawrence Macdonald, an American reporter for Agence France-Presse, had his visa revoked. **********Mr. Shultz also asked China to stop selling weapons to Iran, an American official said, arguing that the secret American sales were ''the exception'' and that the Administration's public campaign to halt the arms flow to Iran remained in effect. **********Mr. Shultz is scheduled to meet Tuesday with the Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping.

Simulation gives the engineers an invaluable assist, Mr. Gunther said. **********An A.T.F. pilot will be bombarded by data from as many as 20 sensors. ''One of the huge challenges is how to present that information to the pilot, to boil it down and put it in a usable context,'' said Terry L. Clawson, a spokesman for Northrop in Los Angeles. ''If you gave him just raw numbers without interpreting them, he'll be dead.'' **********In July, mock combat exercises began inside the 28-foot-diameter dome at Lockheed's lab. About 130 people work in the modernistic, windowless building, sheathed in a porcelain-like material to contain electronic emissions. A second $30 million simulator is planned. **********With a pilot at the simulator's controls, the A.T.F. noses into a cloudless desert sky. One computer controls the flight, determining the plane's aerodynamics, engine propulsion and firepower. **********As the fighter gains altitude, mountains ringing the desert floor shrink away. Two computers create the external world, including enemy planes and missiles. One draws the outline of these objects, based in part on real-world data obtained from classified sources. The other computer colors the panorama and adds texture, such as pockmarks in asphalt or the bolt-pattern of an aircraft wing. **********As the pilot pushes the plane into a steep turn, he even feels the body-crunching force of gravitational pull. Pneumatically powered pumps adjust the pressure of the pilot's suit and seat. **********When the plane's systems detect an incoming missile, the pilot pushes a button to arm a weapon, locks on the target and fires. Yet another computer determines whether the cockpit electronics hampered or helped the engagement. **********The heart of Lockheed's new simulator is a scene creator made by General Electric. **********Assisting G.E.'s scene generator, called the Compu-Scene IV, is a special purpose computer made by G.E. that makes five billion calculations a second, 10 times more computations than the previous model, said Kenneth Kilner, manager of product support for General Electric's simulation department at Daytona Beach, Fla. **********The scene generator's power comes from the use of specialized integrated circuits rather than software, he said. The computer updates the scene 60 times a second, key to faithfully creating the illusion of high speeds without blurring. **********Since virtually every domestic aircraft maker already owns simulators - there are fewer than 30 systems combined - future sales are expected to come from overseas military contractors, Mr. Kilner said. **********Nonmilitary customers of simulators are also emerging. Mercedes-Benz is using them to design trucks. NASA bought one for space station design. And a film maker used one to create a scene for ''The Last Starfighter.'' **********These simulators employ basically the same technology as that used for training pilots, but the nonmilitary market is estimated at $2 billion annually, far great than the $88 million that is expected to be spent on military aircraft simulators this year. **********Simulator developers have become better at selectively applying computing power in critical areas, such as adding the dappled texture of tree leaves in a close-up, but dropping it from the background where it goes undetected and is a waste of computing resources. **********Nevertheless, improvements could come by adding still more power and utilizing more photographic data. Despite the realism of these simulators, some sensitive pilots can detect a lag of about one-twentieth of a second between the time they push the controls and the scenario changes. **********The other weakness of computer dramatizations is probably impossible to fix: the failure to capture the psychological impact of reality. **********Said Lockheed's Mr. Gunther, ''No matter how hard we try - we have sound, we have motion, he's been in the simulator four hours - he knows he can push a little green button that says reset and he's safe.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/03/business/sosnoff-raises-bid-for-caesars-world.html": {"writer_name": "Alison Cowan", "pub_date": "1987-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 833, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOSNOFF RAISES BID FOR CAESARS WORLD", "print_headline": "SOSNOFF RAISES BID FOR CAESARS WORLD", "body_text": " **********For the second time since starting a bid to take control of Caesars World Inc. in March, the Wall Street investor Martin T. Sosnoff has raised his offer to the company's investors, to $35 a share in cash and equity securities. **********The package offer includes common stock that would allow current shareholders to end up retaining about a 30 percent stake in the company, Mr. Sosnoff said last night. **********Mr. Sosnoff already owns 13 percent of the Los Angeles casino operator. His latest bid is an attempt to dissuade Caesars World shareholders from accepting a similar offer from management that would give them a $26.25 dividend plus a continuing stake in the company valued by the market at about $8.50 a share. Thus, Mr. Sosnoff's new bid is designed to top the management offer by about 25 cents a share. Three-Month-Old Battle **********The three-month-old battle until now has been especially noteworthy because Caesars World tried to elude Mr. Sosnoff's overtures through the use of a relatively new defensive technique: the leveraged recapitalization. In a ''recap,'' the company pays shareholders a huge one-time dividend in exchange for all but a small, ongoing stake in the company. **********The stocks of recapitalized companies - while they represent far greater risk to both shareholders and the corporations that issue them -have enjoyed a rousing reception on Wall Street, where they have been bid up to reflect investor interest in a continuing equity participation in the company. That strong performance, in part, has made it hard for outsiders to successfully challenge a recap once management has proposed one. **********The challenge has not been lost on Mr. Sosnoff, who is critical of management's plan. ''It's the typical management recap, where they erect so much barbed wire, that if they're successful, no one will be able to touch this company for a hundred years,'' he said. Defeating a Recap **********But Mr. Sosnoff's initiative could be significant in suggesting a way for a hostile raider to defeat a recap after all. Henry Gluck, the chairman of Caesar's World, acknowledged when he announced the recap that he was taking a cue from Mr. Sosnoff by deciding that his company could weather additional debt. Now Mr. Sosnoff, borrowing an idea from the Caesars management, plans to allow other shareholders in Caesars to retain some equity interest in the company if he is the victor. **********''The argument of Mr. Gluck that shareholders still have a stake in the company's future will apply to us as well,'' explained Mr. Sosnoff, who credited his investment bankers at Paine Webber for the idea. **********Mr. Sosnoff first raised his offer last April, to $32 a share from $28. The latest package will not require the investor to raise more than the $930 million in cash and $88 million in preferred stock that he was prepared to pay out before. **********This time, the difference will come from common stock, roughly 30 percent of the equity that Mr. Sosnoff was hoping to own after a successful takeover and that he is now giving back to investors. **********Mr. Sosnoff's plan does not differ dramatically from management's plan in the amount of debt it would require. So if the current stock price indicates what a highly leveraged Caesars would be worth under either plan, Mr. Sosnoff has added $83 million worth of common equity to his previous offer - 9 percent more. **********Ordinarily, offering securities is considered less attractive than cash in a bidding contest. But Mr. Sosnoff was unable to resist increasing the stock portion of the offer when he saw how the market reacted to management's proposal, a source close to him said. The stock of Caesars, on a when-issued basis, closed yesterday at 8 5/8, roughly 16 times projected earnings. **********Mr. Sosnoff admitted he was startled by how well the stock market has responded to Caesars' plan. ''We think it's trading at an enormous premium based on cash flow and earnings projections five years out,'' he said. ''So yes, it surprised us. It surprised us a lot in fact.'' **********Mr. Sosnoff is now offering $35 in cash for 26.5 million shares of Caesars, 84 percent of the 31.7 million shares he does not own. In the event of a merger, the shares not covered by the tender offer get the equivalent value in preferred and common stock. **********Of course, if everyone turns their shares into Mr. Sosnoff, then each share on a prorated basis, would get roughly $29.55 in cash, $2.77 in preferred stock and an equity stub worth about $2.60, in light of where Caesars stock has been trading on the market."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/03/business/what-s-new-in-compensation-putting-a-pinch-on-management-perks.html": {"writer_name": "Claudia Deutsch", "pub_date": "1987-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 546, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PUTTING A PINCH ON MANAGEMENT PERKS", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN COMPENSATION; PUTTING A PINCH ON MANAGEMENT PERKS", "body_text": " **********SHOULD companies take from the rich or give to the poor? **********The Tax Reform Act has made it far more difficult to offer tax-favored benefits to highly paid people without making them available to the hoi polloi. Compensation managers, therefore, must decide whether to curtail executive perks, or give them to more employees. ''They just cannot be as stingy with the rank and file,'' said James E. Cheeks, vice president of the Research Institute of America Inc. **********Under the new rules, for example, there is an annual $7,000 limit on the amount anyone can put into a 401-k or other savings plan that qualifies for favorable tax treatment. And the average contribution of employees making less than $50,000 cannot differ by more than 2 percent from the average of those making more. **********Many companies are tinkering with their plans to make the math work out. 3M, for one, will now let employees making less than $50,000 contribute 18 percent of their salary to a 401-k, up from a former 10 percent cap. ''This is solely to meet the discrimination rules,'' said Donald A. Kissack, director of benefits. **********Employer-funded retirement programs cause other problems. Companies must give full pensions to anyone with five years of service. And starting in 1989, companies cannot use Social Security payments to reduce any employee's pension by more than half. **********While those rules serve mainly to increase pensions for lower-paid employees, other rules decimate the pensions of top management. Starting in 1988, companies can only grant pensions on a maximum of $200,000 a year in compensation, no matter how high the actual pay. And the new law puts a heavy tax bite on people whose annual retirement income from all tax-favored sources goes over $112,500. **********''It had been Government policy to forgo tax revenue on pension plans in order to encourage employers to undertake the care and feeding of their employees,'' said Pearl Meyer, an executive consultant at Handy Associates. ''But there has been a shift in policy, along the idea of not giving tax breaks to higher-level employees.'' **********Companies that make heavy use of part-time employees have yet another problem. The new law mandates that by 1989 any employee working 15 hours a week must be offered the same benefits as full-time employees. **********To many companies that represents a no-win situation. ''Offering full benefits at 15 hours could cost a lot, but trying to come up with schedules of less than 15 hours takes away scheduling flexibility,'' said John J. Boyd, senior vice president for personnel at Rich's department store in Atlanta. **********Even companies with few part-time employees, and across-the-board benefits plans, are not escaping trouble-free. ''Most of our plans will probably be unaffected, but going through the measurements to make sure that they are in compliance is a real chore,'' said Thomas E. Burns, manager of employee benefits for the General Electric Company. **********In fact, Mr. Burns already has spotted a potential problem. G.E. has an employee savings plan that lets participants withdraw money after three years. Now, employees who withdraw money before retirement will incur a tax penalty."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/20/business/advertising-lintas-s-hot-idea-for-lipton.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1987-11-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 662, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Lintas's 'Hot' Idea For Lipton", "print_headline": "Advertising; Lintas's 'Hot' Idea For Lipton", "body_text": " **********''WE'RE out to make hot tea hot,'' exclaimed Susan Read, effusive executive vice president and executive creative director of Lintas:New York, as she turned to the VCR to bring the new campaign for Lipton tea to the screen. It was, she promised, a big idea.  In any event it was big enough to supplant Don Meredith, the one-time Dallas Cowboys quarterback who had been spokesman for the flow-through tea bags for more than a decade. The new campaign, at the moment two 30-second spots and a 60, is shooting at the younger side of the 18-to-54-year-old target audience but will continue to use daytime and prime-time network TV to reach them. **********The spots, directed by Leslie Dektor, largely feature young, with-it adults in a variety of pursuits and all enjoying their Lipton. The point of it all - as the lyrics written and sung by Jake Holmes explain - is to dismiss the fatuous notion that hot tea is the drink for ''little old ladies.'' **********So as Jake, accompanying himself on the piano, sings, ''Look at all those little old ladies drinkin' Lipton tea,'' the young swingers pass in review.  See them rockin'  See them rockin'  Now that's gentility.  Look at all those little old ladies  Drinkin' Lipton tea. **********Joining Ms. Read were David P. Bell, director of product management for regular and specialty teas at Thomas J. Lipton, a subsidiary of Unilever, and Stephen W. Norcia, executive vice president, account services at Lintas:New York. **********All seemed equally turned on to the advertising, urging a visitor to enjoy repeated showings. **********The spots, at least the 30's, will get their first public airing on three soaps on ABC next Tuesday and on prime time Nov. 29 during ''Murder, She Wrote'' on CBS. **********Mr. Bell was not forthcoming with the size of his ad budget. While showing spending of about $16 million for all of Lipton's teas in 1986, Leading National Advertisers, the independent media monitor, recorded only some $3.1 million for tea bags. And that's what we're talking about today. **********The total tea market, Mr. Bell said ringingly, is worth about $1 billion at the retail level, and that includes regular tea, which he calls black tea; special blends; herb teas; ice tea mixes, and all the rest. **********Of the total, he said, black tea sales come to something like $527 million. **********In the area where sales are monitored - supermarket and grocery stores - sales volume is flat. However, Mr. Bell said, sales volume is known to be increasing in a number of newer outlets, including drug chains and mass merchandisers, which are not monitored. **********But - surprise, surprise - hot tea accounts for only 20 percent of the use. So it can use all the help Lipton is about to give it. **********The tea field has been changing quite a bit in recent years, with the increased awareness of herb teas popularized by Celestial Seasonings, and special blends popularized by R. C. Bigelow. **********Their successes prompted Lipton to diversify its own product line. And since Celestial Seasonings was acquired by Kraft a couple of years ago, it has moved into black tea itself. **********The agency, which is one of the Interpublic Group of Companies, began as Sullivan, Stauffer, Colwell & Bayles. It has served Lipton tea for some 29 years. And Lipton is No. 1.

Volpin, burst into a dormitory at Moscow Maternity House 27. **********''Our beautiful young mothers!'' he announced, beaming at the five women hastily tucking bared breasts into their hospital gowns. ''How many does this make for you? Two? And you, my lovely? Also two? Good for you! Just like the statistics!'' **********The bemused mothers at this north Moscow maternity ward are part of a reversal with potentially important political and economic consequences: women from the Russian majority in the Soviet Union are having more babies. **********Despite cramped and often overcrowded apartments, dire shortages of such basics as baby clothes, the high divorce rate for Russians and the fact that most women work full-time jobs and bear the brunt of food lines and household chores, the statistics show that Russian women increasingly are having two or three children rather than one or two. **********Demographers here and in the West say the trend is a victory for a strong policy that offers mothers financial incentives to have children, extended leave, improved maternity care and a dose of pro-baby propaganda. **********''The policies have been remarkably successful,'' said Murray Feshbach of Georgetown University, a specialist in Soviet population and health. ''You have to ask how long it will last if they don't solve the housing problem and get better medical care, but they have the beginning of a major improvement.'' **********Western population experts long ago calculated that without a higher birth rate, the Soviet Union would have trouble finding enough workers for its factories and new conscripts for its army. **********Moreover, while the birth rate among Russians and other European ethnic groups has languished, the Asian minorities in Soviet Central Asia have been prolific. **********This has already led to dislocations in the economy that result when people are born in one place and factories are located in another. The high birth rates of ethnic minorities also causes concern about language and cultural gaps, especially in the military, and about the potential allure of Islamic fundamentalism. **********Beginning with a 1981 decree, the Government has gradually increased the inducements for larger families. **********Olga Marozova, interviewed while she waited for an ultrasound examination at the maternity clinic here, is expecting her second child in January. She will remain away from her job as an office worker until the baby is a year old, with a monthly stipend of 35 rubles, about a fifth of her normal wage. **********Mrs. Marozova was paid a bonus of 50 rubles, about $80, for her first child, and will get 100 rubles for the second. The average wage is about 200 rubles a month. **********The benefits are hardly lavish, but Mrs. Marozova said that together with the Soviet system of free medical care and the prospect of a new apartment in five years or so, it was enough to convince her and her husband that they could afford a bigger family. **********Since the first measures to encourage births were introduced in the early 1980's, the birth rate has turned upward and begun to increase at a slightly faster rate, according to official data. **********Last year 19.9 babies were born for every 1,000 people in the Soviet Union, up from 17 a decade ago. (The comparable United States figure is 15.5, but more American babies survive because of superior medical care.) The rate of population increase is rising in 11 of 15 Soviet republics, including Russia, according to the most recent official data. 'Replacement Rate' Lags **********The birth trends are not enough to satisfy demographers. Mikhail S. Bedny, a prominent Soviet specialist in medical demographics, said the national average of 1.94 births a couple still falls short of what demographers call the ''replacement rate'' needed to assure a stable population, about 2.5 births a family. In addition, the rising Russian birth rate is still far outstripped by the rates in Soviet Central Asia. **********Soviet experts concede that by the year 2000 Russians, now 51.5 percent of the population, will become a 49 percent minority in the nation commonly called Russia. **********But the upturn in the Russian birth rate has strengthened the conviction of Soviet policy makers that they are on the right course. A new round of inducements is to be introduced in the new year, including an additional six months of partly paid maternity leave and legislation creating part-time jobs for mothers. **********Mr. Bedny said other factors behind the increase include a slight decline in the use of abortion. Abortion is still the most common form of birth control here, with 10 operations not uncommon for a Russian woman. **********Soviet demographers say they continue to be alarmed at the high rate of infant mortality, despite a steady improvement. Statistics for 1986 show that 25.4 Soviet babies die for every 1,000 live births, compared with 10.4 in the United States. **********The neat brick building where Dr. Volpin presides over 20 births a day is a superior installation for the Soviet Union, featuring American incubators, Japanese ultrasound machines and other imported technology. A Devotion to Superstition **********But doctors readily concede that in a rural setting or less prestigious city the facilities would not be so impressive. The newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya reported last month that it is still common for clinics in many areas to lack blood pressure gauges for infants or feeding tubes for newborns who have trouble eating. The newspaper said some parts of the country have infant death rates comparable to those in Paraguay or Thailand. **********One thing Dr. Volpin's clinic has in common with the most remote villages is a devotion to tradition bordering on superstition. Because of a passionate fear of germs, for example, husbands are not allowed to visit their wives and newborn children for the first four or five days after birth. **********The idea of a husband's being present for a birth provoked embarrassed mirth among the new mothers. **********And newborns are still swaddled like papooses from head to toe in the belief that this makes babies secure, warm and well behaved. **********Dr. Volpin said he believes wrapping babies slows muscle development, but it is clinic policy to swaddle because mothers insist on it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/05/business/advertising-fallon-and-chiat-day-win-at-the-one-show.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1987-06-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 290, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fallon and Chiat/Day Win at the One Show", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Fallon and Chiat/Day Win at the One Show", "body_text": " **********Fallon McElligott of Minneapolis and Chiat/Day of Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York were the big winners at the One Show last night at the Palladium. **********Fallon McElligott, a subsidiary of Scali, McCabe, Sloves, won largely in print, and Chiat/Day's victories were almost exclusively in broadcast. **********During its short existence, the Minneapolis crew has grown accustomed to shaming the New York forces at this sort of gathering.

The experts said that while the Russians were doing research and testing on possible ABM systems, the military implications of some of the Soviet actions cited in the 1986 compliance report had been overstated. **********For example, they said, the United States had expressed concern about a Soviet practice drill in the reloading of ABM launchers near Moscow.

Schumacher, a vice president at Nomura Securities, said speculation about Fed intentions might have taken on an extra dimension because of Thursday's report of a rise in borrowings at the Fed's discount window. ''There's always some new gimmick the market wants to key in on, and the latest, along with trade, seems to be borrowed reserves,'' he said. **********The credit markets initially responded favorably to a smaller-than-expected trade deficit for December and a large downward revision in the November deficit.

But interpreting the trade figures on either score has been greatly complicated by the huge revisions in the data. ''The market's concern is whether the numbers we have now are realistic so that we can make a judgment about what the growth of the economy will be and whether the political rhetoric from Washington is going to change,'' Mr. Schumacher said. Likely Immediate Impact **********For the moment, the narrower trade deficit in both November and December should mean that the dollar will strengthen and that foreign investors will therefore be more inclined to buy bonds at the auction. Over the longer term, a narrower trade deficit could be a sign that the domestic economy is strengthening, and a stronger economy would tend to keep the Fed from lowering interest rates. **********''I think the best way to explain what happened in the long end of the market is that buyers simply went on strike after the trade figures came out because it was all too confusing,'' Mr. Schumacher said.  Albert A. Gross, senior vice president at Refco Inc., said that revisions in data were taken for granted among traders, but said revisions as large as those in the trade data were frustrating.

As the decline in the trade balance accelerated, so too did the debate about its causes. But most analyses miss an important distinction between the export performance of American companies - including all their worldwide operations - and that of the operations within the geographical boundaries of the United States. That distinction casts the debate in a different light. **********There is no denying that the nation's trade performance has deteriorated badly. We lost about a third of our share of world exports of manufactures between the 1950's and the 1980's. The merchandise trade balance first declined and then, after 1975, turned negative. The deficit grew larger and larger, reaching more than $120 billion in 1985 and surpassing that level in 1986. Then, even the current account balance, which includes services and investment income, after fluctuating between surplus and deficit through the 1970's, slid rapidly into huge and alarming deficits in the 1980's. Finally, in 1986, the Commerce Department announced that, by its calculations, America had become a debtor nation for the first time since World War I. Plenty of candidates have been nominated to take the blame for this decline in our international position: low productivity growth, excessive wage increases in some industries, the neglect of manufacturing in business schools, relatively high taxation of capital, large government deficits and the high exchange value of the dollar. Especially in recent years, more deep-seated causes have been suggested, including a decline in the work ethic among employees and a loss of competitive strength on the part of large companies. The weakness of the companies includes, supposedly, a decline in their technological prowess, partly because they have given up thinking about long-run advantages and now concentrate on the next quarter's profit reports. It also involves increased bureaucracy within the large companies and the loss of their ability to manage industrial operations, perhaps because their executives have been trained in finance rather than in production, or in how to make deals rather than how to make products. **********Some of these problems may be amenable to changes in government policy. But others, such as the decline of the work ethic and the deterioration of American companies, are presumably more deeply rooted and much less subject to manipulation through public policy. **********As a consequence, we have been treated to lectures and sermons describing what we must do to be saved - companies must pull themselves together, learn to manage as the Japanese do, to think about the long run instead of quarterly profit reports, to substitute cooperative relationships with labor and government for the current adversarial ones, and to relearn the arts of production. **********While much of this may be good advice, the diagnosis that it is based on ignores the important distinction we mentioned at the outset - the competitiveness in world markets of the United States as a country is something very different from the competitiveness of American companies. **********The competitiveness of a country depends on what happens within its boundaries to such things as prices, wages, taxes and exchange rates. The competitiveness of a company depends on what happens within the organization but not on what happens to any particular country or locality. A company that is competitive because it has a new or better product or a new or better production process can take advantage of that competitiveness by producing at home or, if events in the United States make such a course unprofitable, by producing in other countries. Thus, American companies could do well in world markets while the country was doing badly. AND this is exactly what has taken place. The share of United States multinational manufacturing firms, including all their worldwide operations, in world export markets held steady or even increased between the late 1950's and the early 1980's, even while the share of the United States as a country fell by 35 percent. The multinationals increased their share of manufactures exported from both developed and less-developed countries. And they increased their shares in exports in most of the countries in which they operated; that is, they increased their exports faster than did other companies in these countries. **********Thus, American multinationals in manufacturing - a class that includes almost all large manufacturng companies - showed no signs of losing their competitiveness. If their technological and management abilities had been deteriorating, they would have deteriorated outside the United States as well as within it. In fact, there is no sign in their export trade of any such deterioration. **********This superior performance in exporting by American multinationals relative to the United States as a country was not an aberration confined to one or two industries. In every major manufacturing sector (foods, chemicals, metal manufacturing, machinery, transport equipment and other manufacturing industries), the multinationals outdid the country. **********How did the multinationals hold on to their export shares when the country's share in manufactured exports was falling so far? They increased their exports from the United States by more than 600 percent in value and perhaps 150 percent in quantity between 1966 and 1983. This was a slightly faster pace than for United States manufactured exports in general but still lagged the growth of exports by other countries. But they increased their exports from overseas production locations by about twice as much. By 1983, almost half of the multinationals' total exports came from their production outside the United States, up from a third or so 25 years earlier. **********American multinationals may be guilty of many of the weaknesses, bad practices and shortsightedness attributed to them. It may be good that they are constantly lectured on their defects and urged to learn from other countries, pay attention to quality and plan for the long-term future. But their worldwide export performance does not show the poor results we might expect from the bad report cards we read. The multinationals have done well as exporters. **********If we wish to explain our national trade problems, we should look for reasons other than the decline of our companies' technology and management. We should be asking whether developments and policies specific to the United States have been making the country less attractive as a location for manufacturing. These might include our slow growth in output and productivity relative to other industrial countries over the last 30 to 40 years and, until recently, the period of extremely high exchange values of the dollar, the effects of which are still with us.

And the Pizza Hut. **********This vision may soon come true under the glasnost policy of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader. Short on Western expertise, the Soviet Government earlier this year took a major step to opening its economy by permitting joint ventures with Western businesses. Since then, American and European companies have flocked to do business in the Soviet Union. Ten or so ventures have been announced, with at least 60 in the wings. **********The first joint venture involving an American company was announced last week between Combustion Engineering, a Stamford, Conn., concern, and the Soviet state oil company to modernize Soviet oil and petrochemical facilities. Combustion will own 49 percent of the partnership, and the Russians the rest. **********Among other American companies considering joint ventures are Singer, Monsanto, Eli Lilly, Occidental Petroleum and Pepsico, owner of the Pizza Hut restaurant chain. Many of these companies have long done business in the Soviet Union, but never in a joint venture. **********Experts in America see this as a major breakthrough. ''It's a big change and there's a big revolution going on in the Soviet Union,'' said Dwayne O. Andreas, chairman of Archer-Daniels-Midland, who is also chairman of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council. ''The Soviets are trying to bring in market-oriented activites to make socialism work better, and the Western companies see the Soviet Union as a big market.'' Jack Brougher, director of Soviet affairs for the United States Commerce Department, added, ''This is a radical departure from previous Soviet practices.'' **********In the past, business between the United States and the Soviet Union has waxed and waned, depending on the political climate. The Russians were instrumental in the development of the Eurodollar market in the the 1950's, when, during the cold war, they pulled their dollar deposits out of New York and moved them to London. In the 1970's, American companies were hired to help build manufacturing plants but generally left once the job was done. Such consumer goods companies as Pepsico have sold their products in the Soviet Union for almost 15 years, but under franchises. **********Joint ventures, for the first time, allow American businesses to have an ownership stake in a Soviet business. This would give them a continuing presence there, greater control and a chance to make bigger profits. Analysts say the Soviet Union is one of the world's biggest markets where Western businesses can operate with little competition. **********''You can't stay out of a country the size of the Soviet Union and stay a major international marketer,'' said Donald M. Kendall, former chairman of Pepsico, which has a Pizza Hut joint venture under study and plans to add 21 bottling plants to the 19 it already franchises in the Soviet Union. **********For the Russians, the impetus for joint ventures is practical. They need the expertise that Western businesses can provide as well as hard currency, now that lower oil prices have cut one source of foreign exchange. The Russians hope that many of these ventures will teach them to build better manufacturing facilities, which, in turn, can build more marketable export products that can bring in needed foreign currency. **********The Combustion arrangement is a model of what others might look like. Combustion's partner, the Soviet Ministry of Oil Refining and Petrochemical Industries, is about double the size of the Exxon Corporation and Royal Dutch/Shell combined. **********The venture's board is composed of three Russians and two Americans. Its director general, or chief executive, is Russian. Two deputies report to the director general - the one in charge of operations is American and the one in charge of administration is Russian. Rank-and-file employees will be both Russians and Americans. Combustion is investing $16 million initially, with all expenses and profits to be split in line with ownership. **********''We understand that success is important to both of us,'' said Charles Hugel, Combustion's chief executive. ''We've had general discussions about profit levels and it is satisfactory to them and to us.'' Mr. Hugel added, however, that in a crunch, the Russians would probably prevail. **********But impediments still remain. With so few Western companies familiar with the Soviet Union, only those that have done business there before have, so far, expressed interest. And even then, such joint ventures are still moving into uncharted waters. American companies must also obtain an export license to make sure that certain types of information and equipment, particularly anything militarily sensitive, is not exported."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/27/world/afghan-guerrillas-ignore-truce-say-war-goes-on.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Weisman", "pub_date": "1987-01-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1320, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AFGHAN GUERRILLAS IGNORE TRUCE, SAY WAR GOES ON", "print_headline": "AFGHAN GUERRILLAS IGNORE TRUCE, SAY WAR GOES ON", "body_text": " **********Eleven days after the Afghan Government declared a cease-fire, guerrilla leaders say that fighting persists throughout Afghanistan and that there has been no trace of a return by refugees to their homeland. **********Spokesmen for the insurgents and American and Pakistani officials said there was also no sign of any willingness by guerrilla leaders to share power with the Communists, as proposed early this month by the Soviet-backed Kabul Government. **********Afghan officials have asserted in radio broadcasts that leaders of some guerrilla groups had recently agreed to work with the Government and some refugees had returned home. **********But all along the Afghan border, guerrilla leaders have been touring refugee camps, making speeches and handing out leaflets to persuade Afghans not to take seriously the Kabul cease-fire initiative of Jan. 15. **********''We've been working day and night to tell them this is a trick,'' said Qaribur Rehman Saeed, chief spokesman for Hisb-e-Islami, the largest guerrilla group.

A Threat Against Traitors **********The groups also declared that any Afghan leader who took Mr. Najib's offer would be treated as a traitor and as an agent of the Afghan secret police, a declaration that experts here said had special significance. The declaration was generally seen as a threat by the guerrillas to kill anyone who dared to defect. **********Political analysts here and in Washington point out that although sounding conciliatory, Mr. Najib also made clear his intention to preserve Communist control in Kabul. They noted that in a speech on Jan. 1 he also declared that even a government of ''national reconciliation'' would have to bring about the ''full realization'' of Communist goals and preserve Afghanistan as ''a regime loyal to the Soviet Union.'' **********A senior American official said Mr. Najib made it ''perfectly clear'' that the Communists were ''going to continue to run the place - and that's just not acceptable.'' **********Afghan leaders in Kabul asserted that some local commanders of insurgent groups had already surrendered and agreed to work with the Government. The Kabul radio said recently that 417 ''armed opposition groups'' representing 37,000 people were ''engaged in negotiations'' on sharing power. One Group Said to Defect **********But these claims were vehemently disputed here. Rebel spokesmen said they knew of only one insurgent commander who had defected recently, near the city of Herat. Kabul said he brought 1,500 men with him, but guerrilla leaders said today that there were at most 150. **********Officials in Kabul also said that thousands of refugees had returned from Pakistan in recent days. But Pakistani officials and refugee workers said they had seen no evidence of that. **********Of the major guerrilla organizations, four are Islamic fundamentalists and three are considered moderates, with ties to the old secular power centers in Afghanistan. Experts say that some people in the moderate groups might theoretically be more willing to deal with Kabul to return to power in their areas. **********But so far, the hard line against the Najib initiatives appears to command virtually total support among rival guerrilla groups, whose mutual animosity in the past has sometimes led to fighting between them inside Afghanistan. **********Meanwhile, insurgency leaders said that the fight against the Russians has continued throughout the country, with guerrillas attacking Soviet installations and convoys and Soviet soldiers responding with artillery, shelling and aerial bombardment. Fighting on Edge of Kabul **********''The cease-fire has never been in effect,'' said Syed Bahauddin Majrooh, director of the Afghan Information Center here. He said rebel attacks and Soviet retaliations had increased since Jan. 15 in Paktia Province and near the cities of Jalalabad, Kandahar and Herat, and in the southern outskirts of Kabul. **********Other spokesmen said the insurgents had shot down at least one jet plane and destroyed tanks, and that while the Russians had retaliated they had mounted no major offensives. **********Guerrilla spokesmen generally concede that the war has been difficult for the last two years, particularly in 1986, because of growing sophistication in counterinsurgency by Russian troops. In addition, Soviet aerial bombardment has depopulated key areas, making it harder for the guerrillas to operate. **********In some cases villagers in Afghanistan are said to have demanded that the guerrillas leave their areas to avoid being bombed. Such reports may have led to the Soviet belief that the time is right for a peace initiative. **********The insurgents are believed to have huge stockpiles of weapons and could last perhaps a year or more if their supplies were cut off as part of an agreement on a Soviet troop withdrawal, according to analysts here. **********The Russians are therefore seen as wanting to wait at least two more years before leaving, because this might give them enough time to wipe out the insurgency first."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/24/business/niagara-is-writing-off-755-million.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1987-07-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 373, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Niagara Is Writing Off $755 Million", "print_headline": "Niagara Is Writing Off $755 Million", "body_text": " **********The Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation said yesterday that it would take a $755 million after-tax write-off because of cost overruns at its Nine Mile Point 2 nuclear power plant in upstate New York. **********The power company, based in Syracuse, also said it was cutting its quarterly dividend to 30 cents a share, from 52 cents. **********As a result of the write-off, Niagara Mohawk said it had a net loss for the first half of the year of $569.4 million, compared with income of $238.26 million in the first half of 1986. **********Under a new accounting rule, Niagara Mohawk was forced to write off the cost either this year or next year and all at once.

But by midmorning the sun was ablaze, once again burning farmers' hopes of relief from India's driest rainy season in decades. **********''I am 75 years old, and I have never seen anything this bad,'' said Naufat Mohammed, a white-bearded farmer, looking at the cracked earth around a well. ''This is God's will, but God is angry with us.'' **********After weeks of false hopes that the summer monsoon rains would come, India faces the prospect of devastation to the national economy, the uprooting of hundreds of thousands of people and the need for a huge relief effort to distribute drinking water and prevent starvation. **********The drought, which Government officials say is unprecedented in intensity, has already spread through most of the country, hitting hardest in the northern grain belts. There wells, reservoirs and water tanks are running at dangerously low levels or are already dry. Rain 75% Below Normal **********Less than a third of the country has received normal rainfall this year, with the hardest-hit areas as low as 75 percent below normal. **********Although the monsoon floods cause many deaths, the rains are normally one of the great life-giving forces in India, central to its culture and the expectations of its people. The monsoon season is incubated as heat in the subcontinent increases while the Indian Ocean to the south remains cool, unleashing a stormy mix of air that then pushes up from the south. **********Almost nothing is anticipated as much as summer rains carried by winds heading northward starting in early June. The failure of the monsoon is a severe blow to Indian morale as well as to the survival of its people. **********There have been no signs yet of death or starvation, but experts say they fear that a large-scale loss of cattle could wipe out the livelihoods of countless families. Milk production has already fallen sharply as the Government struggles to rush fodder such as spoiled wheat or sugar cane to drought areas. Driest in 80 Years **********New Delhi, 50 miles northwest of here, is suffering its driest season in 80 years. Residents of New Delhi and other cities are suffering water shortages and widespread power cuts so electricity can be diverted to farm areas to run hard-pressed wells and irrigation systems. Other cities are experiencing the same thing. **********Agriculture experts say they fear that India's summer grain crop, once expected to be 90 million metric tons, could fall drastically short. This would force India to rush its 23 million tons of buffer grain, now in storage, throughout the countryside. **********Such relief efforts helped to check starvation in the drought of 1979-80, which was described as the worst in this century nationwide. The army was called out to help distribute drinking water by train and military trucks, something many experts think could happen on an even larger scale this year. **********On top of all these problems, the areas in eastern India that are not suffering from lack of rain are experiencing heavy rains and flooding. News reports say that more than 140 people have died in the northeastern states of Bihar, West Bengal and Assam. In neighboring Bangladesh, the death toll has been reported at 350. Emergency Committee Created **********Faced with a crisis that could dwarf all his other political difficulties, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi recently established an emergency committee, of which he is chairman, to oversee drought relief efforts. **********Officials say a food distribution and rural employment program costing about $1.5 billion is about to be announced. A water distribution plan was announced in Parliament today. These and other steps are certain to worsen the national budget deficit and curtail other development programs. **********Aides to Mr. Gandhi say they also fear that bureacratic problems could undercut Government efforts, creating unrest and disenchantment throughout the north. A senior member of the Gandhi Cabinet said he was afraid that on his next visit to his constituency villagers would throw stones at him. **********Officials say that even if the monsoon were to come now at full force it would not save crops in most areas. The biggest fear is that for some reason the rains may never come at all this year. Although most of India depends on the monsoon of July and August, rainfall lingering into the fall is essential if farmers are to recoup this year with their winter crop of wheat. 'Cannot Image the Horror' **********''If the rain fails even in September, we cannot imagine the horror,' said a former Agriculture Minister, Rao Birendra Singh. He said that from all indications so far, the 23 million metric tons of reserve grain should be enough to prevent starvation - ''provided we do not lose our next wheat crop.'' **********The actual reason for the failure of the monsoon is unclear, although meteorologists say it appears to be part of odd global weather patterns this year, including unusually hot weather in Europe and the United States. **********Two-thirds of India's annual grain crop is supposed to be grown during the summer monsoon. The problem is especially acute in the 70 percent of the country's farmlands that have no irrigation and depend entirely on rain. In these areas, fields that are normally iridescent-green with rice are bare, brown or stunted. **********But even the developed farmlands of the north in Punjab and here in Haryana, where irrigation is extensive, are suffering. The Financial Development Commissioner of Haryana said the state had reached ''near-famine conditions.'' Grain Fields Should be High **********A canal running along the main road here was bone dry today. Farmers complained that a 60-foot well was useless because the water it pumped was brackish and salty. **********''This water would destroy any crops,'' said Jivan Singh, whose family members were plowing a nearby field with two oxen in the hope that at some point rain would come and something, perhaps vegetables, could be planted. A few scrubby sprouts of millet grew at his ankles. He said the grain in this field was normally several feet high at this time. **********The drought has been most devastating in the sandy western regions of Gujarat and Rajasthan states, which have had unusually little rain in three or four years. In these areas, recent visitors say, whole village populations have begun moving in search of water for cattle and people."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/05/business/finance-new-issues-super-valu-stores-selling-9-3-8-notes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 85, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Super Valu Stores Selling 9 3/8% Notes", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Super Valu Stores Selling 9 3/8% Notes", "body_text": " **********Super Valu Stores is offering $100 million of 9 3/8 percent notes due in 1997 at a price of 100 through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. **********Rated A-2 by Moody's and A+ by S.& P., the notes yield about three-quarters of a percentage point more than 10-year Treasury securities with a similar maturity."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/09/business/finance-new-issues-kidder-unit-offers-mortgage-notes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-01-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 200, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kidder Unit Offers Mortgage Notes", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Kidder Unit Offers Mortgage Notes", "body_text": " **********Kidder Peabody Mortgage Assets Trust Three yesterday began offering $500 million of collateralized mortgage obligations divided into five parts, one of which bears a floating interest rate.

As the new overlord of Universal movies, Mr. Pollock is at the peak of the Hollywood hierarchy. But his appointment is more than just another executive move in an industry where people change jobs as often as movie stars change cars. **********For Mr. Pollock has never produced or directed a movie, or even worked at a studio. Instead, for the last decade, he has been one of a handful of superstar lawyers who negotiate deals for other superstars - actors, directors, and studio presidents. With his appointment last September as chairman of MCA's Universal Motion Picture Group, Mr. Pollock won the final responsibility for picking the movies Universal will make - and, in the process, became a powerful symbol of the new business forces that have transformed the entertainment industry. **********In an industry dominated in recent decades by ex-talent agents and ex-television executives - Mr. Pollock's predecessor, Frank Price, once ran Universal's television unit - the 43-year-old lawyer's presence in the chairman's office is one sign that this is the era of the Hollywood lawyer, a special breed distinguished more by their savvy in assembling movie deals than their legal skills. **********''There isn't one of the superstar lawyers who hasn't had at least one or two offers to head a studio recently,'' says Bert Fields, the lawyer who represents actors Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman. **********Hollywood's top dozen lawyers - those who are now chairmen and presidents of studios and those in private practice who negotiate with the studios on behalf of such clients as Sylvester Stallone or Francis Coppola - are mostly men in their 40's or 50's who have spent several years working in law firms with an expertise in entertainment law. Some are graduates of Ivy League law schools, while others went to school in California. **********Just this week, Fred Bernstein, a 1976 graduate of U.C.L.A. law school, was named president of worldwide production at Columbia Pictures. And besides Mr. Pollock (Columbia, '67), there is Frank Wells, (Stanford, '59) the president of the Walt Disney Company; Sidney Sheinberg (Columbia, '56), the president of MCA; Stephen Silbert, (Berkeley, '67) the president of MGM/UA; Gary Hendler (Harvard, '62) the former president of Tri-Star; J. Victor Kaufman, (N.Y.U., '67) the chairman of Tri-Star; Arthur Krim (Columbia, '32), the chairman of Orion; and a handful of others, including Mr. Fields (Harvard, '52), who represent top talent, and could move into high-level studio jobs at any time. **********Their effect on the industry is not likely to be revolutionary. But the superstar lawyers, with their roots in business, will certainly intensify Hollywood's current obsession with movies not as art, but as products. ''I **********N 1986 America, you cannot run a major studio without a financial/ legal/investment type high up in the hierarchy,'' said Frank Rothman (U.S.C., '51), the former chairman and chief executive officer of MGM/UA. ''It has gotten very expensive to make pictures, and you can't just go to the bank and borrow enough money when pictures cost $14 million apiece. There are new ways of financing - bonds and partnerships and public offerings. So you need lawyers to speak to investment bankers about raising complicated funds.'' **********Mr. Pollock defines the role more succinctly: ''They didn't hire me at MCA for my legal skills. They have fabulous lawyers. Entertainment law is a misnomer. Entertainment lawyers don't talk about law. They talk about business. Entertainment law is about representing people in the entertainment business.'' **********Because the costs of making and distributing movies have always made it necessary to win wide audiences, Hollywood has historically been an uneasy amalgam of art and commerce. But these days, it seems that the emphasis on commerce is greater than ever - and some say that emphasis is lowering the quality of the movies that get made. **********''There's an absolute lack of imagination among the people running studios today,'' said Billy Wilder, a writer/director (''Sunset Boulevard,'' ''Some Like It Hot,'') who won six Academy Awards between 1945 and 1960. ''There's no imagination to do something new, something bold, a movie that is not a sequel. A picture can be in preparation for a couple of years, and a new regime comes in and sweeps it out and starts all over with new projects.'' **********According to Mr. Rothman, studios have no choice but to be concerned with finances, given the cost and complexity of movie deals. A former partner in the Los Angeles law firm of Wyman Bautzer Rothman Kuchel & Silbert, Mr. Rothman was picked by Kirk Kerkorian, the financier who owned most of MGM, to reorganize the studio in 1982, when it was struggling under nearly $700 million worth of debt after its purchase of United Artists. **********After running MGM/UA for four years, Mr. Rothman went back to being a trial lawyer, but one of his ex-law partners - Stephen Silbert -who had also done work for Mr. Kerkorian was named president and chief operating officer of MGM/UA in October. In both cases, the Kerkorian connection led the way to the studio job. ''A lawyer in the entertainment field becomes known to Kirk Kerkorian and becomes a logical choice -not necessarily a better choice,'' said Mr. Rothman. **********Like Mr. Rothman and Mr. Silbert, most of the lawyers who have been enticed into studio jobs first caught the attention of people at the studio while handling business negotiations for clients who are actors, producers, movie executives, or studio owners. **********And even if they go to work for a studio, most lawyers stick to business decisions, rather than purely creative ones. But the two are tightly entangled these days - for, more than ever, the studios must think of a movie as a package of different rights, each of which brings in separate earnings. In some cases, the traditional business of showing movies in theaters is no longer the major source of revenue. **********Tri-Star's ''Flashpoint,'' released in 1984 and starring Kris Kristofferson, is one of an increasing number of movies that has earned more on video cassette than in the theater: $3 million worth of box office tickets, versus $3.3 million, wholesale, for cassette distribution. And Orion's ''Maxi,'' starring Glenn Close, earned less than $2.5 million at the box office, but took in $3.5 million, wholesale, for cassettes. Pay television, syndication and foreign theatrical rights also produce hefty chunks of revenue. And toys and television cartoon series have generated huge profits for movies as diverse as ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Rambo.'' **********''I don't believe you can separate the creative and business decisions,'' says Mr. Kaufman, the chairman of Tri-Star. ''If all your films were low-budget, you could make a purely creative decision. But any high- budget film has to be a consideration of the potential of the film at the box office versus the cost. You have to calculate what you can afford to lose on the films that fail.'' **********Mr. Kaufman said that although he has final approval in choosing movies for the studio, he rarely turns down movie proposals that his president of production is really committed to. Similarly, Mr. Rothman said he almost never made the real creative decisions at MGM, although he had the power to kill ideas he hated. **********Mr. Rothman - who cut MGM/ UA's debt, despite poor to mediocre box office reception for such films as ''The Pope of Greenwich Village'' and ''Oxford Blues'' - said lawyers should not take over the creative function. ''For us to say, 'Make this script or that script' is dangerous,'' he warned. ''There are lots of chips riding on people who are new at making such decisions.'' **********And what makes a lawyer successful in Hollywood is not the ability to choose movies. Rather, it is the ability to put together movie deals - a talent that depends at least as much on having the right contacts as on any specific financial or legal abilities. ''L **********AWYERS, like agents, are important when they have important clients,'' said Mr. Pollock, who got his start representing such talented young film school graduates as George Lucas, and went on to other important movie clients, including Dino De Laurentiis and Ivan Reitman. **********Client relationships were also important to Gary Hendler, who was made president of Tri-Star in February 1983, and quickly convinced his long-time client, Robert Redford, to make a movie for the new company. Tri-Star made its debut with ''The Natural,'' a box office success, but the company poured so much money into making and marketing the movie that it was not terribly profitable. Few of Mr. Hendler's other movies were conspicuously successful, and he resigned in January 1985. **********Superstar lawyers working outside the studios include Bruce Ramer (who represents Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood), Barry Hirsch (Goldie Hawn, Jane Fonda), the partnership of Ken Ziffren and Skip Brittenham (Harrison Ford, most major television producers), Mr. Fields, and Mr. Pollock's former partner, Jake Bloom (Sylvester Stallone). **********Their billing arrangements for star clients are generally different from the strict hourly fees that are standard law firm practice. At least one of the lawyers writes contracts for top movie executives for free. Although many Hollywood lawyers now act as all-purpose agent/advisers for their famous clients, some do not feel it fair to charge a percentage of the star's astronomical salary and, instead, settle for a flat fee. SOMETIMES it is the studio, and not the client, that pays the lawyer's fee. Although no one will speak publicly, studio executives and lawyers say privately that when studios really want a particular star, they will often pay both the legal fee and the agent's standard 10 percent. **********Many of the most important talents in Hollywood are now relying more on their lawyers than their agents, and a few - mostly directors, like Steven Spielberg - are eschewing agents altogether. Meanwhile, many of the lawyers are now performing such agent-like functions as reading scripts for their clients. **********''The deals today are so complicated that they can't be done only by an agent or a business manager,'' said Mr. Pollock, who has always read scripts. ''And the reason the deals got so complicated is that the costs got so high. Ten years ago people could afford to take a chance. Now, it's $30 million every time a studio says yes to a movie.'' **********Since it costs $17 million to make a movie and $8 million to market it, plus interest and overhead, Mr. Pollock said, ''studios look for ways to spread their risks, including partnerships. And independent production companies pre-sell pre-sell rights. When cable rights are pre-bought by HBO and video rights by Vestron and foreign rights by Goldcrest, it takes sophisticated deal making.'' **********Many studios are turning to lawyers for that deal-making expertise. But according to Sid Sheinberg, the president of MCA and the man who hired Mr. Pollock, business savvy is not the only hallmark of a movie executive. ''The one single characteristic necessary to success in this business is an affinity and sensitivity to the creative process,'' said Mr. Sheinberg, who started as a lawyer in MCA's television division. ''You can have that and still fail if you're a terrible businessman or irrational. But without it you'll definitely fail.'' **********Some of that affinity may be what gets lawyers to Hollywood in the first place, he said: ''People ask me, 'How did you, a lawyer and a Jewish boy from Corpus Christi, get to this job?' I think there may be something motivating us to go to law school that has an interest in theatricality. Perhaps we veered to law school as a socially acceptable way of dealing with it.''  A HISTORY OF HOLLYWOOD FROM THE MOGULS TO THE LAWYERS **********HOLLYWOOD - Hollywood, and its lawyers, have come a long way since the days of the old movie moguls, mostly uneducated Jewish immigrants who moved to California to exploit the possibilities of a new technology -much like today's young Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. **********Men like Samuel Goldwyn, a former glove salesman, Adolph Zukor, a fur merchant, and Louis B. Mayer, a scrap metal collector, got their start buying penny arcades and showing short silent films to other immigrants for 5 cents a peek. **********For them, lawyers were just tools of the trade, working out the details of their plans. ''The lawyer was always necessary because a picture is a conglomeration of music rights, story rights, all kinds of rights,'' says Samuel Z. Arkoff, a lawyer who in 1954 co-founded American International Pictures. (AIP made such classics as ''I Was a Teenage Werewolf''). ''It's different from a carpenter who makes a table and sells it.'' **********As the theaters got fancier, the moguls began making their own, longer movies to fill them, and in the process, wielded more and more power over the actors, directors and technicians who worked for them. The lawyers, like all the rest, were just tools of the autocratic studio heads who made all the important decisions, including which actors and directors to hire, and, once they had signed the standard seven-year contracts with the studio, which movies they should work on. **********The studios had so much power in the early sound era that the Justice Department brought an anti-trust suit against them to try to break up the industry. And in 1952, the studios were forced to sell off the theater chains in which they showed their movies. **********When the four major studios, Paramount, Warner Brothers, M-G-M, and 20th Century-Fox, lost their captive theaters, they could no longer risk making 40 movies a year - and no longer needed large numbers of actors, directors and producers under contract. And once the actors and directors became free agents, the studios had to make a series of deals to put together a movie. **********''Instead of paying by the week and ordering actors to make five movies a year, the studios hired them picture by picture,'' said Mr. Arkoff. **********By the 1960's, the studios had lost much of their power, and the agents came into their own. Instead of just representing individual talents, they began linking stars with a director and producer, and selling a studio the entire package. ''At one time, MCA had 75 percent of the major talent and William Morris had the rest,'' says Ned Tanen, the president of Paramount's motion picture division. **********By the 1970's, some of the agents had moved into high-level studio jobs, with David Begelman running Columbia, and Alan Ladd Jr. running Fox. But a decade ago the talent agencies began to splinter, as leading agents went out on their own. And the lawyers began to pick up the power. **********''As the Morris office started to decline in power, very bright attorneys smelled a hole,'' said Mr. Tanen, ''The agencies got very weak, and the attorneys rushed in to fill the void.'' **********Said Mr. Arkoff: ''Today almost every producer, every director, every big star has a structure, and more and more those organizations are being headed up by lawyers. Mr. Very Important Producer and Miss Very Important Star are ships, and the lawyers are their barnacles. Being a lawyer was not too popular in 1954. Now when people know you're a lawyer, there's an extra cachet.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/11/jobs/the-job-outlook-across-the-nation-southeast.html": {"writer_name": "Tom Walker", "pub_date": "1987-10-11", "snippet": "LEAD: WITH a trade-related upturn in manufacturing, the Southeast is gaining greater economic growth balance between its diversified front-runners, Florida and Georgia, and its industrial states like North Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama, which we...", "word_count": 625, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Job Market", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Job Outlook Across the Nation;\nSOUTHEAST", "print_headline": "The Job Outlook Across the Nation;\nSOUTHEAST", "body_text": " **********LEAD: WITH a trade-related upturn in manufacturing, the Southeast is gaining greater economic growth balance between its diversified front-runners, Florida and Georgia, and its industrial states like North Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama, which were hit hard by the trade deficit. **********WITH a trade-related upturn in manufacturing, the Southeast is gaining greater economic growth balance between its diversified front-runners, Florida and Georgia, and its industrial states like North Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama, which were hit hard by the trade deficit. **********In overall growth, according to James N. Young, chief economist for BellSouth Corporation, based in Atlanta, the region's economy in the first half of 1987 was ''relatively sluggish by recent historical standards,'' though the region ''still performed relatively well.'' **********Unemployment fell to 6.2 percent in mid-year, a percentage point below the rate the year before, according to the First Wachovia Corporation, a multi-state bank holding company that has compiled a regional index of business activity. **********Since last December, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, regional employment has grown faster than the nation's - 1.5 percent against 0.6 percent. The gap is even wider since June 1986: 3.5 percent compared with 2.4. **********Mr. Young blamed the absence of vigorous manufacturing growth for the Southeast's lackluster first-half performance. Nevertheless, thanks in part to the weaker foreign exchange value of the dollar, manufacturing employment grew 0.5 percent in the first half and 1 percent since June 1986, to 3.63 million jobs, in the region embracing Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, the Carolinas and Tennessee. **********Textile employment, after reversing a long decline by turning up in 1986, continued to improve in this year - by 8,400 new jobs, or 1.7 percent, in the first half, and 14,200 jobs, or almost 3 percent, since June 1986. **********But the biggest engines of economic growth in the region continued to be business, professional and other services. As a group, these advanced 5.8 percent since June 1986, to 3.58 million jobs, followed by retail trade, up 5.4 percent over the year, to 3.3 million jobs. **********Construction employment, which many economists had expected to slump sharply, actually expanded, though at a slower pace than in recent years - 0.7 percent since last December and 3.1 percent since June 1986 - as absorption of commercial space and home building remained strong in a region that still attracts new businesses and new people. **********The biggest weakness in the region continues to lie along the Gulf Coast, in energy states such as Louisiana, with 10.9 percent unemployment, and to a certain extent in Mississippi, with 9.2, and Alabama, with 7.7 percent. Even here, though, June 1987 jobless rates were significantly improved from levels a year earlier of 13.5 percent, 12.0 percent and 10.2 percent, respectively. **********Looking ahead, James A. Pihera, an economist with Citizens and Southern Corporation in Atlanta, projected employment growth in the Southeast of ''around 3.5 percent,'' compared with last year's 3.4 percent expansion. ''Construction, however,'' Mr. Pihera said, ''will be weaker in the Southeast than it was last year and will temper the lift provided by manufacturing. Economic progress in 1987 is likely to be a little more evenly spread than in years past. Florida, Georgia and Tennessee will have the region's highest job growth at somewhat above 4 percent, but that is not much greater than the expected regional average of 3.5 percent.'' **********The region's fundamental economic disparity remains between fast-growth rates with diversified economies, typically along the Atlantic Seaboard, and those with weaker economies in the Southeast's ''industrial heartland,'' such as Alabama and Tennessee. Regional economists say the effort to improve the industry mix in weaker states, moving away from goods production and toward services, will be a top economic development priority in the next decade."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/17/business/advertising-two-agencies-grow-abroad.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1987-11-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Two Agencies Grow Abroad", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Two Agencies Grow Abroad", "body_text": " **********News with a foreign flavor comes from Foote, Cone & Belding Communications and Grey Advertising. **********F.C.&B. is planning an agency acquisition in Denmark, where it already owns Lockey/FCB.

Curfew to Be Shortened **********Speaking his native Pushto, he said: ''Brothers, fathers, please support us. The destiny of the fatherland is in your hands.'' **********He also said that the curfew in Kabul, now from 10 P.M. to 4 A.M., would be shortened by two hours. **********As a full moon rose above the towering mountains and a dusty twilight enveloped the city, thousands of citizens dressed in a dizzying mixture of Western and Moslem garb filled the bazaars. Merchants weighed plump tangerines and mounds of nuts and dried fruits by the light of small kerosene lamps as dilapidated yellow and white taxis, honking loudly, prowled the streets looking for fares. Russians in the Mountains **********''The Russians left a few days ago and moved into the mountains,'' a television repairman said as he worked on a Soviet set. His shop was crowded with Japanese and Soviet models. **********One reason for the calm may have been the arrival of 40 Western reporters from Moscow who had been invited to Kabul as part of a Soviet and Afghan effort to generate favorable publicity for the cease-fire and a peace plan recently outlined by Mr. Najib. **********With encouragement from Moscow, Mr. Najib, who uses only one name, called for the formation of a coalition government, declared a general amnesty, supported religious freedom and, in general, advocated an end to the Afghan conflict. **********The rebels, who receive Western aid, have rejected the Najib proposals as insufficient and several of the groups have said they will not honor the ceasefire. Obstacles to a Settlement **********Moscow has said it will consider withdrawing some of the 120,000 troops it has in Afghanistan if tensions in the country subside and if the West ends its support for the insurgent forces, most of which are based in Pakistan. **********Western diplomats have said a number of major obstacles remain in the way of a political settlement, including the timetable for a Soviet withdrawal and longstanding animosities between Afghan tribes. **********The visit by Western reporters seemed to mark a change in both Soviet and Afghan attitudes toward the war and its effect on public opinion in the West and in Moslem countries, where the Soviet role has been criticized. **********''The main part of your program is devoted to getting you acquainted with the process of reconciliation,'' an Afghan official told the reporters. **********Copies of The Kabul New Times, an English-language paper, were packed with articles about Mr. Najib's proposals. Caviar for Breakfast **********Afghan officials said the visit, which is expected to last until Monday, would include a meeting with Mr. Najib, a talk with Afghan military commanders, a tour of several provincial areas and a chance to watch the Afghan Communist Party and affiliated groups in action at a congress. **********At the Kabul Intercontinental Hotel, the staff was bedecked in native Afghan clothing and signs in the lobby advertised tennis, swimming and saunas. Aeroflot, the Soviet airline, provided first-class service on the flight from Moscow, including caviar for breakfast. **********Several news organizations that had long been denied permission to visit Afghanistan, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, were given visas. **********Restrictions on the movement of the reporters appeared to be less severe than they were during prevous group visits by Western reporters based in Moscow, several returning journalists said. Soviet Has a Hand in Trips **********Western reporters were denied visas to enter Afghanistan from the early 1980's until early last year, Most reporting on the fighting came from correspondents who crossed the border surreptitiously from Pakistan and traveled with guerrillas. **********In 1986, Afghan officials authorized at least three foreign press trips from Moscow to Kabul, including one in October for 90 journalists. In addition, Moscow-based correspondents for The Los Angeles Times, The Baltimore Sun and some European news organizations were given visas to visit Afghanistan individually. **********Althought the tours are ostensibly at the invitation of the Afghan Government, all have been arranged in Moscow with the involvement of the Soviet Foreign Ministry. **********Western reporters invited to Kabul in October to observe the withdrawal of six Soviet regiments, or about 7,000 men, were not permitted to leave their hotel without an escort and were shown only carefully scripted events. **********Today, reporters were free to move about the city on their own, although Afghan escorts accompanied them in some cases. **********A helicopter greeted the arriving journalists over Kabul, lobbing red flares into the sky, apparently to confuse antiaircraft missiles that might be fired at the Soviet passenger jet as it descended steeply in a corkscrew approach pattern, also designed to defeat antiaircraft fire. There appeared to be none. **********Last year the Reagan Administration provided the rebels with Stinger missiles, which they have used to down a number of Soviet helicopters and planes, according to Afghan officials. **********The Kabul airport, which doubles as a major Soviet and Afghan air base, was swarming with cargo planes and Soviet attack helicopters, bristling with guns, that bore Afghan Army markings. Soldiers Along the Route **********But beyond the perimeter of the airport there was little sign of Soviet military activity. Afghan officials said Soviet and Afghan forces had returned to garrisons around the country in preparation for the cease-fire. **********Kabul residents said Soviet forces are usually more visible in Kabul, although they generally limit their presence, apparently in an attempt to reduce tensions with Afghan citizens. **********Afghan soldiers were posted along the route taken by the reporters' motorcade, and other Afghan militiamen stood guard outside government and diplomatic installations, including the United States Embassy and Radio Afghanistan. **********Children and adults, including women who hid their faces behind veils, stopped on the streets to stare at the the passing caravan of police cars and buses. **********In a juxtaposition of urban and country life that is not uncommon in the Middle East and Asia, farm animals wandered near the main roads.

Allen Wallis, Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs and the head of the Administration team that is preparing for the seven-nation economic summit conference in June in Venice. **********''I'd say clearly that's the most important economic problem today -more important than trade, debt and so on,'' he said. ''Agriculture has more potential for all sorts of devastating consequences.'' A Sector in 'Absolute Chaos' **********M. Alan Woods, a Deputy United States Trade Representative, said: ''It's a sector of the world economy that is in absolute chaos. It has to be brought under control, and it's not something that one country can do alone.'' **********Such views are common in Europe as well. In a speech here earlier this month, Britain's Agriculture Minister, Michael Jopling, said ''there is a growing consensus about the need for urgent action'' on farm issues. **********Farming worldwide is plagued by overproduction and depressed prices, problems that, most countries agree, are largely the consequence of domestic economic policies. While the battles among the big industrial powers have been dominated again this year by conflicts over growth, currency values, trade, finances and loans to developing countries, agriculture has drawn increasing attention as it has become evident that farm policies to some extent underlie all these issues. **********Traditionally, farm policy has been a matter that countries kept off the table at multilateral negotiations. Successful negotiation presumably would require concessions in the payments, subsidies and restrictions on imports that nations grant their farmers. Elected governments have been unwilling to trade away programs so dear to their politically powerful farm constituencies. **********But in farming, as in many other economic areas, attitudes have been changing. For one thing, spending on agriculture has grown so huge that it is crowding aside the demands of other powerful interests. In the United States, aid to farmers is expected to total $27 billion in a year in which the Federal budget deficit is projected at $180 billion. With Congress and the Administration now committed to cutting the deficit, mostly through reductions in spending, agricultural costs emerge as a highly visible target. **********The problem is similar elsewhere: The 12-nation European Economic Community spent $23 billion on farm-support programs last year; Japan spent $15 billion. **********Pressure for change also arises as the traditionally parochial business of farming becomes caught in the spreading web of economic interdependence among nations. One country's farm-support policies affect world prices and the economies of other countries as surely as do changes in the values of currencies. Initiative From Reagan **********President Reagan put the subject on the international negotiating table last year at the economic summit conference in Tokyo. The other participants agreed with the President that agricultural policies in one country often affect other countries and that talks on the issue are needed. **********That consensus helped put agriculture among the topics that the world's trade ministers listed for negotiation in the round of trade talks that will begin next year. President Reagan now wants to use the summit conference that he will attend in June to broaden the debate and push the trade talks along. The June meeting will also be attended by the leaders of Japan, West Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada ''The odds for success increase when we get heads of government sending these kinds of instructions,'' said Daniel G. Amstutz, an Undersecretary of Agriculture. **********The President's commitment to the issue of agriculture makes it central even to those governments that might prefer a different emphasis. West Germany, for example, would give higher priority to dealing with the budget deficit in the United States, which the Germans see as the principal cause of the imbalances in the world economy. **********''But whatever is important to the United States is important to us,'' said Dietrich Von Kyau, economics minister at the West German Embassy here. He said of farm policy, ''If we don't take it into account, we could find ourselves in a trade war.'' Supply and Demand **********The source of the problem is supply and demand. Worldwide farm production has been rising about 5 percent a year, according to Robert L. Thompson, dean of agriculture at Purdue University. In the 1980's, Europe, India and China have become exporters of farm products. **********The surplus of the 1980's now mocks the accepted wisdom of the 1970's - that the world was headed toward critical shortages in food. ''We've got the problem of overproduction in a saturated world market,'' said Derwent Renshaw, an economist at the Washington offices of the European Community. **********With supplies of food outpacing demand, prices have dropped dramatically. The richer countries help their farmers maintain incomes through direct governmental payments, subsidies and restraints on imports. That support has encouraged farmers to produce even more. **********By subsidizing their own production, the richer countries undermine the ability of poorer countries, where production costs are often lower, to sell their goods in the world market. This deprives them of revenues they need to develop their economies and make payments on their loans from developed countries. **********''The basic problem in world agriculture is that the rich nations provide too many incentives for production, thereby creating oversupply and depressed prices,'' Mr. Amstutz, the Agriculture undersecretary, said. Cooperative Effort Favored **********It is generally conceded that the least painful way for nations to reduce their spending for farmers would be to coordinate reductions in aid so that no one country gains at another's expense. But disagreements arise over the precise approach. **********Mr. Woods said some European countries favor a policy that would, in effect, create cartels to insure all countries a piece of world agricultural markets. Others, notably Canada and Australia, want agreement on rapid and concerted reductions by all countries of the subsidies they pay to promote exports. **********The Reagan Administration sees the first approach as a violation of its free-market economic philosophy, but it views the second method as a partial step toward its own goal -comprehensive, step-by-step removal of barriers to trade. **********To encourage others to adopt the American approach, the Administration promises to be flexible about the pace at which farm supports are phased out. ''But we want dates certain for each step of the phase-outs,'' Mr. Amstutz said. Other countries, he said, could thwart the process by resisting such deadlines."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/02/business/finance-briefs-423087.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 223, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** National Medical Enterprises Inc. is offering $81 million of Baa-1/BBB+ rated 9.40 percent extendible notes due 1990 at a price of 98.678 to yield 9.92 percent through underwiters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.

The younger Mr. Hess has challenged official versions of his father's death that pointed to suicide. **********In West Berlin, British authorities issued a statement today giving more details of Hess's death a week ago, adding that he had hanged himself with an electric cord. Previous statements by the four wartime Allies had said only that Hess was found with the chord around his neck at Spandau Prison, where he had been the only inmate since 1966. Family Orders Own Autopsy **********''All available evidence - including results of a full autopsy and investigations by the special investigation branch of the Royal Military Police -indicates that Hess used an electrical extension cord to hang himself and that the cause of death was asphyxiation,'' the British statement said. **********Wolf-Rudiger Hess and Rudolf Hess's lawyer, Alfred Seidl, have questioned the Allied version and ordered their own autopsy, which was performed last Friday. The results have not been announced yet. **********Hess's funeral was originally scheduled to be held this Wednesday in the Bavarian town of Wunsiedel, where Hess's parents, who had had a summer house there, are buried. The mayor, Karl Walter, had scheduled a news conference for today to announce details of the funeral. **********But once the venue was announced last week and Wolf-Rudiger Hess questioned the Allied version of the death, Nazi sympathizers from West Germany and other Western European countries - including thugs with close-cropped or shaved heads known as ''skinheads'' - began converging on Wunsiedel. So did the police. Tight Security on Roads **********By the weekend, several hundred police and border guards with dogs, riot gear, paddy wagons and helicopters had moved into Wunsiedel and had set up tight security on roads leading to the town, checking for weapons and known extremists. The measures underscored the determination of West German authorities to prevent any manifestation of neo-Nazism, a fringe movement whose antics invariably attract foreign attention and troubling publicity. **********Officials said about 200 neo-Nazis had arrived in the Wunsiedel area by Monday and more than 80 had been detained, most only briefly. **********The prospect of more publicity and confrontations was evidently too much for the Hess family. **********At an afternoon news conference, Mayor Walter announced that the family had already buried Hess.

Actually, Mr. Birinyi, a vice president and equity market analyst at Salomon Brothers, has been forecasting this figure for the Dow since last spring. **********When the index hits this magic number, he says, it will have grown 90.79 percent since the market rally began in July, 1984 - the same as during the record market rally in the mid-1950's. ''We think we can equal the greatest rally of the post-war period,'' said Mr. Birinyi. **********Will the Dow dip once this record is matched? That depends on how it gets there, he says. ''If it sprints there, it may need to stop and rest. On the other hand, if we have a slow steady gain, as we did through most of 1986, we may not use up a lot of our reserves - and then we could go higher.'' Deeper in Debt **********Consumers are already carrying a record amount of household debt. And they are expected to take on more debt this year, in what Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, calls ''the biggest borrowing binge in history.'' Mr. Steinberg estimates that household debt could grow 9 percent this year from the estimated record $2.61 trillion level reached at year-end 1986. **********The binge will continue, he says, because consumers are confident about the future. They expect the economy to grow, inflation to remain low, interest rates to fall and unemployment to hold steady. **********Though Merrill Lynch expects the 1987 economy to be sluggish, with low income growth, consumer optimism may prove unshakable, Mr. Steinberg says. Those with financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, have done so well that they may feel wealthy enough to go on spending, though at a slower rate. And after a weak first quarter, there will not be enough economic negatives to dissuade consumers from spending or borrowing. In fact, borrowing may become more attractive as rates continue to fall, a trend perhaps assisted by a cut in the discount rate by March. Plastic Falls to Pieces **********Discarded plastic makes up much of the litter that clutters the ground and clogs the streams of America. That's because plastic is non-biodegradable. But now, some new technologies and products offer some promising solutions to the problem. **********One Canadian company is manufacturing a shopping bag made from a plastic film that breaks into tiny pieces when it is exposed to ultraviolet light. A spokesman for the company, which is already selling the bags in Italy, points out that ''one characteristic of litter is that it is exposed to sunlight.'' **********Farmers here at home, meanwhile, may soon have an alternative to the plastic material they use to control weeds, warm soil and retain ground moisture. Chemists at the Agriculture Department's research center in Peoria, Ill., have produced a plastic-and-starch substance that performs the same tasks and can also be broken down by microorganisms. As it crumbles, it can be absorbed into the ground. **********And American consumers will get some new alternatives in packaging. A technology used to manufacture dissolving plastic laundry bags for hospitals is now being applied to some consumer goods: A major consumer-products company is test-marketing a detergent enclosed in a dissolving plastic packet. The packet is not biodegradable, but it is water-soluble. Forsaking Sake **********Sake, the alcoholic beverage made from rice, is losing popularity in Japan. Annual sake sales have dropped to 149 million cases from more than 196 million in 1975. ''I suspect the trend will continue,'' said Frank Walters, research director at M. Shanken Communications, which tracks spirits consumption. **********One reason for sake's decline is the rise of shochu, a distilled spirit similar to vodka and made from barley, corn or buckwheat. Shochu is cheaper, and, though proof percentages vary, generally less alcoholic than sake. ''Sales have exploded,'' said Mr. Walters. Annual sales rose to more than 70 million cases in 1985, up from 21.8 million cases 10 years earlier. **********The sake business, meanwhile, will not get much help from the American market. Sake consumption was off by 15 percent in the United States last year, after a couple of years of healthy increases.

The alternating coverage could go into effect this week. **********''On this one, it seems to me that it makes sense at some point that we have to be concerned about the overall health and stability of the various companies in the industry,'' said David W. Burke, executive vice president of ABC News. ''And we can serve the public just as well.'' **********By last night, both ABC and NBC had agreed to the plan, and CBS was reported to have agreed in principle. Howard Stringer, president of CBS News, was not available for comment. Coverage Has Been Popular **********The hearings have put the networks in an unusual position. Their gavel-to-gavel coverage of Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North's testimony has been popular with viewers - more popular, according to preliminary ratings, than their regularly scheduled soap operas and game shows. But the hearings have been carried without commercial interruptions, and that has cost each network between $600,000 (NBC) and $1 million (CBS) every day. **********Each of the networks planned full, uninterrupted coverage of Colonel North's testimony, but none had decided how to cover the witnesses who followed him. The popularity of the North appearance forced the issue. **********Lawrence K. Grossman, president of NBC News, recalled that the networks had collaborated on coverage of the Senate Watergate hearings in 1973, and he retrieved the agreements from that event and proposed that the networks come to a similar arrangement for the current hearings, according to network sources. **********But the collaboration is a delicate matter, not only because the three network news divisions are accustomed to fierce competition, rather than cooperation, but because they are subject to Federal antitrust constraints on such matters. The alternating coverage of Watergate had to be approved by the Department of Justice, and the current proposal has similarly been reviewed by the Justice Department, according to network executives. Cost-Control Measures **********The shift in the fortunes of the three networks has also changed the picture since the Watergate hearings. All three networks are under new ownership and face strict cost-control measures, underscoring the pressure to renew revenue-generating daytime programming. On the other hand, as the network news executives discussed the proposal to alternate coverage, some of them expressed concern that their new owners might see the plan as a means of saving costs on other continuing news stories, such as political conventions. **********But the Federal rules regarding competition between the broadcasters would probably prevent cooperation between the networks except in rare cases, according to network officials. **********If the plan goes into effect, each network would be obliged to carry the hearings either one or two days a week, with the option of providing coverage even on days when another network is the designated carrier. ''That way, one network each day has an obligation or commitment to broadcast, and the others have the opportunity to broadcast,'' Mr. Grossman said. ''The benefit is that the public would be assured of getting it at least from one source at all times, and then we could go in when we thought it was warranted.'' Networks Losing Money **********The benefit to the networks would be three or four days of revenue-earning programming, worth from $2 million to $4 million. CBS, which has the highest-rated regular daytime schedule of programs, has been losing an estimated $1 million each day on its Iran-contra coverage, ABC has been losing about $800,000 a day, and NBC has been losing an estimated $600,000. **********When the North testimony concludes, ''there may be witnesses that no network feels appropriate to have on, because they're technical witnesses,'' Mr. Grossman said. ''It seems crazy for everyone to be there.'' **********The committee hearings are expected to continue until Aug. 7, and among the witnesses expected to appear are George P. Shultz, the Secretary of State; Caspar W. Weinberger, the Secretary of Defense, and the Attorney General, Edwin Meese 3d."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/24/business/currency-markets-dollar-firm-7-nation-plan-is-doubted.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1987-12-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 742, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dollar Firm; 7-Nation Plan Is Doubted", "print_headline": "CURRENCY MARKETS; Dollar Firm; 7-Nation Plan Is Doubted", "body_text": " **********The dollar firmed slightly yesterday in very light trading, as dealers shrugged off the latest affirmation by the United States and its trading partners that they would seek to check a further decline in its value. **********Prices of precious metals fell, reversing Tuesday's rally.

Wasting no time, he removed the heart and implanted it into another teen-ager, who was dying from a congenital cardiac disease. The recipient lived with that heart for nearly three months. **********For his efforts, Dr. Wada was accused of murder. **********Another physician brought legal action, saying that Dr. Wada, of the Sapporo Medical College, had taken the heart while the donor was still alive. Although no formal criminal charges were filed, the case dragged on for six years before the Prosecutor's Office in Hokkaido dropped it completely. Transplants Are Shunned **********Two decades later that heart-transplant operation - the first and last ever performed in this country -continues to cast a long shadow over Japanese medicine and public attitudes about death. No Japanese physician has been willing since then to risk becoming another Juro Wada. **********Recently, however, interest in resuming heart-transplant surgery has revived, amid widening debate over when and how a doctor may declare a patient to be dead. **********Transplant advocates argue that it makes little sense for this medically sophisticated country to deny itself a procedure that is performed routinely in other industrial countries and that could prolong thousands of Japanese lives. **********But opponents, including physicians, warn that patients' rights might be abused by overzealous transplant specialists. This is a special concern in Japan, where the notion of the patient as medical consumer is poorly developed and where attending physicians often act imperiously. **********Further complicating the issue, experts say, are traditional Japanese feelings about the heart as the repository of the soul and thus deserving primacy over the mind. **********In the measured, often elusive way in which Japanese form a consensus on delicate issues, the pro-transplant side gained ground a few weeks ago when a medical group, the Japan Society for Transplantation, recommended that the procedure be approved in cases of brain death. Among conditions that the organization set were that the donor's family give permission and that someone other than the transplant surgeon determine that brain functions had ceased. **********The ethics committee of the Japan Medical Association is expected to announce its views soon, and supporters of heart transplants are looking for a strong favorable statement that may signal a go-ahead. **********According to Isamu Hashimoto, a Kyoto physician who heads the transplantation society, six or seven Japanese hospitals are ready to begin heart operations right away. Liver transplants, which Japanese physicians have also avoided out of post-Wada fear, would also start fairly soon, he said. Legal Definition of Death **********''The most important obstacle,'' Dr. Hashimoto said, ''is that doctors are divided. Some simply cannot accept the concept of brain death.'' **********Neither can many Japanese laymen, even though cessation of brain function is the legal definition of death in most American states and in many other countries. Death is not pronounced here until the heart stops, breathing ends and the patient's pupils become dilated. **********In a poll last year by the Prime Minister's Office, 46 percent of 10,000 people interviewed said they were against all organ transplants in brain-death cases. On this score, the resistance is so strong that another legal case similar to Dr. Wada's is under way. **********Physicians from a group called the Patients' Rights Conference brought murder charges two years ago against a surgical team from Tsukuba University, north of Tokyo, for taking the liver and pancreas from a brain-dead person and inserting them into another patient. **********In their legal action, which is pending, the rights-conference doctors accuse the Tsukuba team of first killing the donor and then causing fatal injury to the recipient, who survived for about a year. **********''I do not understand why some doctors are so eager to transplant any organ whatsoever,'' Dr. Katsunori Honda, a leader of the group, said. ''I would suggest to them that if they dare to transplant they should wait for the heart to stop beating.'' 'An Insult to the Dead' **********Many Japanese have a strong aversion to any mutilation of a body, regardless of the purpose. This a concept that is considered distinct from that of cremation, which is universally practiced here under Buddhist tradition. **********Shusaku Endo, a leading novelist, whose books include medical themes, said that ''taking out a part of the body is seen as an insult to the dead.'' **********''When my older brother died, the doctors wanted an autopsy,'' Mr. Endo said. ''But my sister-in-law refused, saying she didn't want him to feel any more pain. Logically, she knew he was dead. But her feelings were that those knives must be painful for him.'' **********One complication is the fact that, for all the fuss over the heart procedure, kidney transplants are performed routinely in Japan, about 500 times a year. These are mostly from living donors. Even so, according to Dr. Hashimoto, 105 kidneys were taken from brain-dead patients between 1980 and 1985, and for unexplained reasons there has been little public outcry other than in the Tsukuba case. The Final Arbiters **********It is clear on the issue of heart transplants that physicians themselves will be the final arbiters. A special parliamentary committee is studying the matter, but it is expected merely to ratify whatever the doctors decide. **********An important line was crossed 14 months ago when the Health and Welfare Ministry issued a report from a team of neurologists establishing criteria for brain death. They included deep coma, a flat brain wave, loss of spontaneous breathing functions and loss of brain stem reflexes. **********But the report also underlined how slowly change will come. **********The panel stopped well short of saying that brain death is death, and its leader, Dr. Kazuo Takeuchi of Kyorin University in Tokyo, says he could not imagine himself shutting off a patient's respirator. **********''All the doctors in our hospital, myself included, feel that we should wait for the heartbeat to stop,'' Dr. Takeuchi said at a recent symposium. ''There is no question about it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/20/business/stocks-plunge-508-points-drop-22.6-604-million-volume-nearly-doubles-record-more.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 453, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "604 MILLION VOLUME NEARLY DOUBLES RECORD; More About the Markets", "print_headline": "STOCKS PLUNGE 508 POINTS, A DROP OF 22.6%; 604 MILLION VOLUME NEARLY DOUBLES RECORD; More About the Markets", "body_text": " **********Bonn and the United States agreed that the dollar should be stabilized near current levels.

Information Withheld **********He told the legislators that he was not privy to the details of the National Security Council's activities in Iran and Nicaragua, that important information was withheld from him and that he and the President were often misled by Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter, then the national security adviser. **********The picture Mr. Regan painted of himself as often unaware of events swirling about him was in sharp contrast with the prevailing image of him as chief of staff - that he was a firm conductor of affairs in the White House who never missed a beat. **********Mr. Regan had been accused of not preparing President Reagan properly for a Nov. 19 news conference on the arms sales in which the President made serious misstatements. Today Mr. Regan blamed Admiral Poindexter, saying the reason for the errors was that the admiral had been ''oblique'' in presenting the facts, and ''this sort of confused the Presidential mind.''  [ Excerpts, page A8. ]  'Startled' by Testimony Mr. Regan also said he had been ''startled'' by Admiral Poindexter's testimony this month that he had personally authorized the use of proceeds from the Iran arms sales to help the contras in Nicaragua. Mr. Regan noted that the admiral had told him, the President and Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d last November that he had only general knowledge about the diversion. **********Asked what he had recommended to the President when no hostages were freed after arms shipments to Iran in February 1986, Mr. Regan said, ''I told him that we'd been snookered again, and how many times do we put up with this rug merchant type of stuff?'' **********What, he was asked, was the President's attitude? ''I think he shared my view that, you know, we'd been had,'' Mr. Regan said. In the final analysis, said Mr. Regan, who was chairman of Merrill Lynch & Company before joining the Government, the Reagan Administration was a victim of a ''bait and switch'' scheme by the Iranians. **********''Did you so advise the President?'' he was asked. ''Yeah,'' Mr. Regan replied. The ''driving force'' in the President's mind for continuing the arms sales, Mr. Regan insisted, was that the United States needed to gain influence in Iran and prevent the Soviet Union from getting a foothold. But he said the President would have stopped the operation at the outset had it not been for his concern about the hostages. 'Down This Garden Path' **********Mr. Regan conceded that he himself had blown hot and cold on the Iran policy, supporting it at times and opposing it at others. In ''20-20 hindsight,'' he said, this is why he thought the arms sales were permitted to continue: **********''A lot of this was plotting by arms dealers to involve the United States in massive arms transfers to Iran. They saw an opportunity here and wanted to keep it alive. I think at the same time, our own people had become so involved in trying to extricate the hostages, and not wanting to fail, that they didn't see they were being misled by these arms dealers. And as a result, they were led down this garden path.'' **********In contrast to Attorney General Meese, who testified this week that he could not remember many consequential developments, Mr. Regan described his ''vivid recollection'' of events last November after the Iran arms sales were disclosed. **********A questioner today noted, for example, that one of the main reasons President Reagan had instructed Mr. Meese last November to begin a fact-finding inquiry into the arms deals was to resolve the discrepancy in Administration officials' accounts of the nature of a 1985 shipment from Israel to Iran. **********Mr. Regan said he and the President knew the shipment contained Hawk antiaircraft missiles and not oil-drilling equipment, as some officials were saying. He said he had been told the true nature of the shipment at the time and had also been told that if it became public, the shipment would be described as oil-drilling equipment as a ''cover story.'' **********But Mr. Regan said Mr. Meese never asked what he or the President knew about the matter. Asked why they did not volunteer what they knew, Mr. Regan said with a half smile, ''We didn't know which facts were true facts.'' Reagan's Reaction Described **********Mr. Regan also recalled that when he and the President learned on Nov. 24 that arms profits had been diverted to the contras, President Reagan ''looked like a guy who was punched in the stomach.'' **********Later that day, he said, William J. Casey, then Director of Central Intelligence, called and asked for an urgent meeting. When Mr. Regan stopped by Mr. Casey's office on his way home that evening, he said, he told the director about the diversion. **********He said he could not tell whether Mr. Casey, a renowned poker face, was surprised or already knew about it. ''You didn't get much facial reaction from Bill Casey,'' he said. ''You wouldn't know exactly how he was taking this news.'' **********Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North testified that Mr. Casey not only knew about the diversion of funds but had encouraged it. No supporting evidence has been found. Mr. Casey became ill in December and died in May without having been questioned about the matter. A Conversation With Poindexter **********Mr. Regan also gave a vivid account of going into Admiral Poindexter's office on Nov. 25 and telling the admiral, who was having breakfast on a tray, to submit his resignation. **********''I said, 'What's going on, John? What the heck happened here?' '' he recalled. **********The national security adviser, who was then a vice admiral, ''was very careful and deliberate,'' he continued. ''John is a deliberate man. He adjusted his glasses, he dabbed at his mouth with his napkin, put it down. 'Well,' he said, 'I guess I should have looked into it more but I didn't. I knew that Ollie was up to something. But I didn't know what. I just didn't look into it.' **********''I said, 'Why not? What the hell. You're a vice admiral. What's going on?' '' **********The admiral, he said, responded rather lamely that he did not want to know what Colonel North was doing because he was upset by the way Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., then Speaker of the House, was ''jerking the contras around.'' **********Shortly afterward, according to the testimony, Admiral Poindexter went to the Oval Office and, in the presence of Mr. Regan, Vice President Bush and Mr. Meese, submitted his resignation to the President. **********Mr. Regan said the admiral told the President only that ''he was sorry for what had happened and that he probably should have looked into it more, but didn't.'' **********No one asked any questions, Mr. Regan said, and after an ''awkward silence'' the admiral left the room. **********Pressed today by Senator George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, about why the Poindexter account had gone unchallenged, Mr. Regan said he ''never dreamed'' that the admiral might have been ''devious or anything except 100 percent truthful'' last fall. **********Mr. Regan is to continue his testimony Friday. Confusing Aspect of Testimony **********One confusing aspect of Mr. Regan's testimony today and that of Mr. Meese earlier in the week concerns the way Colonel North and Admiral Poindexter left the White House staff. **********President Reagan announced on television on Nov. 25 that Colonel North had been ''relieved of his duties on the National Security Council staff.'' But Admiral Poindexter was said to have ''asked to be relieved of his assignment.'' **********For months, news accounts invariably interpreted the President's words about Colonel North as a euphemism for ''discharged'' or ''dismissed'' or ''fired,'' and his words about Admiral Poindexter as having meant the admiral resigned. The White House has never corrected that impression. **********But both Mr. Regan and Mr. Meese said there was no intention to treat the two men differently. Both had been allowed to return to uniformed military service, Colonel North in the Marines and Admiral Poindexter in the Navy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/07/world/drug-ambush-in-peru-jungle.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-03-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Drug Ambush in Peru Jungle", "print_headline": "Drug Ambush in Peru Jungle", "body_text": " **********A policeman was killed and 20 people, including a general, were wounded in an attack by drug traffickers Thursday at an airport in the Peruvian jungle, police sources said today.

''We are hopeful that a settlement will be reached, but we cannot predict when,'' Earl Slack, a Carbide spokesman, said. He added that negotiations were ''continuing'' last night, but ''we do not yet have a settlement agreement.'' Government Rejected Offer **********Analysts said Carbide would be able to pay $500 million in damages without jeopordizing the future of the company, particularly if the payments, as rumored, were to be spread over 10 years. Last year, Carbide offered to pay $350 million in damages to Bhopal victims, but that offer was rejected by the Indian Government. **********Activist groups in India, meanwhile, have called for far higher damages, contending that Carbide is taking advantage of the victims of the Bhopal accident, most of whom are poor, have little schooling and, they say, are not aware of the level of cash settlements reached in some American lawsuits. **********One group in India, the Bhopal Group for Information and Action, has suggested that the Indian Government should ask for more than $15 billion in damages from Carbide. 'Fair for All Sides' **********''A $500 million settlement, if that's what they have agreed to, would be fair for all sides concerned,'' said Leslie Ravitz, a vice president of Salomon Inc. He added that, by settling the Bhopal case out of court, Carbide 'would lift an enormous veil of uncertainty'' over its future. **********Mr. Slack, at Carbide, said the hearing today ''is not a settlement deadline,'' and that lawyers for either side could ask for more time to negotiate. **********According to the sources quoted by The Associated Press, Carbide and the Indian Government have reached agreement on a ''working document,'' which specifies that $346.2 million be paid to the Bhopal victims in monthly cash installments over 10 years. The largest amounts, $2,000 a year, or a total of $20,000, reportedly would go to the heirs of those killed. **********In addition, the report said, Carbide might pay more than $153 milliion, bringing the total settlement to more than $500 million.

With its added 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. schedule, the Board is the first financial market to cater explicitly to foreign clients by being open during hours convenient to them, says Richard L. Sandor, senior vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert in Chicago. **********But it won't be the last, he predicts. Eventually, financial markets everywhere will go to 24-hour trading, Mr. Sandor says. The Board's trades are limited to Treasury bond and note futures and options on those contracts, ''but one can see this concept expanding into other financial instruments, as well as commodities like soy beans and precious metals,'' he said. **********For now, said Mr. Sandor, the Chicago Board's longer hours ''may reduce the volatility in the markets'' currently fueled by investor jitters about the dollar, inflation and interest rates. The new night-time hours, he says, give American investors additional time to react to events in Europe and Asia. More Pensions Stay Put **********Corporations eager to retrieve excess funds from their pension plans must first terminate those plans under current law. For years, an increasing number of companies have been doing just that - substituting other plans or purchasing annuities to meet their obligations to retirees. Distressed companies, meanwhile, have been able to terminate underfunded plans and pass on their obligations to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which protects retirees benefit losses. But now, says Frank **********B. McArdle, of the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington, there may be fewer of these ''disruptive'' terminations. Last year, he says, the trend slowed, in part because of a new excise tax on the surpluses plucked from the plans. And if Congress passes a pension package proposed by the White House, terminations might decline even more. ''The thrust of the Administration's proposals has been to reduce the number of terminations,'' said Mr. McArdle. **********The proposed legislation does this in two ways: It permits companies to withdraw excess pension funds without terminating their plans. And it requires an underfunded plan scheduled for termination by a distressed company to be supplemented first by any overfunded plans the company sponsors. Homes: Going Once . . . The recent rise in mortgage rates may mean a wave of residential housing auctions this summer -especially in the Middle West - says Joel D. Zegart, president of JBS & Associates, Chicago auctioneers. **********The auctioneer's gavel is seldom heard during the peak spring and summer home-buying season, he says. But the jump in fixed-rate mortgages for new homes could change that pattern. The average rate was 10.37 last week, up from 9.07 a month ago, a time when new-home sales were already slumping. Sales were off 3.6 percent nationwide, 23.7 percent in the Middle West. **********''More sellers will want to dispose of property before interest rates go higher and buyers drop out of the market,'' said Mr. Zegart, who believes that auctions create an ''urgency'' that disposes of homes and condos more quickly than conventional selling methods. But auctions also involve a cost to the seller: New homes sold at auction usually wind up being discounted by at least 25 percent, Mr. Zegart says. Doing Business Abroad **********Just when the dollar may have weakened enough to make American goods attractive in foreign markets, businessmen working abroad might find there is less Government help available overseas. **********Because of State and Commerce Department budget reductions, ''there have been substantial cuts in foreign commercial service,'' said William Archey of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has 56 affiliate groups overseas. ''And there has been considerable grousing from our members.'' **********So far, says Mr. Archey, the closing of consulates in Bremen, Nice and Trieste should not affect American business, since many of these consulates do not have commercial offices. But planned closings elsewhere - in Goteborg, a big Swedish business center; in Turin, where Italy's Fiat is headquartered; and in Dusseldorf, West Germany's banking and industrial center - might."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/26/world/pakistan-appeals-to-india-on-crisis.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Weisman", "pub_date": "1987-01-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 365, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PAKISTAN APPEALS TO INDIA ON CRISIS", "print_headline": "PAKISTAN APPEALS TO INDIA ON CRISIS", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo called on India today to enter into immediate negotiations to defuse tensions rising from the massing of troops in each country on their mutual border.

Hector Rios Erenu, the army Chief of Staff, said the majority of the army ''is complying with orders.'' Crisis Began Wednesday **********The crisis began when the fugitive officer, Maj. Ernesto Guillermo Barreiro, refused to appear in a civilian court Wednesday for questioning about abuses committed in an army-run detention center in Cordoba during the mid-1970's. The army leadership responded by dismissing him, and he then holed up in the officers' club of the 14th Airborne Regiment, where he was joined by other officers. **********This morning, a group said to comprise about 50 captains led by Lieut. Col. Aldo Rico occupied the infantry school at the Campo de Mayo. They joined in the demand of the Cordoba officers for an amnesty to cover killings and other abuses committed by the military in putting down the leftist insurgency of the 1970's. **********The officers holding the infantry school were visited during the day by a judge who was reported to have told them he was gathering information for the filing of sedition charges. Colonel Rico told reporters after the judge left, however, that the men with him intended to hold out.

Earlier in the day, the army announced that he was being removed from command, along with Colonel Rico, because he was assisting Major Barreiro. But later, a military prosecutor took a sworn statement from Colonel Polo saying he had never acted ''as either director or promotor of the rebellion,'' and he was reported to be still in his post. **********While the major's flight and the army leadership's action may have deflated the immediate crisis it did not end the ongoing army unhappiness over having to turn over active-duty officers for possible prosecution by civilian courts in human rights cases. **********The issue has caused a series of crises between the Government and the military, and also within the military, since President Alfonsin took office at the end of 1983. Several analysts called this week's crisis the most serious since then. **********Mr. Alfonsin has supported the principle of human rights trials, and so far 10 officers have been convicted, most of them former military commanders and presidents. But late last year, at Mr. Alfonsin's request, Congress set a deadline for the filing of additional charges.

What Citicorp has done, they said, will probably force an entirely new approach to the debt crisis. Future Loan Conditions **********''If there is additional lending, it will be on much tougher terms,'' said Stuart Greenbaum, a banking professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School. In Latin America, government officials and debt specialists expect future debt talks to be much rockier.  [ Page D6. ]  The biggest casualty of Citicorp's move, according to analysts, will be new lending, which lies at the heart of the plan by Treasury Secretary James A, Baker 3d to deal with the third world's debt burden. The reason: If Citicorp, in as good a position as anyone to assess the climate for lending, says it does not expect $3 billion of its foreign loans to be repaid, other banks will be loath to place their own capital at risk. Reshaping of Portfolio **********Making matters worse, Citicorp has also said it will seek to reduce its loan exposure in the developing world during the next two years by selling some of its loans and engaging in so-called debt-for-equity swaps. **********''You can't be building reserves on your old loans while at the same time making new loans,'' said George M. Salem, the senior banking analyst at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation. ''The ability of the banks to extend new credit has been dealt a blow.'' **********The tenor of future debt-rescheduling talks could turn decidedly nastier. A few analysts asserted yesterday that Citicorp's bargaining position had been weakened as a result of its action. According to their line of thinking, now that Citicorp has taken a ''hit'' against earnings to account for its problem foreign loans - and if, as expected, other big banks follow suit - the debtor countries will respond by seeking debt forgiveness, arguing that the loans could be forgotten without any further impact on the banks' profits. **********The prevalent view among debt experts, however, is the opposite. Having taken its lumps, most of these people argued, Citicorp is in a better position than ever to be patient in future debt talks. Other banks that build loss reserves for their foreign loans will be similarly able to take a hard-line approach. And if, as many experts suggest, the debtor countries view Citicorp's move as a direct assault on their creditworthiness, the result could be heated negotiations. ''It is a new era for the debt,'' said Christine Bindert, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund who is now senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ''This is the first time that a bank has recognized that the debt is not a liquidity problem but a basic structural problem. We are finally addressing the real issue after five years of muddling through.'' 2 Citicorp Messages Noted Political ramifications are also expected. At Colgate University, Robert Rothstein, director of the Program in International Relations, said Citicorp was trying to send two messages. **********One, aimed at the developing countries, is that the bank is no longer willing to abide by the status quo of forever restructuring debts so as to allow other, weaker banks to continue reporting profits. The other message, aimed at the governments of the commercial banks' nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other international lending agencies, is that Citicorp expects increased public participation in return for the sacrifice it is making. **********As a result of its decision to add $3 billion to its loan-loss reserve, Citicorp will suffer a $2.5 billion loss in the second quarter, the second-largest deficit ever for a United States corporation. Mr. Reed, Citicorp's chairman, said the move would cost its shareholders ''a year's worth of earnings.'' **********''They have said they have gone as far as they can,'' Professor Rothstein said, ''and that somebody else has got to do something or there will be a substantial crisis. It is a major step toward an outright demand for political intervention.'' Role for Commercial Banks **********But even if additional public money is applied to the debt crisis, participation by the commercial banks will still be necessary. That, in turn, will require more of the cooperation that has allowed American banks at least to work together in so-called loan advisory committees so as to continually restructure maturing third world loans. **********But lately that atmosphere has been eroding as more and more banks, particularly regional banks in the United States, have concluded that the debt crisis is showing no signs of improvement. For some time, moreover, debt experts have spoken of a rift between United States banks and the major lenders of Europe and Japan, which long ago established large reserves for their foreign loans. **********With Citicorp's action, the collegiality among the largest United States banks could very well fall apart. For one thing, Citicorp acted on its own, without consulting any of the other big banks on the advisory committees. But more important, by building its reserve, Citicorp has placed immediate pressure on other institutions to bolster their own reserves. Yet weaker institutions such as Manufacturers Hanover, the Bank of America and some banks in Texas are not in a position to take such a move. Friction With Bank's Rivals **********The resulting resentment toward Citicorp, along with an unwillingness to work side-by-side with the giant bank in future debt negotiations, could run deep. **********At a minimum, debt experts say, negotiations will be hobbled by the friction that will undoubtedly exist henceforth between Citicorp and its rivals. **********''To an important extent, Citicorp has done what is good for it,'' said Stephen Berman, the banking analyst at the Wall Street firm of County Securities Inc. ''It will erode the collegiality somewhat.'' **********Rudiger Dornbusch, the Ford International Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, added, ''The more you have episodes like this, the harder it is to keep the cartel of banks together.''

Mottus, an industry consultant, said of the price, which, he noted, was 1.75 times last year's sales. When Yves St. Laurent bought Charles of the Ritz in November 1986, it paid less than 1.5 times sales. **********Arden earned about an $80 million operating profit in 1986. Ritz, Mr. Mottus said, ''was more profitable.'' **********Competitors who had bid for Arden, as well as industry analysts, generally agreed with Mr. Mottus's assessment. They also questioned the soundness of Faberge's strategy. **********''Frankly, we think the pricing is too high,'' said Fumio Hoshino, the executive liaison representative of Shiseido, a Japanese cosmetics giant that been interested in Arden. **********Faberge's chairman, Daniel J. Manella, acknowledged that he was paying dearly for Arden, but he said Arden was the last exclusive beauty business expected to come on the market for a while. **********Eli Lilly closed at $94, up only 37.5 cents, on a day when drug stocks climbed 2 percent on average. Hemant Shah, an analyst with Nomura Securities, blamed the relatively poor showing in the market on a lingering concern over Lilly's Keflex oral antibiotic, whose patent expired in April. It has since lost 40 percent of its market share. 5 Finalists in Bidding About 30 companies had shown interest in Arden. The other finalists were Avon, Warburg Pincus, Moet-Hennessy and Minnetonka. **********Mr. Manella and Arden executives said emphatically that they had no intention of using either company to market the other's products. **********''The two businesses will be run independent of each other,'' Mr. Manella said. ''We have no intentions of trying to upscale our products and for sure, we wouldn't downscale some of theirs.'' Freed From Lilly's Burdens **********Joseph Ronchetti, Arden's president, said he felt Arden would improve its bottom line, perhaps by 10 percent, simply by freeing itself from the corporate burdens that Lilly had imposed. **********''We call it 'de-Lilli-azation,' '' Mr. Ronchetti said. He said Lilly had required Arden to pay a share of the corporate personnel costs even though it has its own personnel director and required Arden to use a corporate distribution center in Dallas when it could ship its products directly from its Roanoke, Va., plant to its customers at less cost. **********''Now all those charges will be removed from our profit-and-loss statement, which will allow us to reinvest in the brands and not in the structure of the company,'' Mr. Ronchetti said. **********That is precisely what outsiders think is badly needed. **********Arden last year spent less than $40 million, or 10 percent of its sales, on advertising and promotion. Faberge spent $78.5 million, or 26 percent of its $307 million in cosmetics and fragrance sales. A Similar Challenge **********In some ways, Arden is a challenge very similar to the one that awaited Mr. Manella when he took over Faberge in 1984. In that year, the McGregor Corporation, a publicly held apparel company, bought Faberge, and then went private. It later changed its name back to Faberge to stress its commitment to the beauty business and is now completely owned by the investor Meshulam Riklis and his family. **********Almost immediately, Mr. Riklis's management cut costs. Their efforts have more than doubled profits while sales have increased 33 percent. **********Mr. Manella eliminated a dozen product lines, including the Farrah Fawcett shampoo, and invested heavily in automation. Packaging and materials can run as high as 70 percent of the manufacturing costs, so where the company had previously relied on outside suppliers for bottles, caps and labels, it began making almost all of them in highly automated factories. **********He also dropped some lavish promotional expenses, including a drag-racing funny car, a ocean-racing boat and an airplane. **********Mr. Manella also eliminated some of the corporate perquisites that had proliferated, such as a shower-for-two and a music room at headquarters, where the former chairman, George Barrie, went to relax every day at 5 P.M. **********''It's unrecognizable compared to what it was a few years ago,'' said Lawrence H.

He said that developments in foreign exchange, credit and commodity markets could be useful indicators of inflationary expectations. **********In accord with the diminished status of the M-1 money supply measure, there was little reaction to the Fed's late afternoon announcement that M-1 rose by $1.9 billion in the week ended Feb. 23, and remains below the average level for January. M-1 and M-2 Growth Estimate **********Using partial data reported for February, Donald Fine, vice president and chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, estimated that growth of M-1 and M-2 would be slightly negative in February, with M-2 growth since the fourth quarter of 1986 barely above the bottom of the Fed's 5 1/2 to 8 1/2 percent target. **********''This doesn't mean the Fed is going to ease,'' he noted, ''but when combined with weak economic data it's a development that could eventually give them more latitude to move in that direction.'' **********Analysts noted that Fed officials indicated at times last year that rapid money supply growth was an impediment to moves toward an easier monetary policy and lower short-term interest rates.

Buick, Oldsmobile and Pontiac said today that they would offer interest rates as low as 3.9 percent on two-year loans as an alternative to the discounts on options previously offered. The new incentives will be in effect until April 30. **********The new incentives raise questions about G.M.'s ability to meet sales targets without costly financing offers that top officials have said they want to avoid. A 7.3 Million Selling Rate **********For the 10 days, the increase in industry sales, to 198,818 cars, put the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 7.3 million, slightly ahead of the rate a year earlier of 7.2 million. **********For all of February, domestic car sales were down 9.1 percent, to 556,953, while sales of light trucks, which often substitute for cars, were up 7.5 percent, to 284,835. Sales of imported cars increased four-tenths of 1 percent, to 219,988, while imported truck sales were down eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 66,615. Over all, sales of light vehicles during the month totaled 1,128,391, a dip of 2.9 percent. **********The seasonally adjusted rate for the month was 7.3 million for domestic cars and 2.6 million for imports, for a 9.9 million combined rate. Last February, the domestic rate was 8.1 million and the import rate 2.7 million, for a 10.8 million combined rate. Ford, Chrysler and Honda Gain **********Analysts were generally encouraged by the increase in sales at the end of February, which included strong gains for the Ford Motor Company, the Chrysler Corporation and Honda of America. **********''The sales improvement is a combination of the incentives already offered and tax reform losing its effect,'' said Edward J. Sullivan, an analyst with Chase Econometrics. He said he anticipated domestic sales would climb slightly in the next few selling periods, to about a 7.5 million annual rate. **********While G.M.'s sales were declining in the final 10 days of February, Ford was up 29.3 percent, to 51,411, and Chrysler gained 11 percent, to 30,634. Honda was up 96.1 percent, to 14,104 and the Nissan Motor company gained 35.8 percent, to 3,501. The Toyota Motor Company, which had no domestic production in February 1986, sold 1,082 domestic cars in the 1987 period. A.M.C. and VW Off **********Meanwhile, the American Motors Corporation was down 65 percent, to 926 sales, while Volkswagen of America was off 42.5 percent, to 1,572. **********G.M. did record a gain of 11.4 percent in light-truck sales in the period, to 40,849, while Ford was up 47.7 percent, to 37,559, and Chrysler was up 47 percent, at 16,583. A.M.C.'s Jeep sales were off 4 percent, at 6,132, while Nissan was up 31.4 percent, to 2,701. **********The imports continued to gain in the car market, with their share rising to 28.3 percent, from 26 percent last February. But they lost share in the hotly contested light-truck market, where both import and domestic companies have been offering incentives. The import share fell to 18.9 percent from 20.2 percent. **********G.M. sales problems and the output from new Japanese-owned plants in this country were reflected in changing shares of the total car market for the month. G.M.'s share declined to 36.9 percent from 43.6 percent, while Ford was gaining to 20.3 percent from 17.8 percent, and Chrysler advanced to 11.4 percent from 11 percent. **********Both Honda and Nissan gained in market share, as a result of their domestic output, which allows them to supplement imports limited by trade restraints. Honda's share increased to 7.3 percent from 5.8 percent, while Nissan was up to 6.2 percent from 4.5 percent. Toyota and the Mazda Motor Company, which are both in the process of building domestic plants, lost market; Toyota moving to 4.7 percent from 4.8 percent and Mazda falling to 1.3 percent from 2.3 percent. **********Hyundai, the Korean company that began selling cars last February had a 2.4 percent share of the market last month.

Although the event was scheduled to run from 5 to 6 P.M., it lasted until 8 P.M. and by the end, the feeling of unease began to evaporate, some of those there recalled. **********It did not entirely disappear, of course. There were lingering fears on both sides that the meshing process would be sticky because of pride and varying business cultures. Backer & Spielvogel, the smaller agency, was given frontal position in the new name, Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc., and Carl Spielvogel, B.&S.'s chairman, was named chairman and chief executive of the combined company. Furthermore, the agencies' approaches were different. Backer & Spielvogel was principally noted for its creative efforts and Ted Bates for its development of marketing plans. **********The problem, of course, was to transform separate company spirits into one, often a difficult matter because of rivalries and egos. It was the same problem faced in other recent agency mergers. The trick, it is clear, is to move quickly and decisively and that is what the leaders of Backer Spielvogel Bates say they have tried to do. **********''One initial thing we did was to hold brand reviews of all accounts,'' Mr. Spielvogel said. ''That gave us an opportunity to both see the work and the people in action. When you bring two groups of professionals together, you do get synergy. But the reviews quickly met our objectives of paying attention to key clients and key people.'' **********In an effort to make everyone feel wanted and vital, all employee compensation programs are being reviewed. ''We are also looking to add to all our employee benefits,'' Mr. Spielvogel said. **********On the matter of disparate cultures, it was obvious that at least semantically the merged agencies might run into some confusion. Bates called its primary method the ''unique selling proposition.'' B.& S. called its ''strategy development.'' But, Mr. Spielvogel noted, ''we are now in the process of writing a joint statement on strategy, but we have already decided to use the 'unique selling proposition.' '' **********To merge the staffs physically to best advantage, the agency has appointed study teams of equal numbers of members from each agency to develop the methodology and structure of all the professional disciplines, including creative, account management, research, media, and finance and administration. **********But the knottiest problem the combined agency faced was the dismay that persisted among Bates staff members after when the agency lost almost $300 million in billings last fall because of conflicts and other problems arising from its acquisition by Saatchi & Saatchi. Since then, with the addition of $130 million in new billings at the combined agency, progress has been made in recovering from that loss. **********''And as we get that new business going,'' Mr. Spielvogel said, ''we are giving Bates people made redundant by the accounts' loss first crack at the new accounts. In this way, we are also removing the labels of 'Bates' or 'B.& S.' that they figuratively carry.'' **********What then is the key to running a strong agency? ''You have to remove any superstructure at the top to insure that the top pros aren't doing administrative work but instead working with the clients,'' Mr. Spielvogel said. ''You must be involved in the business of clients.'' A third key, he added, is ''a high degree of professionalism.'' **********Mr. Spielvogel said that he was functioning in the agency as an account executive; William M. Backer, formerly B.& S.'s president and now vice chairman of the merged group, was a copywriter and was also writing a song for the Hyundai auto account, and Donald M. Zuckert, formerly chairman of Ted Bates and now president of Backer Spielvogel Bates, was an account manager. And all other top executives similarly were operating on a hands-on basis with clients. **********Will that personal involvement with clients eventually mean that the agency's top management will miss the forest for the trees? Mr. Spielvogel, 58 years old and a 27-year veteran of the business, smiled and said, ''That's what the advertising business is all about: the trees.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/17/business/business-people-charter-medical-gets-bid-by-chief.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Ross", "pub_date": "1987-11-17", "snippet": "LEAD: William A.

Cleared for Lack of Proof **********Judge Buchholz said the prosecution had been justified in bringing the corruption charges against the three defendants, who he said had been acquitted for lack of evidence against them. **********The verdict was a political blessing for Otto Lambsdorff, who was forced to resign as Economics Minister in June 1984 after being indicted. A senior figure in the small Free Democratic Party and the first West German Cabinet minister to be indicted while in office, Mr. Lambsdorff was fined $100,000 for tax evasion, a punishment that will permit him to seek a cabinet position again. **********His predecessor in the Economics Ministry job, Hans Friderichs, was fined $34,000 for tax evasion while Eberhard von Brauchitsch, the former Flick executive, was fined $306,000 and given a two-year suspended jail sentence for having avoided some $10 million in taxes. **********The sentences were considerably lighter than those demanded by the prosecution, which had asked for a 15-month suspended jail sentence for Mr. Lambsdorff, four years in jail for Mr. von Brauchitsch and a $110,000 fine for Mr. Friderichs, who was chairman of the Dresdner Bank when he was indicted. Graft Charges Dropped **********Mr. Lambsdorff was at first accused of having accepted $50,000 in bribes from the Flick concern in the late 1970's in return for lucrative tax waivers. **********Mr. Friderichs was charged with having accepted $140,000 from Flick for granting similar tax waivers, while Mr. von Brauchitsch was accused of having distributed the bribes. The Flick payoffs were meticulously entered in a ledger that was a central prosecution document. **********Last July, issuing a ''preliminary acquittal,'' the court decided to stop hearing evidence on the corruption charges, which it said it had judged the prosecution could not demonstrate. The corruption charges had been the most serious ones against the three defendants. **********The sharp-tongued Mr. Lambsdorff has treated his trial as an inconvenience and, while gaining re-election to the Parliament last month, has been an active member of the Free Democratic team negotiating the policies of the next Kohl Government. The 60-year-old patrician is his party's spokesman on economics affairs in Parliament. **********Mr. Lambsdorff, a fierce champion of a free-market economy, was one of the moving forces in persuading the Free Democrats to desert their alliance with the Social Democrats in late 1982. The move toppled the Government of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and brought Mr. Kohl to office. Mixed Views of Verdict **********Martin Bangemann, the Free Democrats' chairman, expressed satisfaction that Mr. Lambsdorff had been acquitted of the corruption charges. But Mr. Bangemann, who succeeded Mr. Lambsdorff as Economics Minister and who is reportedly reluctant to give up the post, did not speculate on Mr. Lambsdorff's political future. **********Offering a contrasting view of the verdict, Otto Schily, a Green Party lawmaker, said the punishments were ''mild and trifling'' considering the ''finesse and criminal intensity'' with which the defendants had deprived the state of ''millions.'' **********''I believe the man on the street will ask how he is supposed to understand this privileged treatment,'' said Mr. Schily, a lawyer who was the most aggressive member of a subcommittee that investigated the Flick payoffs. ''The idea that 'the little ones hang and the big ones go free' will be encouraged.'' **********The Lambsdorff trial was the major legal action growing out of an investigation that started in 1981 and provided a glimpse into a vast network of illegal corporate payments to the three major parties, often through tax-free ''donations'' to dummy charities. The scandal eroded popular trust in West Germany's three established parties and contributed to the rise of the Green Party. **********Virtually every major politician was called to testify before various panels and Chancellor Kohl was separately investigated after Mr. Schily accused him of having perjured himself.

But he refused to be more specific on what type of action the United States might take if attacked by Iranians. **********''I think it's far better if the Iranians go to bed every night wondering what we might do than us telling them in advance,'' he said.  [ Excerpts, page A13. ]  In Brussels today, the NATO allies appeared to rebuff a Pentagon call for military help in protecting oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. The move came at the end of a two-day meeting of the alliance's defense ministers.  [ Page A13. ]  Speculation on U.S. Response A range of possibilities for the American involvement in the Gulf have been a subject of speculation in Congress and in the Administration. It is unclear whether an attack by Iran would trigger retaliation by American forces against the missile bases, or would lead to broader aerial attacks against other Iranian targets. **********Concern in Washington has heightened because of the American decision to allow 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers to sail under the American flag, presumably putting them under the protection of Navy warships in the region. The ''flagging'' of the Kuwaiti ships is to begin perhaps as soon as next week. **********Although Iran has so far avoided any military confrontation with the United States in the Gulf, Senator Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee, who returned today from a tour of the region, said it was ''just a matter of time'' before Iran would attack one of the Kuwaiti tankers flying the American flag. Interview With Reagan **********The discussion about the possible American retaliation against Iran arose in an interview with foreign journalists when Mr. Reagan said: ''Now, it is true that the Iranians have placed missiles on shore that can reach targets at sea. That has to be considered with regard to more than just shooting at another vessel or shooting at an airplane.'' Earlier he had said that the United States would attack ships or planes that fired on its ships at sea. **********''I don't see the danger of a war,'' Mr Reagan added. ''I don't see how it could possibly start. As a matter of fact, we are doing everything we can to try and bring about an end to the war that we have.'' **********The President's remarks were the latest in a string of seemingly contradictory statements by Administration officials since an attack by an Iraqi aircraft killed 37 men aboard the United States Navy frigate Stark May 17. Iraq has since apologized for what it said was a mistake. **********Iran and Iraq have been at war since 1980, and although Iraq has attacked many more tankers in the Persian Gulf since then than Iran has, all sides of the debate here have focussed on the threat of an Iranian attack. Kuwait Shipping Main Target **********Of the 30 ships attacked by Iran since last September, 25 were on their way to or from Kuwait, and Administration officials have justified American protection of Kuwaiti tankers as a way to deter further Iranian attacks and keep open the sea lanes in the Gulf. Iranian officials have warned, however, that they will continue their attacks regardless of the American protection. **********Senator Sasser, on the NBC News program ''Today,'' said he doubted that the reflagging of Kuwaiti ships would go forward as scheduled, citing the overwhelming vote by the Senate last week to require that the Administration explain the rules of engagement in the gulf and define security arrangments before the plan to protect Kuwait's ships goes into effect. 'Likely to Be in Combat' **********In another interview today, Senator John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, said, ''We're more likely to be in combat in the Persian Gulf now than we were before.'' **********Last week, after the attack on the Stark, President Reagan said the Navy would defend itself against any hostile aircraft that approached. But his remarks today were Mr. Reagan's first indication that he is considering retaliation in the event of a sea-based or land-based attack from Iran. **********While some officials have called it irresponsible to suggest that the United States might bomb Iran in the event of an attack, others have suggested that the United States would retaliate as it did against attacks attributed to Libya. In that case last year, American forces began by attacking Libyan patrol boats and a missile site and ended by bombing two other military installations. **********Administration officials acknowledge the difficulty in defining the mission of American forces. On the one hand, they have sought to assure Congress and the public that Iran has taken care never to hit an American vessel and does not want a war with the United States. On the other hand, they have characterized Iran as an unpredictable belligerent that poses an increased risk to American forces. U.S. Rules of Engagement **********Because the military rules of engagement are classified, it is unclear, for example, if an attack against a Kuwaiti tanker flying the American flag and primarily manned by foreigners would bring the same American response as an attack on an American naval vessel with American personnel. **********The Iranian threat has become more dangerous since Iran made its batteries of Chinese-made HY-2 anti-ship missiles nearly operational at two sites near Bandar Abbas. Two weeks ago, a second shipment of the missiles, code-named ''Silkworm'' by NATO, arrived. **********In addition, Iranian revolutionary guards, who are less disciplined than the professional Navy and enjoy a certain degree of autonomy in Iran's naval structure, have expanded their authority over the last several months. They have begun to launch hit-and-run attacks on neutral ships in the Gulf from small speedboats. **********Congressional concern was also heightened by new details that emerged today about the American naval escort of two Kuwaiti merchant vessels carrying American-made M-60 tanks, artillery and ammunition to Bahrain last February and again last weekend. The equipment, which was sold to Bahrain, was delivered on Kuwaiti ships at Bahrain's request, the State Department said today. Cargo Is Transferred **********In the first case, an American vessel carrying the arms developed mechanical trouble before it reached the Gulf and had to put into port in Oman, according to a Pentagon official. Its cargo was transferred to a Kuwaiti ship that was accorded the same protection as the American ship. **********Because an escort was provided for the first delivery, the Pentagon concluded that it was appropriate to give the same protection to the second delivery. The Pentagon said in a statement Tuesday that it offered naval escort for the vessels because ''it is important that the United States remain a reliable supplier of defense items to friendly countries.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/26/business/aid-satisfies-indonesia.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-06-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Aid Satisfies Indonesia", "print_headline": "Aid Satisfies Indonesia", "body_text": " **********Indonesia, its economy battered by a plunge in oil and commodity prices last year, said today that it would not reschedule its foreign debts and would neither devalue its currency nor impose foreign currency controls."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/28/business/tokyo-protests-tariffs-official-sees-retaliation.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Chira", "pub_date": "1987-03-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 558, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OFFICIAL SEES RETALIATION", "print_headline": "TOKYO PROTESTS TARIFFS; OFFICIAL SEES RETALIATION", "body_text": " **********In a strongly worded protest, the Japanese Government called on the United States to reverse its decision to impose tariffs on selected Japanese products. **********Although Government officials publicly denied that they would retaliate, one senior official warned that Japan would consider sanctions of its own against American products. **********In a morning news conference, Hajime Tamura, Minister of International Trade and Industry, said the American decision was ''most regrettable'' and called for emergency consultations with the United States. If the tariffs are imposed, he said, Japan will ''take appropriate measures, including those in pursuance of the GATT.'' **********Under the terms of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Japan could protest the American decision as violating the rules prohibiting members from unilaterally imposing discriminatory tariffs without the approval of the country affected. **********Mr. Tamura also said that Japan would consider canceling the semiconductor agreement that is at the heart of the current trade dispute. **********Mr. Tamura argued that the Japanese Government had done everything it could to uphold the agreement, noting that it had asked Japanese companies to cut production. The production cut was sought to force prices up and curb supplies to a ''gray market'' in which semiconductors are still being ''dumped,'' or sold at prices below the fair market prices stipulated by the accord. 'A Matter of Time' **********''The Japanese Government has taken every measure that Japan can imagine,'' Mr. Tamura said. ''No additional measures for this issue can be considered any more. We firmly believe that our measures will bear significant fruit. The problem now is a matter of time.'' **********Mr. Tamura publicly dismissed the possibility that Japan would impose tariffs of its own. ''Japan has been setting the lowest level of tariffs among industrialized nations,'' he said. ''I do not want to undermine those efforts.'' **********But another senior trade ministry official, who asked to remain unidentified, said that Japan would consider imposing tariffs on American exports, such as agricultural products.

''This means that we will take equivalent compensatory adjustments. We will raise duties of a similar magnitude on United States products.'' **********Nonetheless, the trade ministry official said he did not believe that the United States and Japan had fired the first shots of a trade war. Rather, he and other trade officials said, there was still time to negotiate. **********The Electronic Industries Association of Japan also sharply criticized the United States action.

While some analysts question aspects of the discount-rate increase that followed, it is widely agreed that he has tackled his new job with uncommon vigor. He is said to be fascinated by the unveiling of monetary mysteries only dimly glimpsed in his years as a private economist. A Do-It-Yourself Type **********With all the activity of the first few weeks, the 61-year-old Mr. Greenspan recognizes that he might be overdoing it, and acquaintances say he is already looking a bit haggard. But he has decided not to appoint a personal assistant. **********For at least the foreseeable future, Mr. Greenspan will operate without such help, traditionally enjoyed by Fed chairman, because he has found that doing things himself helps him reach out to the Fed staff. **********In this, by all accounts within the Fed's white-marble headquarters not far from the Lincoln Memorial, Mr. Greenspan has had early success. Unlike Paul A. Volcker, his predecessor, who was described as often intimidating, Mr. Greenspan is said to be regularly going outside the chain of command to feed his voracious appetite for statistics and other information. Frequently, it is said, he has been stunned at the speed and comprehensiveness of the responses, his status notwithstanding. **********This, as President Kennedy learned by occasionally phoning relatively low-level analysts at the Central Intelligence Agency 25 years ago, can do wonders for staff morale. **********''There is an opening up of things, an openness to views that is refreshing around here,'' said Edward W. Kelley Jr., the newest governor of the seven-member Federal Reserve Board except for Mr. Greenspan himself. ''He wants to know what other people think.'' **********H. Robert Heller, another board member, said the new chairman has produced ''a very collegial atmosphere'' marked not just by dialogue but by ''multilogue.'' Mr. Heller appeared to harbor some misgivings about the decision to raise the discount rate - he was out of town that day and could not vote. Nevertheless, he gave Mr. Greenspan high marks for style. ''It's more of a board instead of just one man,'' Mr. Heller said. ''I find that very attractive.'' **********Martha R. Seger, the board member most critical of Mr. Volcker for his style, said she had been out of town for half of Mr. Greenspan's brief tenure and thought it too early to draw conclusions about him. Learning Journeys **********Mr. Greenspan's almost obsessive urge to learn every fact and meet every colleague took him, over the Labor Day weekend, to a meeting of the Bank for International Settlements - the central bankers' central bank - in Basel, Switzerland, and last week to Jacksonville, Fla., where he helped dedicate a new Fed branch building and participated in a joint meeting of regional directors. **********Mr. Forrestal, who noted that Mr. Greenspan could have ducked out early but did not, said the Southerners were impressed with Mr. Greenspan for making complicated monetary policy and regulatory issues understandable. **********A Fed spokesman, Joseph R. Coyne, said today that Mr. Greenspan had put high priority on visiting all 12 regional banks quickly. **********It has not been decided, however, just how visible Mr. Greenspan will be in public. His first major address, for which he is expected to write the first and last draft himself, is scheduled for Oct. 20 at the American Bankers Association convention in Dallas. Some See a Blind Spot **********Some analysts have suggested that Mr. Greenspan, who in his long career as a private consultant developed a perhaps unrivaled reputation for analysis of the ''real economy,'' is relatively unschooled in the financial markets. **********But those who have seen him in action said this is unfounded. One top Fed official, a protege of Mr. Volcker, declared that he sees in Mr. Greenspan, who had headed his own firm, Townsend-Greenspan & Company, since 1958, ''the same kind of sophistication that Volcker had.'' **********Indeed, some colleagues reported, whenever Mr. Greenspan has been out of touch even for an hour or two, his first question on return invariably is ''How are the markets?'' When he is in his office, they said, he frequently keeps up with market action on a computer screen. **********''What the Fed cannot do is work outside the functions of the market,'' he told an interviewer shortly before being tapped for the Fed in early June after Mr. Volcker resigned, reportedly when the Reagan Administration was lukewarm in its invitation to stay on. Mr. Greenspan thinks that the essence of the Fed's job is to study what markets do - not what market commentators say - and then separate those elements that are temporary and self-correcting from those that demand some policy response. A Key Early Decision **********Market analysts have varying views about both the motivation and timing of the Sept. 4 decision by the Fed to raise the discount rate by one-half point, to 6 percent, to head off what it called inflationary pressures. It was the first increase since April 1984. **********Some thought the move was Mr. Greenspan's unavoidable response to a direct challenge of the new man in the job by the currency and bond markets. Some thought it was a bit hasty - especially because Mr. Heller and Miss Seger, the two governors most inclined to oppose it -were out of town. Others thought a half-point too little. **********Stephen H. Axilrod, vice chairman at Nikko Securities Company International and the Fed's chief staff official on monetary policy from 1952 to 1986, said he regards the discount rate increase as ''a shot across the bow'' to demonstrate that the board remains as committed to fighting inflation as under Mr. Volcker. **********Allan Meltzer, a monetarist professor at Carnegie-Mellon University, called the increase ''a not very promising'' and misguided effort at short-term influence of the level of the dollar. **********Mr. Greenspan, a multimillionaire who was married briefly in his 20's, is paid the same $89,500 salary that Mr. Volcker received. He has moved into the Watergate complex, which is near the Fed headquarters, and is keeping his East Side apartment in Manhattan as well. **********These late-summer days, the goal is to get up to Federal Reserve speed as the new chairman marvels at the quantities of paper that he and his three secretaries must process and watches keenly as the secrets of monetary policy reveal themselves."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/17/business/profits-scoreboard-130087.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 129, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PROFITS SCOREBOARD", "print_headline": "PROFITS SCOREBOARD", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/08/world/zambia-imf-fallout-mirrors-third-world-woes.html": {"writer_name": "Sheila Rule", "pub_date": "1987-06-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1768, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ZAMBIA-I.M.F. FALLOUT MIRRORS THIRD-WORLD WOES", "print_headline": "ZAMBIA-I.M.F. FALLOUT MIRRORS THIRD-WORLD WOES", "body_text": " **********When President Kenneth D. Kaunda of Zambia recently abandoned stringent austerity measures drawn up by the International Monetary Fund, he fueled the wide-ranging debate over whether the fund's policies represent the best prescription for heavily indebted third world economies. **********At a time when many African countries are adopting I.M.F.-inspired measures, President Kaunda's decision also dramatized the perilous balancing act of developing nations that seek to heal their hemorrhaging economies while maintaining political stability. The decision also called into question the commitment of donor nations in supporting reform-minded governments. **********When Mr. Kaunda announced last month that Zambia was pulling out of its agreement with the I.M.F., many economists and others viewed the move as a decision based on political rather than economic realities, even though Zambia is one of the most politically stable countries in Africa. **********Under pressure from the monetary fund to reduce its $5.1 billion foreign debt, President Kaunda over the last few years undertook an economic austerity program that included major cuts in Government spending and measures to diversify the economy. **********Also included were the lifting of millions of dollars in subsidies for staple foods and the establishment of weekly foreign currency auctions that resulted in the kwacha, Zambia's currency, falling in value in less than two years from 2 to the United States dollar to about 21 to the dollar. Product of Austerity: Wide Complaints But many Zambians, who live in a country that once enjoyed the highest per capita income in black-ruled Africa, complained of soaring prices, widening labor unrest and a dramatic decline in living standards. Last December, after the Government stopped subsidizing corn meal and its price rose at least 100 percent, 15 people died in the fiercest urban violence since the country gained independence from Britain in 1964. **********Mr. Kaunda reluctantly reintroduced the subsidies, but, four months later, announced a 70 percent increase in fuel prices. The increase was canceled a day later amid signs of rising public dissatisfaction in a county where per capita income has fallen from $630 in 1981 to less than $200 today. **********On May 1, President Kaunda rejected the I.M.F.'s conditions for a new financing package of roughly $300 million, which was to be provided after Zambia paid off debts to the fund estimated at $230 million. **********Mr. Kaunda objected to what Zambian officials said were proposals to raise fertilizer and fuel prices, end food subsidies and peg interest rates to the country's 60 percent inflation rate. He instead announced a new economic policy based largely on tight state controls, which some economists viewed as a reintroduction of failed policies of the past. **********Mr. Kaunda ended the foreign currency auctions, establishing a new fixed rate of eight kwacha to the dollar. He also limited payments on the foreign debt, which had been eating up two-fifths of export earnings, to well under 10 percent of such earnings. **********Zambia's scant foreign exchange, Mr. Kaunda said, would be used for necessities such as gasoline, fertilizer and equipment for its vital copper industry. **********While Zambia's Government has blamed the I.M.F. prescription for many recent hardships, economists here say that the lessening of austerity measures could ultimately wreck the economy. Even without the fund, these economists say, Mr. Kaunda can only revamp his economy with strict measures that will no doubt prove unpopular with vast segments of the population. 'The I.M.F. Became Completely Unbearable' **********''It was our genuine desire to work with the I.M.F. and World Bank,'' Mr. Kaunda said, ''and we did so honestly, but it reached a stage where the programs headed by the I.M.F. became completely unbearable. **********''Zambia has not abandoned the restructuring program,'' he said. ''That program will continue, but not on the lines of the I.M.F., which were too demanding on the economy.'' **********The Zambian authorities have refused to grant visas to some foreign journalists, saying frankly that they did not want coverage of their economic crisis. But Zimbabwe-based Western and African diplomats, economists and bankers who are knowledgeable about Zambia's predicament say that it is a classic example of a third-world nation that, because of misguided policies of its own making as well as external economic forces beyond its control, finds itself in an economic quagmire. **********Like other developing economies that are based on exports of raw materials, Zambia's economy remains almost totally dependent on copper and, thus, on the fluctuations of world market prices. **********Copper still accounts for about 90 percent of the country's foreign exchange earnings, and it has steadily lost value during much of this decade. More foreboding for Zambia is that its copper deposits are expected to be virtually depleted by the turn of the century. **********While Zambia failed to diversify its economy or cut spending to compensate for the decline in world copper prices, the price of oil and other vital imports rose. The Government began to incur balance of payment deficits and was forced to borrow from the I.M.F. and other lenders, leading to a foreign debt it can no longer service. **********Some economists say there are few choices available to countries like Zambia that are sagging under the weight of mounting foreign debts, critical shortages of foreign exchange, a lack of capital for investment, chronic shortages of essential goods and spare parts and a dramatic decline in industry. **********These countries are viewed by some economists familiar with the I.M.F. policy as needing money that only the I.M.F. can provide. If the nations accept the fund's measures, economists say, they may face a dramatic drop in living standards and rising public dissatisfaction over the short term but could ultimately experience long-term growth and stability. If they reject reforms, these economists say, they doom themselves to open-ended misery. Kaunda's Action May Be to Buy Time I.M.F. officials have suggested that Mr. Kaunda is aware that he needs the cooperation of the I.M.F. and Western donors. They believe that his break with the fund may be a temporary move to allow his Government to regain popularity before next year's general elections. **********After the elections, Zambian officials reportedly hope to win more favorable terms on an I.M.F. financing package. But if Mr. Kaunda fails to return to the I.M.F., economists say, Zambia will probably continue to receive foreign aid for development projects but lose other sources of funds intended to adjust its balance of payments. **********Yet Western and African critics of the I.M.F. say that its policies conflict with long-term development. They argue that the application of traditional policies of financial austerity and economic liberalization, which demand major sacrifices, fail to bring about positive results and could lead to political chaos. **********These critics say the I.M.F. and Western donor nations want policies that doom third-world countries to low economic status in order to provide the industrialized world with cheap exports and labor and a ready market. **********For example, some economists critical of the fund say the fund urges developing nations to devalue their currency and open trade to international markets - actions, they say, that lock the countries into the continuing export of raw materials at cheap prices and prevent their generally weak national industries from competing with imports from the industrialized world. **********In the view of these critics, the I.M.F. is too inflexible. More realistic approaches are needed, the critics say, including measures that would stretch out payments on Africa's debt and allow the continent to begin sustained economic growth. **********''All of us, African governments, the international community and world markets, are to blame for the situations these countries find themselves in,'' said a Western economist based in this capital city. **********''These countries go to the I.M.F. when they are very sick and that sickness is derived from international and domestic reasons,'' the economist said. ''The I.M.F. has the money but it doesn't have a magic wand, and its mandate is the bottom line. How a country reaches the bottom line is not the fund's concern. Zambia is a perfect case. The Government and outside donors have to have the stamina - it won't happen with I.M.F. quick injections - to bring Zambia and other poor nations back.'' For I.M.F. Policies, Continent-Wide Sway More than 20 nations in sub-Saharan Africa have adopted bold I.M.F.-inspired policies intended to right their economies. All over this vast continent, from Ghana in West Africa to Tanzania in the east, governments are opening up their economies by cutting spending, increasing incentives for agricultural production, devaluing currencies and easing state controls. **********While it does not appear at this point that most will follow the lead of Zambia, economists say, these heavily indebted nations could suspend interest payments on their debts if the international economic climate remains unconducive to sustained growth. **********In addition, many African leaders willing to seek economic changes are under pressure from ideological factions and other groups that benefited from past policies and therefore have a vested interest in preserving them. **********Some economists and African leaders say donor nations have pressed for reforms without providing the resources needed to cover the period between the time a struggling nation begins a restructuring program and the policies begin to reap results. **********While donor nations have poured great amounts of aid into Africa over the years, these critics say, more money is needed to replace the money these countries spend on servicing debt and to insure that the restructuring succeeds. **********If more aid is not forthcoming, some African leaders suggest that the reform measures could set their governments on a collision course with their people. **********''I hope donors will step in and provide gifts or long-term assistance that the African governments need,'' said an economist who is familiar with I.M.F. policies. **********''The governments also have to have the courage to support and stand by their reforms,'' the economist said. ''Too often, African governments bite the bullet because there is no alternative. Their economies are in ruins and the only way they can get money from outside is to agree to conditions that they and their people have no commitment to.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/25/business/patents-missile-devices-by-boeing.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1987-04-25", "snippet": "LEAD: THE Boeing Company in Seattle received patents this week for a missile power source, a missile control device and a warhead.", "word_count": 128, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PATENTS;\nMissile Devices By Boeing", "print_headline": "PATENTS;\nMissile Devices By Boeing", "body_text": " **********LEAD: THE Boeing Company in Seattle received patents this week for a missile power source, a missile control device and a warhead. **********THE Boeing Company in Seattle received patents this week for a missile power source, a missile control device and a warhead. **********The power source is covered by patent 4,658,588 granted George T.

But America's commercial banks are willing, and able, to help lower prices by hundreds of millions of dollars by increasing competition. The missing ingredient is Congressional authority to give banks the capability to move into new markets that will strengthen our banking system. **********Modernization of banking laws is drawing opposition from many members of the securities industry who are using the current volatility of the financial markets to argue against change. But the real purpose behind the opposition is to protect their markets from needed competition. **********The case is clear. Now, more than ever, Congress must strengthen our financial system by reforming out-of-date banking laws, such as the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act. **********Because banks are governed by these old laws, we are not allowed to serve fully and equally. The result is that commerical banking is becoming a declining industry. In 1970, seven of the world's 25 largest banks had their headquarters in the United States. Today, there is only one. Even our largest and strongest banks are not given a competitive posture. **********What products and services do bankers want to offer? The answer is as varied as the communities banks serve. Some banks would like to buy and sell homes. Many banks want to offer mutual funds or underwrite certain securities products like municipal revenue bonds. Others would like to sell life insurance products. **********There are numerous legislative changes that Congress needs to make. The Glass-Steagall Act is just one example of an outmoded law that works to prevent full competition. What does the Glass-Steagall Act do? It insulates Wall Street firms from much-needed bank competition, resulting in a securities industry that is shockingly concentrated. For instance, the same five large securities firms control 95 percent of the commercial paper market, 81 percent of the mortgage-backed securities underwriting market and 72 percent of the corporate debt market. **********If Glass Steagall barriers are removed, banks will provide substantial savings. For example: **********State and local governments, and therefore the taxpayers, could save an estimated $500 million in borrowing costs, according to estimates based on National Governors Association figures, if banks were permitted to underwrite municipal revenue bonds. **********Homeowners could save thousands of dollars in home financing costs with bank entry into the mortgage- backed securities underwriting business, according to the National Association of Homebuilders. **********Business will enjoy lower underwriting spreads and overall funding costs by using bank-offered commercial paper. Further, banks are uniquely qualified to extend the benefits of commercial paper borrowing to smaller companies that are unlikely to have access to Wall Street. **********Small investors would increase their returns through bank-sponsored and distributed mutual funds. Not only would banks' ''no-load'' mutual funds insure that consumers would have more money working for them compared with the vast numbers of ''load'' funds, but bankers can offer expertise in managing unique equity portfolios. **********Lower costs and more services are part of the story but it is also important for the banking system to be safe and sound. For this to happen, banks must be permitted to offer a wider array of financial products to be competitive, maintain profitablity and raise capital. **********Not only will banks have the opportunity to diversify their revenue stream, but they'll have a fighting chance to recapture what were once their best corporate customers, many of whom left when the services they needed couldn't be found in a bank. **********SOME solutions have been generated outside of Washington. More than half the states have approved rules or legislation to give banks wider opportunities to compete in new service areas. Nevertheless, a national solution remains the best means to correct the competitive inequities that tie the hands of banks limiting consumer choices. **********Several proposals that would broaden competition while protecting bank deposits and capital against undue risks are now awaiting Congressional attention. **********Recently, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Comptroller of the Currency, and senior Administration officials offered Congress virtually identical approaches to permit banking institutions to compete by reforming the Glass-Steagall Act. Their testimony demonstrated that any concerns about risks to the deposit insurance system can be met by appropriate regulatory safeguards. **********Obviously, Congress will want to take a close look at the causes of the recent problems in the financial markets, but this should not be used as an excuse to avoid action on modernizing our banking laws, action that is long overdue. Indeed, the recent problems in the securities industry indicate to an even greater degree the need for the stabilizing influence that bank participation would provide. **********Congress has the ability to reverse the decline of the banking industry and insure consumers full competition in the financial services marketplace. In light of banking industry trends and current financial market conditions, continued inaction is the American economy's greatest risk."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/19/business/international-report-australia-s-luck-starts-running-out.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1309, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AUSTRALIA'S 'LUCK' STARTS RUNNING OUT", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL REPORT; AUSTRALIA'S 'LUCK' STARTS RUNNING OUT", "body_text": " **********Once this was known as ''the lucky country,'' and Australians were confident their vast nation would prosper on its abundance of gold, oil, coal and other resources. But a parade of economic difficulties, including a foreign debt that is rapidly becoming one of the world's largest, has eroded that carefree optimism. **********Concern has been building for months, particularly since the plunge of the Australian dollar on currency markets last year, and the much-publicized warning in May by the Federal Treasurer, Paul Keating, that Australia risked becoming ''a banana republic.'' **********Prime Minister Bob Hawke added his own caution a few months later. ''The party's over, finito,'' Mr. Hawke declared, ''and Australians have to understand it, finito.'' **********John W. Howard, the leader of the opposition Liberal Party, said in a recent interview: ''The problems are structural, not cyclical. This is unlike any economic challenge we've faced since World War II.'' Australian Dollar Plunges **********Such bleak assessments are based on plunging commodity prices, a yawning trade deficit and the mounting foreign debt. Australians sometimes refer to the Australian dollar as ''the peso,'' because of its sharp fall over the last year. **********Most economists and bankers strongly doubt Australia's predicament will follow the path of Latin America, where a similar accumulation of debt and plunges in the values of local currencies helped spark a debt crisis in late 1982. But there is no doubt that Australia has suffered an economic decline. **********A century ago, Australia had perhaps the highest per capita income in the world. Today it ranks about 18th, and once-indigent neighbors in the Pacific are fast approaching its level. Singapore, for example, has a per capita income of about $7,000, compared with $10,000 in Australia. **********''It worries the hell out of me,'' said Peter E. Baume, a senior Senator of the opposition Liberal Party, of the rising foreign debt and general economic woes. ''It seems the economy is structurally unsound.'' Larger Debtor Than Argentina **********Australia's growing foreign debt is one of its most vexing problems. At last count, in June 1986, it stood at about $60 billion in United States dollars, up from about $18 billion in 1981. As a debtor, Australia ranks below Brazil and Mexico, each of which owes about $100 billion, but above Argentina, which owes about $50 billion. And Australia has just 16 million people, half of Argentina's population. **********As with the Latin debtors, the majority of Australia's debts are denominated in foreign currencies. In Australia's case, 65 percent of the loans are in United States dollars and another 20 percent in other foreign currencies, with only 15 percent in Australian dollars. **********That means a declining exchange rate makes it more difficult to repay those debts. **********Pessimists sometimes draw a comparison with Argentina, noting that both are resource-rich countries that primarily export minerals and agricultural products. Both protected their domestic producers and suffered rising debt levels and a falling currency. But there are substantial differences as well. Australia's foreign debt, unlike that of most of Latin America, is owed mostly by the private sector rather than the Government. Also, Australia has political stability and it possesses substantial foreign exchange reserves. Pessimism on the Near Term **********''Compared to the Argentinas and Bolivias of the world, Australia's debt is not serious today,'' said John H. K. Brunner, chief economist of Broken Hill Proprietary, a natural resources company that is Australia's largest concern. ''But tomorrow it becomes quite alarming.'' **********Mr. Brunner noted the amount of debt and the interest that must be paid on it are forecast to grow considerably in the next few decades. In the 1986 fiscal year, interest payments swallowed 17 percent of the foreign exchange earned from exports. **********Two American debt-rating agencies, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, recently downgraded Australia's credit rating, but its borrowing costs have barely risen - a sign of continued confidence in the ability of Australian borrowers to repay loans. **********But lenders are fickle, and borrowing could become more expensive if perceptions of the Australian situation worsen. ''You can't keep on increasing your debt without adjustments,'' said Martin Cooper, the managing director of Citibank Savings Ltd. in Sydney. ''Market forces will come to bear.'' Commodities Dominate Exports **********One of Australia's principal problems is that its economy in some respects resembles that of a developing country. More than 80 percent of exports are agricultural commodities, such as wheat or wool, or natural resources, such as oil or coal. The Government aims to lift the manufacturing share of total output to 19.5 percent in the next few years, from its current 17.8 percent level. **********But officials concede that the structure of the economy will remain much the same. Commodities will dominate, and commodity prices are very depressed. **********Prices of agricultural commodities, such as wheat and barley, have also fallen, partly because of trade skirmishes between the United States and the European Community. Australia says that in the present fiscal year, it will lose wheat and barley exports worth $675 million because of trade battles across the Atlantic. **********Donald Horne, a Sydney political scientist, says the problems of Australia's economy are derived from an overreliance on the bounty of the earth instead of on technology and ingenuity. That was why he chose, with considerable irony, the title ''The Lucky Country'' for his classic 1964 study of Australia. Professor Horne's purpose was misconstrued, however, and Australia soon acquired the nickname ''the lucky country.'' Corrective Actions Taken **********While Prime Minister Hawke and his Labor Party colleagues stress the severity of the difficulties that are testing Australia, they also add that important corrective actions have been taken. For example, the flotation of the Australian dollar led to its plunge on foreign exchange markets from $1.16 United States five years ago to 67 cents today. **********Against other currencies, the change is even more startling. A decade ago, the Australian dollar was worth 330 yen; today it is worth about 100 yen. The lower value of the currency should help Australia's balance of trade, making exports more competitive and imports more costly. **********There are already some signs of a turnaround, although economists are awaiting further data to be sure. **********The change in the exchange rate has also sparked a gold boom, particularly in Western Australia. Companies and individuals alike have caught the gold bug, as world gold prices, which are set in American dollars, soar in local currency terms. And there are plans to increase exports of Australian wine, cars, steel and other products. Tourism Is Up **********Meanwhile, tourism is enjoying a boom, as Japanese and Americans flock to Australia, attracted in part by reduced costs resulting from the fall in the exchange rate. **********There are indeed glimmers of better times on the horizon, but for now everyone predicts continued difficulties. Real wages are expected to fall again this year, after declining 5 to 6 percent during the last two years, according to Barry Hughes, an economic adviser to the Federal Treasurer. He expects overall economic growth in 1987 to be 2 percent, and even that will come only from a change in the trade accounts, rather than a gain in living standards. **********''It's going to be a long, hard slog,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''There's no alternative policy worth talking about.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/20/world/from-democratic-leaders-in-congress-cautious-backing-for-the-attack.html": {"writer_name": "Linda Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1987-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 949, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "From Democratic Leaders in Congress, Cautious Backing for the Attack", "print_headline": "From Democratic Leaders in Congress, Cautious Backing for the Attack", "body_text": " **********Democratic leaders of Congress, anxious to avoid a partisan confrontation over United States policy in the Persian Gulf, offered cautious support today for the strike against the Iranian oil rig. **********''We support what was done,'' Representative Jim Wright, the House Speaker, said at a news conference.

That measure, which does not refer to the War Powers Resolution by name, would defer until January any vote relating to the policy in the gulf. **********The widespread belief among Democrats that the President was not justified in ignoring the War Powers Resolution appeared to be matched by an equally widespread belief that they had little to gain politically from provoking a confrontation over the issue. **********''The law is the law,'' Representative Dante B. Fascell, the Florida Democrat who heads the Foreign Affairs Committee, said at a news conference. He said Mr. Reagan was ''trying to skirt the entire issue, and I don't think that will be successful.'' **********Some members of Congress said complying with the War Powers Resolution would strengthen rather than weaken the President's ability to conduct policy in the Persian Gulf. 'An Enhanced Position' **********Senator John H. Glenn Jr., Democrat of Ohio, said he supported both the current policy in the gulf and a strict interpretation of the resolution. **********''Think what an enhanced position the President would be in with firm Congressional support, which I think he would get,'' Senator Glenn, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said at a news conference. **********Senator Byrd also implied that Congress, if given the opportunity to debate the matter under the War Powers Resolution, would not undercut Administration policy. **********After United States planes raided Libya in 1986, Congressional leaders complained that they had been consulted only after the operation began. Today Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said Administration aides ''certainly were sensitive'' to that criticism and added, ''We wanted to make it clear that we were consulting with them before the action took place.'' **********Members of Congress were equally sensitive to complaints that they had talked too freely after the raid on Libya, and they were inaccessible after meeting the President Sunday. **********At the meeting, Mr. Reagan, dressed in a casual warm-up suit and slippers, discussed his plans and asked for comments. He told the Congressional leaders that he would report to Congress within 48 hours as mandated by the War Powers Resolution. In response to a question by Senator Byrd, the President said the clock would start running when the attack began this morning. Won't Invoke Rest of Law **********But Mr. Reagan told the lawmakers that he would not invoke the provision of the resolution that could require him to remove forces. **********In recent weeks, the Administration has stressed that the military situation in the gulf does not fall under the definition of war contained in the resolution. But today White House officials shifted gears somewhat, emphasizing that Mr. Reagan considered the War Powers Resolution to be an unconstitutional infringement of Presidential prerogatives. The implication was that the President would not invoke the act under any circumstances. **********''We have decided, like all the Administrations before us since this law was passed, that it is not constitutional,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. ''It unfairly ties the hands of the President.'' **********Asked if the President felt free to ignore any law he deemed unconstitutional, before the courts had ruled on its validity, Mr. Fitzwater replied, ''We believe that we are obeying the law.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/23/business/us-ponders-move-against-japanese-on-computer-chips.html": {"writer_name": "Calvin Sims", "pub_date": "1987-03-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1468, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. PONDERS MOVE AGAINST JAPANESE ON COMPUTER CHIPS", "print_headline": "U.S. PONDERS MOVE AGAINST JAPANESE ON COMPUTER CHIPS", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration appears to be on the verge of imposing sanctions against Japanese semiconductor manufacturers, according to Government officials, Congressional leaders and industry executives. **********The move could result in an acute worsening of the trade friction between the United States and Japan. **********Last week, the Commerce Department confirmed industry reports that many Japanese companies were continuing to sell computer chips below cost in developing countries. This practice, called dumping, hurts American chip manufacturers and violates a recent trade agreement between the United States and Japan. A Specter of Retaliation **********Clayton K. Yeutter, the United States trade representative, was quoted by the Reuters news agency yesterday as saying the United States was ''very close'' to imposing a ''retaliatory kind of action'' against the Japanese over trade issues, including the dumping of semiconductors. Mr. Yeutter made the comment to reporters in New Zealand, where he was attending a meeting of trade ministers. **********The President's Economic Policy Council is to meet Wednesday to decide what sanctions, if any, should be imposed on the Japanese companies. An announcement is expected before the end of the month. Senate Adopts Resolution **********Last week, the Senate unanimously approved a resolution calling on the President to take retaliatory action against Japanese violators of the semiconductor pact as a necessary step to maintaining a healthy domestic semiconductor industry. The American industry is showing a modest recovery after a long slump. **********Senator Pete Wilson, Republican of California, said it was fairly clear that Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige would recommend sanctions, which could take the form of tariffs on chip imports as well as on electronic products containing the Japanese chips. Mr. Wilson was among a group of senators and industry representatives who met Friday with Mr. Baldrige to discuss what actions the Administration was considering. **********For their part, the Japanese insist that no dumping is going on. Despite this apparent contradiction, however, they concede that some lower-priced ''gray market'' chips are being sold in third countries. These chips were produced two or three years ago, Japanese chip makers say. **********Japanese Government officials apparently are planning to tighten controls over chip shipments to assure that the semiconductor agreement is honored. If Japan acts quickly enough, the new controls could undermine American efforts at retaliation, trade officials in Washington concede. **********The growing pressure for sanctions comes after Administration pressure forced Fujitsu Ltd., the giant Japanese electronics company, to drop its plan to buy the Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, an American chip maker. **********''These things are always hard to call,'' said a former Commerce Department official who is familiar with the semiconductor agreement but asked not to be identified. ''But when you consider the protectionist sentiments brewing in Congress, the Fairchild-Fujitsu deal and the fact that the Japanese have consistently broken their promise on this, the Administration will probably whop them one to show that we mean business.'' Trade Group Asks Tariffs **********For months, the Semiconductor Industry Association, an American trade group that played a major role in negotiating the semiconductor agreement, has been pressing the Government for tariffs on products such as video cassette recorders, laser printers and computers containing the dumped chips. The trade group, based in San Jose, Calif., has insisted that the Government act by April 1. **********Under the agreement, reached last July, Washington agreed not to impose trade sanctions against Japanese chip makers in exchange for the Japanese Government's cooperation in enforcing fair-market prices and opening up the Japanese market to American producers. **********The Economic Policy Council, whose members include Secretary Baldrige, has two major options in making recommendations to the President. **********For one, the Administration could impose anti-dumping duties on imports of the computer chips, which are known as dynamic random access memory chips, or Drams, and erasable programmable read-only memory chips, or Eproms. Action Opposed by Industry **********But industry officials strongly oppose this because it would hurt large American companies that use the chips and might force them to move production facilities abroad to take advantage of lower prices. Industry analysts also say there is not enough American production of Drams to supplant the supply from Japan. **********A less protectionist action would be to impose sanctions against so-called value-added products such as laser printers and components for supercomputers that either contain the dumped chips or are produced by the Japanese semiconductor manufacturers found to be dumping them. **********''This seems like the most prudent thing to do because it gets them where it really hurts,'' said Andrew Kessler, an analyst with the Paine Webber brokerage house. **********Before the United States announces what action it will take, however, many industry officials expect Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry to present American trade officials with an anti-dumping plan that would convince them that tariffs on value-added products are not necessary. Steps Taken by Ministry **********Indeed, the Japanese agency acted last week to stem the tide toward sanctions. It summoned representatives of Japan's 10 leading semiconductor companies - including Fujitsu, Hitachi Ltd. and the NEC Corporation - and told them not to dump products in third countries and to step up purchases of American-made semiconductors. The ministry also produced its own evidence that Japanese chip makers were complying with the agreement. **********Nonetheless, American analysts say the trade ministry is working to shut off the flow of all Dram and Eprom chips to third countries such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. **********The ministry now requires export licenses on shipments of semiconductors with a value of 50,000 yen, equal to about $330. Analysts say the ministry, to show it is exercising more control, has lowered that threshold to 5,000 yen, and requires all certificates to show not only the price paid for the chips but also the seller. **********These changes will cause extensive delays in the processing of applications for such licenses and the shipments of the chips. Because of these delays, analysts said, the abundance of low-price dumped chips in third countries would be reduced, causing prices to rise. Then the Japanese trade ministry would continue to monitor chips leaving Japan to make sure they were not being dumped, the analysts said. Plans for Controlling Flow **********A high-level Japanese trade official, who asked not to be named, confirmed last week that the ministry had such plans to control the flow of semiconductors to third countries. **********Adam Cuhney, a Kidder, Peabody analyst in San Francisco, said that if the ministry proposed such a plan to American trade officials, ''it would be hard for them to go ahead with any sanctions.'' **********He said, ''To attach a tariff under these circumstances seems to be an unlikely choice on the part of the Administration, because it would have such a great impact on so many U.S. customers that rely on products produced by the Japanese semiconductor manufacturers.'' **********While these actions would address the problem of dumping abroad, they do nothing about the semiconductor market in Japan itself, which remains closed to American producers. The industry group estimates that American chip makers have more than 50 percent of every semiconductor market in the world except for Japan. **********''The Japanese have to open their market if they plan to abide by the agreement,'' said George Scalise, senior vice president of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., and head of the industry association's public policy committee. ''Quality control is no longer a question, and the U.S. industry has earned a right to enter that market.'' **********But analysts say that entrance is unlikely to happen unless Japan exercises tighter control over its companies.  YEUTTTER'S COMMENTS  TAUPO, New Zealand, March 22 (Reuters) - Washington's trade representative said today that the United States and Japan were on the brink of a serious conflict over trade. **********At one point, Mr. Yeutter used the term ''trade war'' in speaking to reporters, but backed off when questioned further at a reception on the eve of a two-day meeting of world trade ministers. **********Mr. Yeutter said the United States and the European Community had come ''very close to a trade war'' over the issue of who should supply cereals to Spain. **********''We are very close to that now with Japan, at least in terms of a potential retaliatory response by the United States over two or three controversial items,'' he said. **********Asked to repeat the phrase, Mr. Yeutter said, ''No, not trade war, but in terms of a potential retaliatory kind of action by the United States.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/18/business/business-forum-new-cabinet-department-would-help-taming-economic-policy-monster.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-01-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1162, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Taming the Economic Policy Monster", "print_headline": "BUSINESS FORUM: A NEW CABINET DEPARTMENT WOULD HELP; Taming the Economic Policy Monster", "body_text": " **********By ALICE M. RIVLIN; **********ECONOMIC policy making in Washington in the last decade has been more frustrating, muddled and confusing than necessary. Some of the fault lies with economists and economics; some with politicians and the political process; some in the interactions. I want to offer some suggestions for modest improvements. **********The main problem, it seems to me, is that our economic policy system has gradually become so complex, diffused and fragmented that it impedes rather than fosters informed choices on major issues. The fragmentation imposes two kinds of costs. **********First, it makes the decision process itself exceedingly inefficient. Decisions are made too often, in too great detail and reviewed by too many layers of decision makers in the executive and in Congress. Too much time is absorbed in procedure and in wrangling over details, not enough on major decisions. It is time to simplify the process, to weed out some of the institutions, and to tip the balance between substance and process back toward substance. **********Second, decisions are made separately that ought to be made together, or at least with attention to their impact on each other. The separation of monetary and fiscal policy is one example; the separation of tax and spending decisions is another. Congress has made a good deal of progress in recent years in putting spending decisions together with their revenue or deficit consequences, but more could be done. I have seven steps to suggest that might make the economic policy process work more effectively. **********First, seek out decisions that should be made less frequently and arrange to do so. This would economize decision-making time and enhance the chances of thoughtful, well-informed decisions. It would free up time and energy for managing the government enterprise more effectively, with a longer planning horizon. It would also reduce the inefficiency and sense of unfairness that goes with frequent changes of the rules. Making the Federal budget every other year would be a major advance. Major revisions of the tax code should occur even less frequently. Big ticket acquisitions, such as major weapons systems, should be reviewed thoroughly at infrequent intervals and then put on a steady efficient track, not constantly revisited. WITH a two-year budget, there would occasionally be major events, such as a sudden escalation of international tension or a sharp unexpected shift in the economic outlook, that would justify reopening the budget in midstream, but the temptation to tinker frequently should be strongly resisted. The argument that economists cannot forecast accurately two years in advance, while quite true, does not undermine the case for a multi-year budget. It simply reinforces the point that discretionary fiscal policy is hazardous and ought to be viewed with great skepticism whether the budget is annual or biennial. **********Second, seek out decisions that need not be made at all and stop making them. Some spending programs could be consolidated into block grants or devolved to the states, not necessarily in the interest of smaller government, but in the interest of greater responsiveness to local needs and a less cluttered Federal decision schedule. In other cases, the responsibility is clearly Federal - as in defense - but Congress would be more effective if it concentrated on major policy issues rather than on details of program management. **********Third, in the executive branch, consolidate authority for tax, budget and fiscal policy in a single Cabinet department. The department could retain the name Treasury, but might better be called the Department of Economic Affairs. The Secretary of Economic Affairs should have a high- level chief economist or economic council with a strong professional staff. The chief economist should work closely with the budget director, who also should report to the Secretary. The purpose would be to bring together economic decisions now made in the Office of Management and Budget, the Council of Economic Advisers and Treasury under one high-level responsible person, to relieve the President of the duty of adjudicating among so many potentially warring power centers, and to increase the chances of building a highly professional permanent economic staff one step removed from the short-run political concerns of the White House. **********Fourth, streamline the Congressional committee structure to reduce the number of steps in the budget process. The authorizing and appropriating functions should be combined in a single set of ''program committees,'' one for each major area of public spending. This would imply a single defense committee, for example, and a social insurance committee. The tax committees should handle the revenue side - not additional spending programs as at present. The budget committees would be charged with considering fiscal policy and putting the spending and revenue sides together into a budget to be passed by the whole congress. The Joint Economic Committee should celebrate the important contributions it made to economic understanding in the days before the budget process and then close up shop. **********Fifth, bring monetary and fiscal policy into the same conversation. This end could be furthered by closer formal links between the central bank and the Department of Economic Affairs to dramatize the need for consultation and interaction. The Federal Reserve chairman should make a report to the budget committees of Congress laying out recommended short- and longer-run economic goals for the nation and discussing combinations of monetary and fiscal strategies to achieve them. The Fed's report should be an important input to Congressional deliberations on fiscal policy. **********Sixth, strive for a Government-wide official economic forecast to be updated on a regular schedule. This would reduce the confusion generated by conflicting estimates and, by the increased interaction between the Department of Economic Affairs, the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve necessary to create such a forecast, would increase mutual understanding of what is happening to the economy and what the goals of policy should be. **********Finally, bring choices explicitly into the decision process, both in executive branch deliberations and, especially, in Congress. Those proposing spending increases or tax reductions should routinely be required to specify what is to be given up and to offer both the benefit and its cost as a package. In other words, proposals should be deficit neutral. **********The press and politicians often sound as if they are telling economists to work harder: go back to your computers and don't come out until you know how the economy really works and can give us reliable forecasts. But economists know that the economic system is incredibly complicated and that increasing global interdependence and rapidly changing technologies and public attitudes are not making it easier to understand. **********Like the medical profession, which also deals with an incredibly complex system, we economists just have to keep applying our imperfect knowledge as carefully as possible and learning from the results. Both doctors and economists need humility, but neither should abandon their patients to the quacks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/04/world/chemistry-professor-granted-permission-to-leave-soviet.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chemistry Professor Granted Permission to Leave Soviet", "print_headline": "Chemistry Professor Granted Permission to Leave Soviet", "body_text": " **********Irwin Cotler, a local lawyer, said today that Yuri Tarnopolsky, a Soviet chemistry professor and poet, hade been given permission to emigrate. **********Mr. Tarnopolsky was told Friday that he could leave with his wife and daughter, Mr. Cotler said.

McFarlane faced questions on the National Security Council's involvement with the contras and his understanding of the Boland Amendment. Here, as recorded by The New York Times, are excerpts from his testimony.  INOUYE STATEMENT  DANIEL K. INOUYE. Before we begin our testimony, I'd like to make the following announcement. We have located the $10 million contributed for the contras by the Sultan of Brunei, which was made in August 1986. **********And as all of us are aware, this was the last substantial donation to the contras unaccounted for until this morning. Our discovery was achieved in the following manner: **********Mr. Mark Belnick, the executive assistant to the chief counsel of the Senate committee, with the assistance of the State Department, obtained authorization from the Sultan of Brunei for the Senate committee to act on its behalf in locating the missing $10 million. **********Using this authorization, Mr. Belnick and Mr. John Cronin, one of the committee's senior accountants, pursued the investigation in this country and abroad. Mr. Cronin is presently in Switzerland obtaining the final details. **********What we know now is that the $10 million was transferred into the account of an individual at Credit Suisse, and that this individual withdrew the funds. The money was apparently transferred to this individual's account by mistake. **********We do not yet know whether this mistake was the result of Colonel North giving the wrong account number to Secretary Abrams or whether it resulted from another error during the transaction. Nor do we at present know the identity of the individual, but we have been assured that in about three hours we would know. **********We do know that the bank has filed criminal charges in Switzerland seeking the return of the money. As soon as Mr. Cronin returns from Switzerland, we intend to present the full story through him and Mr. Belnick at these hearings.  . . . **********I suppose the question before us is: Does the Senate Select Committee get a finder's fee?   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  RETURN TO COUNTRY 2  JOHN W. NIELDS Jr. Now, Mr. McFarlane, I take it you appeared before a number of Congressional committees, towards the end of last year, one of which was the House Foreign Affairs Committee?  A. That's correct.  Q. And that was, I believe, on Dec. 8, 1986?  A. Yes.  . . . **********Q. I'll ask you whether you were asked the following question and gave the following answer. At the bottom of page 65: ''Mr. McFarlane, I would like to try and understand, as we close, what role if any the National Security Council had in the solicitation of funds for the contras? Earlier this morning Secretary Shultz indicated that there had been success in soliciting and persuading at least one country to provide funding. And presumably it was intended for humanitarian purposes and presumably he was speaking about Brunei. **********''Did you or anyone working with you or for you at the National Security Council at any time make efforts at solicitation of other countries for contributions to the contras?'' **********Mr. McFarlane, this is your response, is it not? ''I did not solicit any country at any time to make contributions to the contras. I have seen the reports that various countries have'' - then there's a word deleted and that's Country 2, isn't it?  A. I don't know.  Q. Well, you can turn to the unredacted version. . . I will represent to you - and you may check it if you wish - that the word deleted there is Country 2. So I will read your answer: ''I did not solicit any country at any time to make contributions to the contras. I have seen the reports that various countries have - Country 2, third countries - and I have no idea of the extent of that or anything else.'' Did you make that answer?  A. Yes.  Q. Now, in fact, you did have a pretty good idea of Country 2's funding of the contras, didn't you?  A. Yes.  Q. In fact, as you've testified yesterday and today, you had a hand in obtaining contributions totaling approximately $32 million from Country 2?  A. Yes.  Q. But you did not tell that to the Foreign Affairs Committee at that time?  A. No. I was trying to use some tortured language - inappropriately, I think. But the comment that I did not know the extent: to be technically accurate, I did not, and do not today. But I take your point, Mr. Nields, it wasn't a full account.  . . .  'PROBLEMATIC' PAPERS  Q. I'd like . . to address the subject again of the contras and particularly the Congressional inquiries in the summer of 1985. I think you've already testified about them but I take it - would it be fair to say that in the summer of 1985 there were some news articles about the contras and the N.S.C.?  A. Yes.  Q. And the news articles were on the subject of where the contras's funding was coming from and whether the N.S.C. was giving them any support?  A. That's correct.  Q. I take it that you then received a letter or letters from several members of Congress and the Senate?  A. Yes sir, I did.  Q. And one of them was from Congressman Barnes?  A. Yes.  . . .  Q. And he states, indeed in the very first paragraph, I am writing in response to recent press reports. And he indicates that they're on the subject of the N.S.C. staff members providing advice and fund-raising support to the Nicaraguan resistance?  A. Yes.  Q. And he asks you to supply information on that subject and also documents. Is that correct?. . .  A. Yes.  Q. And I think you've testified that when you got the letter or learned that it had been received, you asked Mr. Thompson to pull the relevant documents?  A. I think probably Admiral Poindexter, but it was ultimately done by Brenda Rieger, the Freedom of Information Act professional, and given to Admiral Poindexter and in turn to Commander Thompson. . . .  Q. And Commander Thompson is a lawyer?  A. Yes sir. He's in the J.A.G. Corps of the Navy.  Q. And when you returned to Washington he gave you the documents that had been pulled?  A. That's correct.  Q. And told you that some of them were problematic?  A. Yes.  Q. And you, then, made a list of the ones that were problematic?  A. Well, I went through and read them all and had my own judgments about which were of concern and I did make a list of those, yes.  . . .  Q. And it lists six documents by the number in which they were filed in N.S.C. files?  A. Yes sir.  . . .  Q. And this is one of the ones. which you found to be problematical?  A. Yes.  Q. And this is a memorandum from North to you, I take it?  A. Yes.  Q. Dated March 5, 1985?  A. Yes sir.  A WISH LIST  Q. And so this is the second time that you were reading it. August of 1985 was the second time? . . .  A. Probably so.  Q. I take it what Mr. North is trying to do here is to reward a certain Central American country for assistance that it had provided to the contras in obtaining arms?  A. . . . Yes, for me to ask Cabinet officers and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs whether they thought Guatemala was deserving of foreign aid was a reasonable thing to do. On its merits it was worth endorsing. In March, when it came across, I don't recall having gotten, paying attention to it at all. When it came up in August, I do recall saying that this is just one more, kind of, example of hyperbole where innocent propositions are given a rather lurid kind of cast that was just not true.  . . .  Q. And he says so here . . . the real purpose of your memo is to find a way by which we can compensate the Central American country for the extraordinary assistance they are providing to the Nicaraguan freedom fighters?  A. Yes.  Q. Then he goes on to say . . . are end-user certificates which the Central American country provided for the purchase of nearly $8 million worth of munitions to be delivered to the F.D.N.?  A. Yes.  Q. And an end-user certificate, I take it, is a certificate that states the actual final user of munitions?  A. That's correct.  Q. And in this case, this Central American country was not the final user of the munitions?  A. Yes.  Q. So the end-user certificates were false?  A. That's right. . . .  Q. And I take it that North's purpose here is to reward the Central American country for having provided these false end-user certificates.  A. I think that's true. . . .  Q. . . . I take it it's fair to say that Mr. North was in touch with people from that Central American country?  A. Yes.  Q. And indeed he had obtained what he refers to in this memorandum as a wish list from that country?  A. Yes.  . . .  Q. O.K. The wish list is . . . a list of various kinds of military equipment that this country wants?  A. Yes.  Q. And North had obtained that wish list?  A. Yes.  . . .  AID AS REWARD  Q. And what he's writing to, he's asking you if you will make a recommendation to the Secretaries of Defense and State that this Central American country be rewarded?  A. No, I don't think that's quite accurate. He is asking that I ask them for their views on whether this country merits the aid, I believe.  Q. Well, I, it, he's asking you to send a memorandum which recommends that they be given some aid?  A. Yes. And I felt that way. I didn't feel that way because they were giving support to the contras alone, although, gosh, that certainly wouldn't disqualify them from aid.  Q. . . . And you did eventually send that memorandum?  A. Yes.  . . .  Q. And, ah, he says in his memo to you at the top of page 2, your memo does not refer to the arrangements which have been made for supporting the resistance, referring to the Nicaraguan resistance, I take it?  A. Yes.  Q. And, in fact, your memorandum did not make any such reference?  A. No.  . . .  'YOUR BEST SHOT'  Q. I'm going to switch back now to the subject we were on just before we broke for lunch, and this has to do with inquiries that were made of you by various committees of the House of Representatives concerning support of the contras. **********And you've indicated that this subject and episode are not perhaps your favorite, and it is not my intention unnecessarily to have you repeat testimony you gave yesterday, but this is a matter of concern to the House of Representatives which as - A. Listen, Mr. Nields, you're being terribly kind. And during the break, I had the misfortune to turn on the television whereupon a young woman was describing that I was a rather fragile flower that had to be catered to. That's nonsense. Shoot your best shot.  . . .  THE BOLAND ISSUE  RICHARD LEON. I believe we met once before. And by way of reintroduction, I'm the deputy chief minority counsel and this is the opportunity that I have on behalf of the minority to question you. . . . **********I believe you pointed out at the outset of your testimony that you told your aides at the N.S.C. very early on that they were not under any way, shape or form to violate the law. And the law, I believe, that you had in mind specifically when you directed them was the Boland amendment?  A. That's correct. . . .  Q. I believe Mr. Nields just had you point out that you testified this past December . . . upon the questioning of Congressman Cheney, that the Boland amendment applied to the N.S.C.?  A. Yes, that's correct. . . .  Q. Now, let me ask you a few questions with respect to your formation of that opinion, Mr. McFarlane. Because you've testified here today that you thought perhaps you'd been a little too categorical in some of your answers to Congress on other occasions . . . Let me ask you if perhaps your position as the applicability of the Boland amendment to the N.S.C. might also be a bit too categorical . . . You're not a lawyer, are you?  A. No, sir.  Q. And have you ever studied the Boland amendment from a Constitutional perspective?  A. No, sir.  . . .  Q. Was there anybody in your staff at the N.S.C. that you turned to at the time Boland had been adopted to give you a legal analysis of the Boland Amendment from the point of view of its applicability to the N.S.C.?  A. No.  . . .  Q. . . . Between that point in time and your leaving your post as N.S.C. director to the President, did you at any time request from the White House counsel a legal opinion, either in writing or orally, evaluating Boland's applicability to the N.S.C.?  A. No.  Q. Did you ever make a request of that nature to the Department of Justice, in specific its Office of Legal Counsel? . . .  A. No, I didn't.  Q. Are you aware that there are differences of opinion among legal scholars as to the applicability of the Boland amendment to the N.S.C.?  A. Yes.  Q. Have you ever heard those articulated?  A. Yes.  Q. O.K. And is it your position today that you disagree with the position of those who argue that it doesn't apply to the N.S.C.?  A. Mr. Leon, this is a very curious exchange. Now here you are trying to be helpful to me, I can see, but as a practical matter I just answered 20 questions in the negative. And the average viewer assumes that anybody who says no that many times in a row must be evil. Now, in fact, I -  Q. There's no intention to make you look evil, Mr. McFarlane.  A. No. I apologize; I don't mean to be silly. I was accepting that the law applied to the N.S.C. and that we must obey it. Because, I think, in good faith, when you deal with the Congress, you must reach conclusions based upon your own personal dialogue with people who have written the legislation. **********And even though it may not be perfect, if you know because you have been told by Dante Fascell: ''Goddam it, don't raise money'' - you better not raise money.  . . .  THE SECOND GIFT  Q. Now, as I recall your testimony, when you first learned of that country's decision to give more money, double its contribution from the prior year, when you first learned of that, you were the, my understanding of your testimony was you were the first to learn that. Is that correct?  A. That's likely, I think. Yes.  Q. O.K. Before accepting it from that country, in light of the risks that Boland might present, did you decide to find out from anybody in the Administration as to whether or not it should be accepted before first assessing the legal consequences of accepting it?  A. No. At the time, to me, it did seem to be a clear case of a voluntary chipping in or a donation by this party.  Q. So you didn't see any legal, you didn't perceive any legal problem with respect to accepting the gift at that time?  A. No I didn't.  . . .  Q. And you informed the President, with regard to that second gift, again, in writing in a note to his, to his book?  A. Yes, I believe so.  Q. . . . Was the reason why you informed him in that manner in any way because you were concerned about the legality of, of your conduct vis-a-vis that contribution?  A. Not at all. I informed him because I had no way of knowing whether he knew about it or not. I had no reason for knowing whether it came up in the conversation that he had had. And apparently there may have been some ambiguity in what I said yesterday on that score. **********I didn't intend to imply that in that meeting the President raised this issue with the head of state of the other government. I know for a fact he did not.  Q. O.K. And how is it that you know for a fact he did not?  A. Because I had occasion to check on this when I was asked about it six weeks ago during these investigative proceedings. And all I knew, or my basis for knowing, was the debrief that I got at the end of the meeting from the President in which he made no mention of this subject having come up. **********And so, based on that, my own opinion was he did not. But I didn't know whether there might have been something else in his diary and I was informed that there was by a senior White House official but that it had not been raised by the President.  . . .  ACTING AS A SHIELD  PAUL S. SARBANES. Would you say that generally speaking you had a greater respect for the Congress and the need to deal with it in a straightforward way?  A. Senator, I think that's totally self-serving. I think the Director was a man of greater loyalty to his President than anybody I've ever seen, and a man of considerable intellect and skill, and who has done enormous good for his agency and this country, and I think his qualities are not diminished by whatever I say.  . . .  Q. In all of this, who or what were you trying to shield, or protect?  A. Very likely myself, my reputation, my own record of performance.  Q. And only that?  A. Well, I believe, Senator Sarbanes, that President Reagan's motives and direction to his subordinates throughout this enterprise has always been in keeping with the law and national values. I don't think he is at fault here.

Mr. Reagan's review of **********East-West affairs was far more balanced than those he used to deliver on the subject four or even two years ago. But it reflected ingrained skepticism about the possibility of doing business with the Kremlin, even at a time when arms negiotiations seem to be going well and the new Soviet policy of glasnost, or openness, seems to some Western analysts to offer rich opportunities. **********''While talking about reforms at home, the Soviet Union has stepped up its efforts to impose a failed system on others,'' the President declared. But only a few sentences later he added: ''We are also seeing a new Soviet leadership that appears more willing to address the problems that have divided East and West so long and to seek agreements based on mutual benefit.'' **********Mr. Reagan made only a passing reference to this morning's statement by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, in which Mr. Kohl said that if Moscow and Washington reached an agreement on medium-range missiles, West Germany would dismantle its Pershing 1A missiles. Those weapons have been described by Soviet spokesmen as the principal impediment to a treaty on medium-range missiles, but the President called the issue an ''artificial obstacle'' that was ''without foundation.'' Meeting Not Mentioned **********Nor was there any mention of any early meeting between Mr. Reagan and the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Mr. Gorbachev has reportedly been considering attending the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly next month, and The Los Angeles Times, in a report later denied by the White House, said on Sunday that the two men would meet then. **********It appears that the Administration wants to see further progress at the Geneva arms-control talks before conceding that an agreement is near and before beginning to talk openly about the prospect of a Gorbachev visit, still widely anticipated in Washington, possibly late in November. **********Early this month, a senior Soviet arms negotiator, Aleksei A. Obukhov, said his country would consider a proposal under which the Pershings would be scrapped when obsolete. A Propaganda Victory **********Some Administration policy makers said, however, that they were puzzled and irritated by Mr. Kohl's move, because it appeared to undercut the adamant insistence of the United States that the Pershings were not and could not be part of the Geneva talks because they are not American weapons. Although the West German leader emphasized that agreement would have to be reached at Geneva before he would act, his statement appeared to hand the Russians a propaganda victory. **********Such victories have been coming thick and fast in recent months - so much so that Alton Frye of the Council on Foreign Relations recently compared Mr. Gorbachev to Machiavelli, saying, ''This man is scoring so many points in so many different arenas that it's hard to keep track of them.'' **********Mr. Reagan's entire speech, with its emphasis on the multifaceted relations between Moscow and Washington, appeared to constitute an attempt to regain the propaganda offensive. And in one passage, he overtly acknowledged the problems created by Soviet maneuvering and appealed for help. **********''I think it is vital that Western reporters and editors keep the real record of these negotiations in mind,'' the President said today. ''As soon as the Soviets realize that attempts to manipulate the media on these negotiations will not work, the better the chances are of treaty documents eventually getting signed.'' Official More Optimistic **********In a briefing in Los Angeles before Mr. Reagan spoke, a senior American official sounded a bit more optimistic than the President. He said, for example, that Mr. Gorbachev's steps seemed to suggest that ''he wants some kind of breathing space,'' and this ''does offer opportunities in the arms reduction field.'' The official spoke on the condition he not be named. **********Mr. Reagan, who built his public career as a strong anti-Communist, is said to have become convinced in the last year or so that arms-reduction agreements would earn him a place in history. But old habits die hard, and he began today with a theme that he has used for decades - the alleged perfidy of the Soviet Union in the years after the Yalta agreements. His words were gentler, but the armature of dislike and distrust remained intact. **********The new proposals in the speech were challenges, almost taunts, that no one in the Administration expects the Soviet Union to accept anytime soon. The President suggested to the Soviet leadership that it publish a valid military budget, reveal the size and composition of its armed forces and foster debate in the Supreme Soviet on the issues of military policy and weapons, three steps that not even glasnost is likely to bring about. **********Mr. Reagan acknowledged that ''there is hope'' in the changes in the Soviet Union, which he described, choosing a notably neutral adjective, as ''interesting.'' But he insisted on holding the Soviet leaders to the Western standards they have always rejected, asserting that ''real democracy,'' with elements such as ''orderly debate and meaningful votes,'' remains a distant prospect for the Soviet people."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/28/business/two-in-japan-seized-over-exports-to-soviet.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 339, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TWO IN JAPAN SEIZED OVER EXPORTS TO SOVIET", "print_headline": "TWO IN JAPAN SEIZED OVER EXPORTS TO SOVIET", "body_text": " **********Two senior executives of a top Japanese machine tool maker were arrested today after being accused of illegally exporting high-technology equipment to the Soviet Union, the police said. **********The executives, Ryuzo Hayashi, 52 years old, a director of the Toshiba Machine Company, and Hiroaki Tanimura, 50, a deputy director, were arrested while being questioned at police headquarters here. **********They are accused of exporting high-technology machine tools capable of making submarine propellers almost silent.

But if Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is forced into early retirement, as seems increasingly possible, Morioka and the rest of Iwate Prefecture is where his downward slide began. **********Around the country, Japanese speak of ''Iwate shock,'' a phrase symbolizing the strong, widening opposition to the Prime Minister's plans for a new 5 percent sales tax. Antitax sentiment is so powerful that in local election campaigns that began nationwide today, candidates from Mr. Nakasone's Liberal-Democratic Party are looking nervously over their shoulders to see if the opposition is gaining. Iwate set the tone. Liberal Democrats are not supposed to lose in this conservative alcove of northern Honshu. But on March 8 the party's candidate, Rei Isurugi, failed to succeed her late husband in a special election for Parliament's upper house. **********Mrs. Isurugi did not just lose; she was humiliated. The Socialist candidate, Jinichi Ogawa, won by an unthinkable margin of more than 2 to 1. Tax Plan Is Blamed **********In Morioka, the Nakasone tax plan was immediately blamed. ''The process of creating this tax was arrogant,'' said Tokusuke Kawamura, president of the Chamber of Commerce. **********Since the ''Iwate shock,'' the Prime Minister's political standing has steadily plunged, raising questions about whether he can hang on to his office until his scheduled departure in October. **********''Voter consciousness has changed,'' said Eiichi Sakashita, a Socialist Party strategist in Morioka. ''There's a feeling that they can affect national policy - that they have more control.'' **********Now another campaign has begun, and with it another test for the Prime Minister. This is for local elections to be held simultaneously across Japan on April 12. From early this morning, candidates for Iwate's municipal assemblies rode blaring sound trucks through the rice fields, still brown before the start of the spring planting season. Offsetting Reductions Dangled **********For sure, they talked about local issues, like controversial plans for a new highway. But right behind loomed the tax. **********To make his plan more palatable, the Prime Minister has dangled offsetting reductions in personal and corporate income taxes. No one talks about the cuts, though. Only the tax increases get attention - in Washington as well as here. **********On Thursday, the United States Trade Representative, Clayton K. Yeutter, expressed unhappiness with the Nakasone program on the ground that taxes undercut American wishes for Japan to stimulate its economy. Mr. Yeutter's comments were attacked today by senior Japanese officials, some of whom accused him of interfering in a domestic matter. **********But Mr. Nakasone has displeased people closer to home as well, and in Iwate even fellow Liberal Democrats have abandoned him. **********Just before special election last month, the local party placed an advertisement praising the sales tax in the Iwate Nippo newspaper. Four days after Mrs. Isurugi's defeat, it took out another advertisement, a full-page screamer in huge type that listed five reasons why the tax was a bad idea. 'Voters Seem to Understand' **********''We had to respond sincerely and quickly to voters' attitudes,'' said Masaru Sato, an official in the re-election campaign of the two-term prefectural Governor, Tadashi Nakamura. ''Voters seem to understand us now.'' That brought a polite hoot from Mr. Sakashita, the Socialist official. ''I have a good feeling about this race, more than I ever have,'' he said. **********The tax issue has made an invisible man of Mr. Nakasone. With the Prime Minister's ratings in opinon polls at a record low, Liberal Democrats across Japan have asked him to stay out of their districts during the campaign. **********At Socialist headquarters in Morioka, walls are plastered with posters of the gubernatorial candidate, Setsuro Takahashi, and also of the party's national chairman, Takako Doi, who has campaigned here twice and refers to the Prime Minister as ''Mr. Tax Hiker.'' In Liberal Democratic offices, Mr. Nakasone's picture is nowhere to be seen. Complexity Is a Problem **********A big problem for many Japanese is the complexity of the tax program. There are 51 categories of exemptions, including food and beverages, but details can be puzzling. **********Tickets for traditional Kabuki theater would not be taxed, but performances of rakugo, a venerable story-telling art, would be. Since medical care is excluded, a person can be born tax-free at Morioka's Red Cross Hospital. The same cannot be said for when he finally needs the services of the Fujisawa Funeral Home. **********The tax, intended to bring in $40 billion a year, would affect only 13 percent of Japan's businesses - those with annual revenue of more than 100 million yen, or about $685,000. But those big companies enjoy a disproportionately large share of total sales, and they will pass along the tax to small retailers and consumers. **********Political analysts predict that Mr. Nakasone will eventually get his way, but he will probably first have to modify the tax or delay its effective date. On Thursday, Mr. Nakasone himself hinted as much in Tokyo. **********Meanwhile, Morioka forecasters say that normalcy will return and that the incumbent Governor, Mr. Nakamura, will win again. But no one seems willing to bet on it, and, a newspaper editor said, ''If Nakamura does lose, Nakasone may have no choice but to step down right away.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/02/world/abrams-today-what-to-look-for.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Engelberg", "pub_date": "1987-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 649, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ABRAMS TODAY: WHAT TO LOOK FOR", "print_headline": "ABRAMS TODAY: WHAT TO LOOK FOR", "body_text": " **********Friends of Elliott Abrams, the State Department's combative Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs, say he has an unusual zest for a good argument. **********Those skills are likely to put to the sternest test of Mr. Abrams's State Department career when he appears Tuesday before the Congressional committees investigating the Iran-contra affair. **********Members of the committees say they are preparing to ask Mr. Abrams sharp questions about whether he misled Congress, the Tower Commission and the American people over the Reagan Administration's links to a private aid network for the Nicaraguan rebels - and his own. **********Mr. Abrams has insisted since one of the supply planes was shot down last October that he had only a vague idea that Lieut.

Walsh, the special prosecutor, is already studying previous Congressional testimony by Mr. Abrams to determine whether he lied to Congress or took part in a conspiracy to violate Federal laws. **********Mr. Abrams, 39 years old, is one of the most active defenders of the contra program. Trained as a lawyer, he was named to the senior post on Central America policy in 1985, the third person to hold the position under President Reagan. **********Administration officials say his two predecessors, Thomas Enders, and Langhorne Motley, left because they were too willing to take seriously the Administration's stated ''two track'' policy of both pressuring the Sandinistas and negotiating with them. **********No one has ever made that complaint about Mr. Abrams. Indeed, one issue likely to be raised in the hearings is his zeal for defending the contras, even in the face of more skeptical analyses by the State Department's own Bureau of Intelligence and Research. Name Keeps Coming Up **********Mr. Abrams's name has been mentioned by several witnesses before the committee. Joe Fernandez, the former C.I.A. station chief in Costa Rica who has been identified by the pseudonym Tomas Castillo, said Mr. Abrams was one of the few Government officials who knew about the secret airstrip being built in Costa Rica. **********Lewis Tambs, the former Ambassador to Costa Rica, said he believed his contacts with contras were approved by the Restricted Inter-Agency Group, or R.I.G., that was chaired by Mr. Abrams. Gen. John Singlaub, a retired officer who worked with the contras, said Mr. Abrams encouraged him 1986 when he set out to solicit money for the contras from countries in Asia. **********Moreover, Administration officials say that Colonel North and Mr. Abrams were ideological soulmates who maintained a close personal and working relationship and they wonder how it could be possible that Mr. Abrams did not know about the contra aid network. **********Yet, that is exactly what Mr. Abrams has contended from Oct. 5, the date when a cargo plane carrying the American crewman Eugene Hasenfus was shot down over Nicaragua. As reports appeared in the press suggesting that the Administration had helped organize the supply mission, Mr. Abrams grew irate, and even called senior editors at newspapers asking that his response be printed. He Calls Enterprise Private **********In one interview arising from this effort, he told a reporter that the supply operations were completely private, declaring, ''People are entitled to believe the Government is constantly lying to them, but it isn't.'' **********Testimony before the Iran-contra committees has since demonstrated that American Government officials, including Colonel North and officers in the Central Intelligence Agency were directly involved in the supply network."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/06/business/chrysler-completes-acquisition-of-amc.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Ross", "pub_date": "1987-08-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 354, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chrysler Completes Acquisition of A.M.C.", "print_headline": "Chrysler Completes Acquisition of A.M.C.", "body_text": " **********The Chrysler Corporation acquired the American Motors Corporation this afternoon, hours after A.M.C.'s shareholders approved the merger. **********The demise of the smallest of the four American-owned auto manufacturers represented the first consolidation in the domestic industry since 1954, when A.M.C. was created by a merger of the Nash-Kelvinator Corporation and the Hudson Motor Car Company. **********Chrysler's cost for the deal, including the assumption of debts, has been estimated at $1.5 billion.

Cholesterol and Heart Attacks **********Malaysia, which produces about 60 percent of the world's palm oil, regards the Tropical Oils Labeling Bills - which also cover palm kernel oil and coconut oil - as largely an effort by the American Soybean Association, also a producer of edible seed oils, to block competition. **********In the United States, the Center for Science in the Public Interest and other consumer and health groups have also called for the specific labeling of the three tropical oils as saturated fats. **********Saturated fats - which, like butter, are usually solid at room temperature - are important in raising blood cholesterol levels. Unsaturated fats found in most vegetable oils, which are liquid at room temperature, help to lower blood cholesterol. High cholesterol levels in the blood can cause heart attacks and strokes. **********Concerns about the dangers of high cholesterol have been growing. Earlier this month, the American Government and more than 20 health groups issued the nation's first guidelines for identifying and treating people with high blood cholesterol levels. The action could affect more than 40 million people in the United States. 'Fat Fighter' Kits **********In this environment, the Soybean Association has mounted a vigorous advertising campaign against tropical oils. ''Fat fighter'' kits distributed by the association show a portly planter on his veranda and coconuts labeled with health-warnings. Diplomats here describe the association's campaign as crude and clearly aimed against the tropical developing countries. The advertisements provoked a demonstration at the United States Embassy here last month. **********About 13 percent of Malaysia's 16 million people make their livelihood from palm oil, one of more than a dozen edible oilseeds used worldwide. Others are soybean, cottonseed, corn, peanut, sunflower, rapeseed, sesame, olive, linseed, castor bean, coconut and palm kernel. Palm oil and rubber, both plantation crops, cover more than half of Malaysia's arable land and bring in a fifth of the country's non-petroleum export earnings. **********Malaysia, a rapidly developing Southeast Asian nation, hopes to expand its sales of palm oil outside the region as prices begin to rise after a 1986 slump. Most of the exported oil becomes a food additive, used in such products as nondairy creamers. **********Although only about 4 percent of Malaysian exports go to the United States, officials here are aware that American food labeling has a worldwide impact, affecting sales in other countries. The Malaysian Message **********A Malaysian team of experts, headed by Augustine Ong, director general of the country's Palm Oil Research Institute, is now in the United States in an attempt to demonstrate that American health fears about palm oil are based on outdated or incomplete evidence. The delegation also hopes to persuade American researchers to conduct more tests on the oil-palm fruit. Malaysia has limited money for such work. **********The Malaysian message for Americans is that palm oil is ''cholesterol-free'' and has not been conclusively proved to behave like a saturated fat in humans. European research is used to support this claim. **********Malaysian Government officials and diplomats here said that recent testimony in Washington by an official of the Food and Drug Adminstration bolstered their arguments. On Sept. 11, Richard J. Ronk, acting director of the F.D.A.'s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, told a House subcommittee that more research was needed on the effects that several major fats and oils in the American diet have on blood cholesterol. According to a transcript of his comments before the Agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains, he also said that tropical oils cannot be classified together because their actions are distinctly different. **********Athough the Malaysians acknowledge that palm oil, extracted from the fleshy fruit of the tree, is a saturated fat - with a 50 percent content -they contend it is not comparable to palm kernel oil, extracted from the nut of the same fruit, which has an 86 percent saturated fat content; or coconut oil, with a fat content of 92 percent. Claims and Counterclaims **********The Palm Oil Research Institute here also holds that the oil palm fruit is a source of carotene and vitamin E, and may in fact reduce blood clotting that can lead to strokes. **********Experts in Malaysia - and the Philippines, a leading coconut oil producer - say they question why heart disease is not unusually high in their countries, where these oils are regularly consumed in larger quantities than in the buyer nations. **********An American Soybean Association position paper, ''Domestic Oils Vs. Tropical Fats'' takes issue with these claims. **********The association contends that palm oil contains four times the cholesterol-producing saturated fat as soybean oil. It also argues that European research showing that palm oil does not elevate blood cholesterol has been discredited. It says that the carotene content of palm oil is destroyed in refining. Changes in the Law **********The Tropical Oils Labeling Bills now before Congress would amend the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in the following ways: *********** ''Disjunctive'' labeling of tropical oils would be prohibited. It is now permissible for a manufacturer to say that a product ''may contain one of the following,'' and then list a number of fats. *********** The words ''a saturated fat'' would be required to follow palm, palm kernel or coconut oil in a list of ingredients. *********** Foods using tropical oils would be required to have labels identifying them as ''saturated fats'' and list the fat and saturated fat contents per serving. **********The Malaysians have apparently received some support from the Reagan Administration. **********Melvin Searls, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for East Asia and the Pacific, said recently that the Administration believes the proposals to label palm oil as a saturated fat ''are not desirable from a trade standpoint.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/12/business/market-place-small-issues-gaining-favor.html": {"writer_name": "Lawrence Demaria", "pub_date": "1987-06-12", "snippet": "LEAD: DESPITE - or perhaps because of - the fact that the stock market has started edging toward its high-water mark again, many investors who burned their fingers in the increasingly risky ''trading market'' of recent months are turning their att...", "word_count": 888, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MARKET PLACE;\nSmall Issues Gaining Favor", "print_headline": "MARKET PLACE;\nSmall Issues Gaining Favor", "body_text": " **********LEAD: DESPITE - or perhaps because of - the fact that the stock market has started edging toward its high-water mark again, many investors who burned their fingers in the increasingly risky ''trading market'' of recent months are turning their attention to secondary issues. **********DESPITE - or perhaps because of - the fact that the stock market has started edging toward its high-water mark again, many investors who burned their fingers in the increasingly risky ''trading market'' of recent months are turning their attention to secondary issues. **********One reason is the stock market's volatility, especially in the blue chips with big institutional followings.

The stock, which trades over the counter, is going for $33.50 a share. Martha G. Locke, the Advest analyst in Boston, who follows Society, said the bank had restructured to absorb its biggest acquisition - and one-time Ohio competitor bank - the Centram Corporation. Society now has $9 billion in assets, $6.9 billion in deposits and branches in Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Akron and Cincinnati. In addition to ''a high-quality loan portfolio'' of $5.3 billion, Ms. Locke noted, Society has a conservative management. ''If they err in anything,'' she said, ''it is in possibly being too conservative.'' If Society succeeds in new marketing programs, she added, ''just modest growth in loans should translate into higher income because of strict cost controls.'' Ms. Locke is predicting that Society will earn $3.75 a share for 1987 and $4.14 in 1988 as the bank builds market share and increases lending activity. It earned $3.43 a share in 1986. *********** La Petite Academy: Mr. Huber of Piper, Jaffray said that this large operator of day care centers in 27 states, mostly in the South, Southwest and West, traditionally posts its strongest earnings in the second half. The company, which closed at $17.25 in over-the-counter trading yesterday, earned 48 cents a share in 1986. Saul Yaari, who follows La Petite for Piper, said he expects the company to earn 65 cents this year and 85 cents in 1988. The stock does carry a lofty price-earnings ratio, he acknowledged, but he said its growth rate would justify it. La Petite now has about 550 centers and 50,000 children enrolled. Mr. Yaari said the increasing movement of mothers into the work force, combined with rising insurance costs that will drive ''Mom and Pop and neighborhood'' centers out of the business, will work to La Petite's advantage. And touching on a sensitive subject in the industry, Mr. Yaari said that La Petite's approach of having large, open rooms for its children ''reduces the chance for abuse.'' *** ***********Chambers Development: Thomas Bailey of the Janus Fund in Denver noted that this waste management concern, which owns a landfill in Pennsylvania, recently signed a $50 million contract to handle waste from Passaic County in New Jersey. ''There is a real capacity shortage in the landfill business, especially in the Northeast,'' Mr. Bailey said, adding that he expects Chambers to earn $1 a share in 1987 and $1.75 in 1988. In 1986 the company earned 59 cents a share. Chambers closed yesterday on the American Stock Exchange at $35.75. *********** Circus Circus Enterprises: Roger Engemann, chairman of the Pasedena Growth Fund in California, expects this casino company to earn $1.50 a share in 1988 and $1.88 in 1989. In its latest fiscal year, which ended Jan. 31, the company earned $1 a share. Circus Circus owns five casinos (three of which are tied to hotels) in Las Vegas, Reno and Laughlin, Nev. It also owns the Colorado Belle, a new hotel-casino complex that is scheduled to be operating soon, and its 1,200 additional rooms, Mr. Engemann says, should bolster earnings.

''Efforts to improve living standards,'' the report asserted, ''are themselves beginning to threaten the health of the global economy.

Damage From Fossil Fuels **********The report noted that much of the world's economic growth over the last century has been based on the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. But that activity, it asserted, was changing the atmosphere to the point where the global climate was expected to shift drastically in the next century, requiring vast adjustments in agriculture and other activities that will cost billions of dollars. **********The report also said that although overall world agricultural production has been growing, it has been declining in many countries, particularly in Africa, because of soil erosion and the spread of deserts. Even in the United States, fully a sixth of the grain harvest comes from eroding lands or draws on diminishing sources of ground water for irrigation, and so cannot be sustained over the long run, according to the report. **********The destruction of forests, in addition to accelerating the extinction of species, is having a heavy impact on underdeveloped countries such as India that depend on firewood for fuel, the report went on. **********The report also addresses the future of nuclear energy in the wake of the explosion and fire last year at the Chernobyl power plant in the Soviet Union. The report concluded that the accident was pushing many countries to gradually phase out plans to rely heavily on nuclear power for future energy needs - a path some nations had embarked on even before the Chernobyl disaster. **********It also said that the world was becoming divided along demographic lines, with the developed countries having stabilized population growth and most of the underdeveloped nations moving toward explosive expansion. **********Mr. Brown said that the instability caused by many of these trends in areas such as Central America and Africa was of major political significance to the United States. **********The report said the time has come for political leaders at the highest levels to address these problems. ''The course corrections needed to restore a worldwide improvement in the human condition have no precedent,'' it said. **********It added: ''No generation has ever faced such a complex set of issues requiring immediate attention. Preceding generations have always been concerned about the future, but we are the first to be faced with decisions that will determine whether the earth our children inherit will be inhabitable.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/12/business/egypt-lets-currency-float-down.html": {"writer_name": "John Kifner", "pub_date": "1987-05-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 478, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EGYPT LETS CURRENCY FLOAT DOWN", "print_headline": "EGYPT LETS CURRENCY FLOAT DOWN", "body_text": " **********Egypt announced a limited reform of its multitiered currency exchange rate today in the hope of satisfying International Monetary Fund requirements for assistance in repaying its $38.6 billion foreign debt. **********The long-awaited move effectively floats a portion of Egypt's currency dealings to the unofficial, but tolerated, street rate.

Wall Street analysts expect the chain to record sales of about $2.24 billion this year, a 30 percent increase from 1986. Its earnings will jump at least 25 percent from its 1986 net of $152 million, they predict. 'The Place Explodes' **********At the 46,000-square-foot store in Valley Stream, eager shoppers were lined up one recent morning even before it opened at 8 o'clock, and continued to flow in until midnight, when it closed. **********''The place explodes,'' said Brian Ehlin, the director of the Valley Stream store. **********Although manufacturers have introduced some new products in recent weeks (including Coleco Industries' Couch Potato and Talking Cabbage Patch doll and Fisher-Price's camera-video recorder), this year has been exceptional for the dearth of exciting new toys. There are no hot new items comparable to the Trivial Pursuit of the 1984 season, the Cabbage Patch of 1985 and G.I. Joe, Lazer Tag and Barbie doll of 1986. **********''Producers did not invest much in new product development this year because of a so-so 1986 and retailer cautiousness in the early months of this year,'' said Mr. Reysen, the editor of Playthings. A Wide Selection **********But rather than hurting Toys ''R'' Us, the lack of superstar toys seems to help it. If consumers are unsure of what they want to buy, they are more likely to go to a Toys ''R'' Us store because of its wide selection, analysts said. **********''The absence of hot items plays into our hands,'' said Charles Lazarus, the chain's chairman and chief executive. **********According to Toys ''R'' Us data, video game machines are extremely popular this year. Two of the biggest sellers are the Nintendo full entertainment system at $139.99 and the Sega system at $99.99. **********Other high-demand items include Big Bird Story Magic, three talking and movie figures that cost $134.99; Couch Potato, a brown stuffed face and head used as a pillow ($28.99); speaking versions of the Cabbage Patch doll ($89.99), and radio- or remote-control cars, trucks and construction vehicles that go for as much as $200. Prices Are Up **********Toys ''R'' Us is using a new electronic-scanning cash register system to keep track of what is selling and to reduce checkout lines. The computerized system, which has been installed in 95 percent of the toy stores, has enabled the chain to increase its checkout speed by more than 30 percent, according to Michael Goldstein, the company's executive vice president and chief financial officer. **********At the Valley Stream store, some customers said that prices this year seemed to be up about 10 percent from 1986. But even higher prices were not causing these consumers to trim their spending plans or to take their business elsewhere. **********''I know that things are overpriced, including toys, but I don't have time to shop anywhere else,'' said Lorraine James of Brooklyn, who was shopping with her 13-year old daughter, Sabrinya. **********William Lee, a bus driver from Ridgewood, Queens, who was in the store with his wife, Elizabeth, added, ''Prices are up but it isn't stopping us from buying what we want.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/13/business/company-news-sematech-gets-250-million-budget.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 187, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sematech Gets $250 Million Budget", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Sematech Gets $250 Million Budget", "body_text": " **********The organizers of Sematech, the consortium of semiconductor companies acting to improve chip manufacturing technologies, said yesterday that a $250 million-a-year budget for the effort had been approved. **********Under the business plan, Sematech would raise about half of the funds from the industry and seek the rest from Federal and state governments.

It later said he was in ''satisfactory'' condition after the removal of two bullets from his head. **********The police refused to give further information, and no arrests were reported. **********The assassination attempt against Mr. Parejo, whose predecessor as Justice Minister was killed on orders of cocaine traffickers in April 1984, appeared to confirm a dramatic new escalation in Colombia's drug war. **********This afternoon, the local office of Agence France-Presse said it received a call from a so-called Hernan Botero Moreno Command, which claimed to have shot ''the traitor Parejo'' on behalf of those whose extradition is being sought by the United States. **********Only last month, President Virgilio Barco Vargas ordered a new offensive against the multibillion-dollar narcotics trade after the slaying here of Guillermo Cano Isaza, who was the publisher of El Espectador, Bogota's second largest newspaper, and a strong critic of drug operators. **********Since then, the authorities say army and police units have carried out 1,198 raids and arrested 783 suspects, including three who are on a list of 113 reported traffickers whose extradition has been requested by the United States. None of the half-dozen biggest traffickers, however, has been caught. **********As part of the new offensive and in apparent response to death threats against civilian judges involved in drug cases, the Government has authorized military tribunals to try people charged with drug-related crimes. **********Although the country's former President, Belisario Betancur, declared war against narcotics early in 1984, Colombian operators still supply about 80 percent of the world's cocaine and continue to control much of the distribution network inside the United States. **********As the Colombian authorities have increased their pressure on the cocaine underworld, however, drug-related violence here has increased, with some 30 judges, 20 journalists and numerous police all killed in the aftermath of the killing of Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla in 1984. **********But on two occasions, leading traffickers also offered to repatriate several billion dollars to help pay off the country's foreign debt if the Government would renounce Colombia's 1979 extradition treaty with the United States, under which 13 Colombians have already been sent for trial in the United States. **********When the Betancur Government refused to revoke the treaty, the traffickers reportedly focused their threats and offers of bribes on the country's Supreme Court, which reviews all extradition requests. **********In his new post as Justice Minister, Mr. Parejo nonetheless continued to work closely with United States drug enforcement authorities. Having faced numerous threats against his life, he left Colombia for his post in Budapest on Aug. 8. **********Diplomats here said that, while Mr. Barco had promised to continue President Betancur's anti-drug drive, this did not appear to be one of his priorities during his first three months in office. **********Early December, however, in what some political commentators saw as a victory for narcotics traffickers, the Supreme Court declared the extradition treaty with the United States to be unconstitutional since it had not been signed by the President. **********On Dec. 14, Mr. Barco signed the treaty, which immediately went back into effect."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/03/business/company-briefs-984087.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 250, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Ameribanc Investors Group, Washington, and Cardinal Federal Savings and Loan Association, Cleveland, said the proposed acquisition of Cardinal by Ameribanc had been terminated by mutual agreement. *********** Basix Corp., a holding company, said it had agreed in principle to sell the stock of its Automatic Toll Systems Inc. subsidiary to Cubic Corp. for about $26 million. *********** W.

Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., said much of this increase seemed to reflect the Labor Department's problem, common in September, of adjusting motor vehicle prices for end-of-model-year liquidation allowances and other factory-financed sales incentives. This year, these incentives were lower than usual. **********As a result, the price of passenger cars jumped 3.6 percent last month after declining 1.8 percent in August. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Harris said that reports by corporate purchasing agents and anecdotal evidence suggested that prices might be rising ''a bit faster'' than the statistics showed and that some producers might be buying raw materials in anticipation of further price increases. **********The three-tenths of 1 percent increase in the finished goods index, often referred to as the P.P.I., represented no substantial acceleration in prices from the average of the first eight months of the year.

Prices rose for fresh fruits and vegetables; pork, beef and veal; eggs and dairy products, and shortening and cooking oil. Processed poultry and roasted coffee prices turned down and the price of fish fell much less than in August, according to the report. **********On the other hand, the price of finished energy goods dropped 3.7 percent after rising 1.5 percent in both July and August.

Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, and John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, amounts to an ultimatum: Either end subsidies worldwide, or the United States will apply them with a vengeance. **********Backers maintain that the American farmer wins either way: If subsidies persist abroad, the legislation would nullify their effects; in a subsidy-free environment, American agriculture, acknowledged to be highly productive, should thrive. **********Initial foreign comment was guarded. ''I can't see it doing world markets much good,'' said Derwent Renshaw, the agricultural counselor at the European Community office here.

Through a system of marketing loans applied to these crops, farmers would be able to sell them at depressed world market prices and still maintain or even enhance their income. **********''We've bargained long enough for no results,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Agriculture Committee. ''It's time to send our negotiators to the table with some real leverage to back up our rhetoric.'' **********Marketing loans for rice and cotton were put into effect under the 1985 farm bill and have already created large increases in the exports of these commodities. **********But competing exporters have loudly complained.

This weekend, however, some major retail chains reported sales up considerably as the holiday shopping season began. **********Half of 1,553 respondents polled from Nov. 20 to Nov. 24 said the current condition of the economy was fairly good. Four percent described it as very good, 29 percent as fairly bad and 15 percent as very bad. Asked to look to the future, 41 percent said the economy was getting worse, 11 percent said it was getting better and 46 percent said conditions would be stable. Earlier Responses Noted **********The figures are almost identical to those recorded in a New York Times poll taken three weeks earlier in the wake of Wall Street's mid-October nosedive. These responses suggest that Americans have seen nothing in the past few weeks to change their views about the economy, but their answers to several other questions may give retailers and others who rely on consumer confidence reason to worry. **********Although 30 percent of the respondents said their household financial condition was getting better while 18 percent said it was getting worse, just 17 percent said they planned to spend more on Christmas gifts this year and 32 percent said they would cut back. **********The margin of sampling error in the poll is plus or minus 3 percentage points. Virtually No Link to Turmoil **********The cautious attitude toward holiday spending appears to have little if any direct connection to the turmoil in the financial markets. Only 1 percent of those who said they were going to spend less on Christmas this year cited the stock market's plunge. And 46 percent of those who said they planned to spend more also expressed belief that the stock market's decline would lead to hard times. **********Forty-three percent of the respondents who plan to spend less on Christmas this year said they did not have enough money, 22 percent cited ''life style changes'' such as divorce, retirement or having a baby, and 13 percent said prices were too high. Seven percent blamed unemployment for their belt-tightening plans. **********While few respondents said there was a link between the stock market's woes and their holiday spending, they split evenly on the question of whether the plunge in stock prices would lead to hard times for the economy. Forty-five percent said yes, 45 percent said no and 10 percent either did not answer or said they did not know. **********In response to a more strongly worded question in the earlier poll, taken Oct. 29 to Nov. 3, that asked whether the stock collapse would lead to a ''recession,'' 31 percent said yes, while 50 percent said no. What Americans Expect **********It is not clear whether the bigger yes response in the latest poll is attributable to growing fears about the fallout from the markets' plunge. Some respondents may foresee a slowdown in growth while doubting that the economy will actually experience enough decline in output to be defined as a recession. **********Not surprisingly, many respondents' views about the economy reflect their own situation. Of the 30 percent who said their finances were improving, 16 percent of them said the economy was getting better and 31 percent said it was getting worse - a 15-point gap. Of the 18 percent who said their situation was getting worse, only 6 percent of them said the economy was improving while 58 percent said it was deteriorating - a 52-point gap. **********Blacks were considerably more pessimistic than whites about the future of the economy. Only 2 percent of blacks said the economy was getting better and 53 percent said it was getting worse, while 12 percent of whites saw improvement and 39 percent were expecting it to worsen. Comparisons by Category **********Ten percent of women and 12 percent of men expect the economy to improve. Forty-six percent of women said the economy would worsen, compared with 35 percent of the men. **********The political split was somewhat sharper. Just 8 percent of Democrats predicted improvement and 49 percent said the economy would get worse, while 14 percent of Republicans predicted improvement and 28 percent said the economy would get worse. **********The people most likely to say that the stock plunge will lead to hard times were blacks (66 percent, compared with 41 percent of whites), women (49 percent, compared with 41 percent of men), Westerners (55 percent, compared with 43 percent of people who live in other regions), Democrats (51 percent, compared with 48 percent of political independents and 34 percent of Republicans), and those with family incomes under $25,000 (52 percent, compared with 40 percent for those with incomes over $25,000).  How the Poll Was Taken **********The latest New York Times Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Nov. 20 through Nov. 24 with 1,553 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii. **********The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted residential numbers. **********The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of residential telephones and to adjust for variations relating to region, race, sex, age and education. **********In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by interviewing all adult Americans. The error for smaller subgroups is larger. **********In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/29/business/company-news-marriott-seeks-denny-s-chain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 230, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Marriott Seeks Denny's Chain", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Marriott Seeks Denny's Chain", "body_text": " **********The Marriott Corporation, the big hotel and restaurant operator, said today that it was holding talks to buy Denny's Inc., a 1,200-unit restaurant company, from the investors who took it private two years ago. **********Analysts said the acquisition, if carried out, would make Marriott the leading operator of sit-down, family-style restaurants in America. **********Marriott, which last year paid a little more than $500 million for the Saga Corporation, a food-service and restaurant concern, said in a statement that it was negotiating a definitive agreement with Denny's, based in La Mirada, Calif. **********Marriott would not disclose the proposed price, but James Meyer, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. of Philadelphia, estimated that the deal might be worth at least $800 million. **********In January 1985, in a heavily financed leveraged buyout, Denny's managers paid $753.4 million to take the concern private.

The bogus transactions took place in the first three months of 1986, according to the court paper. **********Mr. Davidoff, who is 43 years old and lives in New Jersey, is cooperating with the continuing investigation of Mr. Boesky's stock-trading activities, according to Anne Ryan, the Assistant United States Attorney handling the case.

The sources added that the plea coincided with increased activity among the investigators recently, which could indicate that other charges may be coming soon. Purported 'Parking' Scheme **********Mr. Davidoff helped Seemala engage in a practice known as ''parking,'' according to the charges. This involves creating documents for a phony transaction to make it appear that stocks have been sold, thus allowing the brokerage to report larger cash holdings than it actually has. Later, the appearance of a reversal of the phony transaction is created. **********The effect is to inflate the amount of capital that the broker reports to regulators, allowing the broker to own larger stock positions than would otherwise be permitted. **********Sources close to the investigation said that Mr. Davidoff ''was just an employee'' carrying out Mr. Boesky's instructions in the violations of the capital-requirement statutes.

City Gets Tough **********But the raid on the Hash Museum, as it is being called, signaled that this city, where ''flower power'' flourished in the 1960's and which became a sanctuary for Bohemian squatters and drug users in the 1970's, is no longer cooperating in its notoriety. **********Three years ago, the city government enacted tighter controls on dealing in hard drugs, including barring more than three loiterers from gathering in the notorious drug and sex district near the central railroad station. **********It also limited the squatter phenomenon by cutting down on vacant buildings and on official generosity toward transient young people who bumble here like bees to pollen. **********''Like all idealistic movements, it got a bit decadent, and things had to change,'' said Gilbert van Stijgeren, the city's spokesman. **********The change was not entirely reactionary, for at the same time the city concluded that its noncriminal approach to the use of soft drugs like marijuana was working. Increasing Penalties **********The national Government in The Hague, although sympathetic to the laissez-faire local approach, began setting tougher prison penalties for traffickers in heroin, cocaine and other hard drugs who are the main target of the police. The sentence for heroin trafficking was tripled, to 12 years, with little chance for parole. Lately, an increasing number of new prison inmates have been found to be addicted to hard drugs. **********The result is a subtly different Amsterdam, according to city and national officials, even if the busloads of middle-class tourists do not quite realize it as they stare at some of the hollow-eyed addicts. **********Officials note several changes in the drug scene in this still proudly tolerant society. **********For one, the hard-drug problem in Amsterdam is becoming stabilized among an aging group of about 8,000 addicts. There are more than 15,000 addicts nationally, and 50 other communities have introduced methadone maintenance programs to ease withdrawal from heroin, in part because Amsterdam is trying to decentralize its problem and send addicts back home. 'Not So Liberal' **********The average age of drug addicts here has increased from 24 to 27, and Dutch officials envision a ''bridging'' process to see them into middle age and possible rehabilitation. **********''We know our image is still bad in other countries and critics say, 'Oh my God, Amsterdam again,' but we are not so liberal as people think,'' said Eddy L. Engelsman, head of alcohol and drug control in the National Ministry of Health. ''We find that with our integrated policy the drug problem is stabilizing or diminishing.'' **********At the same time, the city has closed 90 marijuana cafes in the last two years for violating the Public Prosecutor's ''expediency'' rule by refusing to stay low-key and avoid the use of hard drugs. **********Officials said the cafe experience showed that it did not invite wider use of soft drugs or evolve into experimentation with harder drugs. 'Reefer Madness' **********According to Government data, the number of marijuana users has remained steady in recent decades at about 3 percent of the population. **********A group of aging, baldish British punk bikers loudly consuming hashish and insulting passers-by this week outside a marijuana cafe called the Bulldog seemed engaged in a parody of the film ''Reefer Madness,'' as if they could not stand the official leniency. The larger, younger surrounding crowd was quietly enjoying beer, wine, pastry and marijuana at sidewalk tables. **********The discouragement of foreign hard-drug users also has helped stabilize the drug scene. A strict ''one for the road'' methadone policy is now in force for alien addicts, who are also required to produce a return ticket home. **********Dutch officials, who are regularly criticized by West Germany, where the drug laws are more Draconian, have found a particular problem with Germans addicted to hard drugs fleeing here. The 60 deaths related to hard drugs in the Netherlands last year included 35 visiting Germans. Only 16 of the addicts were Dutch, from a population of 14 million. **********Police officials and other nations regularly criticize the Dutch policies, saying they invite high-volume world drug traffic. But officials here say data on drug seizures show West Germany, for example, has a far larger problem with its other neighbors. Arrests Rising **********The impression is skewed, Dutch officials say, because this is a traditional shipping nation, and for centuries Rotterdam has been one of the world's busiest transshipping ports. **********According to the city police, arrests for trafficking in hard drugs have steadily risen, to 2,468 last year, along with a 30 percent rise in the amount of heroin seized, to about 450 pounds. **********Cocaine is a growing problem, though not considered comparable to heroin addiction. About 180 pounds of cocaine was seized last year, compared with 11 pounds in 1985. **********''We are taking a pragmatic, nonmoralistic, nonemotional, nonsensational approach to the drug problem,'' Mr. Engelsman said. The Netherlands, he added, is slowly ''demythologizing'' drugs without a melodramatic ''war'' that drives users of hard and soft drugs underground. **********The campaign is not entirely free of hypocrisy. Much like a Times Square vice crackdown, the recent raid on the Hash Museum ended with the place being quietly permitted to reopen five hours later. **********''We were warned not to create publicity in the world press,'' a museum official said, while selling tickets at $2 each.

Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average moved ahead 1.97 more points, to 2,104.47, making the total advance nearly 210 points since year-end. **********''I think the market is setting itself up for a correction on the order of perhaps 10 percent,'' said Martin D. Sass of M.D. Sass Investors, which manages $2.8 billion. ''I can still see this move carrying the Dow to 2,150 or 2,200 before the correction comes. But, after that, my ultimate target is only 2,300 by year-end,'' **********One reason for January's stunning advance, he added, is ''panic buying'' by some money managers who entered the new year with too much cash. Most portfolio managers have underperformed the broad market averages for the last two years and, consequently, have an aversion to missing a big rally. **********On the other hand, Forstmann-Leff Associates, a firm with a good performance record, has been raising cash for the last week, even as stock prices continued to advance. ''We simply think the market is fully valued at these levels,'' said William F. Harnisch, president of the firm, which manages $4.6 billion. **********''We went into this year 80 percent invested -and for us, that's bullish. Currently, we are approaching a cash position of 75 percent and we're still raising cash. For example, we sold some of our Price Company stock and also have sold Ralston-Purina. Genentech remains our largest position, and other major holdings include Toys ''R'' Us, General Mills, Eli Lilly, CPC International and Telerate.'' **********Mr. Harnisch also said that any correction in stock prices in coming months was not likely to exceed 10 percent, ''provided there is no big crash in the bond market.'' **********However, David Dreman, managing director of Dreman Value Management, remains resolutely bullish - and keeps the $2.5 billion under his command fully invested. ''I believe it is more dangerous to be out of this market than in it,'' he said. ''Bull markets like this one are few and far between, even though there will be bumps along the way.'' **********As a self-styled ''contrary'' investor, he often picks out-of-favor stocks. At present, International Business Machines is his firm's largest position, to the tune of nearly 2 million shares. **********''I guess this market is going higher, but I really can't judge it for the short term,'' said James S. Martin, chief investment officer of the College Retirement Equities Fund's $27 billion portfolio, the country's single largest. **********As a long-term forecaster, however, Mr. Martin has an excellent record. In June 1983, when the Dow was hovering around 1,200, he told an interviewer: ''I can see the Dow at 2,100 in 1987.'' **********What does he see ahead? ''The ingredients are there,'' Mr. Martin replied, ''for the Dow to reach the high 2,000's over the next two or three years.'' **********One view gaining popularity on Wall Street is that stocks that can respond to a revved-up economy should outperform the interest-sensitive sectors like electric utilities that have benefited in recent years from declining interest rates. ''This market has to be driven by improved earnings in order to go higher,'' Mr. Martin said. **********As a result, some firms such as the College Retirement fund and the Alliance Capital Management Corporation are changing their mix of investments. **********''Our portfolios have been shifting moderately away from consumer-oriented groups like the foods and tobaccos toward sectors that are more economically sensitive,'' said Dave Williams, chairman of Alliance, which manages $30 billion in various portfolios as a subsidiary of the Equitable Life Assurance Society. ''We also favor groups that, in the past, were hurt by the high value of the dollar. These include capital goods, papers, chemicals and technology issues.'' As a matter of policy, Alliance tends to remain pretty fully invested and it does not regard itself as a ''market-timing'' firm. **********Peter Lynch, portfolio manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund, tends $8.4 billion in assets and, over the last 5, 10 and 15 years, his fund has shown the best performance of any mutual fund. **********Was he surprised by the recent run-up in stock prices?. ''I sure was,'' he admitted. ''I thought the market would go down in January. I'm still waiting to put in my Investment Retirement Account. Where? In Magellan.'' He, too, sees a correction coming. ''But you never know how big or when, until it's over,'' he said. Magellan's two biggest investments are Ford Motor and Federal National Mortgage Association. Other large positions include Chrysler, Kemper Corporation and Middle South Utilities. **********''Eighteen months ago, 20 percent of the fund's assets were in bonds and utility stocks,'' Mr. Lynch said.

''We're told they have about a month's supply left.'' Toshiba Studies Its Options **********An official for Toshiba, however, said the company was still studying its options and did not know yet how supply would be affected. **********Meanwhile, the NEC Corporation, the other major Japanese laptop computer vendor, said it anticipated being able to meet the demand for its machines, although prices might have to rise. **********Laptop computers are the product in which consumers are expected to most notice the effect of the 100 percent tariffs, which were imposed by President Reagan last Friday. The tariffs are designed to punish Japan for its purported failure to adhere to a semiconductor trade agreement signed last year. **********Government officials and retailers said they expected little change in price or supply of power tools, mid-sized color televisions and desktop computers, the other products that are a target of the tariffs, because these products are also supplied by American companies or by Japanese companies manufacturing in the United States. **********But in laptop computers, the Japanese models made by Toshiba and NEC are among the most popular. **********Most Japanese companies are not expected to continue to import products subject to the tariffs, because a 100 percent tariff is too stiff to swallow. Major questions, then, are how much inventory is already on hand in the United States and how long the tariffs will remain in effect. **********Many experts expect the tariffs to be lifted in three months, but a better indication could come after Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone of Japan visits the United States next week. **********If tariffs last only three months, pricing and availability problems should not be severe. Gary Gapp, senior vice president of the Computerland Corporation, the largest chain of computer stores, said the company had a two- to three-month supply of Japanese laptops on hand. **********Retailers said they intended for now to keep prices the same, but if shortages occur or if manufacturers raise prices, retailers would have to follow. If the tariffs were directly passed through to the consumer, it could raise the prices 50 percent or more. **********A few retailers said consumers had flocked to their stores to buy machines ahead of any possible tariff-related price rise. **********''Saturday, there was some panic buying, because no matter what we tell people, they don't believe it,'' said Gene Farb, co-owner of Whole Earth Access, a retailer based in Berkeley, Calif.

Bob Wolff, president of Wolff Computer in New York, said he had ordered a three-month supply, when normally he orders a 20-day supply. Avoiding Product Interruption **********A spokeswoman for NEC Home Electronics in Wood Dale, Ill., said the company had about a 60-day supply of its Multispeed laptop computers, which has a retail list price of $2,000. She said the company believed it could continue satisfying demand for the product without interruption. **********The spokeswoman, Marion Black-Ruffin, said NEC was thinking of shifting assembly of the computer from Japan to one of its existing United States factories. The company is also trying to cut manufacturing costs in Japan so it can keep shipping the product despite the tariffs. Even then, she said, prices would rise. **********A Toshiba official would not say how long inventories would last of the Toshiba 1100, which retails for $2,100, and the 3100, a powerful laptop with a list price of $4,200. John E. Rehfeld, vice president and general manager of the information systems division of Toshiba America in Irvine, Calif., also said the company had not told its dealers that it would be allocating products. **********But retailers and others said they have been told by Toshiba that supplies would be tight. **********''They have said there will probably be a suspension of shipments for some time,'' said John Morgridge, president of the Grid Systems Corporation of Mountain View, Calif., a computer manufacturer that sells the Toshiba 3100 under its own name."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/21/business/company-news-trump-blocks-deal-by-bally.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 227, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Trump Blocks Deal by Bally", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Trump Blocks Deal by Bally", "body_text": " **********Donald J.

Oxford is the world leader in the commercial application of what are now called conventional superconductors, metals that lose their resistance to electricity when cooled in liquid helium baths to less than 10 degrees Kelvin (about minus 263 degrees centigrade). **********Over the last 25 years, the company has used a curious characteristic of superconductors - the strong magnetic fields they create - to develop a variety of products. It is best known for supermagnets that go into instruments made by other companies to analyze everything from plastics to tumors. The instruments measure the energy emitted by the protons in atoms after they have been subjected to magnetic fields, taking advantage of the fact that different types of atoms emit different levels of energy. **********Peter M. Williams, Oxford's 42-year-old chief executive, acknowledges that the new superconductors, which are brittle ceramics, may one day transform the strategic outlook for superconductivity-based businesses. However, the company, which earned $20 million on sales of $160 million in the year ended March 31, is leaving basic research to others and concentrating on the near-term commercial prospects of using the older superconductors. **********Analysts say that Oxford's most promising opportunity stems from a contract with the International Business Machines Corporation to build a new superconducting device for semiconductor fabrication. **********''It's long-term, but it could be a multibillion-dollar market in the 1990's,'' said Nigel Burton, an analyst who follows Oxford for Robert Fleming Securities Ltd. in London. **********The product is a synchrotron, a machine that accelerates a beam of electrons in a magnetic field to the point where it throws off energy in the form of X-rays. Because X-rays have shorter wavelengths than other forms of light, I.B.M. and other semiconductor makers believe that they can be used to etch finer lines in microchips - and pack more circuits into them - than is possible with today's lithographic processes. **********I.B.M. has turned to Oxford because extremely sophisticated ''supermagnets'' are needed to bend the beam and hold it into an oval circuit small enough to fit into a reasonably sized semiconductor production facility. **********''This is substantially bigger than any project we have ever done,'' said John Pilcher, managing director of an Oxford subsidiary, Oxford Instruments Ltd., that is overseeing the three-year effort that some analysts have estimated to be worth as much as $15 million. **********Oxford is being aided by a $1.5 million interest-free loan from the British Government, which is eager to give the company a leg up in its race with German and Japanese groups that are also developing compact synchrotrons. Government scientists at the Daresbury Laboratory in Warrington, England, provided critical advice on the shape and gradations of the magnetic field the synchrotron would need. **********''Accelerator physicists are rare animals that mainly live in Government labs,'' said Martin Wilson, the project manager. ''We can make it, but we needed help from people who could tell us what to make. The biggest technical problem is that where you would want to put the material to make the magnetic field is precisely where you are not allowed to if you are going to get the X-rays out.'' **********Fortunately for Oxford, the synchrotron project has blossomed just as growth in the company's traditional image-analysis business faltered. Magnet-based image analysis is known as nuclear magnetic resonance, or N.M.R., in the analytical field and magnetic resonance imaging, or M.R.I., in medical diagnostics. It had lifted Oxford from the garden-shed enterprise of Martin Wood, an Oxford physicist who developed his magnetics expertise to meet his research needs, into a publicly traded company with overseas subsidiaries and partners and four divisions. **********Oxford's M.R.I. unit sales were the main growth engine in the early 1980's. But major customers such as the General Electric Company and Siemens of Germany are making more of their own magnets for the analytical and medical diagnostic equipment. And many of the limited number of laboratories and hospitals that can afford the devices now have them. **********In addition, competition is increasing from the Intermagnetics General Corporation, a company in Guilderland, N.Y., near Albany, that stumbled badly when its first products broke down. **********But Intermagnetics later pioneered the concept of magnets that could be housed in mobile units and has since enjoyed an improving reputation. **********The main problem, Mr. Williams said, is that the instrument manufacturers who are Oxford's customers are eager to recoup their heavy investment in M.R.I. and N.M.R. systems and are reluctant to cut prices, thereby reducing their profit margins. Lower prices, he said, might attract a broader range of hospitals and laboratories. **********M.R.I. systems cost anywhere from $1.5 million to several times that, with magnets accounting for 15 percent to 40 percent of the cost. **********''The market needs someone to cut the M.R.I. system price below the $1 million level,'' Mr. Williams said. The company's strategy to stimulate sales as it awaits a price break is to broaden its product line by developing magnets that are more powerful, more compact or better shielded so they can be used in less controlled environments. **********In addition, the company is developing businesses to shield it from the downturn in its medical devices. It markets patient monitoring equipment, including portable devices that monitor heart, brain and stomach activity and devices used in sleep study. In September, it acquired Plasma Technology Ltd., which makes equipment that uses electrical and magnetic fields to control gases from which materials are deposited onto semiconductors. **********''A good market for us at the moment is a $100 million market,'' Mr. Williams said. ''A $10 billion market attracts too many big guys.'' **********Some analysts, including Jack M. Frost, the blunt-speaking American whom Oxford hired to build its patient-monitoring business, see such views as unduly conservative. **********''Our company is still in many ways a hometown company that's reluctant to be in the big leagues,'' Mr. Frost said. **********However, Mr. Williams, whom Mr. Frost described as ''a harder driver than his predecessors,'' does not plan to let anyone take Oxford's place on top of the superconductivity heap without a fight. **********''We hope to grow to the point where we can go up against anybody in a major market by the time the synchrotron is commercialized,'' Mr. Williams said.  BUILDING A BETTER SEMICONDUCTOR **********To produce a new generation of chips with features closer together than current manufacturing processes permit, I.B.M. has contracted with Oxford Instruments to design a synchrotron. The device uses powerful magnets to hold a beam of accelerated electrons in a 4.5-meter-by-1.5-meter oval racetrack while energy is drawn off in the form of X-rays, extremely short-length lightwaves that can be used for high-quality etching.  STORAGE RING  Powerful supermagnets bend the electron beam into an oval circuit. Its stability is maintained with the help of conventional magnets on the straight portions.  1. Linear Accelerator:  This drives a beam of electrons at high speed into the device. Oxford is currently redesigning the system so that this accelerator will be at a 90- degree angle.  2. Injection Transport Line:  This captures the beam of electrons and delivers it into the magnetic field.  3. Radio Frequency Cavity:  This device further accelerates the electron beam once it is injected into the track and adds energy to compensate for that lost when X-rays are drawn off.  4. Lithography Stations:  X-rays are drawn into these stations where x-rays etch chips. The stations may be considerably farther from the synchrotron than depicted. Some stations may be used for monitoring or experiments."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/05/business/chicago-rating-raised.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 134, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chicago Rating Raised", "print_headline": "Chicago Rating Raised", "body_text": " **********Moody's Investor Service said today it had raised Chicago's general obligation bonds to an A rating, reflecting the city's economic growth and its determination to balance its budget.

If stock prices recover quickly, some traders worry that note and bond prices could be hit by selling by some fickle money managers who just recently fled the stock market, but are scrambling to get back in. Dollar Still an Issue **********Others pointed to the weakness in the dollar, which discourages purchases by foreigners. Foreign demand for Treasury issues is especially important, analysts noted, as the Treasury auctions $23.75 billion of notes and bonds this week, including 10- and 30-year issues that have attracted strong demand from Japanese investors the last two years. **********The more sedate behavior of bond prices last week seemed to reflect the mixture of views among institutional investors, many of whom remain optimistic that rates will decline further. Others are not so sure, however, and want to see more economic data, while some doubt the recent drop in rates can be sustained. **********''There are lots of silver linings in this whole episode, and I'm more optimistic about the economy and future than in a long time,'' said Marshall B. Front, executive vice president at Stein, Roe & Farnham, a Chicago investment advisory firm. ''We come out of this episode with lower inflation, lower interest rates, enhanced respect for the ability of central bankers to create a stable dollar and some agreement between the President and Congress to reduce the budget deficit.'' **********Mr. Front said further declines in Treasury bond yields were likely, though the extent of the drop would depend on how much economic activity slumps in response to the stock market decline. If inflation remains at the 3.8 percent forecast by Stein, Roe, or lower, Mr. Front said there could be a return of the 7 percent bond yield forecast by many analsyts when the year began. 'Not Much of a Recession' **********''The talk about a really enormous slowdown in the economy is misplaced,'' Mr. Front said. ''We expect a slowdown, but not much of a recession at all'' with a drop in G.N.P. after inflation of about 1 percent in the fourth quarter, followed by growth of one-half of 1 percent in the first quarter, 3 percent in the second quarter and more than 4 percent the next two quarters. **********But Henry J. Gailliot, senior vice president at the Federated Research Corportion, a Pittsburgh-based investment adviser, said he thought that ''people who bought bonds since September will be glad they did two years from now.'' Those bonds offer good yields and value in the face of inflation and the stock market, he said. **********But Mr. Gailliot added that recent euphoria in the bond market did not prove that a long-lived trend for higher bond prices and lower yields was under way and was no reason to abandon the discipline and investment rules learned from past business cycles. **********''The turn in the bond market doesn't come until a recession is started, and sometimes well into the recession,'' he said. ''I don't yet see signs of a recession, so I'm not sure a real bull makret in bonds has begun.'' Preferring the Short Term **********Edward Sporl, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Siebel Capital Management, in Larkspur, Calif., said he continued to keep investments in short-term securities where the risk of loss was low. **********The turnaround in long-term bond prices earlier this month ''is based on some assumptions that I just don't accept,'' he said, noting that forecasts of less consumer spending and more saving are highly tentative. **********''I see what has happened as more of a technical problem in the stock market, and not the direct result of any tight money policy by the Fed or a larger economic phenomenon,'' Mr. Sporl said. **********''We don't know where the economy will be in three or six months, but you do know there will be even more liquidity in the system'' to fuel economic growth and put renewed upward pressure on interest rates, he added. ''I have been in cash since last summer, and I have stayed there through this latest whilrwind,'' he said. **********Questions about the economic effects of the stock market decline are undoubtedly being asked at the Federal Reserve. So far, the Fed has made sure that credit is readily available to securities dealers experiencing a cash shortage and has encouraged a drop in the interest rate on overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market to around 6 3/4 percent Thursday and Friday, from 7 1/2 percent before Oct. 19. **********But analysts noted that the drop in the overnight rate was much less than the Fed could have caused and has not been accompanied by a cut in the discount rate the Fed charges on loans to financial institutions. Warning by the Fed **********Some analysts see an important, but unstated warning in the Fed's reluctance to push down short-term rates more sharply. ''If the Fed doesn't think the economy is going to be so hard hit that they need to cut the discount rate, then maybe the bond market is exaggerating the extent of the damage to the economy from the stock market,'' one securities dealer said. **********In coming weeks, many analysts expect that growth in the money supply will accelerate sharply, as turmoil in the financial markets causes an inflow of money into bank deposits. But they are not sure if the surge in money supply growth will be accompanied by more overt signs of an easing in Federal Reserve monetary policy. **********Those signs might not come, they say, unless there is agreement to increase taxes, a coordinated move with Japan and West Germany to lower rates or clear signs of a weakening in economic activity. **********One result of the mixture of opinions about the rate outlook has been a sharp increase in trading activity in the Treasury securities market. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, trading of 40 primary dealers in the Treasury market averaged nearly $173 billion a day in the week of Oct. 21, up from about $114.6 billion the previous week and an average of slightly more than $100 billion earlier this year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/15/business/finance-new-issues-morgan-notes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Morgan Notes", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Morgan Notes", "body_text": " **********J.

SEEKS TO LIFT CURB ON PROFIT", "body_text": " **********Seeking to eliminate one of the last vestiges of telephone regulation, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company asked Federal authorities yesterday to remove limits on what it can earn from long-distance service. **********A.T.&T. also proposed that it no longer have to prove that changes in long-distance rates or services are necessary or reasonable. Instead, the burden of proof would be shifted to competitors and consumers who challenge the changes. **********The company's action, in a filing to the Federal Communications Commission, comes amid evidence that A.T.&T.'s unregulated competitors now feel that long-distance rates have fallen too far, causing them millions of dollars in losses. On Thursday A.T.&T.'s largest long-distance competitor, the MCI Communications Corporation, reversed its stance and endorsed the total deregulation of the telephone giant, apparently in hopes that would lead to general rate increases for A.T.&T. and its rivals. **********Yesterday, A.T.&T. welcomed MCI's move, and said the time had come to remove most remaining regulations on the company, particularly an F.C.C.-imposed regulation that its rate of return on telephone service could not exceed 12.2 percent. 'Only Regulated Game in Town' **********''A.T.&T. is the only regulated game in town, and people are paying a price for that,'' said Larry Garfinkel, the vice president of marketing services for the company, who said F.C.C. regulations had slowed the introduction of new technology. ''If you believe in competition, you have to let the market regulate A.T.&T.'' **********Analysts said they expected the F.C.C. to embrace part, but probably not all, of A.T.&T.'s proposal. **********''It is certainly something we will look at seriously,'' said Albert Halprin, the chief of the F.C.C.'s common carrier bureau. ''But I would look to the end of the year before we will have an answer.'' **********Just two years ago, it would have been unthinkable, analysts note, that A.T.&T.'s competitors would have endorsed a total deregulation of the company. In filings and public statements, they expressed fears that the company could exploit its size and longstanding position in the telephone market to drive smaller competitors out of business. The Major Force **********But now nearly 70 percent of the country's telephone users have chosen a provider for long-distance services, and A.T.&T. has retained about 80 percent of the market. And the two chief competitors, MCI and U S Sprint, seem convinced that the company will not cut prices further to gain market share. **********''The largest constraint on A.T.&T. would be a political one - they can't be seen to be driving competitors out of business,'' said Lee Selwyn, the president of Economics and Technology Inc., a Boston analysis firm. **********But he said that ''the bottom line is that the public, both resident and business users, are worse off'' if A.T.&T. is deregulated. He said, that freed of regulation, A.T.&T. would likely raise rates steeply and double its rate of return, to more than 25 percent. **********At A.T.&T., Mr. Garfinkel disagreed. ''It's truly a competitive marketplace right now,'' he said. ''So if you believe that exists, we are really precluded from raising rates very much.'' **********Christopher Jackson, a communications analyst for the Yankee Group in Boston, agreed that ''any increases would happen gradually, but there is an increasing consensus that regulation is not good for anybody.'' Rates Have Fallen **********Since 1984, when divestiture began in earnest, long-distance rates have fallen about 30 percent. But at the same time, MCI and U S Sprint have spent billions of dollars on equipment and fiber-optic networks, and executives concede that at current rate levels it would be difficult at best to turn a profit. **********A.T.&T. said that it would commit itself to continuing basic long-distance service nationwide, and would maintain uniform nationwide prices, even in rural regions. **********It also said that ''price controls,'' but not profit controls, would be imposed on some basic services. Analysts guessed that if any regulations were retained, they would probably be those protecting smaller customers, particularly in areas not served by other carriers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/11/world/4000-refugees-of-civil-war-return-home-to-el-salvador.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "4,000 Refugees of Civil War Return Home to El Salvador", "print_headline": "4,000 Refugees of Civil War Return Home to El Salvador", "body_text": " **********About 4,000 refugees from the civil war in El Salvador returned home today after years in Honduras. **********The refugees crossed into northern Chalatenango Province and were processed by army officials, according to reporters at the scene.

The total was down 8.7 percent from the $75.8 billion in securities issued by corporations in this country in the second quarter of 1986 and 21.4 percent from the record of $88 billion in the first quarter of this year, according to Securities Data. **********The decline in underwritings provided another vivid example of how difficult the last three months have been for Wall Street. **********The period was marked by a steep rise in interest rates in April that sent bond prices plummeting and handed huge losses to a number of securities firms, including Merrill Lynch & Company, the First Boston Corporation and Salomon Brothers. Those firms have said that they will either report a large decline in overall earnings in the second quarter or a loss. **********''It was really not a bad quarter for us,'' said Geoffrey T. Boisi, co-head of investment banking at Goldman, Sachs & Company, which rose from sixth spot last year to second this quarter in the underwriting rankings. ''But there's no doubt there was some tapering off because a lot of the pent-up demand over the last two years has been exhausted because of the bullish markets we had before.'' **********Reflecting the unsettled conditions that prevailed in the bond market, the amount of debt securities issued by corporations dropped to $52.7 billion, from $58.4 billion a year earlier, according to Securities Data. Common stock offerings declined more modestly, to $13.5 billion, from $14.6 billion a year earlier. **********For the first half of the year, total underwritings rose on the back of a powerful first-quarter surge. According to Securities Data, underwritings in the first half totaled $157.3 billion, up from $144 billion in the first six months of 1986. **********The shifts in the markets in the second quarter led to changes in the underwriting rankings of the securities firms. But Salomon Brothers, the perennial leader, hung on to the premier spot, in spite of an overall drop in its underwritings. According to Securities Data, Salomon Brothers underwrote $10.3 billion in corporate securities in the second quarter, down from $12.3 billion a year earlier. **********The firm's position was bolstered by its grip on the top spot in debt underwritings, with $9.4 billion in the quarter. Elsewhere, Salomon jumped to fourth in underwritings of high-yield, low-quality ''junk bonds'' from ninth the year before. But it tumbled to ninth from second in stock underwritings. **********Goldman's move to the No. 2 positions reflected an increase in its underwritings of both stock and bonds. Merrill Lynch rose to third from fifth. Junk Bond Market Shrinks **********One of the largest moves was made by Drexel Burnham Lambert, which fell from second last year to seventh in the just completed quarter. Drexel continued to hold onto its top position in junk bonds, but that market shrank to $6 billion in new issues in the second quarter from $11.2 billion last year, according to Securities Data. **********Leaping upward was Baltimore-based Alex. Brown & Sons, to 10th position in the rankings, from 18th a year earlier. Most of the difference was accounted for by one underwriting, the huge $1.5 billion Nuveen Municipal Fund, which Brown managed. **********The global securities market, including the United States domestic market and the so-called Euromarkets, also experienced some decline in the volume of underwritings. According to Securities Data, global underwritings fell to $113.6 billion in the second quarter, from $130.7 billion the year earlier. For the first half of 1987, global underwritings rose to $256.6 billion, from $248.2 billion a year earlier.

That would be roughly flat or even another decline when inflation is taken into account. Further Cuts Possible **********If the negotiations in Washington fail and the Federal budget were cut across the board under the provisions of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction act, the Pentagon's budget could be pared to as little as $275 billion. **********With budget cutting likely to remain a high priority no matter what happens in the 1988 elections, industry executives now expect the Pentagon appropriation at best to grow only slightly - and at worst to decline steadily, well into the 1990's. Because military pay is unlikely to be cut substantially, the burden of any cuts will fall most heavily on weapons procurement plans. **********The probable cuts come at a time when the major aerospace and arms companies are struggling to adapt to new, more stringent procurement rules that are forcing the industry to take on more financial risk and responsibility. Contractors are paying more of the upfront costs of designing and building new weapons and are generally being paid less - and at a slower rate - for their work. **********''The environment for military contractors right now is dominated by down-trending defense budgets and more difficult contracting terms,'' said Jerry Cantwell, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Company. ''The returns in the business have come down and at the same time the investment requirements have gone up.'' Gloomier Profit Outlook **********In the short run, the budget squeeze means that some weapons programs will be delayed, scaled back or even canceled, hurting contractors' profits. New programs will be few and far between. Reflecting the new reality, Frank C. Carlucci, President Reagan's nominee to replace Caspar W. Weinberger as Secretary of Defense, told Congress last week, ''I don't think anything can be sacrosanct.'' **********The budget cuts and the new procurement rules also are combining to spawn or accelerate restructuring and diversification plans and the slow consolidation of the industry. **********''A few years ago I would think in terms of it taking three to four years to move from negative cash flow on a program to positive cash flow,'' said Fred Wood, an executive vice president of the General Dynamics Corporation. ''Now I think in terms of 10 years.'' **********Mr. Wood and other industry executives argue that the cash squeeze will weaken the industry and hurt the nation. The squeeze, they say, will force contractors to delay investments in more efficient production facilities. It will also lead to an erosion of their engineering expertise at a time when technological advances are becoming increasingly important to weapons development. Weinberger Departure a Factor **********But that argument is not expected to bear much weight in Washington, especially with the departure of Mr. Weinberger, a hard-core supporter of increased military spending. **********The nearly completed agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe has further weakened political support for higher military budgets, despite arguments by some experts that the agreement should lead to an increase in spending on conventional weapons. ''Arms control is seen as a substitute for defense spending,'' Mr. Cantwell said. **********The attitude of Wall Street analysts and investors toward military companies reflects this assessment. Analysts say that while some contractors may suffer more than others, depending on which programs are trimmed, the industry's earnings in general will be lackluster in coming years. The industry's growing problems have long depressed the stock prices of aerospace and weapons companies. Aerospace May Suffer Most **********While the potential cuts could affect everything from ships to tanks, the new reality may hit hardest at the large aerospace companies. Executives of the Grumman Corporation of Bethpage, L.I., for example, concede that their A-6F carrier-based attack plane, an updated version of a venerable Navy aircraft, is in for a difficult fight as Congress seeks spending cuts. **********Similarly, Congress may eliminate from this year's spending bill the $564 million needed for the Marine Corps to acquire 32 more AV-8B Harrier attack jets from the McDonnell Douglas Corporation. Development and production money for a number of other missile and airplane programs, including the Advanced Technical Bomber being designed by the Northrop Corporation, is also being trimmed. **********''Things are definitely tougher on the contracting front,'' said Daniel R. Stanley, manager of government programs and business planning at McDonnell Douglas. ''We have to be more competitive. The environment makes it more difficult to make money.'' 2 Monumental Projects Perhaps most worrisome to the industry is the possible long-term effect of sustained budget cutting on the Navy's attack plane of the future, called the Advanced Tactical Aircraft, and on the Air Force's next generation of fighter planes, called the Advanced Tactical Fighter, or A.T.F. Those two programs are not only among the biggest in the works - the Air Force estimates that it will spend $40 billion to build 750 of the A.T.F.'s - they are also the most important examples of the new risks inherent in competing for major contracts. **********Two teams of contractors are competing to build the A.T.F. One team consists of the Lockheed Corporation, the Boeing Company and General Dynamics. The other is made up of Northrop and McDonnell Douglas. The Air Force has awarded each team a $691 million contract to design and build two flying prototypes. But each team is expected to put about $400 million of its own money into the project, a practice known in the industry as cost sharing. **********Even if the A.T.F. program proceeds as planned, the losing team will suffer significant write-offs as its cost-sharing money goes down the drain. But if budget cuts cause the program to be stretched over a longer period or reduce the number of planes ordered, even the winning team might have difficulty making a profit, analysts said. In the worst case, Congress could opt not to pay for any production, leaving both teams in the cold. Optimism for the Short Term **********Despite the current budget environment, industry executives remain hopeful about the program's short-term prospects. ''I don't think it will suffer significantly - maybe marginally but not enough to harm the program through the prototype stage,'' said John C. Brizendine, the president of Lockheed's aeronautical systems group. In the long run, however, the chance that Congress might restrict production of the plane remains ''a hazard and a risk,'' he said. **********Even when a company wins a project unaffected by budget cuts, an automatic, hefty profit is no longer guaranteed, because of stricter procurement and payment rules spawned partly by widely publicized cost overruns and abuses like $400 hammers. **********Progress payments by the Pentagon have been reduced to 75 percent of contractors' monthly expenses, from 90 percent, with payments in many cases made after 30 days instead of 15. Profit margins have been trimmed by a percentage point or so, to about 11 percent, on the average production contract. Tax Changes Also Hurt **********Meanwhile, the new tax law has hit some contractors hard. It significantly tightened a loophole that had permitted them to delay paying taxes on profits until a program was completed. A further tightening of that rule has been proposed. **********The Pentagon is also reimbursing on fewer costs. For instance, the Pentagon used to pick up much of the tab for the costs of marketing a weapon abroad, on the theory that more orders for, say, a plane, would mean greater production efficiency and lower unit costs. No longer. In the same way, the armed services are demanding that contractors pay a greater share of special tooling costs for many programs. **********To cope with the new environment, most major aerospace companies are starting to slim down and cut costs. ''There are a lot of companies that built organizations to go after business that is not going to be there in the amount they had hoped,'' said John N. Simon, an analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles. **********Some of the companies with the most glaring overcapacity are already consolidating their manufacturing plants and trimming their work forces. Lockheed, whose work force is shrinking as its major production programs wind down, announced in September that it would combine its three aircraft-building divisions. Similarly, General Dynamics is ''trying to take a meaningful percentage of costs out - I'm talking upwards of 30 percent,'' Mr. Wood said. A Loss of Big Projects **********Analysts predict that some companies may well end up being forced out of certain key markets altogether. **********The Rockwell International Corporation, for example, is within six months of finishing the last of 100 B-1B bombers it is assembling for the Air Force. After that, Rockwell, long one of the nation's premier military aircraft builders, will not only lack a major airframe production contract but will have little chance of winning one soon. **********Rockwell, like Lockheed and many other companies, is instead pushing into military electronics by acquiring some of the nation's top companies in that sector. That field has been one of the fastest-growing in the industry because the real improvements in weapons are coming not from bigger or heavier planes, tanks and guns but from more accurate guidance, detection and communications technology. But electronics too has become increasingly competitive, and analysts warn that it is no panacea for companies seeking a haven from budget cutting."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/15/business/l-mci-replies-011087.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 102, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MCI REPLIES", "print_headline": "MCI REPLIES", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********''Foreigners Phone Toll-Free'' (Prospects, Jan. 4) leaves the impression that A.T.&T. will be the only United States company offering international toll-free, or international 800 service, in 1987. **********For the record, MCI announced in September that it will be offering both a domestic and international toll-free 800 service in early 1987.

''We had hoped to settle at $4.25,'' Mr. Iacocca said, ''but we ended up at $4.50, which is a substantial premium.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/06/world/the-un-today-nov-6-1987.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 72, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

Wojciech Jaruzelski, declared that Poland was heading down ''the still-bumpy road'' of reform and democratization. **********The events at two May Day rallies, one huge and official, the other small, unauthorized and encircled by the police, reflected the tensions and anxieties that continue to ripple through state and society. At both observances the major themes were improved production and national enrichment. **********At the official rally, the answers stressed discipline and patriotic duty. At the church, the call was for guarantees of the rights of free choice, free expression and free association. Jaruzelski's 'Ideals' **********''To live in dignity, to think creatively, to work assiduously, to effectively manage the economy and to share rewards justly - these are the ideals which will remain on workers' banners forever,'' General Jaruzelski said. **********''We are building a struggle against all that offends the sense of social justice, ignores human suffering and wrongs, breaks the rule of law and discipline and the value of work,'' he said. **********The Polish leader spoke at the start of the parade in which thousands of delegates from factories and offices marched under posters declaring ''Reform Is a Chance for Poland and for All of Us,'' and ''The Work of Poles Guarantees the Power of Poland.'' **********At the same time scarcely two miles away, at St. Stanislaw Kostka Church, a truck driver, Marek Miecznikowski, addressed 2,000 people who had managed to filter through dozens of police checkpoints at which many more people were turned away. No 'Protection of Law' **********''For us, the people of work,'' he said, ''this is still not a real holiday of dignified labor because we do not have the protection of law. We supposedly have the right to free expression of ideas, but we live in a time of police oppression. We have a legal right to our own unions, but those of Solidarity and the other independent unions have been liquidated.'' **********There were attempts to mount demonstrations elsewhere in the country, where, as in Warsaw, military reserves were called up and police leaves were canceled. **********In Wroclaw, 50 people, including a Solidarity supporter, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, were taken into custody when they tried to march under the banner of the outlawed union. In Poznan, about a dozen people were seized. **********The Government spokesman, Jerzy Urban, said almost all of those detained would be released within hours to appear later in magistrates' courts, which usually issue fines. Mr. Urban said 10 million people took part in official May Day parades throughout Poland. Statement by Walesa **********In Gdansk, the founder of Solidarity, Lech Walesa, ignored the shouted urgings of churchgoers who wanted him to lead them in a march. He took note of the tremendous formations of police, saying, ''I don't like to lead losing battles.'' **********He went home, hung a Solidarity banner from his window and issued a statement in which he said: ''The authorities who call themselves workers are ruled by fear. Those who regard themselves as a vanguard of humanity must hide behind cordons of police.'' **********The confrontation with the police at the Warsaw church came two months after a citizens' committee of 160 people had sought to test and expand Warsaw's echoes of the calls for openness and democratization by Mr. Gorbachev. The committee petitioned local authorities to hold an independent May Day march, limiting marchers to 10 slogans that have appeared in official publications. **********The request was denied on the grounds that the slogans were inappropriate and that some members of the committee had in the past provoked violence. Arrests on Way to Church **********Some of the best-known members of the committee, including Konrad Bielinski, Viktor Krulewski, Jan Litynski and Henryk Wujec, were detained on Thursday for 48 hours. Other opposition figures, like Zbigniew Bujak, the former fugitive leader of the Solidarity underground, and Janusz Onyskiewicz, a former Solidarity spokesman, were picked up as they headed for the church today. **********At the end of the religious service, a few dozen people raised banners with the slogans. Before they walked a hundred feet off the church grounds, squads of plainclothesmen darted from behind lines of uniformed policemen to pull down the signs. In several instances, marchers were beaten. Eight people were detained.

Mr. Eyton had been president and chief executive of Pacific Western and Mr. Sigler had been chief operating officer. Problems of Integrating Carriers **********The two executives, architects of a cost-conscious management policy that made it possible for Pacific Western to acquire the much larger but debt-ridden Canadian Pacific, are still wrestling with the problems of integrating the two airlines. Among other things, they must trim Canadian Pacific's $475 million debt; shed unwanted pilots, flight attendants and ground staff from a combined payroll of 13,000, and negotiate new contracts for the employees who remain. **********But already they have their sights set on a much grander goal: catching up to, and if possible surpassing, Air Canada. Because the Government is talking about selling its airline to private interests, possibly as early as next year, the prospects are for an all-out free-enterprise battle for pre-eminence on Canada's domestic routes, and, if governments permit it, on routes to the United States, Europe and Asia as well. **********In Canada, this marks a significant change. When it celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, Air Canada could look back on a history largely untroubled by competition. Under its parliamentary charter and an elaborate set of rules drawn up by Government regulatory bodies, it has had a monopoly, or something close to it, on many of the country's busiest domestic and international routes. With 22,000 employees, 115 aircraft and revenues of nearly $2 billion a year, the airline ranks as the 12th largest in the world. Protected by Government **********Air Canada's regulatory privileges continued for years after 1978, when deregulation in the United States ushered in an era of no-frills airlines, frequent-flier discounts and $99 coast-to-coast fares. Under rules that limited each of its competitors to 25 percent of its domestic route mileage, outlawed fare discounting and otherwise restricted competition, Air Canada regularly took more than 60 percent of a domestic and international market of more than 25 million passengers a year. **********The biggest loser was Canadian Pacific, which traced its history back to bush plane operations that sprang up in the 1920's. Although the modern airline was founded only in 1942, company histories recall a time when flight times for the smaller operators that preceded it were published as an addendum to the schedule for the Canadian Pacific Railway, and some stops were made only if the station manager at remote airfields waved a flag to indicate there were passengers below. **********But history counted for little after the founding of Trans-Canada Airlines in 1937, that later became Air Canada. Until 1959, when Canadian Pacific was granted its first transcontinental route, from Vancouver to Montreal, Canadian Pacific survived largely as a regional carrier in western Canada and as a pioneer of routes across the Pacific. Other domestic routes followed, and the airline expanded into South America and southern Europe. Still, it remained a weak sister to Air Canada at home. **********''We could carry you from one major center in Canada to another, but if you wanted to go from Spuzzem to Eakum-Seakum, you had to go Air Canada,'' said Peter Golding, employed for nine years by Canadian Pacific and recently named the corporate communications manager in Vancouver for Canadian Airlines International. ''Although we were an officially designated flag carrier, we were conspicuous by our absence from major markets at home.'' A Cautious Deregulation **********The first sign that Air Canada's dominance could be challenged came in 1984, when a ''freedom to move'' air policy was introduced by the Government of the Prime Minister at the time, Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Although more cautious than deregulation in the United States, the policy led to the cancellation of the rule limiting competitors to 25 percent of Air Canada's route mileage and the opening of most of the heavily traveled routes in southern Canada to competition. Service to northern communities continues to be regulated, to insure continuity of service. **********Full deregulation will not come until Parliament enacts legislation, probably next year, and even then the industry will lack some of the freedoms of American carriers. But already, patterns that developed in the United States are being repeated. **********At least 16 new regional airlines have sprung up, many of them selling out to Air Canada and Canadian Pacific as the larger carriers have sought to secure longer-haul routes. Consumers have benefited from fare wars, flight schedules are more full and in-flight service has improved. Merger Forms a Challenger **********But the development of potentially greatest significance came late last year, when the PWA Corporation, parent of Pacific Western, used cash generated by a sale-and-leaseback arrangement on 16 of its Boeing 737 jets to acquire Canadian Pacific. The parent company of the larger airline, CP Ltd., a conglomerate with large holdings in real estate, manufacturing industries and hotels, had become impatient with the cumulative losses of more than $75 million run up by Canadian Pacific since 1981, largely because of an expensive program of aircraft acquisitions. **********The result of the merger, Canadian Airlines International, is smaller than Air Canada, but close enough to pose a serious threat. The new carrier starts with 85 jets and 8.5 million passengers a year, the combined total carried by Canadian Pacific and Pacific Western in 1986. Mr. Sigler, the president, estimates the airline's market share at about 33 percent, slightly more than half Air Canada's, and contends that it is heading into the contest with Air Canada in a better financial shape. **********Joining the two bigger carriers in the contest for long-haul traffic will be Wardair, a privately owned airline founded by a former airline pilot, Max Ward. But despite its success in recent years in moving from its original base as a charter operator into scheduled services, the carrier, based in Edmonton, Alberta, remains a distant third in the overall rankings. Fears of a 'Duopoly' **********Among consumer watchdogs, this has raised concerns that Canada may emerge from the restructuring of the industry with a ''duopoly'' - two large carriers that can set prices and schedules as they wish, to the detriment of travelers. **********To Mr. Sigler, such fears betray a lack of understanding of what lies ahead. Already, the new airline is preparing a challenge to Air Canada's ''backyard'' - Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic provinces. In addition, it intends to ask the Government to negotiate ''double-track'' rights for the two airlines on services into the eastern United States and Britain, highly profitable routes that only Air Canada flies. Air Canada has responded by saying that it would like a share of its rival's routes in the Pacific region. **********The result, according to Mr. Sigler, will not be a return to the rigidity of the past. ''The whole process of deregulation began here five years later than it did in the United States, and it is ending five years sooner,'' he said, referring to the industry shakeout. ''We'll end up with three major airlines, all of them competitive, offering a better product and more sensitive on pricing than before. How can that be bad for the consumer?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/06/business/justices-uphold-fdic-on-bank-underwriting.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 619, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Justices Uphold F.D.I.C.

The units could not use the banks' names. **********The decision was seen as another victory for bankers who in recent years have successfully exploited loopholes in Federal banking laws. The decision, however, is more symbolic than practical, because a wide-ranging banking bill passed by Congress last summer puts a moratorium on state-chartered banks underwriting corporate securities until March 1, 1988. **********The Court upheld an April ruling by the Federal appeals court here that the F.D.I.C. did not violate the Banking Act of 1933, known as the Glass-Steagall Act, which separates banking from securities activities. The appeals court said Congress ''clearly intended'' to allow the banks ''to maintain subsidiary or affiliate relationships with securities firms.'' **********Under the F.D.I.C.'s interpretation, the Glass-Steagall Act applies only to national and Federal Reserve member banks. Many of the nation's largest banks are federally chartered and thus outside the F.D.I.C. rule, but the vast majority of medium and smaller banks are state-chartered. **********The Investment Company Institute, representing mutual fund operators, and the Securities Industry Association, which represents securities brokers, dealers and underwriters, appealed the lower court's ruling in the case, Investment Company Institute v. F.D.I.C., No. 87-36. The Reagan Administration supported the ruling. **********The Justices also refused to consider a ruling that the Army Corps of Engineers may block construction, because of water pollution control laws, of dams and power projects previously approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency. In Monongahela Power Co. v. Marsh, No. 86-1642, the Court, without comment, refused to hear an appeal by the Monongahela Power Company. **********The Court agreed to review whether a Mississippi utility is entitled to raise its rates by $626.5 milion to defer costs of a nuclear power plant. Last June, the Justices temporary blocked enforcement of a state court's ruling that disallowed the rate increase for the Mississippi Power and Light Company until they could consider the company's formal appeal. (Mississippi Power and Light v. State of Mississippi, No. 86-1970.) Award to Be Reviewed The Court also agreed to decide whether companies violate antitrust laws when they lobby private organizations that play a role in influencing business legislation. The Justices said they would review a $11.4 million jury award in the case, Allied Tube v. Indian Head, No. 87-157. The Allied Tube and Conduit Corporation, the nation's largest producer of steel conduits, was accused of organizing 230 voters at a National Fire Protection Association meeting to block approval in an electrical safety code of a competing plastic conduit. **********The Court also agreed to consider the appeal by a black woman from North Carolina who charged that she was the victim of on-the-job racial harassment. If it decides in her favor, the decision would effectively broaden the remedy for job-related racial harassment. **********Last November, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld a ruling by a Federal judge in Winston-Salem, N.C., who dismissed a suit by Brenda Patterson against her employer, McLean Credit Union.

''We're not commenting,'' he said. Calls to Pennzoil's chairman, J. Hugh Liedtke, were not returned. Icahn Informed **********Carl C. Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc. and Texaco's largest shareholder, said he had been informed by Texaco executives that a settlement in principle had been reached and that only a few small issues remained to be worked out before an official statement would be made by Texaco and Pennzoil. **********The agreement settles a case in which a jury awarded the largest judgment in American history. The accord will also allow Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company, to emerge from bankruptcy in the next few months. **********It also marks the closing chapter of an acrimonious corporate feud that began almost four years ago as a contracts dispute. The fight has been punctuated by thousands of hours of fruitless negotiations, legal wranglings, dashed hopes and charges by executives of both companies accusing the other side of greed, arrogance and duplicity. **********The dispute dates to January 1984, when Texaco acquired the Getty Oil Company for $10.1 billion. Pennzoil, a Houston-based company that thought it had previously reached a binding agreement to buy three-sevenths of Getty, sued Texaco for interference of contract. Huge Bond Required **********In 1985, after a trial that lasted more than four months, a Texas jury awarded Pennzoil $10.53 billion, plus interest, in damages. **********Texaco, saying that it could not put up a bond in that amount, which was required by Texas law during the appeal process, filed for protection from its creditors on April 12 of this year. **********The filing made Texaco the largest company ever to enter bankruptcy proceedings. The Federal trustee supervising the bankruptcy, Harry Jones, then appointed committees to represent the interests of Texaco's shareholders and creditors. **********Last night, Texaco's 14-member board held a telephone-conference call and approved the most important details of the settlement, Mr. Boies said. The two companies are expected to announce the details of the settlement over the weekend. **********Mr. Boies, a partner with Cravath, Swaine & Moore who has been working on the Texaco case as its lead litigator since shortly after it lost the original case in Texas, said the two companies still had to ''iron out'' certain smaller issues in the plan, such as the effect of an earlier confidentiality agreement between the parties that barred them from revealing the contents of negotiations. Mr. Harper, the Pennzoil spokesman, said that no agreement had been signed by the companies and that lawyers ''were still making changes in the words.'' **********The Texaco board conference came after a several days of hectic negotiations among all of the parties. The board had met for more than three hours on Thursday night. **********Alfred C. DeCrane Jr., Texaco's chairman, led the Texaco board discussions from the company's headquarters in Harrison, N.Y. James W. Kinnear, who became Texaco's chief executive and president less than four months before its bankruptcy filing, was at one of the company's law firms, Weil, Gotshal & Manges, on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. **********Mr. Liedtke, who had postponed his retirement earlier this year until the the case was resolved, spent much of the day being advised of developments by a battery of lawyers at a suite at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Manhattan. Texaco Canada at Issue **********People who have seen the plan said that it contains no reference to the sale of Texaco's share of Texaco Canada Inc. The parent company and the shareholders and creditors committee had been approached about such a sale by at least one Canadian company, Husky Oil Ltd., a unit of Nova, an Alberta corporation, and other companies were believed interested. **********The sale of Texaco's 78 percent share of the Canadian unit had been proposed as a way of raising more than $2 billion of the settlement. Some one close to Texaco said no decision had been reached about what corporate assets would be used to finance the $5.5 billion reorganization, which consists of the Pennzoil settlement and the money owed to other creditors. **********''We're not interested in a fire-sale sort of thing,'' said a Texaco lawyer, who added that the company might seek loans to finance the arrangement. **********The company had $4.3 billion in cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30, according to a filing made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some of that could be used to finance the plan. **********The plan also does not contain any of the earlier demands by the shareholders committee that it have the authority to make a minority of appointments to Texaco's board. Voice for Shareholders **********But it may contain a separate provision, having no impact on the plan itself, which gives the shareholders an opportunity to voice their views on the corporate structure of Texaco. **********The reorganization plan and settlement will require the approval of Texaco's shareholders, who can be expected to vote on it by March. The month-long vote will occur after the plan is filed in a Federal court in White Plains and an appropriate disclosure statement detailing the effects of the plan on Texaco is approved by a bankruptcy judge. **********Two-thirds of the shares voting must consent before the plan becomes effective. **********News of the settlement came after the stock markets had closed, but traders had anticipated a dramatic development. Pennzoil's stock jumped $4.125, to $79.375, on the New York Exchange. Texaco shares, the seventh-most active issue, with 2.1 million shares changing hands, rose $2.50 to $38.50. On the American Exchange, Texaco Canada increased 50 cents, to $23.625. **********People involved in the discussions said that the last major issue centered on the interest to be paid on the $3 billion. Mr. Liedtke insisted that 9 percent or 10 percent interest be paid from last April, when the Chapter 11 papers were filed, until next spring, when the company is expected to emerge from bankruptcy. **********Texaco lawyers said, however, that Mr. Liedtke backed off from that demand, especially after the creditors and shareholders had supported Texaco's contention that no interest be paid. Pennzoil executives would not comment on the interest issue. **********Earlier in the day, the parties decided not to haggle about who should bear the tax liability of the settlement, but would instead each take a position and let the Internal Revenue Service decide. **********Yesterday's settlement came about in large part because of two recent events that radically changed the dynamics of years of negotiations: the intervention of Mr. Icahn and an innovative ruling by a bankruptcy judge in White Plains. **********Mr. Icahn said last night that he was glad to see a settlement emerge but that he was unhappy that it failed to remove corporate bylaws that would make an unfriendly takeover difficult. **********Asked who deserved credit for reaching the deal, he said, ''It doesn't matter. In the final analysis, what counts is the bottom line.'' **********Last month, Mr. Icahn stepped into the fray by buying a large block of shares from Robert Holmes a Court, an Australian industrialist. Mr. Holmes a Court, who sufffered large losses in the October stock market plunge, sold his stake with an after-tax loss of $42.6 million. **********Mr. Icahn paid $348 million for 12 million shares of Texaco stock and the voting rights of an additional 12.1 million shares. Combined with the 5.8 million shares he owns from earlier transactions, Mr. Icahn controls 12.3 percent of Texaco's stock, making him the largest shareholder. **********He also owns a substantial block of Pennzoil, believed by Pennzoil executives to be about 2 percent. He stands to make a substantial profit from the settlement. **********He declined last night to say whether he would sell his shares soon. A Novel Ruling **********After Mr. Icahn announced his acquisition of Texaco shares, the Federal bankruptcy judge, Howard Schwartzberg, issued a novel ruling that strengthened Mr. Icahn's bargaining ability and also put enormous pressure on all sides to reconcile their differences. **********Judge Schwartzberg granted Texaco 40 additional days - until mid-January - to have the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan. But the judge also said that if two legally recognized committees in the proceeding - which represent Texaco's shareholders and its creditors -could agree with Pennzoil upon a reorganization plan, he would allow it to be filed and brought to a vote of Texaco's shareholders, even over the objections of Texaco's management. **********The ruling fueled a furious round of negotiations and shifting alliances among all of the parties. Advancements toward a settlement were made almost daily. **********Last Friday, for instance, the shareholders committee, Pennzoil and Mr. Icahn announced an agreement to a $3 billion all-cash settlement as part of the bankruptcy plan. Three days later, the creditors' committee accepted the $3 billion figure. **********Faced with the possibility of an accord among the three groups, Texaco resumed discussions with Pennzoil executives and with representatives from the two committees. **********But the alliance between the creditors and shareholders and Mr. Icahn was not solid, and grew tenuous at points when the two committees tried to advance their own interests over a unified plan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/31/world/the-hills-are-not-alive-with-the-swoosh-of-skis.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1987-12-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 787, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Hills Are Not Alive With the Swoosh of Skis", "print_headline": "The Hills Are Not Alive With the Swoosh of Skis", "body_text": " **********In Chamonix, they are playing golf and tennis. In Gstaad in the Swiss Alps, they are hiking and riding mountain bikes. **********The extraordinary lack of snow has made it a frustrating winter for skiers in the Alps. Instead of finding 50 inches of snow to schuss down, skiers are finding 50-degree temperatures to sunbathe in. Many ski operators are saying it is the worst winter for them in a quarter century. **********''It's a catastrophe right now,'' said Alain Boyelle, director of the office of tourism in St.-Gervais, in the French Alps. ''Lift operators are being hurt. Ski instructors are hurting. Ski shops are hurting.'' **********What is more, many towns are worried that mild winters like this will hurt Europe's image as a skiing capital that attracts people from as far away as Arizona and Australia. Today, for example, the International Ski Federation said a shortage of snow was forcing it to reschedule a Jan. 9 women's World Cup downhill race that was going to be held at Les Diablerets in Switzerland. Too Warm for Snow Machines **********''We can't even use snow-making equipment because it's too warm,'' complained Francis Richard, Mayor of Morzine, a skiing village in the French Alps. **********Morzine is typical of many ski resorts. Only 5 of the 70 lifts are in operation. Many skiers are canceling hotel reservations, and about half the ski instructors are out of work. **********Indeed, because of the warm winds coming up from North Africa, which have kept temperatures between 40 and 50 degrees, ski officials estimate that 6,000 of France's 10,000 ski instructors have been out of work so far this winter. Many ski resorts below 6,000 feet in altitude cannot operate. And some ski operators who invested millions of dollars in new lift equipment last year are worried about whether they will be able to repay their debts. Holidays a Major Time **********Officials in many ski towns estimate that between 15 percent and 20 percent of their revenues come the week between Christmas and New Year's Day. **********''Christmas week is usually one of the best weeks of the year, and that's been lost,'' said Mayor Richard, whose town has 30,000 beds to accommodate skiers. ''It's a disaster, and things will get very serious if it doesn't snow by next week.'' **********With many skiers having shown up anyway, the snow-less ski resorts are doing their best to provide other distractions. They want to make sure the skiers go away as happy as can be expected under the circumstances. **********For example, Chamrousse, a town in the French Alps, grabbed Antoine Montero, a French boxer, to put on an exhibition. Other towns have organized hikes and aerobics classes and have reopened golf courses. **********''We have people hiking around the glacier and we have jazznastics classes,'' said Hans-Ulrich Tschanz, director of tourism for the Swiss resort of Gstaad. ''It really isn't so bad. People are eating lunch in the sun out on the terrace.'' **********Ski resorts that are accustomed to boasting how great they are as ski towns, now boast that they are more than ski towns. They boast of fine dining and fascinating shopping. Restaurants Doing Better **********''Because people aren't spending time on the slopes, the restaurants, bars and movie theaters are doing far better than usual,'' said an official in one ski town. ''They are spending their money on food.'' **********The problems of the towns that do not have enough snow have also translated into problems for towns that have enough snow. Val-Thorens, at 7,000 feet one of the highest ski spots in the French Alps, is having to turn away skiers. Tour organizers that originally intended to send their tour groups to other towns have steered them to Val-Thorens. Normally the town, which has 30 of its 31 lifts in operation, has the capacity to accommodate 15,000 skiers. So far this week it has squeezed in 20,000, resulting in long lift lines and angry skiers. **********''We have too many people,'' said Christian Portello, director of tourism for Val-Thorens. ''Starting tomorrow, we will have to start turning some people away.'' **********Many ski resort officials say this year's problems will push them to increase their publicity next year to make sure they do not lose any skiers. **********''We don't want people to start thinking the lack of snow is just a French problem,'' said Philippe Bertoli, director of the Christiania Hotel in the French resort, Val d'Isere.

When they do, it will be the end of an effort the army began 40 years ago. **********Making the maps will take another year or two, but the mapping of the North American land mass to a 1:50,000 scale - roughly an inch to a mile, the ''tactical scale'' that suffices for most military purposes and for recreational activities such as hiking - will be complete. Next year, the Canadians will turn to the still more exhausting business of charting the waters of the Arctic Archipelago. **********At a ceremony on a windblown ridge near here, Defense Minister Perrin Beatty unveiled a cairn commemorating the soldiers' work. The cairn was built of the same rough granite blocks that mark the passage through the Arctic - and in many cases, the deaths - of the discoverers who ventured ''north of 60'' before helicopters and radios and all the paraphernalia that sustains a modern mapping party. #700 Miles From the Pole Although this outpost lies barely 700 miles from the North Pole, on the western shore of Ellesmere Island, the closest that the soldiers here come to the extreme hardships experienced by men like Roald Amundsen is in the explorers' accounts that some brought for reading in the permanent daylight of the Arctic summer night. **********Still, a summer at 80 degrees of north latitude is not for the fainthearted. Even in summer, gale winds can blow and temperatures can plunge. Men flown by helicopter to mountain peaks for two days of sighting can be isolated in small tents with survival rations for two weeks before fog and winds recede. In a part of the Arctic that has an annual snowfall of barely 18 inches, summer dust storms can rival those of the Gobi Desert. **********''Small mistakes here can be disastrous,'' said Lieut. Col. George Focsaneanu, commander of the 29-man unit that arrived here in early June. As he spoke, a wind howled around the mess tent so strongly that the Huey helicopters used to carry visitors up the ridge flew with their skids barely clearing the rocky outcroppings ringing the airstrip. **********Like many military outposts in Canada's far north, this one owes its beginnings to the United States. In 1947, a joint Canadian-American weather station was established here at the urging of an American, Col. Charles J. Hubbard, who died in the crash of a Canadian aircraft making a mail drop here in 1950. The station still operates year-round as one of the most northerly inhabited sites on earth. Tame Wolf Visits Camp **********It is a land of musk oxen and polar bears, and of an Arctic wolf pack so tame that one of the wolves, nicknamed Scruffy, is a frequent visitor to the camp. But with barely 60 days on site each year, the Canadian mappers have little time for recreation, working 16 hours a day throughout the week when weather permits. **********When the Canadians started their detailed mapping of the Arctic, in 1947, vast areas of the map showed coastlines and features noted by early explorers but otherwise little but white space. Over 20 years, working with dog teams and pack horses at first and helicopters only later, the mapping parties produced a complete set of 1:250,000 scale maps, showing four miles to the inch. In 1967, they began again on the finer-scale project now nearing completion. **********The 1:50,000 scale maps, when finished, will round out a collection of 13,000 maps that cover all of Canada, an archive weighing one and a half tons. Col. David T. Carney, the head of the army's Mapping and Charting Establishment, acknowledged ruefully that many in the Arctic series were not things of beauty by cartographic standards since the colors that brighten more southerly maps -red for man-made features and green for vegetation, for instance - are mostly absent. **********Little has been disclosed about the mapping unit's future work, charting Arctic waters. This is apparently because the charts themselves are likely to be secret, at least for some channels, since the principal users of them will probably be nuclear submarines. Ever since the American submarine Nautilus sailed under the polar icecap in 1958, the Arctic has been a strategic area for United States and Soviet submarine fleets. **********The Canadian Government has acknowledged that it does not know when submarines operate in what it regards as its internal waters, notably the Northwest Passage, the 1,000-mile channel that provides the only passage across the archipelago for surface ships. Since Canadian charts of the Arctic are crude, it is assumed that the United States Navy, at least, has more accurate maps. Names From an Expert **********Some charts go back to the voyages of Sir John Franklin, discoverer of the Northwest Passage in 1845. For the new series, the Canadians will abandon the leadline used until well into this century and use aerial equipment. One feature to be carefully noted are the ''pingos'' - undersea hills, often ice-cored, that rise as much as 70 feet above an otherwise uniform sea floor. Historians believe that pingos, as much as the ice pack, may have accounted for some of the Arctic's most famous wrecks. **********After the mapping and charting are completed, the work of naming features and places across the vast Arctic will remain. The task has been entrusted to Randolph Freeman, an expert on place names working for the territorial government in Yellowknife, who estimates that as many as 100,000 names will have to be found over the next decade. **********Until this year, many of the 64 populated communities in the Arctic had names imposed by outsiders. But since Jan. 1, many of the better-known communities have begun reverting to the names given to them by Eskimos and Indians thousands of years ago. The first such change was at Frobisher Bay, which became Iqaluit, meaning ''place of the fish.'' **********Mr. Freeman spends at least six months a year traveling across the region, speaking to native people and recording traditional place names. Although most places in the southern Arctic are expected to have native names, places like Eureka in the far north, well beyond the area of Eskimo habitation, are likely to retain names given to them by explorers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/27/business/the-29-crash-seeking-clues-to-the-market-s-future.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 554, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Seeking Clues to the Market's Future", "print_headline": "THE '29 CRASH; Seeking Clues to the Market's Future", "body_text": " **********WHERE is the stock market headed? That question has been topmost in many minds since the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 22 percent to 1,738.74 on Oct. 19. **********As 1987 draws to a close, the market is in a rally of sorts. Yet the Dow is still below the level, 2,027.85, that it regained two days after the plunge. And many investors, both individuals and professionals, fear that the Dow has yet to bottom - and may still fall below the Oct. 19 close. **********One place investors have looked for possible clues to the market's future course is the 1929 stock market. As they did in 1987, stocks took a sharp dive in October 1929; the Dow fell 23 percent in two days. Both plunges were followed by two-day recoveries: in 1929 the Dow regained 63 percent of its loss; in 1987 it regained 57 percent. **********But the 1929 crash was just a prelude. After a five-month climb, the market started falling in earnest. Market participants would later recall that while the October 1929 crash got the headlines, causing severe distress to the average investor, it was the rally in the spring of 1930 that hurt many Wall Street professionals. **********Before the 1929 crash, many market professionals had pared back their exposure in stocks. The 1924-1929 bull market was then 63 months old, one of the longest on record. And the increasing public participation, particularly by new and inexperienced speculators, scared many brokers out of stocks before the crash. **********But by the spring of 1930, when the Dow had very nearly recovered to its pre-crash level, many Wall Street professionals thought that the market had merely had a shakeout and that it was safe to own stocks again. **********They were wrong. By July 8, 1932, the Dow had plummeted to this century's low point - 41.22 - for a loss of 86 percent from the post-crash high reached in April, 1930, and a loss of 89 percent from the Dow's record of 381.17 on Sept. 3, 1929. **********But there are important differences between 1929 and today. For one thing, the Government has introduced many more safeguards. For another, there is the opportunity to learn from past mistakes, including the Federal Reserve System's ill-timed tightening of credit in the early 1930's. **********Another key difference is the strength of the economy. In 1929, the economy had already turned down - in August 1929 - before the market embarked on its prolonged crash. Today, if there is to be a recession, mild or otherwise, there is still no sign of it. **********To be sure, economists, chastened by the market's October plunge, hastily began revising their projections downward, almost before the stock ticker finished chronicling the Dow's 508-point fall. But by December, some of these same economists were in the process of rebuilding their recently reduced estimates of economic activity. For the moment, the outlook for 1988 is good, but not great. In the aftermath of the plunge, many investors would be happy to settle for similar performance from the stock market."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/04/business/china-hong-kong-s-factory.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1699, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China: Hong Kong's Factory", "print_headline": "China: Hong Kong's Factory", "body_text": " **********Dusty fields and backyard vegetable plots are being replaced by rows of thriving factories here, as tiny Hong Kong ''colonizes'' a belt of southern China. **********While American and European companies agonize over unprofitable businesses in China, Hong Kong concerns are nimbly and profitably transferring more and more production to that nation. Already, parts of southern Guangdong province are virtually subcontracting centers for the British territory. **********''They like to work, and they don't like to take holidays,'' Rickie P. K. Yu, the Hong Kong-based manager of Wisegroup Investment Ltd., said of the 62 people in his knitted-garments factory in Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong. Mr. Yu's employees work 10 hours a day, seven days a week, for the princely wage -to them - of almost 30 cents an hour. Once a month or so they take a day off. Better Than the Farm **********''Everyone wants to come here,'' said Li Laikam, a 20-year-old worker in Mr. Yu's factory who moved to Shenzhen two years ago from her native village 260 miles to the southwest. ''It's better here because you don't have to endure the wind and the rain in the fields.'' **********Hong Kong is grappling with a worsening labor shortage, the result of a slow-growing population and a rapidly increasing demand for its toys, televisions and clothes. Unemployment has dropped to just 1.8 percent, and so waves of Hong Kong manufacturing companies in search of workers are shifting production north of the border. **********Hong Kong now supplies 79 percent of the foreign investment in China, and the Hang Seng Bank in Hong Kong estimates that in Guangdong province alone there are 2,000 factories partly owned by Hong Kong interests. **********In addition, the bank calculated, Hong Kong concerns have signed some 60,000 subcontracting agreements with companies in Guangdong, spawning 8,300 factories. Many Hong Kong companies prefer subcontracting agreements because then they need not make an equity investment but can still usually supervise the manufacturing process. 1 Million Jobs Affected More than one million workers in southern China depend on manufacturing arrangements with Hong Kong, the bank reported. In 1978, when China began to open to the West, there were virtually no manufacturing links between Hong Kong and China. **********Many managers and economists say that Hong Kong will increasingly become the managerial center for the region - the site of companies' headquarters and of marketing, engineering, accounting and shipping operations - while the factories themselves will be in China. **********Gordon Wu, the managing director of one of Hong Kong's biggest companies, Hopewell Holdings Ltd., put it this way: ''Hong Kong will be the storefront, and the Pearl River delta of China will be the factory.'' **********Raymond K. Hung, the chairman of Applied Electronics Ltd., a Hong Kong company that manufactures talking dolls, remote-controlled cars and other products, said: ''About 90 percent of our production is being moved to China. As far as toys go, without China you're not competitive at all.'' Labor Far Cheaper **********Applied Electronics has nearly 5,000 employees in China, compared with just 280 in Hong Kong. Although the Chinese workers are not as proficient as those in Hong Kong, the lower labor costs make the shift worthwhile. The company pays assembly line workers in China the equivalent of $77 a month, compared with $333 a month in Hong Kong. **********''They already are at 80 percent of Hong Kong's efficiency,'' Mr. Hung said. ''But I expect they will catch up because turnover is five-tenths of a percent per year, compared with about 20 percent in Hong Kong.'' **********Yet Hong Kong managers certainly do not find manufacturing in China to be trouble-free. Like their American, Japanese and European counterparts, they complain about China's bureaucracy, poor infrastructure and inattention to quality. A Different Work Ethic **********''It's very frustrating to be a manager here,'' said Eddy K. W. Yip, a manager in China for the Hong Kong-based Luks Industrial Company, the one-third owner of an enormous television factory in Shenzhen. ''Workers are very sloppy here, and there is no tradition of a work ethic in China. In Hong Kong, if you don't work, you're out the door.'' **********Other common annoyances of doing business in China are the difficulty of converting local currency into dollars, and the sometimes outrageous cost of raw materials. In one famous example, a foreign company that set up a factory to make orange juice concentrate discovered too late that the price it was expected to pay for oranges was the highest in the world. **********Yet Mr. Yip noted that for all the frustrations, his company's labor cost in Shenzhen - including wages, taxes and room and board - is $162 a month per employee, compared with at least $300 a month in Hong Kong. So the Luks Industrial facility in Shenzhen, which employs 1,100 Chinese workers under 22 Hong Kong managers, doubled production in May and plans further increases so it can manufacture 500,000 televisions a year in 1988. An Acceptance in China **********Shenzhen's labor costs are rising as more Hong Kong companies open factories in the region, but workers are also streaming into the area from other parts of China. While critics point out that Shenzhen has attracted less investment than planners had hoped for, the workers' enthusiasm and the Communist Party's increasing flexibility in employment matters reflect China's drift toward free markets. **********Hong Kong companies are more profitable and successful than other companies in dealing with China for several reasons, analysts say. Among the most important: *********** They have less at risk because frequently they do not invest their own capital. They simply place orders for products and work closely with the Chinese supplier to insure high quality. *********** They usually operate on a small scale. That reduces the layers of bureaucracy and allows more flexibility. Often a Hong Kong businessman hires relatives in China to supervise a ''factory'' of perhaps only a dozen workers. *********** They are mostly interested in the export market rather than in manufacturing for China. That fits neatly with China's own desires and reduces the problem of how to convert revenue in Chinese money into hard currency. *********** Their managers speak the local dialect, know the customs and can often bargain more effectively with officials. 'We Know China Better' **********''We know the tricks,'' said Vincent H. C. Cheng, chief economist of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. ''We know how to get around the problems. We know China better than the Japanese or Americans.'' **********And, the chief executive of one Hong Kong bank said, the local Chinese know when a ''gift'' to a Chinese official will make a difference. **********Roderick W. MacNeil, a Hong Kong-based consultant to companies considering the China market, said that when the Hong Kong Chinese tackle a venture similar to those American or European corporations pursue - something on a large scale and aimed at the domestic market -they face the same problems as other foreign companies. **********Hong Kong executives say that the key to successful manufacturing in China is to oversee the production as closely as possible and to make the labor force as flexible as possible. Even when Hong Kong companies are simply buying from a factory in China, their executives are always on hand, ready to reject goods that are not quite right. **********''You really have to do your own supervision,'' said David C. W. Yeh, the managing director of Universal Matchbox Ltd., a Hong Kong toy manufacturer. ''If you let them do it, you end up with disaster.'' Lower Quality Standards **********The problem seems to be that some Chinese workers are unaccustomed to the standards that foreign markets demand and see no reason not to sell a shirt just because one sleeve is longer than the other. **********In addition, although workers in China are prepared to stay on the job for many hours, there is little tradition of working hard. Even at the most successful factories in Shenzhen, employees on an assembly line pause to chat, leaving those down the line with nothing to do. **********Yet Hong Kong managers say they are slowly succeeding in speeding up production. They test workers' speed before hiring them, and sometimes pay by the piece instead of by the hour. Increasingly, they are also getting the right to fire those who steal or perform poorly. **********The workers come from all over China to work in Guangdong province. Indeed, Shenzhen was only a village eight years ago and has no indigenous labor force. They are lured by wages two or three times higher than they could get anywhere else. In their eagerness for money, long hours are usually an advantage. Workers often try to switch to a factory that promises ''O.T.,'' as overtime is known in the local Chinese dialect. Lower Rents **********Manufacturers are turning to China not just because of low wages and plentiful workers. Rents in Shenzhen are less than 8 cents a square foot, compared with nearly 60 cents a square foot in Hong Kong. Over all, Wisegroup says, the cost of production at its knitted-garments factory in Shenzhen is about 75 percent below that of production in Hong Kong. **********Other companies say the savings are much smaller. For example, Gartex Manufacturing Ltd., which makes woven trousers and shirts, puts the overall savings at 20 percent. **********As companies in China become more efficient and quality-conscious, they might be able to bypass Hong Kong managers, some executives say. Already some companies in China export directly and handle their own design and marketing. But their efforts usually are not as successful as those run by Hong Kong concerns. **********''It may take 5 or 10 years for China to establish its own reputation,'' said Thomas M. H. Chan, a specialist on business in China at Hong Kong University, ''so for that time period at least it must depend on Hong Kong.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/30/world/man-in-the-news-aw-shucks-premier-for-italy-giovanni-guiseppe-goria.html": {"writer_name": "Roberto Suro", "pub_date": "1987-07-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 758, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "'AW SHUCKS' PREMIER FOR ITALY: GIOVANNI GUISEPPE GORIA", "print_headline": "MAN IN THE NEWS; 'AW SHUCKS' PREMIER FOR ITALY: GIOVANNI GUISEPPE GORIA", "body_text": " **********Giovanni Goria likes to recall that his first big move into national politics, his appointment as Treasury Minister in 1982, came so unexpectedly that he had to borrow a friend's dark suit for the swearing-in ceremony. **********Dressed in slightly informal bluish-gray this morning, Mr. Goria took an oath that made him Prime Minister of Italy's 47th postwar Government. The man who describes himself as ''an accountant who's also a politician'' still expresses surprise at his own success, but by now a certain ''aw shucks'' modesty has become a well-developed part of Mr. Goria's political personality. **********Mr. Goria has retained the image of an outsider in Rome, although he has been in Parliament since 1976 and is a well-established player in the corridors where deal are made here. Behind a salt-and-pepper beard, Mr. Goria radiates an earnest lack of pretension, yet he is also one of the most effective and most visible television performers on the political scene. Youngest Leader Since War **********Mr. Goria, who will turn 44 years old on Thursday, is already the youngest man to lead Italy since the fall of Fascism. Now commentators are wondering whether he might also be the first to take full advantage of what is portrayed here as a gradual Americanization of politics, in which image has grown in importance at the expense of party machines. **********After he had finished reading the names of his Cabinet members in a live broadcast on Tuesday night, Mr. Goria added, under his breath, a slang expression that might translate as ''Oh Lord, wish us luck.'' **********Mr. Goria is going to need all the clever gestures, good luck and blessings he can get, according to most analysts. In a front-page editorial today, the Milan newspaper Il Giornale said: ''Goria clamorously blundered his entry on stage. It was not all his fault, but he is the one who lost face.'' **********Twice on Tuesday evening he had to postpone announcing the formation of his Government while the members of his five-party coalition haggled over the distribution of Cabinet posts. At one point, his aides suggest, the whole enterprise looked as if it was going to collapse after two weeks of negotiation, forcing Mr. Goria to announce that he had failed to form a consensus. **********The messy display of power brokering is being widely described today as a sign of the fragmented and highly combative political situation that Mr. Goria will have to manage. Born in the Piedmont **********Born on July 30, 1943, in Asti, the Piedmont town famous for its sparkling wines, Giovanni Giuseppe Goria is the son of a civil servant and a shopkeeper. He studied economics and worked at a local savings bank, but was already a card-carrying member of the Christian Democratic Party at age 17. His career advanced under the patronage of Ciriaco De Mita, now the party secretary, and he quickly became the Christian Democrats' most authoratative voice on economic matters. **********His wife, Eugenia, and their two children, ages 15 and 11, have remained in Asti. Mr. Goria, meanwhile, has kept a studio apartment in Rome, and he has become a familiar figure in the capital's fashionable restaurants and chic salons. He confesses to being ''a fugitive father,'' seeing his family only on some weekends. **********First as budget under secretary and then as Treasury Minister, Mr. Goria has played a central role in developing eonomic policy during a period that has seen Italy enjoy a boom in productivity and a sharp decline in inflation. Opinions are sharply divided over how much credit he deserves. **********Cutting the Government deficit at a time when Italy's boom appears to be leveling off is going to be as much a challenge for Mr. Goria as keeping the peace among his bickering coalition partners. **********The talents he brings to his new job were summed up by Indro Montanelli, editor of Il Giornale, who wrote: ''The man is certainly not a Bismarck or a Metternich. But he has a clean face, full of energy; he stirs up maternal instincts in women, and he also pleases men because among so many matadors he stands out with his air of a somewhat clumsy rustic.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/13/world/campaign-seeks-genocide-trial-of-khmer-rouge.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 870, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CAMPAIGN SEEKS GENOCIDE TRIAL OF KHMER ROUGE", "print_headline": "CAMPAIGN SEEKS GENOCIDE TRIAL OF KHMER ROUGE", "body_text": " **********A New York-based human rights organization has started a campaign to have the Khmer Rouge tried for genocide before the International Court of Justice. **********The Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia from 1975 to 1979 is blamed for more than a million deaths. **********The rights group, the Cambodia Documentation Commission, said last week that it believed it had assembled evidence to prove the Khmer Rouge actions were genocide as defined by the 1948 Genocide Convention drafted by the United Nations. The commission estimated that the Khmer Rouge had caused two to three million deaths. **********The commission's director said the group hoped to gain recognition for the Cambodians' suffering and put pressure on the Cambodian guerrilla coalition fighting the Vietnamese-backed Government to eject and punish Khmer Rouge factions. **********The case would mark the first ever considered by the World Court under the convention, which obligates governments to punish genocide offenders.

It requires signers to punish those the Court or relevant United Nations bodies find have committed genocide. U.N. Recognizes Coalition **********If the World Court decides against the Khmer Rouge, it could also rule against the Cambodian guerrilla coalition for not punishing Khmer Rouge offenders, Mr. Hawk said. **********A Vietnamese-backed Government has ruled most of Cambodia since Vietnam's invasion in 1979, but the United Nations recognizes a Cambodian coalition government that includes the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge, democratic factions and groups loyal to Prince Norodom Sihanouk. **********There is no precedent for enforcing the convention, but the commission believes the case would bring diplomatic pressure on the Cambodian coalition to ''get those most responsible for genocide out of their current positions, and out of the jurisdiction of democratic Kampuchea,'' Mr. Hawk said. **********A letter sent to President Reagan stressed that the group did not support the Vietnamese occupation or seek to weaken opposition to it. **********While the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, as the treaty is known, was signed by the United States, the Senate refused to approve it until October of last year for fear it was poorly drafted and might allow other governments to intervene in United States affairs. CONTROVERSY OVER TOLL **********BANGKOK, Thailand, April 12 -Controversy still surrounds the human toll the Khmer Rouge took during its years in power. **********David P.

Michael Vickery, who wrote the first standard contemporary history of the period, ''Cambodia: 1975-1982,'' accepts a slightly lower figure. **********Stephen R. Heder, a Khmer-speaking historian of Cambodia who is now on the Amnesty International staff in London, has in the past been quoted as accepting a figure of about 1 million to 1.5 million ''policy-related'' deaths, among them at least 100,000 executions. **********Speaking by telephone from Australia, Mr. Chandler, who is completing a history of Cambodia since 1945, acknowledged that other figures had been given, ranging from hundreds of thousands to three million, but he said they often reflect political viewpoints. **********He said he believed that the Vietnamese had overestimated the toll, while Thailand, which supports the Khmer Rouge in exile, had sought to underestimate it. Statistics on Cambodia's population in 1975 and now are considered unreliable by most experts. **********But Mr. Chandler said arguments over numbers were not the issue. **********''The important thing,'' he said ''is that Pol Pot was absolutely awful.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/26/business/business-people-collapse-fails-to-stop-an-investment-team.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1987-11-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 458, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Collapse Fails to Stop An Investment Team", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Collapse Fails to Stop An Investment Team", "body_text": " **********John K.

Physical therapy was called ''shake and bake.'' **********Today, Mrs. Reger describes herself as a ''biomechanic'' who fixes and prevents muscular-skeletal problems, adding that she looks at the patient as a whole, not just as someone with an aching or disabled part. She runs a busy physical-therapy department at Somerset Medical Center in Somerville, and takes several continuing-education courses a year to keep up with her rapidly expanding field. **********She also gets two or three calls a week from executive head-hunters who offer her jobs with starting salaries of $30,000 to $50,000 annually, and some partnership possibilities. **********So far Mrs. Reger is staying put. But more physical therapists are leaving institutions in New Jersey for higher-paying careers in community-based agencies, industry and doctors' offices, creating serious shortages in some hospitals and rehabilitation centers. **********Although the shortage of physical therapists is nationwide, analysts say the situation is aggravated in New Jersey by the state's aging population, tightly regulated hospital rates and, until recently, the existence of only one college in the state that granted physical-therapy degrees. Two new training programs are set to begin, but labor experts still foresee chronic shortages well into the next decade. **********There are currently about 2,650 physical therapists who possess New Jersey licenses, up from 2,053 in 1984, a 29 percent increase, but no one is sure how many are actually working in the state. In 1984, the latest year for which figures are available, there were 1.7 physical therapists for every 10,000 people in New Jersey, compared with 2.3 per 10,000 nationwide. **********''Physical therapists are being sought everywhere,'' said Royce Buczek, chairman of the state's Board of Physical Therapy, which licenses and regulates therapists. ''There are a wide range of opportunitites from school districts to nursing homes, from fitness centers to rehabilitation programs.'' **********In addition, a growing number of physical therapists are starting private practices. State law bars them from treating patients without a doctor's prescription, but a recent change in New Jersey regulations permits them to ''evaluate and educate'' patients without such a referral. Similar rules exist in 36 other states, including 14 where no prescriptions are needed to obtain physical therapy. **********While many therapists in New Jersey believe the regulation change will bring more consumers directly to their doors, the Medical Society of New Jersey, the state's largest doctors' organization, has challenged the new rule in court. Doctors maintain that it violates state law by allowing physical therapists to practice medicine. **********The need for more physical therapists remains undisputed, however, particularly for disabled elderly people and children with physical and developmental handicaps - who are eligible under Federal law for physical therapy services through their public schools. According to estimates from the state's Bureau of Occupational Research, the field will grow 44 percent from now until 1995, with 110 to 150 new openings each year. The bureau also predicts that 660 positions now filled will open up during that time. Some of those 660 vacancies will be created by therapists leaving salaried positions for per diem work with placement agencies or as private contractors. **********Ronnie Silver, director of the Hackensack, N.J., office of Midpoint Associated Practitioners, based in New York, which supplies speech and occupational therapists as well as physical therapists, said that her business had grown fivefold in the last 10 months, fueled by staff shortages and therapists' desire ''to earn what they are worth.'' For example, 34 of the 36 part-time physical therapists in the state-run day schools for profoundly handicapped children now are private contractors, up from 18 two years ago. As private contractors they receive $30 to $35 an hour, compared with $18.70 they earned as civil service employees. **********Hospitals and rehabilitation centers also are using at least some outside therapists. Although no current data are available, according to Susan Tobier, president of the New Jersey Council of Hospital Physical Therapy Directors, most departments are down at least one full-time physical therapist and some have half their positions open. In a 1983 survey, there were 100 vacancies in hospitals alone. ''Competition for physical therapists is very tight,'' Ms. Tobier said. ''Salaries have escalated very fast, more so than the average profession.'' **********A survey earlier this year conducted by the New Jersey Hospital Association found that the average hourly wage for physical therapists in acute-care and specialty hospitals had jumped 18 percent in two years, from $11.54 to $13.57. Hospital administrators in New Jersey still complain that state-set hospital rates have kept salary levels relatively low, making it difficult to compete with facilties in New York and Philadelphia as well as with unregulated health-care providers within the state. **********Therapists like Mrs. Reger who are still in hospitals say that the need for their services has intensified as cost-saving measures have cut the average patient's length of stay. ''We used to have more time to rehabilitate patients,'' she said. ''Now we have to work on getting them functioning quickly so they can leave the hospital sooner.''  Several New Uses **********Mrs. Reger, whose eight-member department has been short one therapist for two years, noted that hospitals are using physical therapy in new ways. Three days a week, her staff runs a lively rehabilitation program for heart-attack and coronary-bypass patients, and another for people with breathing problems. The ''back school,'' which teaches people how to avoid spinal trouble, is booked through December. And physical therapists regularly counsel young women in the medical center's Eating Disorders Program who have a history of over-exercising to lose weight. **********Outside hospitals, some therapists are finding new markets for their skills while others are combining several part-time jobs into challenging full-time careers. Wayne Rath and his wife, Jean, for example, run the Spine Center of New Jersey, a home-based private practice in Somerville specializing in the relief and prevention of neck and back pain. For two half-days a week, however, the Raths move to Ethicon Inc., in Somerville, which produces the materials surgeons use to close wounds. **********There, in addition to treating work-related injuries, the pair has developed group exercise routines designed to prevent the problems that can plague people with jobs involving repetitive motions. For example, in one Ethicon department, 40 channel swagers, who fuse fine strands of suture material with tiny needles thousands of times a day, perform two seven-minute exercise routines during their shifts to stretch their arms, rotate their heads and flex their wrists. Officials credit the effort with a sharp drop in hand, neck and lower-back injuries. **********Another therapist, Jean Thomas, provides physical therapy to homebound Medicare patients for the Visiting Nurse Association in Middlesex County and works with head-injury victims at a rehabilitation center in Rocky Hill. Recently she helped a 57-year-old woman who had lost an arm in an industrial fire learn to use a prosthesis. ''I can give quality care and still have a flexible schedule,'' explained Mrs. Thomas, who also maintains a small private home-care practice. **********Some physical therapists, like Jeffrey Manheimer, president of Delaware Valley Physical Therapy Associates in Lawrenceville, have developed specialties not always associated with the field. Once a week he teaches practicing dentists and physical therapists at the New Jersey Dental School in Newark how to treat patients with head and facial pain caused by jaw problems. **********Marilyn King, a full-time physical therapist for the Teaneck public Schools, treats children with perceptual problems. ''Some of these kids will put their names in the middle of the page instead of on the top, or they can't space their letters properly,'' Mrs. King said. ''I have a child crawl under bars, fit through spaces, find out how thick his arm is and learn how far his head is from his chest.'' she explained. ''Once he gets a feeling for how his body relates to his environment, he can master the finer movements needed for schoolwork.''  Easy to Fill Class **********With such a varied opportunities and rising salaries, officials of the two new physical-therapy training programs in New Jersey say they will have no trouble filling classes. The first 20 students will begin at Stockton State College in Pomona, near Atlantic City, in January. That two-year program, designed for upper-division students, will award bachelor of science degrees in physical therapy. **********The other new program is co-sponsored by Rutgers University Graduate School in Camden, where it is situated, and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, based in Newark. It will offer a master's degree in physical therapy, with the first class of 20 enrolling next fall. **********The only existing in-state physical therapy program, run by Kean College in Elizabeth and the University of Medicine and Dentistry, will award 32 bachelor of science degress this spring. **********Joseph Affanato is administrator of the Betty Bacharach Rehabilitation Hospital in Pomona, on the campus of Stockton State College, and was instrumental in setting up the physical therapy program there. He recalled recently that until now, New Jersey, the nation's fifth-largest industrial state with the second biggest geriatric population, only had one school for training physical therapists. ''Even with all three of the programs cranked up next year,'' he said, ''we will still be way behind the national per-capita average for physical therapists.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/28/business/company-news-genrad-to-close-testing-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-07-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 408, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Genrad to Close Testing Unit", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Genrad to Close Testing Unit", "body_text": " **********Genrad Inc. said today that it was discontinuing operations at its semiconductor test division in Milpitas, Calif.

Whenever possible, we will print a large number of the letters it elicits. **********This time, it was ''Misery on the Meatpacking Line'' by William Glaberson (June 14) that stirred up readers. Following are some of their comments. **********To the Editor: Your article on Morrell and the meatpacking industry was wonderful. The people in Sioux City and Sioux Falls are really thrilled. **********I think most of the people in these plants have assumed for a long time that getting hurt is just an inevitable risk of packinghouse work - unpleasant but unavoidable. So if the company did not worry much about safety, the workers took it in stride. Until now. Recent attention from outside the region (from Congress, from OSHA, from The New York Times) has led many packinghouse workers to revise their low expectations and see present conditions as unacceptable by any standard. Maybe the employers are seeing the same disturbing reflection. Hopefully, the upshot will be a safer industry. **********Thank you for helping us change this industry's practices and assumptions. ELEANOR KENNELLY  Director of Special Services, Food and Allied Service Trades Department, A.F.L.-C.I.O  Washington, D.C., June 19 **********To the Editor: It is clear that a lot of work went into Mr. Glaberson's piece, and I commend his effort. I do take exception, however, to some implications and omissions in the story. **********First, I am disappointed with the omission of relevant information we provided about safety initiatives and improvements in the meat industry. Specifically, there was no mention that the meat industry had the second best improvement rate of the 10 industries with the highest accident and injury rates in 1984-85. This improvement is significant and demonstrates concern and initiative on the industry's part. **********The headline and lead paragraphs indicate that this story is about the meatpacking industry. Yet, the story focused almost exclusively on one company - even though you spoke with officials at several other companies in interviews we helped arrange. **********I recognize these complex issues are difficult to cover in all aspects, but I do feel we deserved some recognition for the progress and attention being given to this issue.  C. MANLY MOLPUS  President, American Meat Institute  Washington, D.C., June 30 **********To the Editor: It was with great interest and a broken heart that I read your article. **********I quit my job on the kill floor of Monfort of Colorado's Grand Island, Neb., plant after four and a half years there. During most of that time I was actively involved in trying to form a union in order to curb the great excesses of management. **********I saw men and women stitched and in casts, one man walking slowly because of a painful back injury caused when a steer fell on him. People were called from their sick beds and told they would be fired if they did not come to work. The turnover rate, as best we could tell, was in excess of 100 percent. Many of us wondered where they all came from. **********Surely, I thought, these people would rise up angry. But we were unsuccessful in forming a union in two National Labor Relations Board elections, both marked by numerous charges against the company's anti-union campaign. **********Much has been made about packinghouse automation, but air knives and down pullers are not very new and conveyor belts do not sound like automation. The rise in productivity has been made simply by increasing the speed the cattle go down the line, and yelling at everyone to keep up. **********Surely, justice requires other than this. I have lost faith in a system that rewards excesses to the clear detriment of such a large number of people. LARRY PETTIT  San Francisco, June 15 **********To the Editor: One of the major goals of the Reagan Administration has been reducing government regulation of business - getting the government off the backs of the American people. Your article helps put this in prospective. More aggressive regulation could well have prevented the accidents Mr. Glaberson described, and others like them. Hopefully, the next administration, whether Republican or Democratic, will put the government back on our backs. JACK KAPLAN  Hamden, Conn., June 15 **********To the Editor: Your revelations are the kind I would rather shut my eyes to or not know about, but all the more important that you have exposed them. Naively, I thought this kind of inhuman treatment of workers had been eliminated by legislation and by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. How wrong I was.  HOPE COBB  Princeton, N.J., June 15 **********To the Editor: Mr. Glaberson provides a compelling, if depressing, insight into the corporate ethics of yet another American industry. The reader can only wonder if there is any morality at all guiding the operations of big business in America. THOMAS J. JOYCE  Monroe, N.Y., June 22 **********To the Editor: I read your horror story and gave it to read to those around me who usually don't look into the business section. I must say that I hardly believe your report. How can we understand that no union, no health or social administration puts an end to so much inhumanity in the workplace? I wonder what the public would say if we read such monstrosities out of Russia. We, I am constantly told, are a country that values life and the individual. Will anything be done soon? E. MARCU  New York, June 16 **********To the Editor: Your story is too familiar. People become ill, injured and killed in the workplace daily. **********Senior management must accept the responsibility to provide a safe workplace. Toward this end, their interest, support and active involvement are essential. In the cases where this corporate commitment has been effectively carried out, the record shows great achievement in avoiding injuries, illness and death. Further, the direct and indirect savings to these organizations represent a significant return on investment for the capital spent on effective safety programs. **********Workers have a similar responsibility to behave safely and act responsibly, but management's influence is paramount. People respond to management's philosphy and attitude. **********Articles such as this one help all of us by pointing out areas of real opportunity. Reducing cost and improving productivity is second only to the humanitarian benefits achieved through an effective safety program. ROBERT F.

Edelman and Dominion Textile Inc. hinted yesterday in a letter written to Burlington Industries that they might raise their joint bid for the company from $77 a share. **********The investor group was outbid on Wednesday by a leveraged buyout group led by Morgan Stanley & Company, which has offered $78 a share, or $2.5 billion on a fully diluted basis. **********The Edelman-Dominion group's letter advised Burlington that it was ''willing to consider raising the price'' if the company either unraveled certain agreements it made with Morgan Stanley or made the same benefits available to other bidders.

The valuations were part of a report that Paine Webber had prepared in an effort to interest Dominion in taking over the Greensboro company. **********The lawsuits' defendants - Mr. Edelman, Dominion, Paine Webber and Mr. Ammeen - are hoping the report will show that the valuations prepared by Paine Webber could not have relied upon inside information because they were off the mark, particularly in the case of those divisions under Mr. Ammeen's control. **********Paine Webber's sales estimates for each of the 24 divisions were off by at least $300,000 and by as much as $15 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/08/business/executive-changes-428087.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 312, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " **********Environmental Systems Co., Little Rock, Ark., which is involved in the incineration of hazardous wastes, said Joseph W.

As in ''Please don't squeeze the Charmin.'' **********The challenge for an advertising agency is to communicate a message about such a low-interest product in a memorable way. **********Just such a challenge faced Altschiller Reitzfeld when Georgia-Pacific, a client of some six years, assigned it a new premium two-ply product with four possible names. One of them, Angel Soft, hit the hot button at the agency. **********Out West the agency was already advertising the client's M.D. brand with pairs of cuddly little animals, because it is two-ply. Angels, of course, are much harder to find. **********But cherubs are like angels and babies are like cherubs, so all the agency really had to do was put wings on babies. Easier said than done, but it has been done and the advertising is now on network television. **********First, to get the tots, the production company R. Greenberg & Associates, which had been retained by the agency, contacted Herman & Lipson & Lipson, a casting firm, which in turn got in touch with 10 of perhaps 20 of the city's children's talent agents. **********Each sent 10 tads to the caster's place at 24 West 25th Street in Manhattan, where videotapes were made of each and every one of them. From the tapes the agency and the production company made the choice. **********Meanwhile the matter of wings had to be faced up to. You know how it is with cherubs. **********The solution came from the puppeteers at Three Design of 568 Broadway, who devised little flapping pink plush wings that they could operate from the end of a three- to four-foot pole. The wings were just held up behind the babes and flapped as they were being filmed. **********This was one of the ways the agency managed to keep down the costly optical work required when trick photography is used. **********The actual shooting was done at the Kaufman Astoria Studio in Queens, where the 30 selected kids were filmed, 10 a day, for three days and where a large room equipped with playpens was kept for their off-duty lounging pleasure. And, as required by state law, there was a nurse on duty, Mimi Plastek, who usually works at a Manhasset, L.I., health center. **********After the three days, Robert Reitzfeld, vice chairman and creative director of the agency, and Rosalind Greene, senior vice president and copy group head, had some thoughts on wee ones. **********''Some have it and some don't,'' Bob Reitzfeld said, adding that ''some have too much of it.'' **********''And personality has nothing to do with beauty,'' Roz Greene said. **********The two of them, along with David Altschiller, chairman, had created the spots. **********According to Mr. Reitzfeld, the law says that children 3 to 7 months of age may spend only six hours on the set with a camera schedule of half-hour-on and half-hour-off. The camera schedule holds true for children 7 months and up, except they can be on the set eight hours a day. **********Under the Screen Actors Guild contract, each tad got $333.25 for the day, which is merely the tip of the iceberg because if the spots run often enough they can make as much as $15,000 to $30,000, which isn't bad for a day's work. **********The agency has produced two 30-second spots and two 15-second spots, which began running a week ago. They are really delightful.  In the end, a dozen children were used, with one cuter than the next. **********What adds to the charm of the commercials is that the supplier of the voice-over is Sterling Holloway, who was the television voice of Winnie the Pooh. His voice was recorded in New York after being transmitted from the West Coast by satellite. **********Music for the spots was supplied by John Sebastian, who sang with the Lovin' Spoonful group of the 1960's. **********However, Advertising Age recently published an article that Georgia-Pacific was planning to spend $75 million for advertising and promotion over a six-month period in an effort to upgrade its Coronet line. Coronet Angel Soft is certainly such an attempt. **********In 1981, Media Decisions reported in 1983, Coronet was backed by only $1.4 million in advertising.

Should it be spent on education and social programs? Or should it be returned to the taxpayers? If the latter, would it be best to lower maximum tax rates and increase the capital gains exclusion, which might help the rich? **********THIRTY-FIVE states are likely to collect higher tax revenues in 1987 because of Federal tax revision, and there is much debate about what the states should do with this ''windfall.'' Should it be spent on education and social programs? Or should it be returned to the taxpayers? If the latter, would it be best to lower maximum tax rates and increase the capital gains exclusion, which might help the rich? Or would it be better to increase the standard deductions and the personal exemption, while lowering sales and property taxes, which might help the poor and middle-income people? **********These are all valid questions, but couching the issue in these terms diverts attention from the most important points. First, there is no ''windfall,'' only a federally mandated tax increase. Moreover, outside of New York and a few other high-tax states, the revenue gains will be slight - on average less than 5 percent of total tax collections. **********Far more important, Federal tax revision has presented the states with a historic opportunity to restructure, simplify and broaden their tax systems, increasing equity while fostering economic development. In fact, this is probably more than an opportunity; it may be an imperative. **********In an era when states are battling to build and sustain economic development efforts, those that resist the trend toward lower rates, a broad tax base, fewer incentives and a simpler tax structure may find themselves losing the competition. For states like New York, with taxes far above the national norm, lower rates are all the more important in attracting and retaining business. **********Over the last several months, in a study for the American Legislative Exchange Council, we worked with legislators and business representatives from all 50 states to identify the crucial areas of tax reform at the state level. Four things bear careful consideration: **********No. 1, the federally mandated tax increases must be returned. **********Second, as we said earlier, states need to emulate the Federal Government, flattening and reducing tax rates, particularly individual and corporate income taxes, while broadening their tax bases and making an effort to simplify the code. States that stimulate development through lower tax rates, rather than incentives, will prove most successful in attracting business in the years ahead. **********Third, states should abolish most incentives and preferences, seeking instead to equalize tax treatment of different industries. Through the years, states have fallen over themselves to offer businesses lucrative tax incentives, even though it has been demonstrated repeatedly that such incentives figure very little, if at all, in business location decisions. IN MANY states, the result is a hodge-podge of preferences that can severely distort investment decisions. A year from now, when most state tax revisions are complete, the states that have slashed rates while at the same time eliminating these and other preferences will be the most attractive for business. **********Fourth, all states should eliminate income tax burdens on the poor in conformity with the Federal definition. This is a matter not just of fairness but of efficiency. Traditionally, most of the states have relied on the Federal Government for taxpayer surveillance. When the Internal Revenue Service audited a taxpayer it would notify the state, which would then conduct its own audit. Under Federal tax revision, six million poor households have been relieved of their Federal income tax liabilities. To keep track of these poor taxpayers would be extremely costly for states. Whether for fairness or efficiency, it is again in the states' interest to emulate the Federal example. **********While they are reviewing their tax systems, states should also consider the role of excise, sales and minimum taxes. Excise taxes are imposed in a selective manner on a narrow segment of a state's tax base, such as liquor, gasoline or tobacco. These taxes should be either eliminated or incorporated in a general broadening of the sales tax. **********Many analysts object to sales taxes as regressive, but this need not be so. Sales taxes could be broadened to include such items as personal services, food and medicine. With the broadening, the overall rate could be lowered, while certain items (such as food and medicine) could be taxed at lower rates. **********Tax revision is particularly important in high-tax states like New York, whose state and local tax burden is 50 percent above the national average. Moreover, the unnecessary complexity of the New York State tax code and tax forms produces a tremendously high compliance cost. Simplification does not necessarily mean that you forfeit revenue. Indeed, simplification can often generate additional revenue. **********After the dust settles, businesses will begin once again to assess state tax systems, looking at the overall burden and complexity. If New York and other high-tax states simply return the windfall but fail to lower rates and restructure their systems, their competitive position may deteriorate. **********In sum, what is important is the overall level of state and local taxation. The best tax incentive of all is a broad-based tax structure that levies taxes uniformly at low rates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/30/business/purchase-by-ge-credit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 115, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Purchase by G.E.

Dove 3d, a former Drexel employee and currently a top money manager for the Clarendon Group, a Bermuda-based holding company, the S.E.C. had been gathering records on a number of other big Drexel junk bond customers. **********Though the S.E.C. has subponeaed Mr. Dove, it does not mean that he has violated any laws. Often the agency subpoenas many sources to assemble enough information to bring a case. Tip-Off Possibility Studied **********Attorneys close to the Government's investigation say that one focus of the S.E.C. inquiry is the possibility that Drexel may have tipped off large investors about upcoming takeover bids as part of its process of trying to raise capital for the deals. Drexel is well known for its ability to raise large amounts of financing for such bids by lining up junk bond buyers. **********Drexel's chief executive, Fred Joseph, has said in the past that the firm has had to experiment with several methods to try to get commitments from investors to buy the bonds without providing secret inside information about the deals that some might trade on illegally. **********Mr. Joseph has acknowledged that on occasion it appeared that there had been insider trading, but that he did not know if it emanated from Drexel's junk bond buyers. As a result of those suspicions, Mr. Joseph said that the firm eventually changed its practice several years ago and no longer gave out any advance information about pending takeover bids. **********''The S.E.C is definitely worried that Drexel clients on a regular basis misappropriated confidential takeover information, bought stock based on these feelers and repeated violate the securities laws,'' said one lawyer who requested anonymity. ''If you look at it, it is almost a fail-safe system.'' However, the sources add that, without hard evidence that such an informal system was intended to encourage insider trading by both Drexel officials and its clients, the S.E.C. will have a difficult time proving such a case. Linked to Boesky Case **********The investigation of Drexel's clients grows out of the Government's $100 million insider trading case against Ivan F. Boesky. **********In addition to Mr. Dove, the S.E.C. has served subpoenas on the Clarendon Group and Clarendon's president, Rodrigo Rocha. Two years ago, Mr. Dove left Drexel to manage Clarendon's multibillion-dollar portfolio. **********With the Dove and Clarendon subpoena, the S.E.C. is seeking information from one of Drexel's largest buyers of junk bonds - perhaps its largest, according to Wall Street sources. **********One of Clarendon's primary business activities involves borrowing funds that city and local government have raised through municipal bond offerings but have yet to spend. Clarendon then guarantees the local governments a certain rate of return and repayment of the loan through its insurance company, and then reinvests the funds in high-risk bonds. **********''They essentially are living on spreads, and they are working with huge amounts of money,'' said one Wall Street source familiar with the company. ''Their return is often 400 to 500 basis points,'' or 4 to 5 percentage points. None Specifically Named **********According to Lionel Pashkoff, attorney for Clarendon and Mr. Dove, who is with the Washington law firm of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Unterberg, Manley, Myerson & Casey, none of the Clarendon parties are specifically named in the S.E.C. formal order of investigation. Naming them would have been a sure indication that the Government suspected them of illegal activities. ''The order just says, 'In the matter of trading in certain securities,' '' Mr. Pashkoff said. He added that he understood other Drexel clients had received similar subpoenas for information. **********In 1982, Mr. Dove was charged with trading on insider information in connection with the Advent Corporation. At a time when he was a consultant to Advent's board, and just before the company declared bankruptcy, Mr. Dove sold Advent stock short and reaped a profit of $22,000, according to the S.E.C. He settled the case in June 1982, by agreeing to disgorge the illegal profits, while neither admitting nor denying guilt. **********Mr. Dove has offices in Beverly Hills and London and manages Clarendon's assets through the Garrison Capital Corporation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/28/business/business-digest-monday-september-28-1987.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 390, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1987", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1987", "body_text": " **********Companies **********Warren Buffett agreed to buy a 12 percent stake in Salomon for $700 million.

The F.D.A. also claims home tests are as effective as their counterpart diagnostic kits used in ''clinical settings'' - tests performed in commercial laboratories, doctors' offices and hospitals. The unfortunate truth is that the F.D.A. has no effectiveness standards for professionally performed tests, let alone at-home tests. **********When queried directly, an F.D.A. spokesman admitted that such ''standards'' are not official written policy. They are instead ''verbal expressions'' offered by scientists at the F.D.A.'s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. In other words, effectiveness standards for medical tests are wishful thinking. **********What is more, the agency also maintains that, prior to sale, every medical test, whether for expert or home use, has demonstrated its safety by proving the device or product will not cause injury. Safety must be considered relative since it is evaluated by weighing a test's probable benefits to health against its possible harm. But the F.D.A.'s claims contradict a Congressional report that states that proof that a medical test will never cause injury or will always be effective is not a requirement for agency approval. **********A bit of background: prior to 1976, there were no regulations governing the use of any medical test, device or procedure. Then Congress passed a law that required the F.D.A. to guarantee any medical device used for diagnostic purposes as effective and safe prior to being marketed. Through the ensuing years, medical test devices, along with their related chemical components, were ultimately placed in three classes, primarily associated with their potential for harm but with no reference to effectiveness. **********Class I tests were considered to have the least danger - akin to drugs that can be purchased without a prescription. Thermometers and blood testosterone tests are in Class I. Tests assigned to Class II were those the agency felt could be unsafe if randomly used. These tests were supposed to meet stringent performance standards. Simple urine sugar tests and even blood thyroid tests are in this broad category. As of this year, for the nearly 2,000 test devices allocated to Class II, not one performance standard has been set. **********Class III devices are deemed so dangerous that they are ostensibly required to prove their safety before marketing. Class III includes all new diagnostic devices such as magnetic resonance imagers, AIDS antibody tests and catheters used for X-rays of the heart's circulation. **********But, F.D.A. ''approval'' does not take into account who uses a specific test device once it is sold. This means the agency cannot be blamed for a mistake in reading an X-ray picture, a false-positive AIDS test or a heart catheter that causes, rather than helps diagnose, heart damage. **********The F.D.A. has approved the use of contrast media (dye-like substances injected or swallowed that stand out on an X-ray); ergo, they must be at least 95 percent effective as well as safe. But to doctors, effectiveness is equated with accuracy; it cannot be relative when a life depends on the proper diagnosis. Yet X-ray specialists admit in their own professional journals that contrast media X-rays of the gall bladder are less than 50 percent accurate and that at least 800 people die each year from a reaction to the contrast substances. **********While keeping in mind that the stress electrocardiogram also has the F.D.A.'s imprimatur, in reality this test is rated from only 12 to 50 percent accurate when used to detect heart disease in healthy people. In patients with known heart disease, the test has been shown to be wrong at least half the time. **********AS for safety, for every 10,000 people who perform on a treadmill, while the electrocardiogram is taken, four suffer heart attacks and one dies as a consequence of the test. **********Possibly the worst example of test ineffectiveness is the one for blood cholesterol. The College of American Pathologists, the peer group for laboratory testing, recently sent out an ''unknown'' blood sample to 5,000 laboratories to measure this test's accuracy. Less than half of the laboratories surveyed came within the 95 percent effectiveness range claimed by the F.D.A. **********Experts in the field blame the errors on the so-called ''standards'' used for calibration of test instruments and the controls used to monitor the determinations. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Standards obviously agrees and is now in the process of trying to correct the problem. Considering the facts, the Commerce Department and the Centers for Disease Control are not in error when they call the cholesterol test inaccurate. **********It is wrong, and even dangerous, for the F.D.A. to tell the public that home medical tests are as accurate as their counterparts done in clinical settings, since neither has any official accuracy standards at this time. This does not mean medical tests are bad. Rather, they are diagnostic adjuncts and should not be considered innocuous. The F.D.A., in spite of its boasts, does not deny that the standards for medical tests approval are less rigorous than would be required for the sale of a prescription drug. Unfortunately, however, even the F.D.A.'s drug evaluations no longer appear as stringent as they once were in the effort to hasten the availability of a new drug."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/15/business/company-news-lamaur-bars-bid.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 76, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lamaur Bars Bid", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Lamaur Bars Bid", "body_text": " **********Lamaur Inc., a Minneapolis-based marketer of hair-care products, said today it rejected a sweetened $135 million takeover bid by the Alberto-Culver Company as inadequate.

Secrecy Laws Are Extensive **********The British Government uses extensive secrecy laws to exercise some of the most far-reaching powers over the press in the Western world. Critics have complained that successive Prime Ministers protect their predecessors from late emerging accusations, in effect, by staunchly defending their own perogatives under the official secrets act. **********At the same time, the British public is treated to an endless, confusing array of articles in the newspapers rooted in rumors of double-agent ''moles'' and compromising homosexuality in the highest levels of the intelligence services. **********The precise truth of these articles and the extent of possible official damage often is never clearly ascertained, in part because Britain has no constitution for providing the extensive investigation powers akin to those of the United States Congress. Amid the latest such rumor barrage, Prime Minister Thatcher confirmed last week that Sir Maurice Oldfield, the late director of M.I.6, another intelligence agency, was a homosexual, but she offered no other details. **********Mr. Wright charges that M.I.5, which specializes in counterintelligence, was penetrated by Soviet agents - a scandal well known now for years - and that it also regularly engaged in unlawful activities inside Britain. Most of the charges have long since been published, although often left unverified, and that fact was part of Mr. Wright's defense. **********The Government accuses Mr. Wright of violating his promise as a British agent not to disclose the inner workings of M.I.5, where he served as a high-ranking official until retirement in 1976."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/08/business/consumer-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONSUMER RATES", "print_headline": "CONSUMER RATES", "body_text": " **********In percent"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/03/business/advertising-interpublic-to-acquire-marketel-publim-office.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1987-08-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Interpublic to Acquire Marketel/Publim Office", "print_headline": "Advertising; Interpublic to Acquire Marketel/Publim Office", "body_text": " **********McCann-Erickson, one of the Interpublic Group of Companies, has reached an agreement to acquire Marketel/Publim's office in Montreal, which is billing about $60 million. **********It plans to merge it with its own Montreal office, billing a measly $15 million, and name the new unit Marketel/McCann-Erickson. **********The merger will not affect the McCann-Erickson offices in Toronto or Vancouver, or the Marketel/Publim office in Quebec."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/20/business/week-in-business-boesky-gets-jail-for-insider-role.html": {"writer_name": "Jack Lynch", "pub_date": "1987-12-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 598, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Boesky Gets Jail For Insider Role", "print_headline": "WEEK IN BUSINESS; Boesky Gets Jail For Insider Role", "body_text": " **********Ivan F.

It starts Jan. 1. **********In recent years China has sharply boosted production capacity for these products, which are now its main source of foreign earnings. In the last year China replaced Taiwan as the leading supplier to the United States. **********Moreover, textile and apparel sales here contributed heavily to the $3.1 billion trade surplus that China recorded with the United States in the first 10 months of this year. **********Under the memorandum of understanding - initialed at 1 A.M. by the chief American textile negotiator, William H. Houston 3d, and China's chief negotiator, Li Guo Dong - the growth rate of China's exports will be cut back to 3 percent from the 19 percent prevailing since July 1983. **********The United States has recently negotiated long-term textile agreements with the four other major suppliers -Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan - curbing their export growth to around 1 percent. China was given a higher rate, an American spokesman, Gary Holmes, explained, because it is poorer country and because textiles are a much more important factor in the Chinese economy than in the four others. **********The agreement settles an issue that has long been a point of friction between the two countries. **********Chinese sensitivity was demonstrated in 1983 when it banned further purchases of cotton, soybeans and chemical fibers from the United States in retaliation for quotas on certain textile products that were unilaterally imposed a few months earlier by the Reagan Administration. The sanctions imposed by both countries were lifted when the two nations concluded their first major textile agreement in July of that year. **********But textiles are also a highly sensitive subject in the United States. The pact has already touched off complaints from domestic producers and their supporters on Capitol Hill, who feel the United States was too generous with the Chinese. **********Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, said in the Senate this morning that the agreement was a ''giveaway'' that will cost ''untold thousands of American jobs.'' **********According to Robert G. Laidlaw, president of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, the industry's lobbying organization, the Administration has ''sent a clear signal that the import problem will continue and the textile and trade deficit will worsen.'' **********Domestic producers have been seeking legislation that would impose even tighter curbs on imports. **********A bill that passed the House over Administration opposition last September would cut imports from all countries to 1 percent growth. The vote was 263 to 156 - still 27 votes shy of the 290 needed to guaranty an override of an almost certain Presidential veto. **********A parallel bill has yet to reach the floor of the Senate. Backers expect it to be voted on sometime next year, making textile trade into an election issue. **********The industry had earlier maneuvered quota legislation through both chambers only to have Mr. Reagan's veto sustained by the House in 1986. **********The five countries where the United States now has long-term pacts supply 50 percent of American imports. The United States Trade Representative, Clayton K. Yeutter, said the five agreements, combined with other international undertakings, ''solve the problem of textile and apparel import surges into the United States.'' **********He noted that recent figures showing large profits for domestic textile and apparel manufacturing companies ''would suggest that these companies are already reaping the benefits of our earrlier negotiating successes.'' **********But a representative said the reason for the high profits was an investment of $8 billion in plant modernization and equipment since 1981, which is now endangered by import rises. **********In the first 10 months of this year China was the 13th largest trading partner of the United States.

Charges Are Denied **********American officials and several of those accused of illegal activity by the two journalists have repeatedly denied the accusations. Some American officials contend that the two reporters are political activists and that they have created a conspiracy theory to press their opposition to American policy in Central America. **********Mr. Avirgan and Ms. Honey, who are husband and wife, deny that they are biased. They base their assertions on their investigation of a bombing that almost killed rebel leader Eden Pastora in 1984 as he spoke to a crowded news conference. The blast killed at least four people and wounded more than 20, including Mr. Avirgan. **********The suit, which the Christic Institute filed on behalf of Ms. Honey and Mr. Avirgan in Miami last year before the Iran-contra scandal was disclosed, charges that 29 men conspired to run guns, deal drugs and kill Mr. Pastora in an illegal effort to press the contra war from Costa Rica. **********The lawsuit does not charge that the C.I.A. was involved but does name some former senior officials of the agency. Drugs were sold, the suit charges, to buy guns for the rebels, though it is not clear who was in charge of the shipments. Iran-Contra Figures Are Named **********Those named in the suit include Richard V. Secord, the retired general who was the point man in setting up a secret supply network for the contras overseen by former White House aide Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North. Also named are contra leader Adolfo Calero and Robert Owen, Mr. North's emissary to the contras. **********Mr. Secord, Mr. Calero and Mr. Owen have denied the accusations against them. **********Several news organizations, as well as Congressional investigators, have looked into the allegation that drugs were sold to buy weapons for the contras, and have so far been unable to prove it. **********Mr. Avirgan is a television cameraman who has worked for ABC, CBS and the BBC in England. Ms. Honey has been a stringer for several newspapers, including The New York Times and now writes for the Times of London and the Sunday Times of London. Journalists Got Too Close **********Their investigations apparently worried members of Mr. North's secret contra supply network. An ex-C.I.A. agent, Glenn A. Robinette, told Congressional investigators that Mr. Secord paid him $100,000 last year to investigate Mr. Avirgan and Ms. Honey in order to develop ''derogatory'' information about them. **********Mr. Robinette said he came to Costa Rica and paid people for information. Mr. Secord has said he paid Mr. Robinette to investigate the two reporters only because they were close to revealing Mr. North's secret contra supply network. **********Mr. Secord has denied involvement with any conspiracy that involved drug-dealing or the attempt to kill Mr. Pastora. **********In the last year, Mr. Avirgan and Ms. Honey say they have received numerous anonymous death threats, and their lawyers and friends have been detained and harassed by the Costa Rican narcotics police, who have received training and funding from the American Embassy here. In addition, the two reporters, who have lived here for four years, say their house has been burglarized three times. Targets of a Setup **********Last month, they were the targets of what one Costa Rican official called a clumsy setup that involved mailing a package of cocaine to them, supposedly sent by Nicaraguan Interior Minister Tomas Borge. Two weeks ago, a rightist political group unsuccessfully demanded that the two reporters be expelled as ''spies.'' **********A senior Costa Rican official said a review had shown that Mr. Avirgan and Ms. Honey had broken no laws. **********Three drug-traffickers now imprisoned in the United States have told reporters and Congressional investigators that some drug planes were allowed to land in the area in northern Costa Rica from which the contras operated. Guns were also run to the rebels, according to several ex-contras and mercenaries. In addition, someone built and planted a very professional bomb that almost killed Mr. Pastora. **********But American officials say the drug trafficking, gun-running and the bombing are separate events that do not, as the two reporters contend, form part of a conspiracy. Theory on Assassination **********The man who tried to kill Mr. Pastora has never been found. American officials assert he was an agent of the Sandinistas, a claim they have not proved. In their investigation, Mr. Avirgan and Ms. Honey concluded that Mr. Pastora's rightist opponents within the contra movement hired a Libyan assassin named Amac Galil to plant the bomb. **********The two journalists have a witness, a former contra adviser named Jack Terrell, who told a Costa Rican court last year that he was in a meeting where the bomb attack and other plans to kill Mr. Pastora were discussed with senior contra officials, including Mr. Calero, and an American rancher here named John Hull. **********Mr. Calero and Mr. Hull have denied ever discussing killing Mr. Pastora. **********Mr. Avirgan and Ms. Honey contend that the contras killed a key source of theirs to keep him from talking. The two say they never met their source, but they communicated with him through a Costa Rican carpenter. Victims of a Hoax? Critics of the two journalists say they are victims of a hoax or have created a tale conveniently based on a witness who cannot be produced. **********The journalists have also charged that American Embassy officials here had obstructed their investigative efforts on two occasions. **********Two mercenaries arrested while aiding the contras here, Steven Carr and Robert Thompson, have told reporters that American Embassy officials helped them jump bail last year and escape from Costa Rica. Mr. Carr, a principal source for Mr. Avirgan and Ms. Honey, died of a cocaine overdose after reaching the United States. **********An embassy spokesman confirmed that embassy officials had met the two mercenaries, but denied they helped them leave Costa Rica. **********The one sustained official investigation here of the bombing foundered when the Costa Rican policeman in charge of the case dropped the inquiry in 1985. Mr. Avirgan and Ms. Honey contend that the American Embassy offered the policeman a chance to study in the United States on the condition that he leave immediately, forcing him to drop the investigation. **********The American Embassy spokesman said that while the policeman had been sent to study in the United States, the trip had been approved in advance."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/24/business/advertising-mt-sinai-s-multimedia-campaign.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1987-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 629, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mt.

Sinai's Multimedia Campaign", "body_text": " **********THE 134-year-old Mount Sinai Medical Center has been driven by circumstance into 20th-century marketing and will soon be unleashing its first multimedia advertising campaign. The theme, created by the year-old Grace & Rothschild agency, is ''Take Good Care of Yourself.'' **********The two 30-second commercials will begin to run Thursday on all local commercial channels as well as on Channel 13 and several health-related cable programs. **********That along with radio, newspaper and magazine advertising will, in the belief of Natal K. Matschulat, vice president, marketing and development, give Mount Sinai the loudest hospital voice in New York and perhaps in the nation. Hospitals have become intensely competitive in trying to fill their beds, and she will not disclose for publication the size of her ad budget, which is sizable in light of the limited area involved. **********Ms. Matschulat, with packaged-goods marketing and agency experience, has in a year with the hospital established its first marketing department, staffed with five professionals. Now she is prepared to do something about getting a better share for Mount Sinai in a marketplace where hospitals are operating with 81 percent of their beds filled, in comparison with 96 percent two years ago. **********The difficulty with hospital advertising is that persuading a potential patient to go to a particular hospital is not enough because the patient, except in emergency cases, cannot check himself in. So the advertising aims to get consumers to seek out physicians connected with the hospital and to get physicians with more than one hospital affiliation to increase the traffic they send to Mount Sinai. And it would not hurt if the advertising also engendered a giving spirit among potential contributors to the current $165 million building fund. **********''We were looking for advertising to give the hospital a personality,'' Ms. Matschulat said, ''a personality of top medical care. Fortunately, we had the kind of a staff to justify that kind of claim.'' **********''Top doctors equal top medicine,'' said Roy Grace, the agency's chairman. **********''And top-quality medical care is the bottom line to the consumer,'' added Ms. Matschulat. **********To get across this message of a superior staff leading to superior care, the TV spots will use a series of vignettes, each about someone in a far-off land who has been helped toward a healthier existence by Mount Sinai Medical Center. **********Each commercial opens with a description of three people who have been aided and ends with the voice-over saying, ''And while people around the world have been helped by procedures developed by doctors at Mount Sinai, people in New York can be helped by something even better: the doctors themselves.'' **********The radio advertising will be pretty much the same but lengthened to a more leisurely 60 seconds. **********''And it has to be human, not haughty, relating to people, yet dignified,'' Mr. Grace said.

''I think my responsibility is overwhelming, and I sincerely apologize.'' **********Together, the two main opposition candidates, Kim Dae Jung and Kim Young Sam, received 55 percent of the vote, while Roh Tae Woo, the ruling party candidate, won with just 37 percent. Kim Dae Jung's apology didn't mean he believed the opposition defeat was his fault, however; he continued to charge that election fraud would have made it impossible for the opposition to win in any case. **********Mr. Kim's apology comes at a time when opposition groups seem demoralized and uncertain over their next step. Faced with public anger over the opposition split, they are debating whether to stage a full-scale drive to overturn the elections. Such a call for nationwide demonstrations worked in June, forcing the Government to reverse itself and allow direct presidential elections, but it is by no means clear that the public would take to the streets again this time around. No Move to Reunify Opposition **********Moreover, the opposition remains divided from a campaign in which the two Kims issued increasingly angry denunciations of each other. And many politicians want to focus on legislative elections, which the ruling party now would like to schedule for early February, before Mr. Roh takes power. **********Choi Jang Jip, an associate professor of political science, said that for the most part, people are not eager to demonstrate. ''People are exhausted and disappointed,'' he said. **********Mr. Kim did not issue a direct call for demonstrations in his statement, although he said he would join in the struggle of students, workers, farmers and religious leaders to overturn the election. But he said he opposed violence. **********''I think it's only natural that I should join them in this struggle and sacrifice myself in this fight,'' he said. ''I denounce violence and disorder, and I sincerely hope that our young men and democratic citizens will no longer be sacrificed.'' Fraud Is Still Emphasized **********Mr. Kim also detailed a long list of examples of election fraud. Indeed, the bulk of his statement was devoted to a discussion of fraud. **********''This was a rigged election, orchestrated by big money, Government power and the mass media,'' he said. ''Thousands and thousands of specific cases of fraud were committed throughout the election process. Under such circumstances, no opposition party, even in a developed nation, could have won.'' **********Kim Young Sam also repeated his earlier apologies over the failure to field a single candidate, but like Kim Dae Jung he did not accept full responsibility for the opposition defeat. **********''It is clear that the major reason I didn't win the election is because of the well-organized corrupt election practices,'' he told reporters this morning. **********On Monday, he called for people to join him in resisting the results of the election. ''I announce that this election is completely annulled,'' he said.

Adelman, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said that one ranking Soviet official stressed the need to conclude the treaty by Nov. 15 so that a summit meeting could be held next month.

The Soviet leader, Mikhail S.

Shultz went to Moscow - that it be allowed to keep a small force of shorter-range missiles until West Germany's 72 Pershing 1A missiles are eliminated. The United States had rejected this demand because it does not want a precedent for including the forces of other countries in a Moscow-Washington accord. **********But on Thursday in Moscow, a compromise was worked out under which almost all American and Soviet shorter-range missiles would be eliminated within 12 to 18 months, Mr. Adelman said. The Soviet Union would be allowed to keep 80 to 100 shorter-range missiles for about two and half years. America would be allowed to keep a similar number of Pershing 1A's on its territory for the same period. Exchange of Data **********This compromise would let the Russians maintain that they were keeping some shorter-range missiles to offset the West German force. And the United States would be able to assert that the Soviet Union was not being compensated for the West German missiles. **********Bonn has assured Moscow that all the West German missiles will be eliminated when all American and Soviet missiles are eliminated under the treaty. American and Soviet medium-range missiles are to be eliminated within three years after a pact. **********On other issues, both sides agreed to exchange data on missiles in Geneva on Monday. And they agreed on a schedule for dismantling medium- and shorter-range missiles. **********In addition, Soviet officials reportedly were more receptive to the American idea of ''challenge'' inspections on short notice when treaty violations are suspected. The United States wants its officials to carry out such inspections within six hours of arriving on Soviet territory. The Russians are now more open to the idea of quicker inspections if weather permits. Differences Remain **********But important differences remain on how to conduct such inspections. The United States is still insisting that they be confined to the United States and the Soviet Union. It also wants the right to inspect some facilities for mobile long-range missiles to make sure that they do not hide medium-range or shorter-range missiles. The United States is no longer insisting that installations for all long-range land-based missiles be open to inspection. **********The Soviet Union wants to broaden the inspections to include Western Europe and other countries. Soviet officials suggested that there could be continuous monitoring outside some types of SS-25 mobile long-range missile installations to insure that the medium-range missiles are not hidden inside.

The military said the arrests were made after the authorities met resistance to a search for weapons.  [ In Washington, a senior State Department official said that Colonel Diaz had been arrested and that the United States government was certain that he was in good health even though the armed forces used tear gas and guns in making the arrest. ]  Reports on Casualties Conflict Accounts from Panama said the siege at Colonel Diaz's home went on for four hours and included rifle and automatic-weapons fire and the use of tear gas. **********The Panamanian Army said there were no deaths or injuries in the shootout, although there were other reports of one or more deaths. **********The army crackdown came on the first day of what appeared to be the most effective opposition general strike in a prolonged showdown between civilian opposition parties and the regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. Opposition leaders strongly criticized the army's actions and promised further protests. Capital Reported Paralyzed **********''Each day we are living in a more typical repressive dictatorship led by a military chief who is rejected by society but who maintains himself by force,'' Ricardo Arias Calderon, the chief opposition leader and head of the Christian Democratic Party, said in a telephone interview.  [ In Washington, American policy makers said they were expecting opposition to military rule to increase as a result of the latest crackdown. Page A6. ] **********The general strike that began today reportedly closed down the capital as well as other major cities in a strong repudiation of the regime. A Western diplomat reached by telephone said the capital was ''closed up like a Sunday afternoon.'' **********Panama has been in political turmoil for two months, since Colonel Diaz, the former No. 2 man in the army, publicly denounced General Noriega and repeated longstanding accusations that the general has been involved in running drugs, stealing votes, killing political opponents and other forms of corruption. Protests Have Grown **********The denunciation touched off civil protests that grew stronger as Colonel Diaz shut himself in his home and continued to denounce the army-backed dictatorship he had so recently served. He sought to protect himself from reprisal by relying on dozens of armed bodyguards and the Roman Catholic Archbishop's public pledge of political asylum. **********According to diplomats and Panamanian politicians reached by telephone today, two army helicopters backed by army units attacked Colonel Herrera's home early this morning, and a prolonged exchange of gunfire ensued. **********There were conflicting accounts of the outcome of the attack. Mr. Arias said in a telephone interview that several people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred told him the assault lasted an hour and a half, starting at 6 A.M. with helicopters bombarding Colonel Diaz's house with tear gas canisters. The army later asserted that the gunfire lasted seven minutes.  Maj. Edgardo Lopez, head of the military press office, said this evening that Colonel Diaz had been placed ''under the Attorney General's custody'' and said it was likely that the prisoner would face a variety of criminal charges, including illegal weapons possession and sedition. **********Major Lopez denied that the colonel had been injured, contradicting a report by Alvin Weeden, Colonel Diaz's lawyer, who said that he had been told by Roman Catholic Church officials that the colonel had been wounded, but that they did not know the extent of his injuries. Main Newspaper Closed **********In addition, policemen closed and occupied the main opposition newspaper, La Prensa, on Sunday night, charging that it had ''incited the disturbance of public order,'' Winston Robles, the newspaper's editor, said in a telephone interview. **********The editors of El Extra and El Siglo, two smaller opposition papers, said they also had been shut down. **********At the same time, President Eric Arturo Delvalle's office issued a decree effectively censoring all radio and television stations. The decree said they would lose their right to broadcast if they announced anything deemed prejudicial ''to public order.'' **********Mr. Robles said he did not know how long the occupation of his paper would last. It has been among the strongest critics of General Noriega. **********Several Panamanians reached by telephone said that the main afternoon television newscast today contained no news about the army crackdown and that the announcer told listeners that a military censor was in the studio. Ready for a Fight **********The attack on Colonel Diaz and the closing of the press appear likely to raise tensions that have been building over the last seven weeks as protests have grown against what appears to be the last traditional military dictatorship in Central America. After several shootings, an attack on the United States Embassy that appeared to have army backing, and indications that General Noriega is determined to hang on to power, the Reagan Administration has increasingly criticized the general's monopolization of power and has distanced itself from his regime. **********But Mr. Noriega, who has a reputation as one of the toughest and shrewdest military dictators in recent Latin American history, appears ready to put up a hard fight. **********He and his predecessors have built a political organization that dominates the country by controlling key businesses, the government press and the official government party while reportedly paying off, threatening or even killing opponents."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/04/business/about-real-estate-brooklyn-neighborhood-helps-revive-storefronts.html": {"writer_name": "Shawn Kennedy", "pub_date": "1987-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 865, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BROOKLYN NEIGHBORHOOD HELPS REVIVE STOREFRONTS", "print_headline": "ABOUT REAL ESTATE; BROOKLYN NEIGHBORHOOD HELPS REVIVE STOREFRONTS", "body_text": " **********A year ago not one of the 14 storefronts on Nostrand Avenue between Martense Street and Linden Boulevard in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn held a business. Some had stood empty as long as eight years. **********Today every space has a new tenant and a fresh look. The spaces were leased within a few weeks last fall after Avi Raz, the new owner of the building where the stores are situated, put more than $1 million into renovating them. Now all of the shops -which include an ice cream parlor, a pet shop, two shoe stores, a video store and a women's dress shop -have new interiors and identical green and white awnings. The merchants pay up to $1,700 a month. **********The renewed business strip is the centerpiece of a commercial revitalization effort led by the Erasmus Neighborhood Federation, formed in 1978. It started an economic development arm in 1980 to halt the decline of the area's shopping streets. **********According to Barbara Wolff, a vice president of New York City's Public Development Corporation, over the last three years the Erasmus Neighborhood Federation has used $137,000 in grants from the city's Office of Business Development to help store owners refresh their space and bring new investment to the area.   $ ? * * **********The redevelopment effort started with a $115,000 grant for new exterior signs and refurbished interiors for 16 businesses in the redevelopment area. It runs on Nostrand Avenue from Linden Boulevard to Snyder Avenue and on Church Avenue from Bedford Avenue to Brooklyn Avenue. **********''Our overall objective was to fill some of the empty spaces,'' said V. Renee Williams, executive director of the Erasmus Neighborhood Federation. ''But rather than start from scratch we wanted to do something first that would strengthen the existing businesses, show the community that things were improving and attract outside investment.'' **********Last year the organization received a $72,000 grant to continue the program of facade improvement and to strengthen security. This year the group is working with an additional $15,000 in grant money. **********The key to success of the economic development effort, Ms. Williams said, was a series of commercial market reports, land use surveys and population studies done with help from the Pratt Institute Center for Community and Ecomomic Development and the city's Department of Planning. The group used the reports to determine what types of businesses the community needed. **********One study, for example, indicated that the neighborhood could support an additional 23,000 square feet in supermarket businesses, 9,000 feet in clothing and general merchandise stores, 4,500 feet of fast-food businesses and 1,000 square feet in stores that sold personal care products. **********''We live in the area and knew that people here had money to spend,'' said Mildred Keel-Williams, project director for the economic development arm. ''But the reports were proof that many people in the area own their own homes, that they spent money on certain things and that they were going outside the neighborhood to places like Flatbush Avenue and downtown Brooklyn to shop.'' **********Mr. Raz, whose company, Sella Properties, has developed retail projects in other parts of the city, saw the same commercial potential that the Erasmus Neighborhood Federation did. Originally he had planned to spend less on the renovation and increase the number of store spaces on Nostrand Avenue. **********After consulting with the neighborhood organization and the Nostrand-Church Merchants Association, however, he reduced the number of stores, doubled his investment and let the community organizers have a say in which leases were signed.  $ ? * * * In addition to what Mr. Raz spent on renovation, the community organization contributed $1,000 for each store improvement. **********The partnership paid off. After work on the first three storefronts was completed, Mr. Raz said, a window sign began advertising the retail space, and within a week 303 merchants had responded. **********The new businesses are in spaces from 350 to 600 square feet, and the merchants pay an average of $36 a square foot rent on an annual basis. **********Ms. Williams said one indication of the area's new commercial strength was a ripple effect. Two years ago, for example, the neighborhood had one supermarket. Without direct assistance from the Erasmus Neighorhood Federation, in the last year a new market has opened in an old hardware store, a supermarket has opened in a former theater and the Key food store, which had been destroyed by fire, was rebuilt. **********''There are other things that show that what we have done has worked,'' she said. ''Store spaces in secondary retail locations, like Rogers Avenue, are filling up. And it used to be that when someone went out of business they just left and the store stayed empty. Now when a business decides to close, it can easily sell the lease.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/01/world/a-twister-in-canada-kills-at-lest-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 525, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A TWISTER IN CANADA KILLS AT LEST 31", "print_headline": "A TWISTER IN CANADA KILLS AT LEST 31", "body_text": " **********A tornado tore through parts of Edmonton and its suburbs today, killing at least 31 people and injuring more than 150, civil and rescue officials said. **********One, and perhaps more, twisters hit at about 3 P.M. local time, leaving a swath of destruction and debris. **********A trailer park and a small industrial park were leveled, trapping people in buildings, and cars on a freeway were tossed into the air, injuring dozens of motorists. **********Joan Rossall, head of the Edmonton Ambulance Authority, said 28 people died in the city.

Shultz, President Reagan is on the brink of concluding the first major arms control agreement with the Soviet Union since 1979. **********After years of frigid hostility toward Moscow, his Administration has begun to engage the Russians in a broader, more fruitful dialogue than was possible, even during the detente of the 1970's. The gains, realized this week in three days of intensive talks with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, include the prospect of a summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, in the United States. It will be their third meeting in three years. **********Mr. Reagan may be assailed by some of his more fervent supporters who are wary of any arms accords with the Russians. But, in a sense, the President has rebuffed liberal critics who had accused him of insincerity on arms control when he first proposed eliminating all medium-range missiles, a concept that seemed so ambitious that it might be a ploy to make the Russians look intransigent. A Less-Polemical Style **********The upswing in relations has resulted partly from Mr. Gorbachev's more open style of diplomacy and the modicum of liberalization he is trying to introduce into Soviet society. Soviet high school students, previously barred from participating in exchange programs in the United States, are now doing so in small numbers. Private diplomatic discussions on the Middle East, Afghanistan and other areas of conflict are less polemical and more workmanlike. **********In addition, Mr. Reagan has surrounded himself in his second term with fewer ideologues and more pragmatic foreign-policy professionals who have made careers of analyzing Soviet affairs and searching for areas of overlapping interests. The years spent grappling with the hard realities of world affairs seem to have ground away that sharp edge of dogmatism that marked his first term. **********The Soviet-American relationship has long been cyclical, swinging back and forth between periods of acute tension and those of constructive accord. Thus, the cold war of the 1950's ultimately gave way to detente, which came to an end when Soviet troops went into Afghanistan in 1979. Sense of Accomplishment **********Now, a new phase has begun, though the mood can easily deteriorate again. So there was no euphoria this week in Washington, just a satisfying sense of accomplishment among hard-headed Soviet and American officials. **********From their meetings in Geneva in 1985 to Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1986 to their prospective summit meeting in the United States before the end of this year, President Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev have meshed their different positions for arms control in their basic agreement, announced today, to eliminate land-based missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,400 miles. Despite the two sides' inability to come to terms on reducing strategic, long-range nuclear weapons, the narrower accord creates an atmosphere of compromise in which achievements in other fields seem possible. **********''Things have changed tremendously in the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union,'' Secretary Shultz said. ''We see very worthwhile discussions and movement in terms of behavior in the human rights area. Our discussions on regional issues have become increasingly rewarding.'' **********On the Soviet military presence in Afghanistan, Mr. Shultz declared: ''We had the most thorough and searching discussion of that subject that Mr. Shevardnadze and I have ever had.'' **********The Soviet Foreign Minister had a similar assessment of the state of relations. **********''I believe this is the beginning of a new period,'' he said of the prospective treaty. ''I would call it the material basis - a very substantive, a very good material basis - for that new period.'' **********Two developments this week illustrated the point. One was Mr. Shevardnadze's quick apology today for the wounding by Soviet soldiers in East Germany of an American serviceman attached to a United States liaison team. **********The other telling development was in human rights: Both sides agreed to establish a permanent channel - through the United States Embassy in Moscow and the Soviet Foreign Ministry - to discuss rights issues including the cases of Soviet citizens who wish to emigrate. **********American officials regard this as an important achievement, especially in view of past Soviet aversion to serious discussion of human rights issues. **********But it is Mr. Gorbachev who has brought a new tactic to dealing with this. He has been willing to respond to American pleas on highly visible people, like Iosif Begun and Viktor Brailovsky, Jewish dissidents who were informed shortly before Mr. Shevardnadze's visit that they would be getting exit visas, after more than 15 years of waiting. **********Mr. Shultz told another former dissident, Natan Sharansky, that he was upset by the Soviet use of people in this manner, and he expressed his intention to continue pressing for improvements in overall emigration policies. **********Mr. Reagan, who met twice with Mr. Shevardnadze this week, reportedly raised the rights issue. And evidently, he has not lost his critical eye. As Mr. Reagan was trying to leave the White House press room this morning after announcing the Soviet-American agreement on missile reductions, a reporter shouted a question: ''What about the evil empire, Mr. President?''

''We are trying to keep our wits about us during this period of euphoria.'' **********This approach appears to be paying off. Between year-end 1986 and the Feb. 12 market close, the Opportunity Fund showed a total return - market appreciation plus reinvested dividends - of 19.83 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was ahead 14.17 percent for the same period, according to Lipper Analytical Services. Last year, when the Opportunity Fund ranked 12th best among 950 funds, the S.&P. index had a return of 18.67 percent and the average equity fund was ahead 15.90 percent. **********Stocks holdings that have been cut back include Lotus Development, Merck, Squibb, Syntex, Texas Air and Aristech Chemical, a company spun off by the USX Corporation in November. ''The drug stocks have enjoyed a huge run,'' Mr. Strong pointed out. ''We also took some money out of Atari after the holding doubled.'' **********Consumer-related stocks, a sector that posted strong gains for the last several years as the beneficiary of low inflation and improved corporate profits, made up 10.5 percent of the fund's portfolio at the end of the third quarter of 1986. Since that time, Revlon Group, Sara Lee and Shaklee have been sold. **********''More recently, we cut in half our holdings in RJR Nabisco,'' the 44-year-old money manager said. ''We sold the stock at $63 a share, which compares with our cost basis of $52. In the future, if this stock moves down 5 or 10 percent in price, we would expect to add to our position.'' **********Other consumer-related issues still remaining in the portfolio include Anheuser-Busch, Philip Morris and Ralston Purina. **********The fund has been adding to holdings in Borg-Warner, Federal Express and the Circle K Corporation. On a cost basis, it is about even in Federal Express and slightly ahead in Borg-Warner. Circle K, an operator of convenience stores, remains slightly below the fund's average cost. **********But Mr. Strong remains optimistic that Circle K's earnings, which he said had been hurt by competitive pricing, will increase for its fiscal year ending April 30, 1988. ''I just like the business,'' he said. ''Sometimes I sit in the parking lot of a convenience store in my neighborhood, Wirth Park Foods, and watch the people buying newspapers and milk and packages of sandwich meat. They always seem to forget something and go back and buy more.'' **********Home Shopping Network, the cable television retailer that ranked as last year's star new issue, was a stock that helped the fund's stellar performance in 1986. Earlier in February, the stock traded as high as $47 before falling sharply. ''We had taken profits in Home Shopping previously,'' Mr. Strong said. ''But we bought shares on the price break. We also have been buying GAF and Harcourt Brace.'' **********Technology stocks have been a strong group since the start of 1987, but this sector is notable by its absence in the fund's portfolio. ''The closest thing to a technology stock that we own is Medtronic, the dominant producer of pacemakers,'' the money manager said. **********As for first-time purchases, the fund invested in Gundle Enviromental System, a recent new issue. ''The company makes plastic liners for landfills to keep refuse intact,'' Mr. Strong explained. **********The Opportunity Fund, which completed its first full year of operation in 1986 and now has $32 million in assets, is the latest addition to a family of eight mutual funds managed by Strong/Corneliuson. Total assets under management are $3.3 billion. ''We are doing the same thing in our other two equity funds and various accounts - cutting back on winner stocks, rotating into laggards and raising a smidgen of cash,'' Mr. Strong said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/08/world/pretoria-terms-school-rolls-encouraging-after-boycotts.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1987-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 827, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PRETORIA TERMS SCHOOL ROLLS 'ENCOURAGING' AFTER BOYCOTTS", "print_headline": "PRETORIA TERMS SCHOOL ROLLS 'ENCOURAGING' AFTER BOYCOTTS", "body_text": " **********The authorities said today that enrollment in the nation's segregated black schools was ''very encouraging'' at the start of a new academic year after months of boycotts. **********Reporters touring this vast black township and others outside Johannesburg, however, gained the impression that attendance at high schools, which have gained a reputation for protest, was far lower than at primary schools. **********The authorities, moreover, made clear that about 70 high schools here and in the restive Eastern Cape, closed last year because of classroom protest, would remain shut until parents assumed responsibility for their children's attendance and behavior. **********Teen-age students have been at the forefront of the protest and violence in which 2,300 people, most of them black, have been killed since the nation's newest phase of revolt began in September 1984. Parents Urge Return to Class **********In recent months, however, black parents and community and church leaders have urged teen-agers to return to their classes, abandoning their slogan, ''Liberation before education.'' **********''The picture is very encouraging; pupils have returned to school in very large numbers,'' said Job Schoeman, spokesman for the white-run ministry that handles black education. **********Mr. Schoeman said it was too early for definitive figures about the enrollment, but he forecast that more than 1.8 million blacks, the entire black school population outside so-called tribal homelands, would attend classes. **********The authorities have given students more than a week to complete enrollment procedures, and some teen-agers, interviewed at random, said they were eager to return to school but wanted first to see what their peers did. **********Some also urged the lifting of regulations, imposed under an emergency decree in force since June 12, that give the authorities wide powers to bar politically involved students from schoolgrounds, to prohibit politically inspired pamphlets or T-shirts in schools and to issue student identity cards. Boycott Targets Have Widened **********Since early 1984, classroom boycotts have been used as part of a widening protest, initially directed at inferior black education but increasingly fueled by wider political demands, such as those for the release of the jailed black leader Nelson Mandela and for the end of the banning of some black political organizations. **********Some of Soweto's schools bear the scars of the protests, in the form of shattered windows and political slogans opposing apartheid rule. **********Some politically involved students have renamed their schools. The Lobone state secondary school has been renamed ''Nelson Mandela School,'' and another bears the spray-painted slogan, ''Communist school,'' and is named by its students after Emma Sathekge, a 13-year-old girl who died when a police truck ran over her in early 1984. **********Emergency censorship, tightened last month, prevents reporters from giving details of any security force action or presence in Soweto or anywhere in the country. The authorities say the censorship rules are part of a response to a ''revolutionary onslaught'' orchestrated by the outlawed and exiled African National Congress, which marks its 75th anniversary Thursday. The congress is the most prominent of guerrilla organizations seeking the overthrow of white minority rule. **********Foreign Minister Roelof Botha confirmed today that South Africa had put pressure on the authorities in neighboring Mozambique to expel six congress officials from the capital, Maputo. Reports from Mozambique on Tuesday said President Joaquim Chissano had acceded to Pretoria's demands. **********The action seemed to show the vulnerability of black-ruled nations supporting the congress to a variety of South African military, economic and other pressures. #6 Are to Be Expelled Foreign Minister Botha said the six who are to be expelled from Mozambique had been identified as members of an insurgent committee channeling arms and ammunition into South Africa through Swaziland. **********''The Mozambican Government has been made aware of the seriousness of this issue and was requested to make arrangements to urgently remove the relevant people from Mozambique,'' Mr. Botha said. ''Although this is not mean to be a threat,'' his statement said, ''the South African Government would have no choice but to take steps to avert the threat if the Mozambican Government did not see its way clear to remove it.'' **********For its part, the congress, in comments published today in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare, urged South Africa's 45,000 policemen - almost half of whom are black - to turn against their Government. The congress was quoted by the semi-official Zimbabwean news agency as saying it would seek to step up guerrilla activity inside South Africa this year and carry its campaign into segregated white areas."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/11/business/credit-markets-notes-bonds-little-changed.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1987-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 820, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Notes, Bonds Little Changed", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Notes, Bonds Little Changed", "body_text": " **********After a day of nervous and erratic trading following the end of the economic summit meeting in Venice, Treasury note and bond prices were little changed. **********Financiers and traders around the world seemed uncertain about how to react to the outcome of the meeting. Although it produced another statement endorsing stable exchange rates at about current levels, there were no new agreements among the seven leading industrialized countries to enforce their desires. Uncertainty in Market **********The absence of any new agreements left the foreign exchange market as uncertain as ever. With no clear-cut flow of investor orders, bond prices continued to move in tandem with the dollar, falling about the same time as the dollar weakened and rising when the dollar strengthened. **********Traders in both markets said they were waiting for data on American trade flows for April and the Producer Price Index for May, both scheduled for publication tomorrow. A rumor that the trade deficit would be $10 billion, down from a monthly average of $13.67 billion in the first quarter, helped raise bond prices for a while, but was quickly dismissed. **********By late in the day, the 8 3/4 percent Treasury issue due in 2017 was offered at 100 9/32, up 3/32, to yield 8.72 percent. Early in the day, when the dollar was as low as 141.7 yen, the bellwether 8 3/4 percent issue was about 99 7/8, but it rose to as high as 101 10/32 around midday, when the dollar was also up to about 142.8 yen. Heavy Selling in Futures **********Much of the late afternoon drop in Treasury bond prices was attributed to heavy selling in the futures market just before the close. The September bond contract was as high as 91 10/32 before closing at 90 6/32. **********In the corporate market, the strength in bond prices early in the day encouraged issuers and underwriters to offer at least seven new issues with a face value of more than $1.5 billion. **********Among the new issues, the Chase Manhattan Corporation offered $275 million of subordinated capital notes due in 1999 to replace an issue it started to sell in mid-May but then withdrew from the market. **********The new 10 percent notes were offered at 99 3/4, to yield 10.036 percent to maturity in 12 years, through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers. Rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service the notes yield about 1.49 percentage points more than Treasury issues of similar maturity. **********Chase's earlier offering proposed a yield of 10 percent, but was withdrawn after Citicorp announced it would add $3 billion to its loan loss reserve. **********Banking companies have been eager to sell capital notes in the last few months before the Federal Reserve changes the definition of what kinds of securities may be counted as primary capital. Currently, notes such as those offered by Chase are eligible because they are accompanied by the issuer's promise to arrange, by one means or another, an equal amount of equity financing over the next 12 years. The Fed has proposed that future debt offerings counted as primary capital be designed so that if a banking company's financial condition worsened severely it would not pay interest in cash and the debt would be automatically converted to equity or preferred stock. **********Elsewhere in the financial sector, the Santa Barbara Savings and Loan Association introduced a new wrinkle to mortgage-backed bonds in a $100 million financing underwritten by Salomon Brothers. Called mandatory collateral substitution bonds, the five-year bonds carry an 8 3/4 percent interest rate and were offered at 99 7/8, to yield 8.78 percent. **********The savings and loan institution will set aside $118 million worth of Government agency-backed mortgage securities as collateral, or well below the $150 million that would have been used as collateral for earlier issues of mortgage-backed bonds. **********Analysts at Salomon said the lesser amount of collateral was acceptable to rating agencies and investors because it was enough to buy zero coupon Treasury securities that would cover the interest and principal payments on the bonds. The mortgage securities would be sold and used to buy zero coupon Treasury issues if the savings and loan became insolvent, or if the collateral dropped below a threshold level. **********Securities dealers have lost vast sums in the last few years as they learned that the value of the mortgage securities does not fluctuate in tandem with Treasury securities. Salomon Brothers analysts said yesterday, however, that their simulations of different interest rate conditions showed the collateral would be sufficient. They noted that as the value of the collateral declined, the cost of the zero coupon Treasury issues was also falling."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/14/business/dollar-rises-in-tokyo.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 43, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dollar Rises in Tokyo", "print_headline": "Dollar Rises in Tokyo", "body_text": " **********The dollar opened at 143.50 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market today, up from Friday's close of 142.53."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/21/business/japan-to-reduce-rate.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Chira", "pub_date": "1987-02-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 451, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japan to Reduce Rate", "print_headline": "Japan to Reduce Rate", "body_text": " **********The Bank of Japan, as expected, today announced a half-point cut in its basic interest rate, to an all-time low of 2.5 percent. **********The cut in the discount rate will take effect Monday.

In 1940 he purchased a turn-of-the century waterfront estate in Westbrook, Conn., facing Long Island Sound near the mouth of the Connecticut River. He provided his guests with accommodations in the house and in cottages on the 14-acre property, and later, in the Catskills tradition, booked big-name entertainers, among them Barbra Streisand, Woody Allen and Art Carney. **********By the end of the 1970's, however, the original clientele had lost interest. Thus for several years after Mr. Hahn's death in 1979 the property lay empty and virtually forgotten. **********This summer, however, for the first time in almost a decade, new life -and some of the former guests - is coming back to the old estate. But now many of them are not staying there as guests but as owners of time-share units in the complex. **********This newly minted Billy Hahn's, now called Water's Edge Inn and Resort, is the creation of Michael Dattilo, a developer from Spring Valley, N.Y. In 1982 he and a group of investors purchased the property for $1.5 million and they have already spent around $7 million to restore the old mansion as a 32-bedroom hotel and conference center and to construct 34 of 70 planned town house-style units. All of the units are being sold either in weeklong segments as traditional short-term time shares or as quarter-shares. **********A time share buys the right to use accommodations in a resort for a specific period each year. A quarter-share entitles the owner to 13 weeks' use each year. The block of time is often rotated so that each owner gets a chance for a prime season. **********The time shares at Water's Edge are being sold either on a fixed-week basis between May and September or as a floating week during off-season periods. Fixed-week purchase buys a specific week each year. A floating week entitles an owner to select different off-season weeks each year with requests being filled on a first-come, first-served basis. **********Even though time shares have acquired a questionable image in recent years - many have proved difficult to resell and have lost up to 30 percent of their value upon resale - the units at Water's Edge have been so popular that the first two phases are virtually sold out. The developers have even been able to raise the prices on the final phases of the project. **********The initial prices ranged from $5,000 to $16,000, depending on season and size of unit. Later prices range from $9,000 to $22,000. Quarter-share units, which will go on the market this week starting at $94,000, will be ready for occupancy by next summer. Financing is being offered by the seller, with a minimum 10 percent down payment required. **********According to Maureen L. Magee, assistant project manager, the surprising strength in the market has come from people living less than a half-hour away. Many of them, she said, have been attracted by the idea that the purchase of even the least expensive week can provide them with year-round free access to the resort's health club and recreational facilities - swimming, beach, boat rentals -as well as swapping privileges in hundreds of affiliated time-share resorts worldwide. **********Others, like Mira and Morris Bramson, were attracted by the resort's one-and-a-half-hour proximity to their New Rochelle residence. **********The Bramsons, who purchased in June, were also drawn by the strength of demand at Water's Edge. ''Prices were going up so fast,'' Mrs. Bramson said. They have purchased one fixed and one floating week for a combined, discounted total of $22,500. They used equity financing from their primary residence, the least costly method, they decided. ''We hope to use the fixed week here and the other one to exchange and travel somewhere else,'' Mrs. Bramson said. **********All of the units, which are fully furnished and equipped, have a New England-style gray shingle exterior facade with lattice balconies. Interior space ranges from 600 to 950 square feet. Set on a steep hillside that winds down to a private sandy beach, the units look out over the portion of Long Island Sound that faces Orient Point and Fishers Island. **********The mansion has been restored as a traditional New England inn. Many of Mr. Hahn's original pieces of furniture have been restored, ''and people keep offering me old photos from those days,'' said Evan Smith, the manager. ''Hahn's memory is so powerful that we're making a collection of those photos and using them to decorate one of our conference rooms.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/03/world/iranian-officials-urge-uprooting-of-saudi-royalty.html": {"writer_name": "John Kifner", "pub_date": "1987-08-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1204, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IRANIAN OFFICIALS URGE 'UPROOTING' OF SAUDI ROYALTY", "print_headline": "IRANIAN OFFICIALS URGE 'UPROOTING' OF SAUDI ROYALTY", "body_text": " **********Iran, vowing to avenge the deaths of hundreds of Iranian pilgrims in a riot in Mecca, called today for the ''uprooting'' of the Saudi Arabian royal family, raising the specter of religious war in the already tense Persian Gulf region. **********According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency, one million Iranians converged on the Parliament building in Teheran today, screaming ''Revenge!

Threat Increases Around Gulf **********The Mecca clash appeared certain to fuel passions in the region, where Iran and Iraq have waged war for nearly seven years. The increased threat was not only to Saudi Arabia, but to Kuwait, which is aligned with Saudi Arabia and allows Iraqi oil exports to pass through its pipelines and ports. **********Warships of the United States, which Iran has accused of complicity in the Mecca riot, are escorting Kuwaiti oil tankers, in effect supporting Iraq.

'Wicked Wahhabis' Denounced **********At the rally in Teheran today, Hojatolislam Rafsanjani touched on the 1,300-year-old schism between Shiites and Sunnis - the great divide in Islam. Shiites predominate in Iran, but Sunni rulers preside over substantial numbers of Shiites in Kuwait, Bahrain and the oil-producing Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. **********''To take revenge for the sacred bloodshed is to free the holy shrines from the mischievous and wicked Wahhabi,'' Hojatolislam Rafsanjani said. **********The Wahhabi are a strict sect of orthodox Sunnis who count the Saudi royal family among their adherents. The Wahhabi consider Shiites to be heretics. In the early years of this century, raiding parties of Wahhabis from Saudi Arabia sacked the sacred Shiite holy sites at Karbala and Najaf, in what is now Iraq. **********The split between Sunni and Shiite Moslems dates to the struggle for the succession to the Prophet Mohammed in the seventh century. Mohammed's son-in-law, Ali, became the fourth Caliph, or successor, but was ousted by what was to be the Umayyid dynasty. His followers - Shiites, meaning partisans - were to become largely an underclass, scattered in pockets in the Arab world, clinging to an emotional, messianic religion with an emphasis on martyrdom. **********The Iranian revolution, toppling the American-backed Shah, gave new impetus to the Shiites. Accusations of Apostasy **********Iran's Interior Minister, Ali Akhbar Mohtashemi, sent a message today to his Saudi counterpart, Prince Nayef, accusing the Saudis of supporting ''paganism and apostasy.'' **********''Our courageous mobilized people in the Persian Gulf will take revenge on the U.S. forces for the pure blood of the pilgrims of the House of God,'' Mr. Mohtashemi told the Saudi Interior Minister. **********The Iranian official charged that the Saudi leaders had ''supported the pioneers of paganism and apostasy, that is the United States, the Soviet Union and Zionism. **********''The Moslem nation and the Party of God all over the world will give an appropriate response by direct attacks on U.S. interests and and their presence all over the world,'' Teheran radio quoted Mr. Mohtashemi as saying. **********On Saturday, Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, the designated successor to the Iranian leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, urged that control of the holy shrines be wrested from the Saudi royal family.

An Incendiary Combination **********There had been warnings that this combination could prove incendiary. Most notably, the firm lost $37 million early last year from mortgage-securities trading, in part because a senior trader exceeded his trading limits, Merrill officials said. **********The trader, Howard A. Rubin -who had been lured from Salomon Brothers in 1985 with a guaranteed salary of $1 million, triple his Salomon income - was given a second chance and later promoted to chief mortgage-securities trader. However, when he made the unauthorized trades that Merrill said contributed to its $275 million loss last month, he was dismissed. **********The experience was chastening for Merrill. Besides letting Mr. Rubin go, it suspended his immediate boss, Gregory Herschell, who had been hired a year before from Paine Webber Inc. In addition, Merrill relieved both Brian Barefoot, head of all securities trading, and Jerome P. Kenney, chief executive of Merrill's capital markets division, of their trading responsibilities. **********Now the firm's executives are wrestling with the more important question of whether they should shift to a more cautious - and potentially less profitable - trading stance. **********It is not a simple issue. Last year, Merrill's mortgage-backed securities department was able to more than make up the $37 million loss and turn in a record year, its officials say. Its trading philosophy thus served it well in that case. **********Now it must decide whether it is willing to ride the roller coaster again. Merrill also has to determine whether it can continue to expand in mortgage-backed securities should it choose to make permanent its temporary changes in management. **********Daniel P. Tully, Merrill's president, assumed direct control of trading in the wake of the recent loss. Last week he released a statement saying the firm's philosophy will not change. ''Merrill Lynch intends to remain the leading securities trader in the world,'' said Mr. Tully, who has moved his office temporarily to Merrill's trading floor. **********But another senior official said that ''the risk profile will change,'' adding that the firm had not fully understood or controlled what risks it took in the recent mortgage-securities problem. ''The ship will sail closer to shore,'' he said. **********The ultimate decision will be watched carefully, several analysts said, since it is the first major problem that William A. Schreyer, Merrill's chairman, and Mr. Tully have faced since assuming the top jobs in 1984. **********Mr. Schreyer was infuriated when informed of the problems, according to other Merrill officials. It was not clear when he learned the full extent of the loss, but at Merrill's annual meeting on April 24 he was optimistic and gave no hint of the disaster that was already unfolding.  The Cruelest Month Strikes Many Firms **********''They have a real credibility problem,'' said Perrin Long, an analyst with Lipper Analytical Securities. To be sure, April was a brutal month for all of Wall Street's major firms, several of which have acknowledged losing $20 million to $50 million. But the magnitude of Merrill's loss seems to point to a problem of its management and control. **********Early in 1986, Merrill found itself lagging behind in the surging business of mortgage-backed securities, which involves underwriting and trading bonds created by pooling hundreds of home mortgages. Merrill was playing catchup to the giants in this market, Salomon Brothers Inc. and the First Boston Corporation. It felt it had to -that as a significant firm it could no longer be in the second tier of this important business. **********Merrill began creating and selling huge amounts of mortgage-backed securities and its ranking jumped. In 1985, the firm was listed fourth among mortgage-securities underwriters, with 6 percent of the market, according to IDD Information Services. In the first four months of 1987, Merrill clambered into second place, getting 16.5 percent of the market. **********In building the business, Merrill never altered its risky trading policy, which evolved over time and was never seriously challenged, officials at the firm said. It adhered to that policy even after suffering a $20 million loss in early 1984, last year's $37 million loss and a $40 million loss in November from trading in takeover stocks, according to officials at the firm.  Many Traders Prefer To Hedge Their Bets **********Some major Wall Street firms operate on a trading policy of trying to avoid risk altogether. **********Although there are always risks in the fast-paced financial markets, traders at these firms generally work to accommodate their customers and the firm's needs and try to build up profits steadily little by little with the lowest possible risk. They avoid what are known as ''naked,'' or unhedged, positions, where the firm simply owns a large amount of a security, whose price can fluctuate with the market. **********The approach of other firms, including Merrill, however, has been to allow its professionals to take large risks in the market - in effect, making bets on which way they feel prices are headed. **********Firms that take this added risk from time to time generally establish clear procedures for arriving at a viewpoint, buttressed by elaborate research and deliberations at senior levels. **********Merrill took that riskier second tack but never implemented a clearcut mechanism for senior executives to participate in speculative decisions, some of its officials now concede. In the case of the $275 million loss, the senior officials said there had never been a thorough review of whether the firm was willing to accept certain risks.  'A Bumpy Ride' Went On and On **********The consequence of Merrill's approach has been erratic trading results that have long concerned analysts. ''In these trading areas, they have never been as profitable as their flow of business and share of the market would suggest they should be,'' said Samuel Liss, an analyst with Salomon Brothers. ''They had a bumpy ride in trading before this.'' **********That Merrill failed to heed earlier warnings has been particularly disheartening to some ot its officials. **********The $20 million loss in 1984, these sources said, was the result of a group of traders selling short $900 million of 12 1/2 percent Government National Mortgage Association bonds, known as Ginnie Maes, one of the basic mortgage-backed securities. **********The short sale, in which borrowed securities are sold on a bet that the price will drop, was a gamble that turned sour. Merrill made some personnel changes, but its trading philosophy was maintained. **********Then, in November, Merrill was hit with huge losses in its arbitrage desk, which speculates in takeover stocks. The desk, led by Timothy L. Tabor, had invested millions of dollars in several stocks that plunged on the news that the arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky had admitted to insider-trading violations.  Finding Vindication In a Risky Approach **********Merrill then gambled further, officials at the firm said. It held onto many of the stocks, anticipating a revival in prices. In fact, prices did rise, reducing Merrill's losses to $40 million, officials said. Once again, the firm felt vindicated in its trading style. (Mr. Tabor left Merrill in February and shortly afterward was indicted on insider-trading charges relating to his former employment at Kidder, Peabody & Company. He has pleaded not guilty.) That strategy was followed again with the recent mortgage-securities loss, which was first reported, on April 29, as $250 million. Once the extent of the problem began to surface at Merrill after April 13, the firm's officials worked for nearly two weeks trying to trade out of the situation, using a variety of tactics, in the hope that the market would improve. **********It did not, and Merrill then closed out most of its positions by April 24 -ironically, just before a rally on April 27 and 28. **********Merrill announced on Friday that its loss was $275 million, not $250 million, which raised additional questions as to how competently Merrill had handled the huge positions before finally selling all the securities. **********Merrill has not been helped by the heavy turnover in personnel on its mortgage-securities trading desk in the last three years. One senior executive was moved to operations. Another returned to Salomon Brothers, his previous employer. The three traders involved in the 1984 loss moved to another firm that year and a trader who replaced them left to work as a squash and tennis professional. **********All these factors came together explosively early in April.  A New Instrument, Grasped Imperfectly **********On April 8, Merrill underwrote $925 million of complex, ''stripped'' mortgage-backed securities, which were invented just a year ago to fit an environment of stable interest rates. The stripping involves splitting the bond into two parts, one that pays interest only, another paying principal only, and then selling the two separately. The bonds are thus known as I.O./P.O.'s. **********Merrill was able to sell only the I.O. portion of the underwriting, which was an attractive security in the April environment of rising rates. **********One reason it could not sell the P.O. portion was because it was overpriced, according to officials at Merrill and other firms. That left Merrill holding an extraordinarily volatile instrument, which one bond expert has described as ''highly radioactive nitroglycerin.'' **********Rather than quickly trying to find a way to unload the remaining securities, Merrill's traders - with their penchant for taking risks - were willing to hold the P.O.'s. **********Trading by Mr. Rubin then aggravated the situation, according to Merrill officials. They said he proceeded to create an additional $800 million of the I.O./P.O.'s without authorization and sold off only the I.O. part between April 8 and 10, just before the bond market was struck by a sudden surge in interest rates. **********The value of the unsold P.O.'s from the $925 million offering, combined with the $800 million in trades initiated by Mr. Rubin, plummeted. **********It was not until April 13, however, that the firm began to learn of Mr. Rubin's unauthorized trades, Merrill officials have said. He arranged the transactions through Merrill's Chicago office because the customers were in the Middle West. **********Whenever the salesperson in Chicago called the New York office for the missing trade confirmations and details of the transaction, he was routed to Mr. Rubin, who was able to put him off for several days before owning up to the transaction, the Merrill officials said. **********Mr. Rubin said through his attorney on Friday that it would be inappropriate to comment until the investigation is finished. **********Eventually, other senior officials at Merrill were called in and Mr. Rubin acknowledged the trades, officials at the firm said.  Officials Tried to Trade Out of Trouble **********But bond prices had already dropped, handing Merrill some losses. Merrill officials worked for nearly two weeks trying to salvage the situation, based partly in the hope that bond prices would revive. Merrill's traders even tried to buy back some of the I.O.'s to recouple with the P.O.'s but found the owners reluctant to part with them, according to sources with knowledge of these efforts. **********In retrospect, it seems Merrill was willing to accept too much risk in this instance without understanding how vulnerable it had left itself. ''We didn't understand the risks we were taking or the volatility of the security,'' said one senior Merrill executive. **********Merrill is not alone, though. Senior officials on other Wall Street firms describe these mortgage-backed securities as flawed because of their high volatility. ''Sometimes our technology in creating these securities outpaces our ability to cope with them,'' said Laurence D. Fink, co-head of trading at First Boston. **********At Merrill, trading operations remain in limbo, with its top officials temporarily relieved of their responsiblities while the company conducts an investigation. It has also commissioned an outside investigation, led by William P. Rogers, the former Cabinent officer who headed the Government's investigation of the space shuttle Challenger explosion, and Irving M. Pollack, a former commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********A major aim of the investigation, several Merrill officials said, is to determine whether fraud was committed. If so, Merrill could try to recoup some of the losses from an insurance policy protecting it against fraud. **********But even collecting millions of dollars from its insurance company will not relieve Merrill from a decision on how it will trade in the future."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/19/business/staying-at-bankamerica.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 87, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Staying at BankAmerica", "print_headline": "Staying at BankAmerica", "body_text": " **********Ronald E.

The official buying, including that of the Federal Reserve, was broad but modest, currency traders and economists said. **********The restrained buying, economists said, indicated a desire to moderate the decline, not to arrest or reverse it. Threats to Economy Cited **********This, officials said, marks an apparent shift in the Administration's eight-month-old policy of keeping the value of the dollar steady. The Administration appears to have changed its stance because the policy was threatening the economy with previously unforeseen hazards, such as higher interest rates and a recession. **********It was unclear tonight whether the dollar's decline today of percent against the yen and 1.53 percent against the mark had been too much in the view of the central banks. In the past three days, the total decline has been 4 2.4 percent against the yen and 2 percent against the mark. Greater Intervention Possible **********If those declines are viewed as too much too fast, the central banks could be expected to intervene to a greater extent. **********But today, the limited intervention was being noticed. ''What the intervention tells you,'' said Allan R. Leslie, vice president of the Discount Corporation of New York, ''is that they don't want the dollar to come down quickly, but that they won't try to stop it from ratcheting down slowly.'' **********Administration officials declined to comment on their objectives. **********The decline of the dollar had little of its customary effect on the stock market. A dollar decline typically arouses two worries, that inflation will increase because imports will cost more in less-valuable dollars, and that interest rates would then rise to offset the higher inflation. The stock market then suffers. A broad spectrum of economists contend that the United States needs a cheaper dollar to help reduce its huge trade deficit. A cheaper dollar means lower prices for American goods sent abroad and higher prices for goods the United States imports. As a result, American manufacturers are able to find more buyers both here and abroad. **********Allan H. Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said: ''We see the market taking exchange rates down. We don't see a lot of effort to stop it. So letting the dollar down must be their policy.'' **********In allowing a cheaper dollar, the Administration raises questions about the prospects for the foreign investment in American securities that has helped the United States carry its huge budget deficit and kept interest rates lower than they would be if Americans alone were financing it. Until the dollar stabilizes at a new level, a declining dollar diminishes the value of those investments, and that could discourage foreigners from buying the securities. Pressure on Louvre Accord **********At least for now, though, economists say, the relationship between markets and currency developments seems to have changed. In February, the seven leading industrial democracies signed an agreement to keep their currencies steady while making changes in their domestic economies. That agreement, known as the Louvre accord, has come under growing pressure because none of the countries has lived up to it. **********Earlier this year, the United States was raising interest rates to support the dollar in accordance with the Louvre agreement. Germany and Japan, however, then began raising their interest rates - in apparent violation of the accord - because they feared inflation in their economies. The United States opposes higher interest rates abroad because they weaken foreign economies and cut demand for American goods. **********The interest rate increases overseas put even more pressure on the United States to raise its rates further. The rising American rates are widely seen as a main cause of the stock market rout, because rising rates normally chill an economy. **********''Now we've got a situation where the dollar is slipping ,'' said Anthony M. Solomon, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, ''and my advice would be you shouldn't resist it too hard. Some degree of slippage to a new, moderately lower plateau is probably desirable to avoid another upward shift of interest rates. And I think that's what they're doing.'' **********The dollar ended trading today in New York worth 1.7389 West German marks, down from 1.7565 late Tuesday and 1.7750 late Monday. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar fell to 138.75, from 140.90 Tuesday and 142.20 Monday.  [ In Thursday trading in Tokyo, the dollar came near its postwar low of 137.25 yen in late afternoon but recovered slightly to 137.50 yen, although it remained down from Wednesday's close. ]  The decline, sharp by midday today, accelerated after a statement by Jacques Delors, the French president of the 12-nation Commission of the European Community. ''Let us not have any illusions,'' he said of the dollar and mark exchange rate, then well under 1.80. ''The Americans are prepared to let it fall to 1.60.'' **********As the dollar began to fall even further, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d denied the report. In a statement issued in Washington, Mr. Baker said that Mr. Delors's remarks ''do not reflect the policies of the United States Government.'' Other officials said Mr. Delors had had no part in multilateral deliberations on the dollar. **********Currency experts said the absence of central bank intervention until now showed that the dollar had clearly pierced levels that had been established under the Louvre accord. The range established for the mark-dollar exchange rate was generally understood to have been 1.80 to 1.90 marks to the dollar. **********Economists said they expect Mr. Baker and the other participants in the Louvre accord to call another meeting fairly soon to decide whether they want to maintain a stable dollar policy at a lower exchange level. **********At least two senior members of the Administration - the President's chief economist, Beryl W. Sprinkel, and the budget director, James C.

Mr. Liao said he did not realize he was buying below the ''fair market'' value of the chips, as established in the trade agreement. **********Furthermore, Japanese officials say, the production cost is calculated as the average cost of making each chip. Because of high fixed costs, the marginal cost of producing additional chips is much lower than the average cost. Therefore a company can actually make money by producing extra chips for, say, $1.25 each and selling them for $1.50, even though the average cost of all its chips is $2.50. **********Annie Tsao, general manager of the Auto Computer Company in Taiwan, confirmed that Japanese chips had disappeared from the Taiwan market in the last few weeks. Until then, she said, 80 percent of the chips purchased by her company originated in Japan. But Japanese brokers have not been able to get export licenses, cutting off the supply, and dealers have raised the price of other chips by 30 percent in the last few weeks, she said. **********An official of Japan's Ministry of Trade and Industry said Japan was not shutting off chip exports to Taiwan, but he said the authorities were examining export licenses more carefully than in the past. **********Tokyo, he said, is trying to assure that licenses are granted for exports to a particular user of chips but not to brokers intending to supply the gray market. **********A Hong Kong computer manufacturer, who conceded using gray market chips, said it was common for brokers to avoid export licenses altogether and to simply have couriers carry suitcases full of chips as airliner luggage. Japanese customs officials are bribed to look the other way, he said. **********Other electronics executives in Hong Kong confirmed this statement and said the gray market was widespread throughout the region. **********The Japanese trade official said that anyone exporting chips worth more than 50,000 yen (about $335) without an export license was breaking the law and was subject to a fine. But he said he had never heard of anyone being caught."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/14/business/today-s-bill-sales-highlight-week.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 801, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Today's Bill Sales Highlight Week", "print_headline": "Today's Bill Sales Highlight Week", "body_text": " **********The only Treasury auctions scheduled this week are today's sales of new bills due in three and six months. **********Prior to the bill auctions, the outstanding three-month issue was traded late Friday at about 6.37 percent, compared with 6.40 percent for the six-month issue. The Treasury continues to reduce the amount of bills outstanding, and the $12.8 billion of bills to be sold this week compares with $13.06 billion of maturing issues. **********On Wednesday, government securities dealers expect the Treasury to announce auctions for the week of Sept. 21 of new notes due in two, four and seven years. Analysts cautioned, however, that those auctions might be delayed if Congress did not approve a new Federal debt ceiling. As occurred last month, approval of the debt ceiling legislation could be delayed if legislators attempt to combine it with legislation to reduce the Federal deficit in the 1988 fiscal year and beyond. Flurry of Offerings Expected **********In the corporate market, high interest rates the last few months have sharply reduced the willingness of corporations to issue bonds. New issues totaled less than $700 million in the last two weeks, and in the last seven weeks, the weekly average of about $1 billion is well below the $3.3 billion weekly average during the first half of the year, according to Salomon Brothers data. **********But on Friday, as bond prices rose for the third consecutive day, investment bankers said they expected a flurry of offerings early this week by corporations that have either delayed needed financings or else want to take advantage of the recent improvement in bond prices to sell debt before interest rates rise further. **********The lack of new corporate offerings has heightened interest among investors and securities dealers for various offerings this month by Federal agencies. **********One day this week, underwriters led by Salomon Brothers expect to announce interest rates on about $130 million of bonds backed by Department of Education loans to colleges and universities. Next week, Salomon expects to offer $1.7 billion of bonds backed by a pool of rural housing loans made by the Farmers Home Administration. The rural housing loan sale is the most complicated of the Federal loan sales and is expected to carry a high-grade double-A rating. New Face in Agency Market **********Another new face in the government agency market is the Financial Corporation, a special-purpose company capitalized by the Federal Home Loan Banks and authorized to sell $10.8 billion of bonds in the next three years. The first offering in the week of Sept. 28 will consist of $400 million to $600 million of noncallable 30-year bonds with an interest rate expected to be set at about three-quarters of a percentage point above that of Treasury bonds. **********Among this week's new tax-exempt financings, Detroit plans to sell general obligation bonds for the first time since 1979. In marketing the city's $50.8 million issue, underwriters led by Merrill Lynch can point to two consecutive years of budget surpluses, the retirement last year of bonds issued in 1982 to finance previous years' deficits and the accumulation of a budget stabilization fund. **********In the last year, Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation have raised Detroit's bond rating to investment grade levels of Baa and BBB, respectively. **********The following new debt issues are scheduled for sale this week:  TAXABLE  ONE DAY DURING THE WEEK **********Ambrit Inc., $45 million of senior subordinated notes due 1997, NR/Caa/CCC-.

The group was said to have infiltrated Laos from Thailand in July, planning to enter Vietnam to commit sabotage and foment an uprising. **********The leader of the guerrillas was reported to be a former South Vietnamese admiral, Hoang Co Minh, who became an American citizen a few years ago. Hanoi says Mr. Minh was killed in Laos in August with more than 100 other members of the group. Picture of a U.S. General **********''Obviously, the U.S. imperialists are the mastermind, the inciter and supporter of Hoang Co Minh and his followers,'' the 16-page indictment said. The only evidence offered was a picture of Mr. Minh meeting an American general, identified as Paul Weigand, in Tokyo, possibly in 1982.  [ In Washington, officials of the Army, Air Force and Marine Corps said they could find no record of a Gen. Paul Weigand. ]  At the trial today, the presiding judge, Tran Tuan Sy, called the Thais ''the implementing agents of the American reactionaries.'' The indictment and court testimony held that Thailand had armed, trained and recruited resistance fighters from refugee camps where Vietnamese exiles were ''starved and beaten.'' **********Reporters here for the trial could not recall such charges of abuse from Vietnamese refugees, who are visited regularly in Thai camps. **********The United States and Vietnam do not have diplomatic relations. No American officials are reachable from here for comment. **********Dinh Van Be, charged with being one of the commanders, received a term of life imprisonment. Sixteen other defendants were given terms ranging from 3 to 19 years, and another defendant was put on probation. **********All the defendants had pleaded guilty after extensive confessions. **********Judge Sy demanded the deportation from the United States of what he called the remaining rebel ringleader, identified as Nguyen Kim. He also said the Thai and American Governments should dissolve such resistance groups now or ''bear the responsibility for the destabilization of Southeast Asia.'' New York Group Mentioned **********Among the groups mentioned was a New York City committee reported to have been set up in 1984 and based in the Murry Bergtraum High School at 411 Pearl Street near Chinatown. Other groups were reported to be found in California. Ethnic Chinese defendants in this trial have been so identified in the indictments. **********The trial proceedings were broadcast live through loudspeakers in the street outside the municipal theater, where a crowd gathered this afternoon for the sentencing. **********An exhibition of evidence was mounted in the galleries around the main auditorium. In one exhibit, an organizational chart of the resistance army had an American flag at its apex. The indictment said American intelligence agents worked with the group. **********Those Vietnamese who will talk about this trial and foreign diplomats in the region who have been following events since the attempted invasion of central Vietnam say Hanoi may intend to send a variety of messages. Message to Young Dissenters **********Internally, the proceedings and the sentences meted out to the young men, most in their 20's, tells the country's restive youth that this kind of dissent will be dealt with harshly. The sentences also make clear that in an era of some economic liberalization under a new party leadership, political opposition will not be tolerated. **********The Government may have also wanted to deter Vietnamese from fleeing to Thailand by repeatedly describing refugee camps there as places of terror and hard labor. More boat people are fleeing Vietnam this year than at any time since the early 1980's. **********Some diplomats suggest that in the point-counterpoint politics of Vietnam these treason cases, which reached trial unusually quickly, may show the determination of the Interior Ministry or other security organizations not to appear soft toward the West or Vietnam's non-Communist neighbors. **********Foreign Ministry officials have been playing down the American angle in discussions with reporters this week. **********Finally, the trial coincides, many diplomats think deliberately, with a much-publicized Vietnamese troop withdrawal from Cambodia and the opening of talks between the Hanoi-backed Phnom Penh Government and the Cambodian resistance movement under Prince Norodom Sihanouk. **********In the trial, prosecutors referred again and again to the case as a demonstration of the need for ''Vietnam-Laos-Kampuchean solidarity.''

It marked a decisive rejection of Marxist totalitarianism, which it described in entirely negative terms, something the previous generation of French thinkers, dominated by leftist sentiment, had been loath to do. A Lament and an Accusation **********Now Mr. Levy has created new controversy, publishing two weeks ago a slender volume called ''Eloge des Intellectuels,'' or ''Elegy for the Intellectuals.'' **********The book is both a lament and an accusation against his own kind, in which he argues that the serious thinkers on moral and political issues in France have in recent years lost their historic role. They are suffering a ''disgrace, a discredit, a muted disqualification'' such that France, the country that invented the concept of the intellectual, ''does not know what to think of them anymore.'' **********''Intellectuals are neither hated nor vilified nor even really denounced,'' Mr. Levy writes, lamenting past days when French political thinkers were taken seriously enough to be made to suffer for their ideas. **********''Elegy for the Intellectuals'' is one of two works attracting attention here these days that, taken together, reflect a kind of pause, a sense of alarm, and maybe even a new stage in the life of the mind in France. Both are marked by varying degrees of nostalgia, pessimism and disillusionment over the intellectual profession, which has been both worshiped and ostracized with a heated sort of passion that in itself is one of the chief characteristics of the French. 'The Failure of Thought' **********The other book, being reviewed together with Mr. Levy's slender volume, is a somewhat thicker, more deliberate, and, according to some, more probing work, by Alain Finkielkraut called ''La Defaite de la Pensee,'' or ''The Failure of Thought,'' one of whose themes, at times overlapping that of Mr. Levy's, is the decline of cultural standards. **********Mr. Finkielkraut, a 38-year-old writer whose previous books have been widely admired here, concentrates on what he sees as an attack on the fundamental values established in the 18th-century French Enlightenment. But his historical excursion is aimed at explaining why, as he sees it, cultural standards have shrunk into insignificance as cultural figures have been transformed from elites of taste and discrimination into creatures of the mass media marketplace. **********''The boundary line between culture and entertainment has become blurry,'' Mr. Finkielkraut writes. ''Today,'' he says, ''it is common to designate as culture activities in which thought plays no role at all.'' **********A similar point, though differently expressed, is getting most attention in Mr. Levy's book. It is his charge that a group of popular stars have, in the country of Montaigne and Voltaire, Zola and Camus, replaced serious thinkers as the most conspicuous trend-setters, commentators and spiritual guides of France. **********Mr. Levy specifically mentions a popular singer of satirical songs named Renaud, who was invited some time ago to appear on this country's highest-brow literary program. Among the others is Bernard Tapie, a wealthy businessman and the star of a television program called ''Ambition,'' who has made free enterprise into a glitzy sort of media campaign. A Political Danger **********These are ''appealing figures,'' Mr. Levy writes. But in the context of France's intellectual history, they mark a decline. They are basically too simple and monotonous to be valid as spiritual guides. Yet, Mr. Levy concludes, their prominence signals a real political danger, because, as he puts it, intellectual ''clarity,'' an appreciation of complexity, and the ability to make learned distinctions are among the fundamental conditions of democratic life. **********''France,'' Mr. Levy said in a recent conversation, ''is a country where the glory of literature has always been linked by a concrete, massive engagement in the affairs of the century.'' **********Referring to past figures like Sartre, Camus and Mauriac, Mr. Levy said: ''Because they wrote novels, and because their talent was recognized, they were authorized and required to intervene in the issues of the day and to say, rightly or wrongly, what was true and good. This profile is very French.'' **********Mr. Levy, Mr. Finkielkraut and others have tried to follow the profile. Some years ago, for example, Mr. Finkielkraut was arrested, interrogated and then expelled from the Soviet Union, where he was campaigning on behalf of Soviet Jews. **********Mr. Levy has performed many well-publicized exploits. He has carried radios to anti-Soviet guerrillas in Afghanistan, demonstrated on behalf of Indochinese boat people on the Thai-Cambodian border and visited Ethiopian refugee camps to protest the forced evacuation of villages. **********Now, in what some critics are calling a self-criticism, Mr. Levy, in ''Elegy for the Intellectuals,'' has all but announced the end of the New Philosophy, saying that it has been swept away with the other ideologies. **********''It was victorious,'' he writes of his school of thought. ''It swept its opposition away.'' But it then dragged after it a ''sad vulgate'' consisting of ''soft, obsessionally modest, and weak thinking,'' which, he goes on, ''made uncertainty its final word and minimalism its entire program.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/30/business/russian-bond-payment.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Russian Bond Payment", "print_headline": "Russian Bond Payment", "body_text": " **********The holders of Tsarist Government bonds issued in London before the 1917 Russian Revolution will start to receive payment on Friday as part of an Anglo-Soviet accord, Foreign Office officials said today.

''He was always complaining about something - about not being adequately compensated by the Crown for his services, about being in poor health in Jamaica; always something,'' she said of the man being honored Oct. 12, 495 years after his journey to the Americas. **********Within the walls of the two-story 16th-century building are 40 million documents, neatly preserved in 43,000 boxes stored on mahogany shelving brought from Cuba. Although they are merely records and cold statistics, with no interpretation or analysis, they have attracted scholars from all over the world and resulted in important discoveries. Treasure Hunter Is Helped **********Last year, for example, Dr. Eugene Lyon, a University of Florida history professor, made public analyses of shipping data on Columbus's favorite vessel, the Nina, from documents here. The findings are expected to contribute to the understanding of those early voyages. **********Information from the archive was also instrumental in helping Mel Fisher, the treasure hunter, strike it rich two years ago by locating the sunken Spanish galleon Nuestra Senora de Atocha and her $100 million cargo. The ship went down in the Gulf of Mexico in a hurricane in 1622. **********Reading through the documents can be about as thrilling as culling water and electric bills in the records room of New York City Hall, except that the records here are from Spain's glory days of empire-building. They date from as far back as 1492, an era of exciting discovery and pioneering, change and conquest, hardship and abuse. **********The archive is not open to the public, and scholars wishing access must present a written request from their institutions. Treasure hunters like Mr. Fisher, not as welcome here as scholars, find the wealth of information invaluable. Mr. Fisher was so appreciative that he donated a cannon from the galleon. Bureaucratic in the Extreme **********The Spanish were extremists in bureaucratic demands. ''Down to every detail, everything done had to be approved in Spain,'' Miss Parra said. ''All laws, all changes in laws, construction plans, all of it had to have permission from Seville. **********''Copies of everything - birth, marriage and death certificates, for example - were sent here. The documents here are administrative, not a chronicle; they make dull reading, but they are very important.'' **********Most of the material is well preserved - there is no air conditioning or heating in the archive, leaving those using it sometimes sweating and sometimes shivering - but there is an active restoration process with a staff of half a dozen. The archive is also working to computerize and microfilm every piece of paper. **********Miss Parra said the history of the Americas is not just for historians. Geologists, philosophers and military scholars are making more use of it. ''More economists are visiting nowadays,'' she said. ''Previously, language and religion were major topics of research.'' **********Victoria Stapells Johnson, a Canadian, began research here 12 years ago as an anthropologist but became attracted to treasure hunting and is now in love with it. She said that her most exciting project was helping Mr. Fisher in his hunt for the Nuestra Senora de Atocha, but that she also works for scholars. **********But for an American, at this time of year, the main treasure in this storehouse of the administrative capital of the now-gone empire revolves around Columbus and the approaching 500th anniversary of his discoveries. The American Ambassador, Reginald Bartholomew, visited the archive recently and said it was sheer joy to hold in his hands personal letters between Christopher Columbus and Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Letters to Columbus **********Miss Parra said other communications to or from Columbus in the archive include an authorization dated April 30, 1492, for insurance policies for his crew and exemption from taxes on provisions bought in Seville for his trip; a letter from the King and Queen dated Aug. 23, 1493, telling him to prepare an army of conquest in Barcelona for his second trip, and a letter from Jamaica, dated July 7, 1503, saying he was in poor health. **********Other documents bestow on Columbus the titles of admiral, viceroy and governor general of the Indies. There is a letter from the Crown to the treasurer directing him to pay the navigator, a letter on sending prisoners to the New World and a letter from Queen Isabella suggesting a good position in the army for a friend. **********Cervantes, like the hero in his ''Don Quixote de la Mancha,'' was considered brave and unselfish - and was also a poor money manager. He served time in prison on occasion for nonpayment of debt, which led to his request, never granted, to leave the country."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/25/business/company-news-kinder-care-seeks-florida-thrift-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-06-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kinder-Care Seeks Florida Thrift Unit", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Kinder-Care Seeks Florida Thrift Unit", "body_text": " **********Kinder-Care Inc., a day-care provider, plans to buy the American Savings and Loan Association of Miami for about $138 million, American's chairman said.
