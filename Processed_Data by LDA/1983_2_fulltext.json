Schmidt, vice chairman of Control Data Corporation, the computer maker, and president of the Washington committee, said in a foreword, ''It is high time to look at our trade with the U.S.S.R. without emotion, with utilization of the best information possible and with an honest effort to correct the errors of the past.'' **********Mr. Schmidt said the study, titled ''Common Sense in U.S.-Soviet Trade,'' was intended to present what he called the realities of commerce between the two countries. **********''One reality we all should recognize,'' he said, ''is that there is no advantage in not doing business. Another is that we are not going to insure peace by trade alone. **********''But the strategic relationship is such that we either must live with the Soviets on this planet or die with them. There is no point in aggravating our relations by punitive trade policies which are politically ineffective and economically self-destructive.'' **********The allusion appears to be to disputes between the United States and its allies, which have often supplied Moscow with goods embargoed at various times by Washington. **********The volume of trade with the Soviet Union carried on by such countries as West Germany, Japan, France and Italy has long exceeded American trade with the Russians. **********The trade study was written before a South Korean airliner was shot down by a Soviet fighter plane on Sept. 1 and does not deal with the repercussions. Trade with Moscow has again emerged as an issue since the incident. **********Last month an interagency advisory group in the Reagan Administration recommended that some 17 oil and gas exploration products be placed under tighter export controls supervised by the Pentagon. The recommendation led to the resignation in protest by William A. Root, the State Department's top official for trade with Communist countries. **********On Oct. 4 it was disclosed that the Administration had decided to ignore the recommendation of the interagency group. The Government was evidently reluctant to impose additional curbs on trade with the Russians and hoped to avoid new frictions with the allies. **********The Administration decision, in turn, gave rise to reports that Lawrence J. Brady, an Assistant Secretary of Commerce and a hard-liner on the issue of trading with the Russians, might now leave the Government. **********The book issued by the Committee on East-West Accord contends that American trade sanctions have proved ineffective because Moscow can circumvent them by obtaining embargoed goods elsewhere. The study also argues that contracts, once signed, should not be breached by suspending export licenses for policy reasons.  Among the authors, aside from Mr. Schmidt, are business leaders who have had experience in dealing with the Russians, including Donald M. Kendall, chairman of PepsiCo Inc.; James H. Giffen, a corporate vice president of Armco Inc., and Michael V. Forrestal and Harold B. Scott, former presidents of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council, a New York-based trade promotion group. **********A gas industry executive, Jack H. Ray of Tennessee Gas Transmission, noted that the Reagan Administration adopted a futile course last year in opposing construction of the gas pipeline from Siberia to Western Europe. The project was favored by the Western Europeans, and the laying of pipe on the 2,800-mile Soviet segment was completed in August. **********The 173-page soft-cover book is available for $5 from the American Committee on East-West Accord, 109 11th Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/23/business/dow-up-by-7.01-to-1275.81.html": {"writer_name": "Alexander Hammer", "pub_date": "1983-11-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 914, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DOW UP BY 7.01, TO 1,275.81", "print_headline": "DOW UP BY 7.01, TO 1,275.81", "body_text": " **********Trading in telephone company stocks dominated the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, accounting for almost 8 percent of all shares that changed hands and helping to push up stock prices in general. **********The Dow Jones industrial average, which was in the plus column throughout the session, closed up 7.01 points, to 1,275.81 after having climbed 17.78 points the day before. **********Trading in the shares of the ''old'' and ''new'' American Telephone and Telegraph Company totaled just over 9 million. Total Big Board volume was 117.6 million shares, the largest since Oct. 6 when 118.3 million shares were traded. **********On Monday, volume in the two stocks represented 11.5 percent of that day's turnover of 97.7 million shares on the Big Board. The stocks of the ''new'' A.T.& T. and the seven regional companies that are to come into existence on Jan. 1 began trading Monday on a ''when-issued'' basis. In all, 1.6 billion new shares were listed, the largest listing ever of new stock in a single day. **********Some Blue Chips Do Well **********In the overall market, 998 issues advanced in price on the New York Stock Exchange, while 658 declined. Some blue chips and technology issues again were strong.  The volume leader for the second consecutive session was the ''when- issued'' shares of the ''new'' A.T.&T., the company that will remain after its regional operations are spun off. The stock rose 5/8, to 18 5/8, on a turnover of about 5 million shares. **********Most analysts believe that the surge of trading in the stocks of the ''new'' and ''old'' A.T.& T. will continue for a few days more and then drop after professional speculators and arbritgers lose interest. They have been the principal buyers and sellers, seeking to make quick profits as the prices of the shares fluctuate in the initial trading. **********The stock of the still-existing, or ''old,'' A.T.& T., which will continue to trade through mid-February under the divestiture plan, were up 1, to 64 1/2. The stock was the second most- heavily traded with 4.1 million shares changing hands. **********Most Regionals Lower **********Most of the seven regional telephone companies finished lower yesterday in moderate trading. Bell South lost 1 1/4, to 89; Pacific Telesis was off 1/2, to 54 5/8; Southwestern Bell eased 1/8, to 61 3/8; U S West, 1/8, to 59, and Bell Atlantic, 1/4, to 70. On the upside, Ameritech gained 1 1/4, to 66 3/8, and Nynex, 7/8, to 63. **********Robert H. Stovall, director of investment policy of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said equities were buoyed by a Commerce Department report that durable goods orders for October rose 3 percent, its biggest gain since a 7.6 percent rise in June. **********Another favorable factor for the market was the Government's revised report that the gross national product in the third quarter increased by 7.7 percent, instead of the 7.9 percent rise previously announced. **********Mr. Stovall said the slower growth of the economy would lessen pressure on interest rates and thus tend to spur stock prices. He said that early indications are that fourth-quarter G.N.P. gains will be the same or less than in the previous quarter. **********The market's impressive gain on Monday was spurred by the Commerce Department's report of a gain of 1.2 percent in personal income in October, which was its biggest monthly advance since August 1981, and a small decline in interest rates in the credit markets. Bond yields again fell modestly yesterday. **********Other Indicators Gain **********The two other major market indicators also ended higher yesterday. The exchange's composite index of 1,500 common stocks rose 0.41, to 96.33, while Standard & Poor's index of 500 issues gained 0.79, to 166.84. **********Charles S. Comer, vice president of Oppenheimer & Company, said that while the market's recent strength is encouraging, ''the absence of broader participation in the secondary issues detracts from the prospects for a continuation of the advance.'' **********Long Island Lighting was actively- traded yesterday and fell 1 3/4, to 12 5/8, after it was reported that Governor Cuomo of New York will not act to help open the company's troubled nuclear power plant in Shoreham, L.I. The company said the fate of the plant's license is in the hands of the Federal Government. **********The biggest loser among the 15 most-active issues was International Business Machines. The company yesterday increased its interest in Intel Corporation to 16.3 percent of Intel's outstanding stock. I.B.M. had previously announced that it has agreed to acquire no more than 30 percent of Intel's stock. Intel, which trades in the over-the-counter market, rose 3/4, to 42 1/2 bid. **********In the stronger blue-chip category, American Brands advanced 2 1/2, to 58 1/4, while gains of a point or more were registered by Union Carbide, General Foods and U.S. Steel. **********The biggest gainers among the technology stocks were Honeywell, which rose 1 3/4, to 134 1/2, and Digital Equipment, 1 3/8, to 72 7/8. Computervision added 1 1/8, to 46 1/8, and Hewlett- Packard, 1, to 40 3/4. **********On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index was up 0.71, to 221.02. CDI Corporation rose 2 1/2, to 29 1/4, after reporting that its profits in the quarter ended Oct. 31 climbed to $1.04 a share from 19 cents. **********In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq composite index increased 1.50, to 284.55."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/05/world/voice-of-america-is-telling-russians-of-plane-incident.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Voice of America Is Telling Russians of Plane Incident", "print_headline": "Voice of America Is Telling Russians of Plane Incident", "body_text": " **********The Voice of America is increasing broadcasts to the Soviet Union in an effort to get the story out about the downing of a South Korean airliner by a Russian warplane, a spokesman said today. **********The spokesman for the United States Information Agency, which runs Voice of America, said the radio station began adding 56 transmitter hours of broadcasting daily after the crisis began. **********''The Soviets are giving their own people even less than they are giving us,'' Charles Z.

And it was a welcome reversal of roles. Last year, these were the stocks that were shunned by Wall Street - sold off by large institutional investors and left to flounder throughout the fall and winter. **********Analysts now point to March 31 as the beginning of the upturn for oil stocks. Since then, Standard & Poor's composite index of oil stock prices has risen more than three times as much as the S.& P.500. **********The question now facing investors is whether the oils are priced too high. Can current prices be justified in face of abundant oil and gas inventories, hundreds of idle drilling rigs and refineries running way below capacity? Indeed, analysts maintain the oil industry has serious problems to overcome, and their assessments of the oil stocks have become increasingly cautious in recent weeks. **********Charles C. Cahn of Sanford C. Bernstein offered one of the most skeptical views. Mr. Cahn said he would not recommend that investors buy any stock in the group at current prices and thinks that it would take ''something like a 20 percent increase in the gross national product,'' and the resulting increase in demand for oil and gas, for him to change his mind. **********Other analysts retain a more positive position than Mr. Cahn, but they say they have become far more selective about which oil stocks they are recommending. ''The easy stuff is behind us,'' said Rosario Ilacqua of L. F. Rothchild. **********Despite the caution, most Wall Street analysts who follow the oil and gas industry continue to recommend a select number of oil stocks. Among the stocks on the buy lists of these analysts last week were Amerada Hess, Mobil, Schlumberger and Dorchester Hugoton Ltd., a small gas producer. **********The rally in oil stocks began some two weeks after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries reached a long awaited agreement in mid-March to lower the price of its crude oil by 15 percent and set production quotas to prevent a worsening of the worldwide oil glut. **********Although the accord was widely regarded as good news for oil companies, Wall Street's response was delayed because of doubts that the agreement would hold. ''The market responded only when it decided OPEC was acting with discipline, and stock prices continued to rise as the market became more convinced that the discipline would be maintained,'' Mr. Cahn said. **********In recent weeks, oil stocks have been bolstered even further by concern that the three-year-old war between Iran and Iraq, both major producers, will flare up. France has recently supplied Iraq with sophisticated jet fighters and heat seeking missiles, and analysts speculate that Iraq could begin to use them against oil tankers at Iran's oil port. If that happens, many believe the war could engulf Saudi Arabia and other Middle East producers, creating a major oil disruption. **********If the Iran-Iraq war does not escalate sharply, analysts agree that oil supplies will be plentiful and prices roughly unchanged for at least two years. Thus, the earnings performance and growth of American oil companies will not benefit from OPEC-imposed price increases. Rather they will rise or fall on the success of their exploration programs, the efficiency of their refining and marketing operations, and the impact of changes in government regulations. **********Amerada Hess ranks high on several analysts' lists of recommended stocks because its oil production in the North Sea is expected to expand rapidly. The First Boston Corporation estimated that Hess's North Sea oil production, which averaged 24,370 barrels a day last year, would increase to 80,000 barrels a day by 1986. **********Thomas Petrie of First Boston also said he expects Hess to benefit from exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska's Beaufort Sea, where it acquired a promising oil production lease from the Department of the Interior this year. With the cash generated by its North Sea oil, Amerada ''has a very good inventory of future opportunities and the horsepower to explore them,'' Mr. Petrie said. **********Several analysts pick Mobil as another company that will benefit from expanding production. Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil company, is bringing several new wells into production in the North Sea and Indonesia. **********MR. ILACQUA of L. F. Rothschild, one those who favor Mobil, said the company's earnings will also be broadened this year because it is paying less for the oil it buys from Saudi Arabia. As part of the March OPEC accord, the Saudis lowered their crude price to $29 from $34 a barrel. As one of the four American oil companies that are partners in the Arabian American Oil Company, or Aramco, Mobil is currently increasing its purchases at the lower price. **********The oilfield services industry has yet to recover from the rapid decline in drilling last year. After a slight but steady increase in drilling activity this summer, there were only 2,445 rigs in operation in the United States and Canada last week - slightly more than half of those that were operating in December 1981. **********But analysts expect the business of some oilfield service concerns to get better. Several pick Schlumberger, a maker of tools that are used by oil drillers to detect, or ''log,'' underground geological formations. **********Schlumberger has taken a lead in computerized logging equipment, which allows drillers to chart formations more accurately. ''Even with surplus capacity'' in the oil drilling industry, ''the technologically advanced companies will prosper, and Schlumberger heads that list,'' said Elizabeth Peek of Wertheim & Company. **********Many speculative investors, meanwhile, believe that money can be made by acquiring the stocks of natural gas production companies because of the possibility of changes in government regulations. Analysts maintain that decontrol of natural gas prices - a highly controversial proposal before Congress - would sharply increase the earnings of some of these companies. **********Kurt H. Wulff, of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, picks Dorchester Hugoton. The company has large reserves, but its gas can only be sold at extremely low prices under Federal price controls. Mr. Wulff says the company is selling its gas for an average of 30 cents per thousand cubic feet, or one-tenth the industry average of $3 per thousand cubic feet. **********Thus, while the company faces severe problems now, it would benefit greatly from changes in government regulations. Even without price decontrol, Mr. Wulff said the company would gain from proposed changes in state regulations in Kansas, where most of its gas reserves are. The proposal in that state would allow Dorchester to sink one additional gas well for each of the wells it already operates, and charge far higher prices for the gas produced in the new wells."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/20/world/the-un-today-april-20-1983.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

Rosan, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, explained that there had been a growing problem in recent years with building owners who refused to pay commissions to brokers for their work in finding tenants for commercial buildings. The real estate board, the industry's most prominent trade organization, counts as members both owners and brokers. **********Aaron Gural, vice president of the board's brokerage division, adds that the problem has existed for 20 years but has lately grown to serious proportions. **********The result is a bill that protects brokers by allowing them to place liens on a building when a commission has not been paid.  Passage of the legislation, Mr. Rosan said, was one of the major accomplishments of the real estate board last year. **********Every state has enacted some form of ''mechanic's lien'' law, which allows those who furnish labor or materials to impose liens against a contractor or property owner. Owners cannot sell a property or change the financing when there is a lien on the property. Officials here believe New York has become the first state that includes brokers in the mechanic's lien law. **********Instead of litigating, which can eat up a third or more of a commission, the broker now has the option of placing a lien on the property. **********A survey by the real estate board in the fall of 1981 found brokers and owners disputing $16 million in commissions over a fiveyear period. The survey looked at 75 Manhattan brokers who had 284 cases of disputed commissions. In 54 percent of the cases, the disputes involved the commission on the sale of a property. **********The amounts of the disputes ranged from $800 to $2.5 million.  Large commissions are usually paid in stages over several years, sometimes as long as five years. Most brokers are totally dependent on commissions for their income, although some do receive an additional regular salary. **********The new law covers only leasing commissions and only those commissions where the broker has a written contract with the owner.  The legal and logical questions about disputed commissions on sales are more difficult and as a result the bill was limited to leases, according to Mr. Rosan. **********The real estate board's report estimated that about $10 million in disputed claims had been settled. Brokers reported ''concrete losses'' of $4.9 million in the settled cases. ''Most settlements occur though negotiation,'' the report said, ''probably because, in 76 percent of the cases settled through litigation, legal fees absorbed at least one-third of the cash received by the broker. Under these circumstances, brokers negotiate low settlements rather than invest time in litigation only to see one-third of the settlement go to legal fees.'' **********Mr. Gural, who is chairman of Newmark & Company Real Estate, said problems in collecting commissions had recently become worse because there is a ''new type of owner'' in the city. Newmark started as a brokerage firm 50 years ago and has expanded to other areas of real estate, but Mr. Gural is also an owner. **********He said that the number of ''foreign owners'' was growing and that many of the newcomers ''are people not used to the way of paying bills.'' He added, ''Frankly, some of these owners are not aware that brokers' commissions have to be paid on time and properly.'' **********Mr. Gural also said the problem had been exacerbated by the fact that many new owners were not real estate professionals but people in other unrelated busineses who owned only one building. Mr. Rosan agreed, adding that sometimes the disputes arose when a building changed hands. **********Sometimes the broker who is still owed money for placing a tenant in the building becomes trapped between the old and new owner. Mr.  Rosan said problems were also generated by ''faceless people and offshore companies'' that were buying Manhattan properties in great numbers these days. **********Larry Silverstein, one of the major owners of the city, who is chairman of the real estate board and one of bill's biggest supporters, had a slightly different explanation of the problem. **********''Most owners are very responsible people,'' he said. ''They fulfill their responsibilities to the broker. In many instances - not the major buildings, but in many instances where properties are less significant - the broker has not been able to collect.'' **********Mr. Silverstein said he agreed that the problem had been growing, but he attributed the cause to more difficult economic times.  Skeptics believe that the new law may be a disappointment for brokers. Owners, the skeptics said, may now simply refuse to give brokers a written contract to lease space, thereby avoiding the possibility of a lien."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/11/world/israeli-killed-in-lebanon.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 49, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israeli Killed in Lebanon", "print_headline": "Israeli Killed in Lebanon", "body_text": " **********An Israeli soldier was killed today by an explosive device as his patrol was moving through the southern approaches to Sidon in southern Lebanon, an army spokesman said.

Instead of moving toward a national consensus that almost every sector of Venezuelan society has been calling for in broadcast appeals and newspaper advertisements, the Government has shunned consultation, and the two key members of its economic team have fallen into an open quarrel. **********Import restrictions are being issued periodically, and their application has appeared erratic. Some, for instance, have been directed at life-supporting medical equipment while an announced ban on whisky is apparently being reconsidered. **********The dispute between the two men is considered so damaging that the leadership of President Luis Herrera Campins's Social Christian Copei Party has called for the resignation of one of them, Leopoldo Diaz Bruzual, the central bank president, and has pledged to submit him to an embarrassing party disciplinary procedure if he does not step down. Pay Raise Criticized **********Mr. Diaz Bruzual, commonly referred to by Venezuelans as ''the buffalo'' because of his physically intimidating manner, further alienated critics by taking a 94 percent pay increase while demanding austerity from the nation. Word also emerged that he had received a $500,000 loan from the central bank credit union, the bulk of it at 4 percent interest over 25 years. **********The other principal in the dispute, Finance Minister Arturo Sosa, returned from New York tonight after discussing with bankers the refinancing of more than $9 billion in short-term debt. The Government still has not determined the total, according to economic analysts here. ''Each day they keep finding more,'' one said. **********Banking sources cited by the management newsletter Veneconomy said they thought the current renegotiation was only a prelude to a formal restructuring of the nation's entire $24 billion foreign debt. This would begin, the publication reported, with the declaration of a ''standstill,'' under which no principal payments would be made for three to six months while a new repayment schedule was worked out based on oil income projections. **********Before leaving Caracas Thursday night, Mr. Sosa estimated that Venezuela's anticipated oil income for this year would fall by $2.8 billion because of the new production quotas agreed upon at the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in London earlier this month. Petroleum industry sources however, said they thought the reduction could run as high as $5 billion. Spending Cuts Urged **********Many economists are saying that a cut of up to 20 percent in Government spending is needed, but the Government has shown no disposition to make such a move. It is widely acknowledged that the present crisis has its roots in the huge increases in public spending during the years of the oil price boom. **********The federal bureaucracy has grown in the past decade to 1.2 million people from 300,000, and Government spending in that period has risen to $22.6 billion from $3.5 billion. The participation of the state in total production of goods and services has grown to 65 percent from 32 percent 20 years ago. **********Along with its apparent reluctance to attack state spending, the Government has devised a three-tiered exchange rate that has nearly doubled the debt burden of private companies while maintaining for the public sector access to cheaper dollars. **********Total private debt in Venezuela is $6 billion to $8 billion. Under the exchange rate program, the Government can continue to buy dollars at the longtime rate of 4.3 bolivars, but private companies have to purchase them either at 6 bolivars or at a floating rate as high as 9 bolivars. An Exchange Windfall **********By purchasing dollars at the lower rate and selling them at the higher one, the Government stands to obtain a windfall of bolivars.  By contrast, leaders of business said that thousands of companies would go bankrupt if the decree stood. **********This procedure aroused such controversy that President Herrera amended it. In his televised annual address to Congress on March 9 he disclosed that the preferential dollar rate would be extended to private businesses. And Mr. Sosa said that businesses could qualify if they were able to convert their short-term obligations into longer ones. **********That evening, however, Mr. Diaz Bruzual said he had heard nothing of the plan and did not necessarily go along with it. This remarkable public disagreement has been allowed to continue. **********Imports, on which all strata of the Venezuelan economy are heavily dependent, have stopped while traders await word on which dollar rates to use for transactions. Consecomercio, the country's largest retail trade organization, said it would resort to a one-day protest strike if the indecision persisted. Prices Frozen **********There is a certain irony in the threat since the level of business activity in Venezuela has already been sharply reduced. Many companies are using emergency inventories, while others are holding back supplies in anticipation of higher prices. The Government froze prices in February until April 28. **********The crisis began to build with the decline in oil revenues and a concomitant flight of capital out of the country. Central bank reserves, which stood at $20.1 billion at the beginning of 1982, were down to $8.6 billion and falling rapidly at the beginning of this month. The bank has stopped publishing the figure, an indication that they have reached dangerous levels. **********Two steps taken by the Government to build reserves also had the effect of eroding investor confidence and caused more money to leave the country. The Government revalued its gold reserves from $35 an ounce to $400, and it nationalized the reserves of the state oil monopoly. **********On the last day of dollar trading before the exchange halt, $230 million left Venezuela.  The dormant economy did receive one piece of good news in the past week, however. Citing the exchange controls as the reason, banks said they would lower interest rates on April 1 by 3 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/26/business/company-news-mattel-studying-public-offering.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mattel Studying Public Offering", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Mattel Studying Public Offering", "body_text": " **********Mattel Inc. is considering a public offering of stock in its toy division, a company spokesman said, because the unit has enjoyed a record year. **********For the six months ended July 30, the company as a whole had a loss of $179.4 million, substantially wider than the deficit of $31.2 million a year earlier.

Only in recent years have community leaders been able to take steps to attract the private investment that is necessary to lift the community above the level of subsistence. **********Their capacity to even begin this process results from the success of the government-sponsored housing programs. But it also stems from the perception that loading a community with subsidized housing is inimical in the long run to that community's revitalization. **********George Brooker holds this view. He is president of Webb & Brooker, a Harlem-based real estate firm that manages several major commercial properties and more than 8,000 apartments throughout the city. **********''Although government housing programs have done tremendous good, we can't afford to blanket the community with subsidized developments,'' Mr. Brooker said in a recent interview. **********''A healthy community is one that's economically integrated,'' he continued. ''We need the kind of housing that will make the middle class want to live here and lure further private investment.'' **********That this can occur is not merely wishful thinking, despite the continued severity of Harlem's housing problems. **********The town-house market in Harlem is attracting greater interest. A coalition of city and community leaders is trying to put the finishing touches on a comprehensive plan - based on participation by the private sector - to spur residential and commercial development. And signs of private investment in Harlem's vast multifamily housing stock are beginning to occur. **********One example is the new partnership formed by Mr. Brooker's firm and the Georgetown Company, a real estate consulting and development concern. Its president is Edgar Lampert, former president of the Community Development Corporation. **********His company is a subsidiary of the Georgetown Group, a diversified real estate and financial services company headed by Marshall Rose, former president of the Arlen Realty and Development Corporation. **********This joint venture brings together four men - Eugene Webb is the other principal of Webb & Brooker - with considerable expertise in real estate matters. **********Their first project has been to purchase a 236-apartment building at 345 West 145th Street from the Bowery Savings Bank. They paid ''in excess of $2 million,'' Mr. Brooker said. **********The 14-story rent-stabilized structure at the corner of St. Nicholas Avenue was built by the bank in 1956 and is called the Bowery Building. It occupies a prominent place in Harlem - and not just because the elevation of 145th Street at that point affords a view of most of the community. **********The Bowery Building has been a well-maintained property since its opening, Mr. Brooker said. Webb & Brooker has managed the 164,000- square-foot property since 1969. **********It contains a branch of the bank and 10 stores on the ground floor, and its residential tenantry is solidly middle class. **********The Bowery was looking to sell the building. Because the bank intended to maintain its branch there, however, it wanted to have confidence in the new owners. **********That is why the bank itself brought together Webb & Brooker, which wished to make equity investments, and the Rose-Lampert combine, with whom the bank has a separate joint- venture relationship. **********''They know us both well,'' Mr. Rose said, referring to the bank, ''and they know our feelings about the building and the neighborhood.'' **********The new owners plan some minor renovations but nothing drastic. Rather, Mr. Lampert said, they want to assure that the building remains a bulwark of one of Harlem's most stable neighborhoods. **********That neighborhood, which includes the campus of City College, is formally called Hamilton Heights. In colonial times much of it was Alexander Hamilton's homestead; now a big section is a historic district. **********Since the 1920's the area, which has a large stock of town houses and a sizable middle class population, has been known as Sugar Hill. **********''There's a great potential for building an even stronger community here,'' Mr. Lampert said, referring to numerous residential and commercial renovations in the neighborhood. ''This building has always helped anchor the area, and we want it to continue to do so.'' **********He added that the building, which the two firms own as equal partners, embodies the purposes of their joint venture: to acquire and manage income-producing properties in inner cities across the country - and thus help improve these areas - by combining the financial resources of the Georgetown Group with the management expertise of Webb & Brooker. **********''We both have qualities that we hope will attract private capital into areas that in the past have almost totally relied on government and insitutional subsidies,'' Mr. Brooker said. ''We can offer a new route to development in these communities.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/15/business/stake-in-superior-reported.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 348, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STAKE IN SUPERIOR REPORTED", "print_headline": "STAKE IN SUPERIOR REPORTED", "body_text": " **********Bear, Stearns & Company, the investment banking house, has purchased between 2.5 million and 3 million shares of the Superior Oil Company within the last two weeks, Wall Street arbitragers said yesterday. **********Reports circulated that most of the shares had been bought on behalf of T.

The move would increase Japan's influence over World Bank lending decisions and add to its prestige, especially among third world countries. **********In return, Japan would be expected to increase its payments to the International Development Agency, the World Bank's arm that provides low- cost loans to developing nations, these sources said. Talks on funding for the agency for the next three years are scheduled to open here Dec. 9. **********U.S. Plan for Ceiling **********An increase in Japan's subscription to the fund will become particularly important, officials say, if the Reagan Administration sticks to its present plan of putting a ceiling of $750 million annually on the American contribution to the agency's next three-year budget. **********Since the United States has agreed to pay 25 percent of the agency's budget, this would limit the organization's total resources for the three years to $9 billion. That is far less than other aid-giving countries think is needed to finance cheap loans for very poor countries that cannot afford to borrow at normal market rates. **********Japan has asked for the added voting power on the bank's executive board because it has such a large economy and is contributing the second-largest amount to the agency. **********Japanese Production **********The latest figures from the Organization of Economic Coooperation and Development put total Japanese output last year, as measured by the gross national product, at $686.4 billion, which is only about a third of the United States output but still comfortably ahead of the next three biggest Western economies - Germany, France and Britain. **********Meanwhile, Japan is currently providing 14 percent of the agency's resources, a figure second only to the 25 percent given by the United States. **********Yet while the United States accounts for 20 percent of the combined voting power of the World Bank's executive board, Japan occupies fifth place with a shade under 4.5 percent of the votes. It lags Britain, which has a 5.1 percent share, Germany, with 4.6 percent, and France, with 4.5 percent. **********This discrepency has come about because shareholdings in the World Bank and its sister institution, the International Monetary Fund, still largely reflect individual countries' relative wealth and power after World War II and have never been fully adjusted for subsequent changes. **********A bigger World Bank shareholding would not cost the Japanese Government much, officials say, because only a small part of the bank's capital is actually paid in - most takes the form of a government guarantee on loans the bank makes. **********Higher Level of Funding Sought **********In return, however, other Western donors want Japan to help assure that the I.D.A. is refinanced next month at a substantially higher level than the Reagan Administration appears to want. The last time the agency's resources were replenished, in 1979, the loan agency was given $12 billion to spend over three years to aid the world's poorest countries. **********At this next replenishment, the World Bank is asking donor countries for $16 billion, to compensate for inflation and to allow for the fact that China, which only joined the World Bank in 1980, will become fully eligible for I.D.A. assistance. Last summer, finance ministers of the European Economic Community agreed jointly to support a minimum replenishment of $12 billion, with some ready to go to $16 billion. **********But the Reagan Administration still wants to limit the United States contribution to $750 million over three years, which, because of the funding formula involved, would reduce I.D.A. total funding to $9 billion. Over the last two years, however, Congress has shown greater support for the agency by appropriating $945 million annually. **********Difficult Political Choice **********If the United States sticks to its planned contribution, other Western donors face a difficult political choice, officials say. On the one hand, they believe a larger amount is necessary for the development and stability of the poorest countries, many of which are in sensitive strategic locations. But they are reluctant to abandon the principal of sharing the burden in international organizations, whereby members divide up the cost according to their wealth, by paying in more money themselves and letting America's contribution fall under the agreed 25 percent share. **********The United States currently accounts for 33 percent of the total economic output of all nations that donate to the agency, suggesting that its planned share of the organization's budget is already low. If it is allowed to fall futher, European officials fear it will set a dangerous precedent that could encourage the United States to reduce its contribution to other international organizations. **********The dilemma might be avoided, or at least reduced, officials say, if Japan agrees to increase its share of the I.D.A.'s budget above the present 14 percent. It could justify this by pointing to the small amount of bilateral aid it gives the third world and also by its special interest in promoting economic development in China, which would mainly benefit Japanese industry."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/01/business/business-people-engineer-chosen-to-run-real-estate-developer.html": {"writer_name": "Daneil Cuff", "pub_date": "1983-07-01", "snippet": "Skender Ghilaga has been named president of R.H.

They are charged with high treason, an offense that carries a possible death sentence. **********The hearings in the Rand Supreme Court have provided a rare glimpse into the world of South Africa's secret police and its operations against foes of apartheid. **********Moreover, the disclosures at the trial seemed designed to create suspicion and mistrust among South African dissidents because they have highlighted the authorities' ability to undermine the nationalist movement by planting spies and informers in its ranks. **********From evidence so far not only did a South African agent penetrate the cell in which the two defendants were purportedly involved, but the police, through its ''mole,'' also effectively ran the dissident unit and was privy to its secrets.   Charges Are Denied **********The defendants, Carl Niehaus and Johanna Lourens, have denied treason charges and other associated accusations. Many of the witnesses, appearing for the prosecution, have been friends and associates prevailed upon to turn state's evidence. The most illuminating testimony has been that of Robert Whitecross, whom they were said to regard as a trusted accomplice. **********On Wednesday Mr. Whitecross was introduced to the court as a security agent recruited in April 1980 while a student by Maj. Craig Williamson, reportedly a key figure in the Security Police Department, which deals with infiltration of the ranks of those perceived as enemies. Major Williamson is said to be a former agent himself.  Mr. Whitecross's task was said to be to keep tabs on university people with nationalist or Communist ties. **********In evidence, Mr. Niehaus has been accused of seeking to recruit fellow whites as agents for the African National Congress, which is banned in South Africa, and of helping four young blacks flee into exile. **********Mr. Niehaus was also, according to Mr. Whitecross, entrusted with the task of obtaining photographs and plans of the Johannesburg City Council gas works as a possible target for sabotage by the African National Congress. To obtain the photographs, Mr. Niehaus is said to have enlisted the help of Mr. Whitecross, the policeman.   Police Took Photographs **********Thus, when he needed a vehicle to get to the gas works, he asked Mr. Whitecross to obtain one. Mr. Whitecross said in court Wednesday that after consulting what he called his handler in the Security Police, he had agreed to do so the African National Congress sympathizer and the secret policeman, thus, drove together to the gas works in a pickup supplied by the Security Police. **********As Mr. Niehaus took the photographs of the gas works, the police took equally clandestine pictures of him. Mr. Whitecross said he had then been asked to insure that the film was developed. He did so, at the Security Police headquarters. **********The photographs, and a hand-drawn plan of the gas works were to have been taken by courier to neighboring, black- ruled Botswana on Aug. 26, but Mr. Niehaus was arrested three days before then. At that time Mr. Whitecross had been associated with Mr. Niehaus for 18 months. **********By producing Mr. Whitecross in court, and identifying him as an agent, the Security Police seemed to have calculated that it was worth blowing his cover in return for the uncertainty created in dissident groups. The question the Security Police seems to be inviting among its opponents is: How many ''moles'' are there and who are they?   Convulsed With Laughter **********Mr. Whitecross said he had shared a commune with Miss Lourens and Mr. Niehaus. The disclosure in court of his identity seemed to stun not only the two accused but also many of their friends in the public galleries. But security policemen outside the courtroom were reportedly convulsed with laughter at their dismay. **********The state case against the two Afrikaners reinforces a Security Police nurtured image of omniscience, but does not obscure the fact that its effectiveness is not total. **********While African National Congress officials themselves acknowledged that the group was a target for penetration and had been infiltrated in the past, the nationalist movement nonetheless claimed responsibility for the most dramatic act of urban warfare in South Africa in recent years: last May's car- bomb blast outside a military office building in Pretoria. Nineteen people were killed and more than 200 were wounded. **********The African National Congress said at the time that the bombing represented a stepping up of that protracted and largely low-key campaign, but since then there has been little indication of significantly stepped-up activity.   Vote on a New Charter **********Several small bombings punctuated a referendum here last week on limited constitutional change but caused no major damage or injuries. Two elderly white people were attacked by armed men described by the authorities as ''terrorists'' in a remote area of the Northern Transvaal on Wednesday. The four attackers were killed Thursday by the army, according to a military statement. **********The Security Police is only one branch of South Africa's intelligence networks, seemingly dealing with day- to-day surveillance and other activities. The National Intelligence Service, formerly called the Bureau of State Security, is thought to have a wider, more strategic role, while in recent years the military intelligence department has assumed significant influence. **********The intelligence establishment is supported by a large body of legislation, including the Internal Security Act and the Defense Act. The Internal Security Act provides for virtually unlimited detention without trial, and both measures place restrictions on press reporting of what are viewed as sensitive subjects. **********Public trials thus enable an unaccustomed degree of reporting of security matters for the South African press. **********The fact that the two defendants are whites has also attracted public attention, particularly since the accused are of the same Afrikaner stock as the hierarchy that has ruled since 1948 and that has molded apartheid into the landscape. **********But the history of Afrikanerdom in the 20th century is dotted with occasional figures who have pursued a limited small-scale revolt against their leaders. Radical whites have also been frequently associated with the African National Congress, and the South African authorities assert that the organization's head of military planning is a white South African named Joe Slovo."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/25/business/business-digest-wednesday-may-25-1983.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-05-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 650, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WEDNESDAY, MAY 25, 1983", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST; WEDNESDAY, MAY 25, 1983", "body_text": " **********The Economy **********Consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in April, the biggest increase since last July, the Labor Department reported.

Four marines had been killed in the almost-daily sniper and artillery fire that had pounded their airport compound since mid-August. And that morning an aide to Robert C. McFarlane, the United States special envoy in the Middle East, was on the secure radio, ordering Colonel Geraghty to request United States Naval bombardment of Druse militiamen in the nearby mountain town of Suk al Gharb. **********Colonel Geraghty protested, according to officers familiar with the conversation. ''He was violently against it,'' one of the officers said. ''We were supposed to be neutral peacekeepers, and now we were going to start shelling one of the factions.'' **********Fear of Retaliation **********American ships had shelled Moslem militiamen before, but only when the militiamen had fired on American positions first. This timethe Druse were in battle with the Lebanese Army, not the Americans. The Naval shelling was to help the Lebanese Army.  ''Our feeling was it was going to change our role here,'' one Marine officer said. ''And Geraghty was afraid it would open us up to the full brunt of retaliation from the Moslems.'' **********According to one account of the radio conversation that morning, Colonel Geraghty shouted, ''We're sitting ducks down here! Take that into account before firing. I feel we are going to take substantial casualties because of this.'' **********Colonel Geraghty was overruled. The shelling was ordered, partly because Administration officials felt that the fledgling Lebanese Army could not easily recover from a defeat at Suk al Gharb.  In Washington, officials acknowledged that the naval bombardment significantly broadened the United States role in Lebanon. Days earlier, President Reagan decided to permit the forces in Lebanon to fire in support of the Lebanese Army and not just in self-defense.   Feelings Toward the Marines **********Some Marine officers and others in Lebanon believe the shelling of Suk al Gharb helped create the hostile feelings toward the Marines that led to the truck- bomb attack a month later. **********No one can say for certain if that is true. But the incident seems to illustrate how the marines' mission has been linked to United States diplomatic-policy decisions from the day they landed in Beirut.   'No Longer Neutral' **********General Kelley, testifying before Congress, said of the shelling, ''Unfortunately, some could conclude that it may have increased the Moslem perception that our marines were pro- Christian and no longer neutral.'' **********An officer in one of Beirut's Moslem militias who is not hostile to the marines said the shelling had changed the marines' image among all Lebanese Moslems. ''After that, they were not neutral anymore,'' he said. **********A high-ranking United States military officer in Lebanon, not a marine, agreed. Still, he said, that did not excuse the marines for their vulnerability at their headquarters on Oct. 23. **********''It's the job of the commander to make sure his men are secure from attack, no matter what the other people do,'' he said. **********In answer to that, many marines say they felt constrained when devising defenses for their compound. More formidable barriers, they said, would have interfered with their stated mission.   'We Would Have Been Criticized' **********''We had to be present, to be seen by the Lebanese people,'' General Kelley told Congress last month. **********Major Jordan, the Marine spokesman at the time of the bombing, said, ''We would have been criticized for building massive defenses.'' **********But diplomats and Administration officials said the marines took the political aspect of their mission too seriously and censored themselves. **********General Mead said: ''I would say to you that at no time was there any finger pointing from the diplomatic side that you will perform this way for this reason. We just had a sensitivity to their mission and knew what they needed.'' **********A top-level State Department official who was directly involved with Lebanon matters said: ''I don't think anybody would have objected if the marines told us they needed to build sophisticated defenses around their compound.''  Debate Over Restraints **********Former Ambassador Dillon said: ''If the marines had deemed it necessary to build a 12-foot wall around their compound, then working it out with the Lebanese authorities would have been necessary. But it could have been done.'' **********Part of the problem was that the marines' role in Lebanon changed gradually from a largely ceremonial posture to one that was distinctly more aggresive. One Marine officer in Beirut said, ''They changed our role politically without letting our role change militarily at the same time.'' **********He added, ''We used to sit around the hooch, 11 or 12 of us officers,'' from every section of the unit, ''and we'd debate the ramifications of all the political restraints.''  An Effort to Be Respectful **********Initially, the marines were instructed ''not to be warlike,'' General Mead said, ''to be respectful to the local population.''The orders were for peacetime rules of engagement, ''the infamous rules,'' as the marine officer called them. ''They were force-fed to all of us, over and over, on the ships all the way across the Atlantic,'' he said. And they were printed on cards that every marine was required to carry. **********The rules stipulated that marines were to carry their weapons unloaded and were not to load and return fire unless they were attacked first by ''effective fire,'' the Marine officersaid. **********''There was always a lot of debate about what is effective fire,'' he said. ''Is it effective if it hits the dirt in front of you? Is it effective if it blows off your arm?''  First, an Order to Stop **********A sentry guarding the temporary United States Embassy in downtown Beirut last month described the prescribed procedure for stopping a suspected car-bomber rushing at him: **********''First you shout, 'Stop!' '' the sentry said. ''Then if he doesn't stop, you can load your weapon and shoot at the vehicle and try to hit the tires. If that doesn't stop him, then you are allowed to shoot at the driver.'' **********A Marine sentry at the compound described what he believed went through the mind of the sentry whose rifle was unloaded the morning of the truck bombing. **********As the truck rushed past, ''First you had to load your weapon,'' he said, demonstrating. That took three or four seconds. ''Then once you're loaded, you have to stop and think about the rules of engagement and whether or not you're allowed to fire.'' By then, he said, ''You'd be lucky to get off a shot.''  'Clearance to Get Killed' **********''Around here,'' he added, ''you've got to get clearance to get killed.'' **********The Marine officer recalled the time, last summer, when ''one of those big bully marines - you know one of those guys who weighs 285 pounds - was on patrol in a Moslem section when a Lebanese walked up to him and slugged him in the chest. Hit him hard. **********''Later, I asked him: 'You hit him back, didn't you?' He said, 'No sir. I've been ordered not to touch any Lebanese individuals.' '' **********One officer wrote a letter to Colonel Geraghty complaining that the rules of engagement and other instructions were being so strictly interpreted that the marines felt they were not allowed to defend themselves. He never received an answer, one officer said. **********Several officers said the rules of engagement and their interpretation by the men may have encouraged the truck bombing, because the marines had demonstrated that they were slow to fight back.   Rules on Arms Amended **********The rules were amended after the bombing. Sentries now carry loaded weapons. **********General Mead, who helped draft the initial rules, said: ''Really, they were to protect the men, because if you start shooting the Shiite Moslems, the shooting is going to increase, not diminish. And therefore you increase the threat to you.'' **********The Marine officers also felt constraints when they considered how their compound should be defended.  To illustrate, one officer recalled that at the end of February, ''we received some intelligence that said we had to be careful of the vendors.''  A Warning on Vendors **********The airport parking lot just south of the Marine compound - the one the terrorist truck driver circled to gather speed before crashing through the fence on Oct. 23 - was a favorite gathering spot for Lebanese. Salesmen carrying various goods often wandered from there up to the Marine positions, and in February, intelligence reports suggested that some of the vendors might be carrying bombs, the officer said. **********''I wanted to put in some concertina wire,'' the officer said. ''I said to my commander, 'Sir, I know this won't sit well with a lot of people, but we need concertina 250 yards out.' **********''It took forever to get a decision,'' he said, ''and in the end we were only allowed to put it 250 feet out.'' **********General Mead said: ''That's true, and it's a good example. We could have put the fences literally anywhere we wanted to. We could have taken the entire parking lot.   'A Fortress America' **********''But we had to balance that against the mission and the perception of all the people around the area. One, we didn't need a Fortress America. And two, we recognized that the Lebanese needed certain spaces.'' **********Colonel Anderson, second in command under General Mead last spring, said he wanted to place mine fields around the compound after the embassy bombing, ''but we couldn't do it.'' **********''We kept running into these conflicts; there were constraints,'' he said, and indicating puzzlement, he added, ''but I can't tell you where they were coming from.'' **********General Mead said, ''What a lot of people are having a hard time coming to grips with is that every time we did something, we had to balance the mission against the threat and the safety of the men.'' **********''The thing that we felt we could not do,'' said Colonel Geraghty, was to ''be holed up here because that ran counter to our mission.'' **********From his vantage point in London, Admiral Holcomb said, he and his staff made it ''a matter of continuous, almost daily discussion that, to do the peacekeeping mission, we were forced to expose the marines to a hostile environment.'' **********He added, ''We all understood the risks.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/01/business/sears-plc-plans-mail-order-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 101, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sears P.L.C.

While the economic advantages to private companies are clear, not everyone is pleased with the way the policy is being applied. **********Instead of enforcing limits on each source of air pollution within an industrial facility, the E.P.A., under the bubble policy, allows one overall reduction target for each pollutant type - as if the entire complex were covered by a bubble. If a company can achieve the goal through some innovative procedure, it is encouraged to do so. **********Several companies responded eagerly to the policy when it was announced. The first, Armco Inc. in Middletown, Ohio, avoided controls on particulate matter from some of its steelmaking processes through dust-reducing actions, such as paving roads, within the plant. The trade saved the company more than $10 million in capital costs and $2.5 million a year in operating costs. **********The New England Electric System, at its two side-by-side power plants in Providence, R.I., traded the requirement to burn low-sulfur oil at both for periodically burning high-sulfur oil at one and natural gas at the other. The bubble has saved the company $4 million to date in fuel costs. **********The Du Pont Company built what a spokesman calls the ''granddaddy'' of bubbles at its Chambers Works chemical plant in Deepwater, N.J.  Instead of lowering the emissions of ''volatile organic compounds'' - precursors of smog - by 85 percent from each of the plant's 112 stacks, it reduced the compounds from the plant's seven largest stacks by 99 percent through incineration. The trade not only saved the company $10 million, says Bob Bonczek, Du Pont's director of environmental affairs; it also achieved better overall pollution reduction, with the average per stack now 90 percent. **********Michael Levin, chief of the E.P.A.'s Regulatory Reform Staff, says that the agency has been directly involved in 38 such bubbles and that 180 more are being developed at the state level, representing total savings of $600 million in capital and first-year operating costs. If all potential bubbles came into being, he estimates, this ''tip of the iceberg'' could grow to annual savings of $1 billion. **********Yet there is still considerable criticism of the policy, from environmentalists and industrialists.  David D. Doniger, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, suggests that bubbles generally reflect the letter of the Clean Air Act but violate its spirit. Most of the controls implemented under bubbles, he says, should have been the baseline - the ''reasonably available control technologies'' - that bubbles would improve on. But companies have been claiming ''bogus credit,'' he says, for basic pollution-reduction processes they would have, or should have, installed anyway. **********''The stated purpose of the bubble was to encourage innovation,'' Mr. Doniger said, ''but instead it rewards the recalcitrant.'' And although he asserts that some companies, under inadequate state regulation, have milked the bubble's advantages to the limit and sometimes beyond -with dubious or incorrect numbers that purport to establish ''ambient equivalence'' of proposed actions with what should have been - it is really the E.P.A.'s vision that is most in need of expansion. The agency's policy, Mr. Doniger says, is to make ''an awful situation'' a little less awful. **********Some industrial observers are similarly dissatisfied but for opposite reasons. They also assert that the bubble concept is a belated effort at tinkering. From their perspective, however, the problem is not that the Clean Air Act is being insufficiently implemented, but that it is fundamentally flawed and should be replaced altogether. **********One prominent business representative, who asked not to be named, cites a common industrial concern: the national air-quality standards required by the act. These numbers - the targets that the bubble and other regulatory approaches are supposed to meet - are ''arbitrary and irrational,'' he says. A more sensible approach, he adds, would correlate pollution-control costs with environmental benefits. **********Du Pont's Mr. Bonczek asserts that the bubble concept can deflect criticisms from both sides. ''It's easy to demand controls across the board,'' he says, but, because bubbles generally deliver ''more environmental cleanup for less dollars,'' they are surely in the spirit of the Clean Air Act. And the selection of sources for control is indeed a rational process, he says, based as it is on cost-effectiveness criteria. **********Mr. Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council acknowledges a legitimate role for the concept, especially for such problems as acid rain. In that case, bubbles could include entire states. But while geography is not a limiting factor, he says, issues of fairness, timeliness, appropriateness and completeness certainly are. **********Most agree, in other words, that the bubble and related ''emissions trading'' concepts, as the E.P.A. now calls them, are useful tools.  But they are no replacements for more fundamental Federal policies that would aim for either the elimination of much more pollution or much less."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/11/world/carter-reaffirms-support-of-israel.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 406, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CARTER REAFFIRMS SUPPORT OF ISRAEL", "print_headline": "CARTER REAFFIRMS SUPPORT OF ISRAEL", "body_text": " **********Former President Jimmy Carter said today that his deep religious belief had led him to a commitment to the existence of Israel as a Jewish state.

According to an official who was present, the former President told Mr. Shawa that the Palestinians must do their own negotiating and not depend on Egypt and the United States as intermediaries. **********Mr. Shawa reportedly replied that the United States should use its influence on Israel to stop construction of Jewish settlements. Mr.  Carter was said to have answered that if Israel wished to build settlements, it would do so with or without American pressure. Mr.  Shawa suggested that American aid be cut off, and Mr. Carter explained that that was politically impossible. 3 Soldiers Hurt in Attack Special to the New York Times **********JERUSALEM, March 10 - Three Israeli soldiers were slightly wounded today, a military spokesman said, in stone throwing that continued for a second day as youths in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem protested Mr. Carter's tour. **********Two universities and three secondary schools were ordered shut and tear gas was fired to disperse high school demonstrators in the Bethlehem area, the spokesman said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/21/business/a-creditor-plan-filed-by-lionel.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 135, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Creditor Plan Filed by Lionel", "print_headline": "A Creditor Plan Filed by Lionel", "body_text": " **********The Lionel Corporation, operating under Chapter 11, said it had filed a reorganization plan that would give its unsecured creditors an initial payment of $70 million in cash. **********Under the plan, filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, Lionel would also give its unsecured creditors $10 million in Lionel convertible preferred stock, which would pay an 8 percent annual dividend and be convertible into two million Lionel common shares. **********Unsecured creditors also would get 3.8 million common shares, or about 35 percent of the company's stock to be outstanding after the reorganization, and $45.5 million, payable without interest in annual installments through 1984.

The reason, the doctor says, is that previously the women all depended on their stewards from Ghana and Benin and elsewhere to do the household chores. The servants, largely, are gone now, victims of Nigeria's decision to expel illegal immigrants, and so the women must cope with forgotten challenges: overheating stoves and undisciplined carving knives. There has even been a run on washing machines in the local market now that human launderers have departed. **********The physician's business is growing but when Nigeria counts the cost of its decision to expel the foreigners the balance sheet will be less monochromatic and a question will intrude: After all the years of multibillion-dollar oil revenues, what has been achieved if the nation - black-ruled Africa's wealthiest and the self-appointed standard-bearer of the continent's democracy - needs to take draconian measures to stay afloat? **********If cities bare their souls through their architecture, then Lagos is a place that grasps, and wastes, and goes forward without reference to the esthetic. In the city center, for instance, there is the great stadium built by the military during their years in power from 1966 to 1979. Columns soar and the prancing of huge horses is frozen in bronze. But it celebrates a strange glory because it is surrounded and engulfed by a chaotic city of rundown office blocks and open sewers and the decaying semiantiquity of older houses, erected during a colonial era and caught up later in the oil-fueled rush for modernity. **********In the wealthy suburbs, such as Victoria Island, the homes built these days reflect no sense of self-adornment. They fit the city, for they provide only a roof to sleep under, walls and bars to ward off unwanted outsiders and air-conditioners to chill the process of accumulating wealth. Lagos is a place to come to seek riches and then leave behind. **********Wealthy Nigerians are commuters and Lagos is a transit halt, suspended in its grubbiness between a distant home village and the airline flights that take the rich to London or New York for a weekend's shopping, or a vacation, or a medical checkup -escape, that is, from the pressures created by wealth and its distribution between patron and petitioner. **********''People have to get away,'' a businessman said. ''If you don't you find your time is never your own.'' Where has all the money gone? It has not noticeably gone to schools, for even in those states where education is free, teachers need to be bribed for places, textbooks must be bought, donations must be made to school funds. And it has not gone to health care. **********''If you go to hospital, then you have to bribe a doctor to see you,'' a foreign resident said.'' There are no drugs, so you have to send someone out to find them for you. There's a children's home here where nearly all the disabled kids have had polio: they'd all been vaccinated, but the vaccine had not been kept properly so it was useless.'' **********''The middle class,'' the foreigner said, ''go to private clinics.  The rich go abroad for medical treatment. It's part of their calendar. There are no loboratories for tests. Conditions are getting worse, and it's happening in a cutthroat society: Look after No. 1 is the motto.'' **********Nigerians do not like to hear criticism from foreigners, so when the Western press condemned the manner of the aliens' expulsion Nigeria's newspapers bridled. What, editorialists wrote, about the treatment of Turks in West Germany?  And what about the policies of Britain, the former colonial power that is the object of a love-hate sentiment? Was it not the British who invented the ''virginity test'' for Asian women immigrants - so what cause do the British have to refer to human rights in Nigeria? Typically, the belief among officials here was that press condemnation reflected a campaign inspired by Western governments to belittle Africa's self-enthroned giant. **********Nigeria's achievements are less tangible. Just about everybody in this country lost somebody or suffered in other ways in the civil war of 1967 to 1970 when the Ibo tribal nation seceded from the federation and made a separatist state called Biafra, whose ultimate demise was bloody. Yet there has been a remarkable reconciliation. **********The forgiveness was symbolized last year by the pardoning and return home of Emeka Ojukwu, the man who led the Biafran forces. Mr.  Ojukwu has joined the ruling National Party of Nigeria, so that, when elections are held next August, his role will be to split the Ibo vote and enhance President Shehu Shagari's chances for a widely forecast second term. But some resentments linger. **********''They'll have to play the Ojukwu card very delicately,'' a Western diplomat said, referring to President Shagari's political strategists. ''A lot of people feel he should not be in politics. And it is inconceivable that he should attain a position of state power that would oblige his old enemies in the army to pay homage to him.  They would not do that.'' **********As usual, the 130,000-strong military is a force in Nigerian politics.  There are many calculations about whether it will take power again, ending Nigeria's greatest recent achievement - the retention of a rough-and-tumble democracy that, through unassailable presidential power and a system designed to share the nation's wealth among the three rival nation-tribes, has survived Nigeria's inherent tensions and pressures. ''If Nigeria has achieved anything,'' a Westerner said, ''it lies in the aftermath of the civil war - forgiveness and the evential reinstatement of democracy.'' **********It is as a model of democracy that Nigeria asserts itself as blackruled Africa's leader. But that image, these days, is tainted by the expulsion of the foreigners.  Whatever its justifications in economic and political terms, a Nigerian official said, it has nonetheless left the mental imprint of a nation treating fellow Africans in a manner it would not countenance in others."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/02/world/how-us-would-act-in-airspace-invasion.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 167, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "How U.S. Would Act In Airspace Invasion", "print_headline": "How U.S. Would Act In Airspace Invasion", "body_text": " **********United States Air Force officials said today that there were no circumstances in peacetime under which American military aircraft would shoot down a foreign commercial airliner that had strayed from its flight plan in United States airspace, even if attempts at communication were unsuccessful. **********Air Force procedures for dealing with such situations are classified, but Pentagon officials said American pilots would need permission from the highest levels of the Defense Department, or even the White House, to fire upon a foreign military plane, unless fired upon first. **********Lieut.

Former Braniff International employees had been interviewed for jobs. New cloth for uniforms - and some new airplane seats - had already been purchased. **********That was how confident PSA Inc. was that its deal with Braniff would stand up and that by summer it could begin a long-planned thrust into the Sun Belt. But then a Federal appeals court threw out the agreement, and, in the words of Paul C. Barkley, the president and chief operating officer of PSA, ''We're looking at five years of expansion that collapsed in one deal.'' **********PSA, which owns Pacific Southwest Airlines, has been eager to expand for many years, ever since it reached a limit to its growth in its home market - mostly the Los Angeles-to-San Francisco corridor.  Once before the airline's expansion plans were frustrated when, four years ago, a jump in fuel prices forced it to concentrate on reequipping its fleet instead. New Pressures to Expand **********Lately, given deregulation and increasing competition at home, the pressure to enter new markets has been building. The Braniff deal offered a quick, relatively inexpensive way to break into the rapidly growing Sun Belt market. But now, Mr. Barkley said, PSA will have to proceed slowly and piecemeal - and at much greater cost. **********''Even picking our best opportunities,'' he said in a telephone interview from PSA's headquarters at Lindbergh Field in San Diego, ''it will take several years to get anywhere near what we were talking about.'' **********Under the Braniff-PSA agreement, PSA would have leased 30 planes from Braniff and hired 2,200 of Braniff's 8,500 laid-off employees.  In addition, PSA would have had the use of 200 Braniff landing slots, mostly in parts of the Southwest that PSA does not serve, and many of them in the lucrative Dallas-Fort Worth market. Court Objects to Transfer **********For PSA and Braniff, which filed for protection from its creditors last May, the agreement was a logical one. But on March 2 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans overturned lower court approval of the deal. The appeals court objected in particular to the transfer of the landing slots, which, it said, were not Braniff's to distribute. **********The agreement was a major element in Braniff's reorganization plan, and without it, industry analysts have said, the airline may be forced into liquidation. Some hope remains that the deal might be revived if Braniff comes up with a plan that the court will accept.  But Mr. Barkley is doubtful. **********In any event, he observed, a slower expansion will involve less risk for PSA. ''You can reassess your plans step by step,'' he said.  ''With Braniff, we would take one big leap into the corner.'' **********The Braniff venture offered PSA a strikingly low cost for entering a new market. For example, to buy 30 new planes - such as the McDonnell Douglas Super 80 - would cost about $700 million. PSA would have gained the use of Braniff's 727's for $70,000 a month per plane plus about $30 million to help start the division. 'Pretty Cheap' Cost **********''That's pretty cheap,'' said Harry Harwood, the airline analyst for Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. of Los Angeles. **********PSA has been hoping that a market expansion would lead to a repeat of its early success, which was based on a strategy of offering low fares and frequent service on no-frill flights. From carrying 5.1 million passengers with a net profit of $3.6 million in 1970, the carrier reached its peak in 1979 when it carried 8.7 million passengers and posted a net profit of $23 million. **********But Pacific Southwest, like the rest of the airline industry, was staggered in the late 1970's by the jump in fuel prices. Meanwhile, in August 1978, the carrier and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation signed an initial agreement that eventually called for the delivery of 29 Super 80 aircraft for a total price of more than $600 million. **********A 53-day strike by PSA's pilots at the end of 1980 and a delay in the delivery of the new planes compounded the financial problems. Profit to Loss **********From an operating profit of $30.4 million in 1979, the airline since 1980 has had operating losses totaling $17 million. Only by generating profits from other businesses, such as the maintenance of jet engines, aircraft leasing and the sale of tax credits on the new aircraft, was the company able to show a profit of $19.5 million last year. **********Its debt-to-equity ratio in 1982 stood at 73 percent debt and 27 percent equity. ''That's way too high,'' George M. Shortley, senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer of PSA, conceded in an interview. ''We intend to bring it down under 60 to 40.'' The current long-term debt totals $395 million. **********Despite the heavy debt burden, the upgrading of the fleet of aircraft has enabled PSA to bring its costs down, to 7.8 cents per available seat mile last December from 8.3 cents in December 1981."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/21/world/us-is-condemned-over-salvadorans.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Weinraub", "pub_date": "1983-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 536, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. IS CONDEMNED OVER SALVADORANS", "print_headline": "U.S. IS CONDEMNED OVER SALVADORANS", "body_text": " **********The United States' refusal to grant political asylum and temporary residential status to Salvadorans has stirred a wave of letters and protests from members of Congress and church groups, who say the lives of many of the Salvadorans would be in danger if they returned home. **********The American Civil Liberties Union and a group of 88 members of Congress, as well as church and community ganizations, have pressed the Administration in recent months to adopt an informal administrative procedure that would allow Salvadorans to remain in the United States for an indefinite period. The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimated that the number of Salvadorans in the United States, many of them illegally, might be as high as 500,000. **********Diana Bell, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Political Asylum project, said the organization had urged the State Department to seek ''extended voluntary departure status'' for Salvadorans in the United States. 'Problem Is Very Simple' **********''The real problem is very simple,'' Miss Bell said. ''Are we deporting people to their death?'' Miss Bell said it was ''very difficult'' to determine if any Salvadorans had been murdered after being deported from the United States. But she said that Salvadoran newspapers had reported two such deaths and that affidavits had been signed by people ''saying that they heard of deportees being killed.'' Last year, according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 5,566 Salvadorans were deported on grounds of illegal entry. **********At the same time, the Immigration and Naturalization Service denied political asylum to 1,067 Salvadorans, and 74 Salvadorans were given asylum. Many of the asylum applicants who were rejected are appealing the decision. **********Miss Bell said Salvadorans deported from the United States faced special dangers ''because they are often identified as subversives since they fled Salvador in the first place.'' She said deported Salvadorans were often identified at the airport in San Salvador as soon as they returned home. **********In asylum cases, State Department officials said, the department deals in a case-by-case review. Extended voluntary departure status would enable the Salvadorans to remain here for anywhere from 90 days to 6 months or longer. Currently, arrivals from Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Poland and Uganda remain in the United States in that status. Abrams Defends Policy **********Elliott Abrams, head of the State Department's Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, said in a telephone interview that one of the main arguments against granting extended voluntary departure status to the Salvadorans was that ''there are an extremely large number in the United States illegally who are here for reasons that are purely economic.'' **********''A substantially large number are not leaving violence or seeking asylum,'' he said. ''Virtually all of them come up through Mexico, a country at peace. If all they wanted to do is flee violence, they would have stayed in Mexico.'' **********He added: ''To grant extended voluntary departure would be to say to all Salvadorans here seeking to escape political persecution and all Salvadorans seeking jobs could stay.

However, applicants in several parts of the country reported a flurry of recent rejections. **********In New York City, for example, Lydia Savoyka of the United States Catholic Conference, which helps exiles of all nationalities in this country, said that ''85 percent of our applications for asylum are being denied.'' She said the applications of 300 to 400 of the 1,500 Poles with applications for asylum pending were denied in recent months. **********Some private agencies in the United States that help refugees say the rejection rate seems to be more stringent than it was two or three years ago, before action on the applications of Polish exiles was essentially postponed because of the chaotic political situation in their home country. **********Poles have been excluded from deportation proceedings since 1981 under a six-month Immigration Service directive that has since been renewed every six months.

Typical Case Cited **********Typical is the case of Jerry W., a man in his late thirties who friends say was a ''notorious'' trade unionist in his home town in Poland. He now lives in Texas. He came to the United States on a visitor's visa in mid-1982, bringing with him his wife and one child, but forced to leave another child behind. **********He asked not to be identified, as have other Poles seeking asylum here, either because they have relatives still in Poland or because they fear retribution if they are forced to return. His lawyer, Jonathan Lamb, of Houston, said Jerry W. had been warned by other dissidents allied with Solidarity that he might face reprisals for sponsoring union meetings at his place of business and supporting a strike at a local mill. **********In September 1982, after six weeks in this country, Jerry W. filed for political asylum. His application joined a backlog of pleas for asylum from 170,000 other aliens, 115,000 of them Cubans and 5,500 Haitians, who have filed similar petitions with the Department of Immigration and Naturalization. For eight months he heard nothing. **********Finally, after the intervention by Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, his hearing was held. Although Jerry W. had no card proving his membership in Solidarity - he said he feared trying to leave Poland with it in his possession - he presented affidavits from two men who swore to his membership in Solidarity and his activities in its behalf. **********About two weeks ago, he received a letter that said his application for asylum had been denied. It gave him 15 days to return to Poland voluntarily or face deportation proceedings. **********In considering applications for asylum, the United States does not take into account economic conditions in the applicant's home country, only the possibility of political persecution."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/11/world/slower-inflation-leads-oecd-to-urge-growth.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1983-05-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 997, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SLOWER INFLATION LEADS O.E.C.D.

News analysis, page D4. **********PARIS, May 10 - The chief industrial countries can now safely promote faster economic growth because of progress in reducing inflation, finance and foreign ministers from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said today. **********Their stand, announced at the end of their annual two-day meeting here, represents a major shift: For the first time in a decade, the 24 O.E.C.D. members collectively agreed that the top economic priority for the most prosperous nations was reducing unemployment, rather than fighting inflation. **********In their final communique the ministers said: ''In a number of countries, accounting for about 70 percent of O.E.C.D. gross national product, inflation is approaching the level of the 1960's.  Confidence has strengthened; progress has been made in tackling structural imbalances,'' and activity has started to pick up. **********''For such countries,'' the communique went on, ''ministers agreed on the importance of taking advantage of the room that has emerged for increased output and employment.'' **********These nations must now make ''sus-tainable noninflationary growth'' their major priority ''in order to reduce the present very high levels of unemployment.'' **********At a closing news conference, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said: ''The U.S. has been, remains and will continue always to be interested in world economic growth. We are glad to be aboard and leading the charge.'' **********The United States and the other industrial countries also used today's final sessions with reporters to express reservations about President Francois Mitterrand's call Monday for a conference to reestablish fixed exchange rates between major world currencies. **********While accepting the eventual need to ''discuss in more detail monetary problems and currency fluctuations,'' Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan said of the French leader's proposal, ''I don't think the time is ripe.'' **********The West German Finance Minister, Otto Lambsdorff, conceded that the present international monetary system ''doesn't work very well.'' But he said the fault lay not with ''the lack of fixed exchange rates, but with the lack of internal discipline by countries operating the system'' - an implied criticism of the French Socialists, whose inflationary economic policies have resulted in three franc devaluations in two years. **********In the O.E.C.D.'s view, the countries in which inflation is now so firmly under control that governments can afford to concentrate on promoting expansion are the United States, West Germany, Britain, Canada and Japan. In all of them, inflation is now running at rates well below the average for the 1960's, O.E.C.D. officials say. **********A second group of countries, chiefly made up of France and Italy and accounting for about 20 percent of the O.E.C.D. gross national product, must still concentrate on reducing inflation, the communique said. Consequently, this group will have ''less growing room in the near term.'' In the remaining countries inflation-fighting remains the top economic priority, the ministers agreed. **********This week's meeting avoided any outright call for stimulative measures, such as increased public spending or big tax cuts. In the past the group's secretariat, with the support of France and many smaller members, has tried without success to persuade countries with good inflation records to expand their economies rapidly in order to serve as ''locomotives'' that could pull the rest of the world out of recession. **********But such thinking has been generally discredited through the staunch opposition of the United States, West Germany, Britain and other conservative members, who have argued that stimulative tactics are self-defeating because they merely result in higher inflation.  Instead, they believe that output will start expanding of its own accord as inflation is brought under control, with only marginal help from Governments. **********As a result, the policy recommendations aimed at encouraging faster growth that were approved at today's meeting are phrased in cautious terms and placed firmly in a medium-term perspective. **********The communique urged countries where the threat of future budget deficits ''looms large'' to take urgent action to reduce that portion that does not involve recession-linked social benefits, in order to bring down interest rates. Although no members are mentioned by name, officials say that the meeting had the United States in mind. **********The other low-inflation countries were told to be cautious in reducing that part of their deficit.  In addition, low-inflation countries are warned against futher reducing their monetary growth targets to reflect the expected drop in inflation caused by weaker oil prices. **********The meeting also made a strong commitment to rolling back protectionist measures taken during the recession, as unemployment rose. It asked the organization's Secretary General to propose specific plans for doing so. **********Delegates generally agreed that the prospect of more growth in the world, together with the growing recognition that the battle against inflation is finally being won, helped make this year's meeting an unusually cooperative and peaceful one. In particular, there was little evidence in the communique of the kind of divisive quarrels between conservatives and liberals that marked earlier meetings. **********Nevertheless, divergent currents of thoughts could be discerned in the speeches and private comments of individual ministers. The French Finance Minister, Jacques Delors, was skeptical about the strength of the economic recovery in the United States and made clear that he favors more aggressive stimulation by the low-inflation countries. Several Scandinavian countries supported him. **********Another difference of viewpoint emerged over trade and interest rates. Mr. Regan argued strongly that the best way to sustain and broaden the present recovery is by rolling back protectionist measures so that world trade can increase and deeply indebted third world countries can earn enough to service their debts.

''We always have. It's something that never goes out of style.'' **********Indeed, bubble gum may be one of the nation's few truly recession-proof industries. Experts estimate that sales of the confection, in a variety of artificially colored sticks, wads, chunks, flakes, nuggets and powders, have probably tripled in the last decade, approaching $500 million last year. **********Still, bubble gum remains a product subject to the whims of a market dominated by knee-high customers. ''I like to change all the time,'' Mrs. Cantavero says. ''And they usually come out with things that are fun, like gum shaped and colored as hamburgers, tacos and waffles. That really sells.'' **********Enter the industry's latest innovation: bubble gum in a tube. On Aug. 11 - within an hour of each other - both the Topps Chewing Gum Company and Wm. Wrigley Jr.'s subsidiary, the Amurol Products Company, introduced toothpaste-like tubes filled with a little more than a pack's worth of the familiar soft gum. The products, expected to reach stores next month, will retail at about 59 cents.  'Secret Project' **********There was no lack of accompanying fanfare. Topps cited the culmination of a two-year ''secret project'' aimed at packing the right mix of ''bubbleability, chewability and, of course, squeezeability'' into a 1.5-ounce plastic tube. Wrigley hailed its Tubble Gum as ''the biggest innovation in the bubble gum industry since soft bubble gum.'' **********This is unlikely. When Nabisco Brands' Life Savers Company (then a Squibb subsidiary) brought out Bubble Yum - a gum considerably softer, tastier and longer lasting than its traditional Bazooka and Double Bubble counterparts - in 1974, ''it revolutionized the bubble gum industry,'' said Lou Lassus, editor of Candy Marketer Quarterly, a trade magazine. ''Sales increased tremendously, mainly because it attracted a wider age group than bubble gum had previously.'' **********In fact, analysts say, Bubble Yum was largely responsible for the boom that saw bubble gum sales balloon by up to 10 percent a year before tapering off in 1979. **********Bubble Yum is still the favorite, commanding more than 20 percent of total bubble gum sales; Bubblicious, made by the Fleer Corporation (of Double Bubble fame), Wrigley's Hubba Bubba - the first nonstick variety - and Topps's soft Bazooka together account for another 50 percent of industry sales.  Industry's Earnings Up **********Soft bubble gum has increased profits industrywide. Topps, whose products are almost all bubble gum-related, has seen earnings soar since a disastrous loss in 1980: the Brooklyn-based company reported net income of $5.9 million on sales of $69.7 million last year. **********Nabisco's confectionery division, buoyed by Bubble Yum sales, posted operating income of $47 million last year on $528.5 million in revenue. **********Wrigley declines to break down figures for bubble gum sales, but analysts say its Hubba Bubba and novelty products have produced consistently high profits. **********No one, save Topps and Wrigley publicists, expects bubble gum in a tube to approach Bubble Yum's success. But experts differ on whether the innovation will become a lasting standard, or just attract the fleeting attention and revenues gained by the industry's many novelty products.  'A Very Faddish Industry' **********''It's an unusual idea, and it's probably going to sell like crazy,'' said one trade association executive. ''But it's a question of how long. Kids' candies do peak and then tend to go on a downward trend. It's a very faddish industry, especially when you're dealing with children.'' **********Novelty bubble gum takes on dozens of shapes, colors and sizes designed to grab the fancy of the youthful consumers. Topps, the leading novelty manufacturer, sells Gold Rush, a tiny canvas prospecting bag filled with yellow gum nuggets, Video Arcade Gum, miniaturized, gum-filled versions of Donkey Kong and Zaxxon, and Smurf Rocks; last year's hottest product was Wrigley's Big League Chew, gum flakes in a scaled-down tobacco pouch. And despite their faddish nature, analysts say, this relatively small segment of the market has shown surprising growth in the last five years. **********Such products, it seems, transcend the pure food value of the basic bubble gum. ''Many years ago, we considered ourselves to be in the gum business,'' said Arthur T. Shorin, chairman of Topps. ''Since then, we've come to consider ourselves in the business of entertaining children. The motivation behind a lot of our products is fun.''  Profit Margins Higher **********But novelties are as much profit as fun: Smurf Rocks, Gold Rush and the like typically sell at profit margins at least 10 percent higher than those for Bubble Yum and other standard packages. **********Part of the markup reflects the risks of catering to ever-changing preteen-age tastes. ''In the novelty business,'' said William Piet, a Wrigley spokesman, ''you have to look for higher margins because you never know what the product life will be. If the life is only six months, you have to put a lot of money up front, and the price reflects that.'' Even if risk were not a factor, Topps's Mr. Shorin observed, ''I think you're entitled to be recompensed for some modicum of genius.'' **********And so it is with bubble gum in a tube: Its proponents hope the unusual packaging and high ''play'' factor will make it a natural success, and a big profit center. **********''There's great receptivity on the part of these kids,'' said A. G. Atwater Jr., president of Amurol.  ''They go over to the counter and they're always looking for something new. If there's something that catches their fancy, they'll pick it up.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/07/world/british-laborites-find-unity-elusive.html": {"writer_name": "R.

If he did, said Giles Radice, an M.P. allied with Mr. Healey, ''it would be electorally disastrous for the party.'' **********Mr. Hattersley and Mr. Shore have lined up so little support in the leadership contest that the engineers' union, one of the biggest right-wing groups, decided last week to boycott the election on the ground that a Kinnock victory is a foregone conclusion. **********Unions cast 40 percent of the votes in the electoral college that picks a leader and a deputy; local parties and M.P.'s each cast 30 percent.   Party's Fate at Stake **********The continuing squabbling may threaten Labor's existence as a major party. In the June 9 voting, it polled only 20.1 percent of the total electorate - less than the percentage that stayed at home. It ran second in only 132 constituencies, whereas the new Liberal- Social Democratic alliance was the runner-up in 312. In much of the country, the alliance now constitutes the main opposition to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Government. **********One measure of the disaster that engulfed the Labor Party is the number of seats where it forfeited electoral deposits as a penalty for having failed to poll at least 12.5 percent of the total vote. **********In the 11 general elections between 1945 and 1979, there were only 82 such forfeitures; in this year's election alone, there were 119. **********A confidential analysis of the party's situation, circulated among Labor M.P.'s during the last month, argues that the shift of votes from Labor to the alliance constituted an ''earthquake'' of major proportions. **********It asserts that if the party does not reestablish itself soon as the second party - in early by-elections, local elections next May and voting for the European by-elections next June - Labor will enter the next general election in third place.   'A Steady Erosion' **********The author, David Cowling, a respected party researcher, wrote: **********''Unless we have broken the back of the alliance within 12 months, we face the real prospect of a steady erosion of our already massively depleted votes. Unless we understand and accept the sheer scale and nature of our defeat, there is not the slightest chance of us winning the next general election.'' **********In the only by-election held since the general election, the Labor showing underlined Mr. Cowling's warning. **********In balloting on July 28 at Penrith and the Border, Labor's share of the vote plummeted to 7.4 percent as the Conservatives narrowly held the Lake District constituency represented for 28 years by William Whitelaw, now Viscount Whitelaw. The alliance nominee, Michael Young, polled 44.6 percent. **********Mr. Hattersley has argued vigorously that Labor fared poorly in June largely because its economic policies were ''literally incredible'' to the British public, and because its commitment to unilateral nuclear disarmement had cost it dearly. **********The voters, he said, overwhelmingly rejected ''the notion that we might give up our nuclear protection if others did not do the same thing.'' **********But Mr. Kinnock, the clear front-runner with the backing of most of the big unions and most of the local parties, insisted last month that the party did not ''have to shift ground.''  'Timetable Can't Be Dictated' **********It may be necessary to change public perceptions of some policies, he added, but disarmament must proceed regardless of what the Soviet Union does because ''the timetable can't be dictated by other people.'' **********''The main body of our policies must not be jettisoned,'' he said. **********Although both Mr. Kinnock and Mr. Hattersley have insisted that there is no bad feeling between them, tensions between left and right exploded at a private meeting of Labor M.P.'s last month, with Mr. Hattersley's trading bitter words with Michael Foot, the outgoing leader, who is backing Mr. Kinnock."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/02/business/business-digest-saturday-july-2-1983.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 641, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SATURDAY, JULY 2, 1983", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST; SATURDAY, JULY 2, 1983", "body_text": " **********International **********A month-long conference of the world's rich and poor nations moved toward adjournment with delegates near agreement on a resolution that sidestepped the demands of the poor nations for emergency economic aid.

And in the oil boom that followed, nowhere was growth wilder or faster than in Villahermosa. **********But today, Mexico's new, more severe economic crisis has reached here. Shops and restaurants that opened in prosperity now cry out for customers, several half-finished buildings await completion and work on a new highway to nearby Coatzacoalcos has stopped. There even seem to be fewer people around. **********Perhaps most surprising, given Mexico's continuing dependence on its oil exports, the state oil monopoly, Petroleos Mexicanos, is also facing budget restraints. One-quarter of the country's daily oil production of 3 million barrels still comes from the region, but the company has been forced to lay off 10,000 construction workers in recent months as oil output here has shrunk from the 1978 record of a million barrels a day. 'Like Rest of the Country' **********''Many contractors have left, many migrant workers have returned to their hometowns, even peasants who found jobs in Petroleos Mexicanos are going back to their plots,'' said Eduardo Utrilla, who handles community relations here for the oil company, which is called Pemex.  ''Now we're more like the rest of the country.'' **********The slowing of the pace has thus brought some relief to a longsleepy farming region that never quite adjusted to the industrial revolution that exploded in its midst. **********''This gives us time to balance the relationship between Petroleos Mexicanos and Tabasco,'' said Enrique Gonzalez Pedrero, the new Governor of the state of Tabasco, of which Villahermosa is the capital. ''Our aim is to balance the economic development brought on by oil with the social development that got left behind, particularly in outlying rural districts.'' **********Oil was first struck a few miles south of here in May 1972, but it was only in 1977 that the true dimension of the region's hydrocarbon wealth became known - 20 billion barrels of proved reserves. And it was then that the metamorphosis of Tabasco began. Billions of Dollars Spent **********In a matter of months Pemex focused its entire expansion effort on Tabasco, spending billions of dollars, importing hundreds of Mexican and foreign engineers and technicians and attracting thousands more peasants and workers searching for high-paying jobs. But money - more than Tabasco had ever dreamed of - soon strained the state's social fabric. **********''The attitude and mentality of the locals were not adapted to the new rhythm and new customs of those who came here,'' Mr. Utrilla recalled. ''The newcomers drove big cars, they went to bars, they filled restaurants, the red light district expanded. It was a tremendous shock for Tabasco.'' **********The cattle-ranchers who had long dominated the state's economy found their farmhands leaving to work for Pemex. Shopkeepers and small-business operators were unable to pay the salaries necessary to dissuade secretaries and accountants from flocking to the oil company. **********With insufficient residential housing available, local homeowners saw an opportunity to raise rents to levels three times higher than the national average and more. This, in turn, pushed rents and house prices beyond the reach of local families. And for several years, inflation here was consistently 10 to 20 percentage points higher than elsewhere in Mexico. Rush Toward Exploration **********The greatest impact, though, was felt in the rural areas where Pemex was actually drilling. Because the Government owns the subsoil, Pemex could take over land that it required. But while compensation was paid, disagreements over the price frequently provoked angry incidents. **********Further, in its eagerness to find and exploit the region's oil wealth as rapidly as possible, Pemex often paid scant attention to environmental questions, and farmers began complaining that their animals and crops were being harmed by water and air pollution. **********After indignant peasants began blocking roads to oil wells in order to put pressure on the Government to act, even the then governor of Tabasco, Leandro Rovirosa Wade, felt forced to denounce Pemex in public, arguing that the state had become a victim rather than beneficiary of the boom. **********At that point, Pemex apparently recognized a potentially explosive problem and responded accordingly: it offered to share the cost of building and repairing local roads, started its own homebuilding program and agreed to pay a special tax to Tabasco equivalent to 6 percent of local oil production. It also set up a commission to deal with the complaints of local farmers. Using Funds From Pemex **********With the additional funds, Villahermosa, whose population has tripled to 300,000 in less than a decade, was able to carry out urgently needed urban improvements to appease long-time residents and increase the compensation paid to peasants affected by Pemex operations. **********Even now, Pemex is blamed for most of the ills that befall the rural population. But company officials respond that local residents have merely discovered an easy way to make money. **********''If it rains, it's Pemex's fault, and if it doesn't rain, it's Pemex's fault,'' said Guillermo Diaz, who is in charge of the company's local environmental protection office.

After six months in the New York area, the soft drink went national in January and is clearly living up to its promise. **********''It is the hottest-selling soft drink in the shortest amount of time ever,'' said Jesse Meyers, editor of Jesse Meyers' Beverage Digest, a publication of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. ''If diet Coke is well marketed, in a very short time it will be No. 3. Even if it is marketed badly, it will be No.5.'' The No. 1 soft drink is Coke, followed by Pepsi and 7-Up. **********As new products go, diet Coke has all the advantages: the Coke name, a budget of $50 million, and a distribution network capable of getting the product to 155 countries. The Coca-Cola Company was so sure that diet Coke would be a success that it was never even testmarketed in stores. After a gala introduction at Radio City Music Hall last July, diet Coke went straight to consumers. A Supportive Name **********''The Coca-Cola name supports that of diet Coke - and diet Coke reinforces Coke,'' said Brian Dyson, president of Coca-Cola U.S.A. **********Another spokesman, Anthony Tortorici, put it more directly.  Referring to crucial store shelf space, he declared: ''You've got to get facings.'' **********That has been all but automatic for diet Coke, because merchandisers respect Coca-Cola's marketing clout and because the special arrangements between distributors and retailers create loyalty. **********''Nobody is going to jeopardize his relationship with Coke by not giving diet Coke space,'' said a New York supermarket chain executive who asked not to be identified. **********Coca-Cola made itself into a corporate giant, with revenues last year of $6.2 billion, on the successful marketing of Coke. The Small 'd' Strategy **********But although Coca-Cola has had dozens of soft drinks, diet Coke is only the second to bear the Coke name. To market the new drink, the parent chose a package that uses the Coke label as a point of departure, de-emphasizing its dietetic attribute by using a lowercase ''d.'' The strategy was to attract a broader market than traditional diet drinks, one that would include men. Coca-Cola also wanted to insulate its other great seller, Tab, from new competition. Tab, the industry's No.1 diet drink, has its own look and has been marketed to women. **********Nonetheless, the company had expected that 48 percent of the sales of diet Coke would come at the expense of its own products, especially Coke and Tab. However, it has apparently been so successful in positioning the new drink that it has now lowered that estimate to only 40 percent. And analysts said it is closer to 30 percent. A Lot of Fanfare **********During the first few weeks of diet Coke's national introduction, analysts estimated that the drink sold at least as well as Pepsi, primarily because diet Coke was treated with such fanfare and excitement. For its part, Pepsico is not willing to concede that it has lost any market share to the new product. **********Coca-Cola treated the introduction of diet Coke like a news event.  Coca-Cola generated so much advance press coverage - all without spending a cent on advertising - that a survey conducted by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company showed than 29 percent of a sample group knew about diet Coke before it had been announced. **********The competition for shelf space -facings, as it is known in the industry - is particularly acute for colas, the largest segment of the soft drink business and the fastest-growing. Over the last six months, new colas have been added at the rate of one a month. At the beginning of 1982, there were eight. So far in 1983, there are already 14, with the possibility of more, especially if Coca-Cola decides to produce decaffienated soft drinks to compete with the new ones introduced by Pepsico Inc. and Philip Morris Inc's Seven-Up unit last summer. **********Caffeine-free colas constitute less than 8 percent of the market right now. But Coca-Cola said that if it enters the competition, the market would grow to 15 percent. **********''If Coca-Cola decides caffeine free is important, I think you will see a caffeine-free version in all of Coca-Cola's products,'' said Lawrence Adelman, senior vice president of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Coca-Cola executives will say only that they are considering a decaffeinated Coke. A Hard-to-Ignore Potential **********Coca-Cola is not expected to move as slowly into decaffeinated soft drinks as it did into diet sodas. Tab, introduced in 1963, was its main entry in the diet drink category until the market showed the kind of growth potential that Coca-Cola could not ignore. Diet drinks, which now account for about 20 percent of the market, are expected to grow at a rate of nearly 12 percent over the next few years, three times the growth anticipated for the rest of the industry. **********Now that there are two Cokes, there may be three or four before long.

This means that, if just one of the 263 banks in the syndicate formally declares default, all the banks involved must stop all loans to Argentina. Such a step would be financially disastrous to the country. **********The administration of President Reynaldo B. Bignone has asked to put off the payment as long as 30 days. Argentina, with $40 billion of foreign debt, is already in arrears and cannot meet the payment, foreign bankers and Government officials agreed in interviews.  'The Banks Are Just Fed Up' **********The foreign bankers said they had refused the Government's request for a postponement. The bankers said they were angered by the Government's refusal for nearly two years to amend an Argentine bankruptcy law that discriminates against foreign creditors. They also hope to force the Government to modify its unilateral refinancing of more than $5 billion in private foreign debt last May. **********''It's a scandal,'' one key banker said of the Government's measures, ''and the banks are just fed up.'' **********What finally set off the bankers was a ruling two weeks ago by a judge in the river port of Rosario, 170 miles northwest of Buenos Aires. The judge, Enrique Mullen, invoked the bankruptcy law in restructuring the debt of Celulosa, a pulp and paper manufacturer. **********Celulosa, one of Argentina's largest private corporations, had declared a cessation of payments in February 1982. Hurt by cheap imports and high interest rates, it applied to Judge Mullen for relief on the $300 million it owed to bankers and suppliers.  Out-of-Court Accord Sought **********Of its nearly 800 creditors, about 50 are foreign, and they hold $110 million of the debt. **********First, the creditors tried to reach an out-of-court settlement. Unanimity is necessary under Argentine law, but an agonizingly small number of the creditors - three - refused to go along. Judge Mullen refused to extend his deadline for an out-of-court settlement. **********Citing the bankruptcy law, the judge then ruled that the foreign creditors could no longer vote in the debt negotiations and would be subject to waiting 12 years before repayment. That period may be extended for 24 more years - without interest. **********It is now up to the Argentine creditors to agree on a repayment schedule to present to the judge. They could vote to share their repayments, but that is considered unlikely. **********Argentina's discriminatory bankruptcy provision was adopted by an earlier military Government in 1972 as a nationalistic measure. Banks Start Chain Reaction **********The foreign banks, most of them based in the United States, Canada and Europe, have retaliated by setting off a chain reaction. **********Representatives of many of the banks involved in the various syndicates for loans to Argentina have been meeting in New York, and similar meetings have taken place here. **********Besides refusing to grant a delay of Thursday's payment, the banks are also holding back on what had been scheduled as the signing today of a $230 million restructuring loan by a syndicate of nearly 40 foreign banks for Aerolineas Argentina, a state- owned airline. The loan is meant to be the model for restructuring more than $6 billion in public debt. **********By not signing the airline loan, the banks have prevented Argentina from receiving the first disbursal of $500 million from a $1.5 billion loan that was arranged last month. An agreement on the airline restructuring was a condition for the disbursal.  Key $300 Million Is Withheld **********Without the disbursal, Argentina is unable to pay enough of its arrears - estimated at $1.2 billion by a Western diplomat - to meet a condition set by the International Monetary Fund before it would disburse $300 million of a loan agreed upon last year. **********Argentina was planning to use that $300 million to meet the payment that is due to private banks Thursday. **********''There would never have been a better moment to pressure Argentina,'' one American banker said. **********The military Government's Legislative Advisory Commission met today to consider proposals to amend the bankruptcy law, Argentine officials said. **********The commission, which drafts legislation for the Government, has turned down previous proposed amendments. It does not want to look as though it is conceding anything to foreign bankers, particularly with national elections scheduled for October, an Argentine official said. Civilian political leaders have accused the military of being ''allied'' with foreign banks. **********''The military is afraid,'' said an Argentine close to the proceedings."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/16/world/sri-lanka-lifts-curfew.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sri Lanka Lifts Curfew", "print_headline": "Sri Lanka Lifts Curfew", "body_text": " **********The Government said today that it was lifting a night curfew enforced since ethnic violence broke out in July between the majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils. **********The curfew has been progressively relaxed since mid-August.

Burial is difficult in ground studded with rocks and frozen much of the year. There is not enough firewood for cooking, let alone for cremation, and rural villages often must rely on dried yak dung for fuel. **********The Tibetans, whose fervent Buddhism fused long ago with an older animism called Bon, believe that upon death the soul leaves the body, to be reborn 49 days later in another form. They look upon the extent to which the vultures dispose of the body as a sign of how well the deceased will fare in reincarnation. For Most Tibetans, the River **********Under the old feudal theocracy, only the wealthy could afford the time-consuming ritual of a sky burial. Ordinary Tibetans were more often dumped into the fast-flowing rivers when they died. **********This may be one reason why Tibetans retain an aversion to eating fish. Last autumn, a Chinese economic journal reported that Tibet's rivers and lakes were teeming with fish, which the local population would not consume ''because of religious and economic limitations.'' **********Sky burials are closed to outsiders, and even the relatives usually leave them to others. Lamaist monks used to perform the ceremony. But as the monks' numbers declined, some local farmers and herdsmen have picked up the skills to supplement their livelihood. They can earn up to $30 a day for each sky burial. **********At the capital of Lhasa, sky burials take place on a hill above the Sera Monastery, about four miles from town. The Han Chinese, one of whom showed revulsion in discussing the practice, have set up a crematorium. Mending the Buddha **********Another tradition is Buddhism. When King Songtsen Gampo unified Tibet 13 centuries ago, he cemented relations with his neighbors by taking two royal wives, from China and Nepal, who helped introduce Buddhism. The Nepalese princess brought with her a bronze Buddha more than five feet high. **********After China's Cultural Revolution was launched in 1966, Maoist radicals ransacking the Tibetan temples broke the priceless statue in two and sent the pieces off to be melted down. **********The lower half was eventually rescued from the scrap heap of a local factory. The upper half was found in Peking. This spring, the ancient Buddha was mended and restored to the Jokhan Temple in Lhasa. **********Ten thousand other relics from Tibetan monasteries that were destined for melting have been returned from Gansu Province. They included more than 3,000 statues of Buddha, some dating from the 4th century. Such treasures became targets of the Maoist campaign against the ''four olds'' - old culture, old ideas, old customs and old habits. Irrevocably Lost Relics **********Despite the Peking Government's recent efforts to repair the damage of the Cultural Revolution, the majority of such relics have been irrevocably lost. Legislation passed last November now forbids the export of any surviving Tibetan antiques that predate 1959. This was the year that Chinese troops put down an armed revolt, opening the way to the desecration of Tibet's heritage. **********In the old markets of Lhasa and Xigaze, where the animated haggling encompasses everything from wooden saddles to animal pelts and colorful felt boots, young vendors sidle up and furtively offer tourists small statues, pieces of prayer boxes, religious amulets and the like. Most of them are overpriced and nearly worthless.  Nevertheless, unsympathetic customs officials have prevented them from leaving Tibet by confiscating them from tourists who have bought them. **********At the Drepung Monastery outside Lhasa, a husky Tibetan displayed a few trinkets from inside his sheepskin coat while his wife stared wide-eyed at an American visitor without breaking the cadence of her Buddhist chant. **********His wares were refused, but the young man wanted to prove that he was no shyster. He proudly pulled from his belt an onionskin certificate in Chinese. It attested that the police had caught him previously selling antiques to tourists. Folk Medicine Endures **********And another tradition is folk medicine. A wiry herdsman walked into the downtown hospital in Lhasa carrying a deer's antler, which he wanted ground into medicine. The hospital, which specializes in Tibetan folk medicine, attracts 700 to 800 patients a day. **********Like Chinese traditional medicine, Tibetan medicine relies heavily on herbs, which are gathered mostly in eastern Tibet. Gunga Pingzuo, the hospital's chief physician, said acupuncture and massage had been adopted lately from the Chinese. **********Dr. Gunga, a patriarchal 78-year-old with a wispy white beard, learned traditional medicine as a young monk. He said that, although Tibetan medicine has a history of 2,000 years, its ''way of treatment is simple.'' The doctor, he said, examines the face, blood pressure and urine of the patient and then prescribes from more than 300 herbal medicines. Blood Pressure and Altitudes **********Dr. Gunga said the most common complaints involved high blood pressure, which he attributed to living at high altitudes, and stomach ailments, which he said were from eating raw meat. Serious illnesses are referred to a Chinese hospital with Western medical equipment across town. **********Traditional medicine departments have been added to the 80 town and county hospitals in Tibet, and a reference book on Tibetan medicine was published in Chinese earlier this year. **********Tibet's rugged living conditions have made modern medical care almost impossible in some remote areas, where patients must walk for days or even weeks to reach a hospital. A Han physician said that in one region of southern Tibet, 20 percent of the babies died within a month after birth. He also found that intermarriage in isolated villages had created genetic problems. **********A common form of marriage used to be fraternal polyandry, in which the eldest brother took a wife and all his younger brothers automatically became her husbands too. The offspring of such a multiple union were considered the elder brother's.

Riegler, Akron's law director, in defending the city's so-called flow-control ordinance, one of the country's first.  But those are fighting words to haulers and recyclers, who have already pursued their case to the Supreme Court, and to their ally, J. Rodney Edwards, a vice president of the American Paper Institute. **********''We think the collector should have the right'' to take paper waste where he wants and not be forced to take it to be burned, Mr.Edwards says.

''Some of us are beginning to ask some pretty hard questions of ourselves.'' **********Akron's example in asserting control over the stream of waste within its borders is being followed by many of the dozen other communities that are now building their own waste-to-energy plants and the 175 more that plan to do so. Unless the courts intervene, it is likely that even New York City will follow suit. New York Legislation **********New York State has passed legislation allowing the city to enact flow-control authority after 1985. **********Recycling of paper is big business. Most of the nation's 700 paper and paperboard mills use some waste as a raw material and more than 200 of them rely exclusively on it. In all, about 18 million tons of paper products, about a quarter of United States consumption, are recycled each year. The pickup price ranges from about $20 a ton for newspapers to $150 for computer ''tab'' cards. Baling and processing doubles the mills' cost. **********A major question in the growing debate is whether ''waste'' should be defined as anything put out for disposal or, as the American Paper Institute would have it, whether recyclable materials should be excluded. **********This week, Senator John H. Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, introduced a bill to amend the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to require that waste-burning plants be designed so that they do not rely either on materials now being recycled or those that might be in the future. 'Critical' Carton Problem **********Although newspapers are probably the best-known source of recycled paper, Mr. Edwards says the ''most critical'' problem involves corrugated boxes from stores and supermarkets. While it is still permissible for store owners in Akron to separate their waste for private sale or donation, the city insists that even one banana peel in a truckload of boxes would subject the whole load to its control law. **********The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the Akron case. Instead it sent it back to Federal District Court in Cleveland for rehearing based on the Court's ruling in a cable TV franchise case. That decision said that the grant of home rule by a state legislature to a municipality does not carry with it automatic immunity from Federal antitrust prosecution. **********It is doubtful that a decision upholding Akron-type flow-control laws would put many of the nation's 1,500 wastepaper dealers out of business. Rather, says Mr. Edwards, paper would simply become more expensive as collectors would have to travel farther afield to collect supplies. **********Added Paul D. Casowitz, New York City's deputy sanitation commissioner: ''There is more than enough paper out there. The question is how much you have to pay people to bring it to you.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/29/business/business-people-american-can-realigns-some-management.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1983-06-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 354, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "American Can Realigns Some Management", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; American Can Realigns Some Management", "body_text": " **********The American Can Company, which has been moving out of some basic industries into financial services, announced yesterday that it had formed an office of the chairman intended to strengthen management. **********William S.

The percentage of the undecided vote, however, is said to be high. **********President Kenan Evren, the general who led the military takeover three years ago, has carefully refrained from publicly backing any of the three political organizations officially authorized to take part in the Sunday elections. **********Nevertheless, the Nationalist Democracy Party has sought to give the impression that it has the backing of the military leadership. Reinforcing such an idea, the Prime Minister, Adm. Bulend Ulusu, and five Cabinet members are running under the banner of the Nationalist Democracy Party, which is widely referred to in Turkey as ''the generals' party.'' **********The third group in the race is the Populist Party, an officially inspired organization that has apparently been expected to serve as an opposition. It is led by Necdet Calp, a former under secretary to the Prime Minister.   A Generally Quiet Campaign **********It has been a generally quiet campaign, although some interest seems to have been stirred by the television appearances of the three party leaders in the last 10 days, with Mr. Ozal confident and relaxed. **********The main reason for the general mood of indifference, political experts say, is a widespread feeling that, with all candidates and party programs carefully screened by the military leadership, no real choice is being offered and little change can be expected, at least in the immediate future. **********Turkey's big business establishment, based in Istanbul, and some other conservative groups are said to feel relieved over what they view as the prospect that whoever wins the election is likely to pursue the general policies laid down by the military regime - tight control of law and order, strong support of private enterprise and restrictions on labor. **********At the same time, former politicians and the press have expressed impatience over the restrictions. A prominent Turkish editor, who asked not to be identified, said it was increasingly clear that the results of the balloting would be ''only the beginning of the transition period, which could last another five years, until the next parliamentary elections.'' **********The military leaders who seized power Sept. 12, 1980, with the declared aim of putting an end to political chaos, are continuing to focus on security problems and do not appear to be ready to take any chances. They have indicated that whatever the outcome of the election, martial law will be in force for some time.   Polls Published **********Last week, the independent daily newspaper Milliyet published a poll showing 37.7 percent of those questioned in favor of Mr. Ozal's Motherland Party, with the Populist Party second with 25.1 percent and the Nationalist Democracy Party last with only 14 percent. **********Last weekend, another popular daily, Gunaydin, published the results of a straw vote showing the Motherland Party well in the lead. The following day, the paper was suspended indefinitely. **********On Tuesday, the mass daily Hurriyet prepared to publish a scientifically prepared nationwide survey showing the Motherland Party ahead with 44 percent, the Nationalist Democracy Party second with 34 percent and the Populists third with 22 percent. But the military barred publication of the Hurriyet and any other surveys. **********Political commentators have refused to make predictions, noting that the former Justice and Republican People's Parties, which represented Turkey's traditional conservative and Social Democratic voting majority for 40 years, had been excluded from the elections. In addition, their leaders have been barred from politics for 10 years. **********No one claims to know what the supporters of these two parties will do on Sunday. Organizations called the True Path Party and the Social Democracy Party have been formed to replace the two traditional groups, but they are not being allowed to take part Sunday. **********A nationwide television debate last weekend showed the three officially sanctioned parties agreed that that Turkey's pro-Western foreign policy and its domestic policy of strict law and order measures should be continued. Leaders of all three parties also spoke out in favor of a free market economy with only slight differences of emphasis.   A Contest of Personalities **********It appears that the elections on Sunday will turn out to be a contest of personalities. Mr. Ozal is generally regarded as the most charismatic leader, with Mr. Sunalp appearing to stand for continuity of military rule. Mr. Calp, political experts says, tries hard to look like a Social Democrat. **********A large turnout is expected, in part because those not voting are liable to a fine of more than $10, not an insignificant sum for most Turks.

Mr. Arafat then predicted at a news conference that the Palestinian rebels would invade the city in 24 to 48 hours.) **********Preparations Continue **********Both Arafat loyalists and foes continued to erect earthen barricades and reinforce their positions around downtown Tripoli today, in preparation for another possible round of heavy street fighting. **********Mr. Rahman said the P.L.O. leader received details at 3 A.M. of the plan to end the Tripoli crisis worked out in Damascus by the Syrian Foreign Minister, Abdel Halim Khaddam, and the Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal. **********Two of Mr. Arafat's senior aides, Khalid al-Hassan and Rafiq Natshe, were in Damascus this evening working with Saudi and Syrian officials on the specific details for carrying out the plan, according to Arafat aides. **********The plan falls short of the conditions Mr. Arafat demanded 10 days ago for his withdrawal, so his conditional acceptance of it would seem to indicate a recognition on his part of his precarious military situation, as well as a desire to end the killings here.   Lull in the Fighting **********There was almost no fighting in Tripoli today, as the rebels gave more of the city's residents a chance to clear out in advance of any house-to-house fighting, as well as an opportunity for the Arab diplomatic efforts to run their course. The Arab countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, are understood to be desperate to save Mr. Arafat, not because they necessarily like him, but because they fear his death could set off widespread demonstrations and instability within their own countries. **********Reto Meister, the head of the Tripoli office of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said today that, according to data compiled by his staff a total of 438 people had been killed in the Tripoli fighting since it started Nov. 3 and 2,100 wounded. These figures include both civilians and combatants on both sides. **********Ahmed Jabril, who heads the Syrian- backed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, has emerged in the last three weeks of fighting as the top rebel military commander. The other senior rebel officer, Col. Saed Musa, appears to have faded into the background, at least for the time being. **********Mr. Jabril indicated that he was not interested in any formula that would provide Mr. Arafat with an honorable exit or a chance to retain his leadership of the Palestinian movement through any ''democratic dialogue.''  Arafat Called 'Wanted Man' **********''We want to get Arafat out of Tripoli,'' said the 48-year-old Mr. Jabril, ''because we have decided in the Palestinian revolution to finish Arafat politically, militarily and symbolically.'' **********Once Mr. Arafat is out of Tripoli, Mr. Jabril said, ''he should be presented to a revolutionary tribunal that would take account of all his political and moral deviations during the last 18 years.'' **********Mr. Jabril added that, even if Mr. Arafat left Tripoli alive, he would remain ''a wanted man.'' **********Asked how the Palestinians living in the Beddawi refugee camp just northeast of Tripoli were accepting the rebels, Mr. Jabril hinted that there were some problems. **********Some indication of what he was talking about may have been given by an encounter between some of Mr. Jabril's guards and two women from the camp that a few reporters witnessed by accident. **********The two women, both of whom appeared to be in their late 20's, walked up to the gate of two small apartment blocks that were once the home of senior pro-Arafat officials in the camp but are now being used by Mr. Jabril's men as a barracks and command center.   'Shame on You!' **********One of the women told the guards that her apartment was on the ground floor of one of the buildings and that she had come to see how it had survived the last three weeks of combat. At first the guard told her to go away, but after some argument he agreed to let her go in and look around, provided she did not remove anything. **********After about a minute, one of the women returned, sobbing and shrieking at the guards. Her apartment had been looted and trashed. **********''Shame on you! Shame on you!'' she screamed. ''You tell me not to remove anything - there is nothing left to remove. For 10 years we worked - 10 years. For what? For this? Everything is gone!'' **********The guards sat stony-faced and the woman, her fists clenched in anger, screamed: ''We are not Jews! We are not Jews! Why did you do this to us?'' **********Finally, one of the guards, who was cradling a Kalashnikov, jumped up and said: ''Look, it's not only your home. I can take you to my home, too, and you will see it destroyed. You should just thank God that you're alive.'' **********Tears streaming down her cheeks, the woman wailed: ''It would be better if I were dead. I worked 10 years for that, and now there is nothing.'' **********U.N. Urges a Cease-Fire **********UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Nov. 23 - The Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution tonight that deplored ''the considerable loss of human life'' caused by the fighting in northern Lebanon and called on the warring parties ''immediately to accept a cease- fire.'' **********It was the first diplomatic action taken by the United Nations since the fighting began in northern Lebanon. France requested the meeting. **********The resolution, sponsored by Algeria, Egypt, France and Jordan, did not mention either the Palestine Liberation Organization or Syria and was described by Security Council members as so moderate in its language that it was achieved in a brief meeting without speeches. **********Lebanese officials sought to toughen the resolution by insisting on language emphasizing ''the strict respect for the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity'' of their country. A member of the Lebanese Mission said the position of his Government remained clear, ''To solve the problem you need the withdrawal of all unauthorized foreign forces.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/21/world/old-french-feud-is-back-who-will-run-schools.html": {"writer_name": "Frank Prial", "pub_date": "1983-12-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1074, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OLD FRENCH FEUD IS BACK: WHO WILL RUN SCHOOLS?", "print_headline": "OLD FRENCH FEUD IS BACK: WHO WILL RUN SCHOOLS?", "body_text": " **********From Lille in the north to Marseilles in the south, thousands of people have taken to the streets in protest in recent weeks. But not, as in Britain and West Germany, against cruise missiles and Pershing 2's. A commentator here said, ''It's just another battle in France's oldest war.'' **********The argument, which goes back 200 years to the French Revolution, is over who should educate French children and how. **********On Oct. 22, some 100,000 people marched in Nantes in support of private schools. A month later, in the same city, almost as many marched against private schools. In Paris, in Marseilles, in Toulouse, in Rodez, in Lille, the story has been the same. **********The French are hoping, finally, for a showdown over national educational policy. They probably will be disappointed. ''Ecole libre,'' or ''Free school,'' has been a Socialist rallying cry since Jules Ferry, the founder of the modern French educational system and himself a Socialist, decreed in 1882 that primary education in France would henceforth be ''free, nonclerical, and obligatory.'' It is a goal that has yet to be realized. The Roman Catholic Church and conservative groups have never permitted the private school system to disappear. **********Just after the May 1981 elections, when the Socialists captured not only the presidency but also the National Assembly, it looked as if the old goal was finally within reach. But the Government of Francois Mitterrand put education on a back burner while it pursued economic goals.   Education Plan Published **********A preliminary school plan was made public last December and a final version was published in October. Called the Savary project, after its author, Minister of Education Alain Savary, it is a long way from the fiery anticlerical talk of the summer of 1981. **********For one thing, polls indicate that 71 percent of the French people support the dual educational system of both public and private schools. For another, a series of local elections around the country in recent months have shown a strong movement away from the left. The Socialist Goverment's time for radical change may have passed. **********Most notably, the Savary project in no way signals an end to the private school system. It talks instead of education being ''national without being uniform,'' and proposes an extended program of changes in which the easiest problems, such as conflicting school calendars, will be solved first and fundamental differences, such as how teachers will be paid, will be left until 1986. **********Bruno Frappat, writing in Le Monde, went so far as to say the plan ''renounces the old ideal of one single school system.'' **********The Savary project has pleased no one and has particularly irritated the strongest supporters of the public school system, including two powerful teachers' organizations and various unions that have banned together under an umbrella group called the National Committee for Lay Action. They have accused the Government of backing off on its promise to nationalize the private education sector as forcefully and dramatically as it did the major banks.   Freedom From Control **********The defenders of the dual system, principally the Catholic church, have adopted the ''Ecole libre'' slogan, but to them it means freedom from bureaucratic harassment and control. **********This move brought a bitter response from Michel Bouchareissais, secretary general of the National Committee for Lay Action. For the private schools, he said, ''free means that they are free to reject immigrants, free to refuse atheists and divorcees, free to dispose of public funds with no controls whatsoever.'' **********The moderate tone of the Savary project has heartened the private schools considerably. The Rev. Paul Guiberteau, secretary general of the National Committee for Catholic Education, while noting that the text of the plan is ''complex and ambiguous,'' acknowledged that it did provide grounds for discussion.   Millions in Private Schools **********As of last fall, about one-sixth of France's student population, or just over two million students, were in private schools, from the preschool level through the French equivalent of high school. In general, they pay no tuition. Of the two million, about 93 percent were in Catholic schools. The rest are mostly in academically demanding secondary schools or in schools run by other religious denominations. There are, for instance, 50 Jewish schools in France with a total of about 13,000 students. **********The reason most often advanced by parents for switching children to private school is much the same as that usually given in the United States: lower standards in the public schools. **********The French Government pays salaries and benefits for all teachers, in both private and public schools. Teachers in private schools are paid under two formulas. Under the ''simple contract,'' they work for the school; under the ''contract of association,'' they work directly for the state, as do the public school teachers. The contract of association applies to schools that fulfill ''a recognized educational need,'' such as being the only school in a specific area. **********The operational costs of private schools are borne by the schools themselves under the simple contract, although the local governments often contribute. Under the contract by association, the local governments pay operating costs for elementary schools and the national Government pays for secondary and vocational schools. The more exclusive private schools, which are not part of the system, pay their own way. **********The system theoretically gives the Government wide powers in setting standards for teachers and the material they teach. In practice, opponents of the private schools say, public funds are turned over to the private institutions, mainly the Catholic church, with virtually no strings attached. **********The Savary project would give the Government more say in appointing the directors of all schools, public and private, a system the private schools find unacceptable. ''They have something similar to that in the Netherlands,'' a Jewish spokesman here said. ''Consequently there are Jewish schools where the headmaster is not even Jewish.'' The Savary project would provide for simple changes such as correlating the school calendars of public and private schools and for fundamental changes in the training and continuing education of private-school teachers. It would require that experiments and new methods being tried in public schools be tried out in private institutions as well. **********All of which embitters the militant laicists, as the opponents of private schools are called. For them, the solution to France's educational problems is the end of all public support for private schools."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/12/world/poles-to-free-476-but-still-hold-60-labor-activists.html": {"writer_name": "John Kifner", "pub_date": "1983-08-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 474, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "POLES TO FREE 476, BUT STILL HOLD 60 LABOR ACTIVISTS", "print_headline": "POLES TO FREE 476, BUT STILL HOLD 60 LABOR ACTIVISTS", "body_text": " **********The Justice Ministry said today that it was releasing 476 political prisoners under the limited amnesty, but that 60 Solidarity figures would remain in prison. **********The United States has said that the release of prisoners jailed for political reasons would be its main test in determining whether economic sanctions imposed after the martial law takeover on Dec. 13, 1981, should be eased. **********The amnesty was announced as part of the end of martial law on July 21. But the Roman Catholic Church, the underground opposition and Solidarity's founder, Lech Walesa, have charged that new, repressive legislation took the place of martial law and that the amnesty was incomplete. **********The situation has been confused by fragmentary Government announcements.

Estimates of the death toll over the last three days ranged from 20 to over 50. **********A cease-fire was supposed to have been arranged this afternoon, but the firing did not ease until dusk. It was not clear how long the truce would hold. **********How Fighting Began **********The fighting started on Saturday when French units of the multinational force pulled out of two areas after bomb and sniper attacks on their positions. **********The French handed the areas over to the Lebanese Army, which the Shiite Moslem militiamen controlling much of southern Beirut regard as allied with one of their principal foes, the Christian Phalangist militia. The Shiites fear, Arab officials and analysts said, that the army's advance into areas under their control will enable the Phalangists to expand their zone of influence.  In an interview tonight that underscored an atmosphere of gathering crisis among the Shiites, one of their leaders, Nabih Berri, asserted that his Amal militia had not opposed the army's takeover of the French positions and that the army had started the clashes. Speaking of the fighting today, he said his followers were attacked and ''I decided to answer.'' **********Mr. Berri said he saw the latest Lebanese Army maneuver as a possible preliminary to a major attack on the Shiite-dominated southern suburbs. ''I do not have any intention to attack, but if they do it, I will fight,'' he said. **********An aide at his headquarters, Hussein Fawaz, said that if the army stormed the southern suburbs, ''We will defend ourselves and the whole country will be destroyed.'' **********He said the French and American contingents in the four-nation force were behind the Lebanese army tactics. France and the United States are training Lebanese Army units to try to strengthen the central Government and help it extend its control to areas of Beirut and the hills surrounding it that are under the influence of militias. **********Apart from the recent fighting, the Shiites say they have been unsettled by a steady buildup of Lebanese Army forces close to their positions. **********''They are moving tanks toward us,'' Mr. Fawaz said. A reporter who visited Mr. Berri's heavily guarded West Beirut residence tonight saw a convoy of the Lebanese Army's American-built armored personnel carriers moving south through the city. Their destination was not known. **********Shiite Buildings Under Fire **********Lebanese Army units used barrages of tank and heavy machine-gun fire today on buildings occupied by Shiite militiamen, and the Shiites fired mortars from apartment buildings at Government positions. **********During one army drive to reinforce forward positions, troops crouched low over their weapons as they advanced through nearly empty streets until sniper fire forced them to take cover. Smoke billowed from buildings attacked in the contest. In Shiite areas, apartment dwellers fled to their basements, pressing together in the gloom seeking safety. **********The fighting is said by many residents to be the worst in the Beirut area since the army and Shiite militiamen fought a three-day battle in September.

They are rising at a more moderate 8 percent rate in West Germany, 5 percent in Italy and 3 percent in Britain. **********Interpreting these numbers, the Conference Board, a nonprofit business research organization, forecasts the growth rates of the six foreign countries to level out at an annual rate of about 7 percent, and the United States to slow to a 4 to 5 percent rate. Those figures are roughly consistent with the expectations of the Reagan Administation, which is forecasting United States economic growth, adjusted for inflation, of 4.5 percent in 1984 as the basis for its coming budget. **********In other countries, a group of 22 financial editors and writers, surveyed by Robert Bendiner for World Press Review magazine, also expects better economic conditions next year. Three-fourths of the financial journalists said they were ''more hopeful'' about world economic prospects than they were a year ago. **********But, when asked whether the recent upturn in the United States had increased their confidence in President Reagan's economic policies, 55 percent said no and 45 percent said yes. B. Kamau Kaniaru of The Daily Nation in Nairobi, Kenya, said: ''President Reagan has done only what any other President should have done - stop the rot from getting worse, at least in the United States. But he seems quite oblivious to economic disaster in the rest of the world.'' **********''The problems and dangers of his deficit-spending policy are still relevant,'' said Hartmut Froels, executive editor of the business weekly Wirtschaftswoche of D\"usseldorf, West Germany. Anne Bower of The Financial Post of Toronto said: ''Looking back, there must have been a better way to bring inflation down than to kill so many jobs.'' **********Stephen Mulholland, editor of the of The Financial Mail of Johannesburg, was more enthusiastic about Mr. Reagan's economic policies. ''Based on the swing away from demand management and welfarism and toward supply-side economics,'' Mr. Mulholland said, ''I expect that we will see a prolonged upswing in the 80's.'' **********The darkest cloud hanging over the world economy, according to the financial journalists, is the debt burden in the third world and Eastern Europe. **********Many business economists also say the world debt is the No. 1 problem. F. Taylor Ostrander, economic consultant to AMAX Inc., told a recent minerals conference in Washington that, in the face of the gravest threat to world financial stability since 1931, the International Monetary Fund was trying ''valiantly'' to exert discipline on the debtor countries and to use ''the medicine of money to enforce what a pragmatic family physician might prescribe for economic ills.'' **********But he warned that the I.M.F.'s resources were limited and had just missed being undermined by a populist reaction in the United States Congress. **********The other major threats to the world economy, the journalists said, were the strong American dollar resulting from high interest rates; the spread of protectionism; technological unemployment; strains between the United States and the Soviet Union, and concern over future energy sources. **********The greatest negative factor in the United States economy, they said, was the high level of military expenditures, followed by the disparity between wages and labor productivity, the low proportion of private savings to personal income, recent Federal tax cuts and the increasing costs of social services. **********While there is strong consensus among the financial journalists and business economists that the American economy will continue expanding in the coming year, many are worried about its sustainability beyond 1984. ''The surprising strength of the recovery and Washington's inability to curb huge deficits cast a shadow upon the 1984 economy,'' says Francis H. Schott, chief economist of the Equitable Life Assurance Society. He thinks interest rates are likely to rise by late 1984 to the point where a cyclical setback in 1985 is probable. **********Similarly, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development expressed reservations on whether the recovery could be sustained in the United States and Europe, with a major question mark the ability of the United States to reduce its fiscal and external imbalance. **********Thus there is widespread confidence that the upswing in the business cycle will continue in 1984 and equally widespread concern that it will run into trouble if this country does not do something about its outsized budget deficits. **********So, here's to a happy '84 and, to keep it rolling, a healthy budget plan for the fiscal years '85 to '89!"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/18/world/us-diplomat-leaves-soviet.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 47, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Diplomat Leaves Soviet", "print_headline": "U.S. Diplomat Leaves Soviet", "body_text": " **********The United States Embassy said today that Richard W.

AIDES SAID TO QUESTION ACTS IN NICARAGUA", "body_text": " **********High-ranking State Department officials raised questions in White House meetings last week about the legality of United States involvement in covert military operations against Nicaragua, according to Reagan Administration officials. **********By law, the Administration is barred from taking any actions ''for the purpose of overthrowing the Government of Nicaragua.'' The questions were raised by policy makers and legal experts high in the department hierarchy. Their point was said to be that, contrary to law and to agreed Administration policy, guerrilla actions in Nicaragua supported by the Central Intelligence Agency and the United States military had gone beyond efforts to block supplies from Nicaragua to Salvadoran insurgents and could be seen as intended to overthrow the Sandinist Government in Nicaragua. **********U.S. Directly Involved **********These concerns, along with more vigorous charges by a number of senators, were brought to the attention of the White House in several meetings last week. But according to Administration officials, no decisions were made to curtail the operations. **********The concern in the State Department seems to have been provoked by reports about covert operations in Nicaragua and warnings by several key senators over possible violations of the law. **********One senior official said the danger that the operations might take on ''larger proportions'' should have been foreseen but was not.  Another said that the spillover effect was understood at the outset, at least by some officials, and that they had suggested that the Administration oppose legislation that would bar efforts to overthrow the Sandinist Government. This suggestion was rejected because it would have been too controversial, the official said. U.S. Involvement Confirmed **********According to the official, this in effect put the United States in the position of protecting the Sandinist Government if operations were restrained, or possibly violating the law as operations inevitably expanded. **********The officials confirmed a report last week that the Central Intelligence Agency and the American military were directly involved in planning, arming and advising paramilitary forces based in Honduras and were providing them with intelligence data. **********They said the State Department officials had not argued that the C.I.A. and the American military were deliberately acting contrary to policy. Rather, they suggested that in carrying out the policy at this stage, it was almost impossible not to cross the bounds of legality from the interdiction of arms supplies to the destabilization of the Nicaraguan Government. Activities Stepped Up **********The policy approved by the President, the officials said, was to block supplies from Nicaragua to the Salvadoran guerrillas, to attack Cubans and the Cuban ''infrastructure'' in Nicaragua and in general to increase the costs to Nicaragua of backing the insurgency in El Salvador. Earlier this year, the State Department endorsed a decision to step up the interdiction, the officials said. **********Another complicating factor, according to the officials, is the attempt to control the operations of the contras, as the anti-Sandinist guerrillas call themselves. ''The contras' aims and actions may not be the same as ours,'' one key Administration official said. C.I.A. Officials Concerned **********The prohibition against efforts to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government is laid out in an amendment to a catchall appropriations bill approved by Congress last December. ''None of the funds provided in this act,'' it says, ''may be used by the Central Intelligence Agency or the Department of Defense to furnish military equipment, military training or advice, or other support for military activities, to any group or individual, not part of the country's armed forces, for the purpose of overthrowing the Government of Nicaragua or provoking a military exchange between Nicaragua and Honduras.'' **********A number of C.I.A. officials are also said to have expressed concern that the covert operations might have gone beyond the limitations stated in Presidential documents and in intelligence briefings to Congressional committees.

In addition, he owns nine shares of the 14,000 outstanding in the Switzerland-based company of Marc Rich A.G., shares he valued at between $150,000 to $200,000. He also owns nine of 14,000 outstanding shares in the Guam Oil and Refining Company, another Marc Rich company.

The United States, according to the companies, is about to experience a muffler shop explosion. Midas plans to open 700 new shops in the next five years, and Meineke is planning another 200 in half that time. **********In 1982, Midas, a subsidiary of IC Industries, a consumer products, real estate and railroad conglomerate, reported earnings from continuing operations of $31 million on sales of $246 million. **********The growth of Midas and the industry has been spurred in part by a trend in which consumers are increasingly relying on specialty shops to repair their cars. According to some industry estimates, 36 percent of exhaust repairs now take place in specialty muffler shops compared to 24 percent in 1976. And many Midas shops are now offering brakes and shock absorber repairs and replacements. The average bill, company officials say, runs about $75. **********Operating costs are lower and vehicle turnover higher in shops that do these kinds of repairs, compared to those that do tune- ups, overhauls and other more elaborate work. Brake, shock absorber and muffler work can be performed relatively quickly and they do not require sophisticated electronic equipment. The training of mechanics is easier than for general repairs and salaries are commensurately lower. **********.''Its lucrative, anyone can install a muffler, with very little training, and make a lot of money at it, said Jay Steinfeld, vice president of Meineke. **********In the aftermath of the 1973 Arab oil embargo, many gasoline stations either went out of business or dropped their repair services to concentrate on selling gasoline. Meanwhile, rising prices of new cars and high interest rates have prompted many automobile owners to hold onto their cars longer, requiring that they spend more money on repairs. **********Furthermore, Midas officials estimate that between 13 and 30 percent of the cars on the road will need exhaust work each year. In Chicago, where cars are exposed to a fair amount of cold, snow and salt, between 20 to 25 percent of the cars will need muffler repairs this year. **********Meineke, a low-cost muffler chain that opened its franchise operation in 1974 sold about 150 franchises this year, at an average price of $65,000 each. A Midas franchise costs an average of $145,000. **********Speedy Muffler King, a unit of Chicago area-based Tenneco Automotive that primarily operates in Canada and the Northeast, also expects to expand its network of company-owned sites, but its officials declined to release estimates. **********Midas introduced the franchising concept to muffler repairs in 1956 at about the same time that Ray Kroc, in the Chicago suburbs, began his chain of fast-food restaurants under the McDonald's name. At the time, Nate Sherman, the son of the head of a family-owned muffler manufacturing concern, was looking for a way to bypass distributors and sell directly to consumers. **********Part of the success of Midas has been its apparent ability to overcome customer dissatisfaction with existing repair shops. Consumer surveys continually show that many car owners do not understand the mechanics of their car and often believe that repair shops overcharge for their work, do sloppy or inadequate work and often perform unnecessary repairs. **********In contrast, Midas began offering clean, well-lit repair shops with large windows so that customers could see their cars being worked on. Customers were allowed to inspect underneath their cars and were given a written estimate beforehand so they understood the extent of the repair work. **********''We have a 'show and tell' marketing program,'' said John R. Moore, president and chief executive officer of Midas. ''We try to get the customer involved with the decision. We show him what's wrong with the car.'' **********Mr. Moore also said that exhaust repairs, well done, can inspire customer confidence and create an opportunity for additional repair work. ''When a muffler or tailpipe is gone, you know it,'' said Mr. Moore. ''And when it is fixed that, too, is obvious.'' **********Midas was the first exhaust repair shop to offer free replacement of its installed mufflers as long as the customer owned the car. Mr. Moore said that the guarantee helps reinforce the idea that Midas is offering a quality muffler, and virtually all the major chains now offer a similar guarantee. Only 17 percent of mufflers installed by Midas are replaced under the guarantee, Mr. Moore added. **********The guarantee also serves another purpose in that it brings back the customer to the Midas shop if anything goes wrong with the exhaust system, a Midas spokesman explained. And once a car is back in the shop, the mechanic might spot other problems that need repairs offered by Midas, such as shock absorbers and brakes. Executives at other muffler shops said that they offered the guarantee for the same reasons. **********In contrast to Midas and Speedy Muffler King, Meineke's advertising stresses its discount prices. Mr. Steinfeld estimates that the concern's outlets can install mufflers for about 20 percent less than Midas. Mr. Moore believes that prices at Midas are ''comparable'' with the discount shops. **********The difference in marketing approaches, however, is readily apparent in the television commercials each runs. The latest Midas ads are shot in soft tones and emphasize the shop as an understanding and efficient friend that makes good on its guaranteed mufflers, even far from home. **********Meineke's commercials purposely have a low-budget quality to them and have as a feature a young woman proclaiming that Meineke ''shatters'' muffler prices as she smashes a large window. ''It's made to look like it was filmed on a shoestring budget,'' Mr. Steinfeld said. ''That commercial gets our message across.'' **********In order to keep its costs down, Meineke uses less expensive universal mufflers that can be adapted at the shop to fit a number of cars. Midas and Speedy Muffler King use replacement mufflers that are similar to the original equipment and are designed to fit a specific car or family of cars."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/19/business/profits-scoreboard-173964.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Profits Scoreboard", "print_headline": "Profits Scoreboard", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/27/world/walesa-says-prisoners-are-freed-temporarily.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 221, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Walesa Says Prisoners Are Freed Temporarily", "print_headline": "Walesa Says Prisoners Are Freed Temporarily", "body_text": " **********Lech Walesa said today that Polish political prisoners released by the Government at the request of the Roman Catholic church have only been given a temporary leave and will have to return to prison. **********Mr. Walesa, the leader of the outlawed Solidarity union movement, said the men from Gdansk who were among the 30 detainees released had been ordered to surrender to prison authorities on Jan. 10. **********A spokesman for the Roman Catholic primate, Jozef Cardinal Glemp, declined to comment on Mr. Walesa's statement.

Silver, dropping more than a dollar an ounce this week, has plummeted to its lowest level in a year.  And just when people said copper could not fall any further, it has continued to slide. **********''The conditions in each of the markets are different,'' said Robert H. Lesemann, a vice president with the Commodities Research Unit. ''But in the eyes of a lot of speculators, they are sort of limping together. When you get speculators bailing out of one of those markets, it tends to produce an overflow in the others.'' **********The three metals are different in how traders approach them. Gold is for the most part a speculator's metal, silver is both an investor's metal and an industrial metal, and copper is mainly an industrial metal. **********Actions in Third World **********Despite these differences, actions - or fears of actions - in the third world have helped drive down prices of all three. **********Analysts say that investors fear debt-ridden developing nations are already selling gold - and will be selling more - to help repay their debts. **********Silver plummeted this week in large part because Peru announced that it is selling an estimated $70 million of the metal to raise cash. **********And, to the chagrin of domestic copper companies, Chile, the world's largest copper exporter, has stepped up production despite the depressed prices. Analysts say that this, too, was to obtain foreign currency. **********Ronald M. Hersch, vice president and manager of metals for Shearson/ American Express, sees another reason for the joint decline. ''Large speculators in the Mideast are distressed by the fact that the metals market hasn't responded to the international crises,'' he said. ''Therefore, they've liquidated their holdings, thinking that the price is going to go much lower, so they might as well buy it back when it's much cheaper.'' **********Margin Calls Cited **********Some analysts say another reason is that there have been some margin calls, which have triggered efforts to sell the three metals. **********Despite expectations that this week's crises would push up gold prices, gold slid until late yesterday. In London, it fell $10.10 an ounce Wednesday and $4.80 yesterday, to $383.50, a 14-month low. **********Later yesterday, in New York, gold for current delivery slipped 40 cents, to $386.20 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange of New York. For the 4 P.M. quote at Republic National Bank, it had edged up 50 cents, to $386. Metals trading in London closes at 10 A.M. New York time, while copper trading on the Comex ends at 2 P.M., and gold trading at 2:30. **********Silver fell by 56.5 cents an ounce, to $8.72, in London yesterday and by 30 cents, to $8.80, on the Comex. Silver has been hurt by the same speculators' actions that have hurt gold, but it has been dragged down by other factors, too. **********Silver is used heavily by the electronics and photography industry. ''The economic recovery has not been as strong worldwide as expected,'' said Mr. Hersch. ''There hasn't been as much demand as we expected, and some companies are delivering excess silver in their inventories to the Comex.'' **********Copper prices, too, have been held down by the failure of other nations to recover as strongly as the United States. This, coupled with the overheated production of copper in third- world countries in need of hard currency, has depressed copper prices. Copper rose by three-tenths of a cent yesterday on the Comex, to 62.7 cents a pound.

Peronists here conceded just two hours after the polls closed; it was the first sign that a major political upset was in the making. Mr. Alfonsin went on to win 52 percent of the nation's vote and 60 percent of Cordoba's. **********''When Cordoba moves, the country moves,'' said Rodolfo Dragun, a gruff 51-year-old auto worker at the sprawling Renault plant. His was a boast common among Cordobeses, as the city's one million people are called.   A Blend of Detroit and Boston **********Behind their rebelliousness is their city's image as a place of brawn and brain, of auto factories and universities, that have combined to make it an Argentine blend of Detroit and Boston that in many ways mirrors and leads the nation's interior. **********The city is a symbol that there is another Argentina outside Buenos Aires, the capital, which holds 40 percent of the nation's 28 million people and touches 70 percent of its economic activity. The rest of Argentina, one third the size of the United States, is largely uninhabited. **********''Capitolismo'' is what Cordobeses call that domination. The term reflects a chip on their shoulder that is partly behind their readiness to buck it. **********''It's not resentment, but resigned resistance,'' Marcelo Lozada, 53, one of the city's leading lawyers, said in an interview.   Striking Colonial Architecture **********A city of striking colonial architecture, Cordoba sits on an edge between the fertile pampas and the arid Cordoba Sierras. Its geography blesses it with verdant plazas, a dry climate and extraordinarily deep blue skies. **********Legend has it that even the city's beginnings were ornery. Jeronimo Luis de Cabrera was sent by the Spanish crown in 1573 to found a capital of the northwest province of Salta; he founded Cordoba instead. **********The story may be apocryphal, but it highlights immigration patterns that made Cordoba and much of the Argentine interior very different from Buenos Aires. Spanish colonizers mostly pushed across the Andes from Peru to develop the Argentine interior before Italian and other European immigrants came by sea in the 19th century to greatly expand Buenos Aires, a seaport. Italian-Argentines, though the majority in the capital, are still called ''gringos'' here. **********Where the way of life in the capital is racy, here there is a bent for tradition, down to the two downtown convents that still hold cloistered nuns.   Tradition 'Not Frozen' **********Preserving much of the heritage today are many young people like Juan Manuel Bergallo. A 33-year-old bearded architect, he returned in 1980 after six years in Europe to take over the city's programs to conserve the Spanish colonial churches and buildings that are a contrast to the 19th-century Italian and French architecture of the capital. **********''I wanted to do things in Cordoba and for Cordoba,'' he said earnestly on a walking tour of the city. ''There is so much tradition here, but it's a tradition that is always renovating. It's not frozen.'' **********The city's social transformation grew with its industry. Today Renault, Fiat and the Government's airplane company are among the factories here. Growing alongside them were powerful unions. It was an independent break by rank and file with Peronist union leaders that greatly aided Mr. Alfonsin, who attacked the power of the old-line leaders. **********''I like his ideas about democracy,'' Enrique Roldan, 43, said, stepping back from the Renault assembly line. ''You cannot work if you are not Peronist, and that's not right.''  Revolt on the Campus **********The most far-reaching revolt here was educational. Restiveness in 1918 at the National University of Cordoba, one of the three oldest universities in the hemisphere, won total independence from the Government. The changes quickly spread throughout Latin America, creating a double- edged effect of academic freedom and politicizing of campuses. **********Argentine military and civilian Governments for the last 40 years often reacted by intervening in the universities. Quality has suffered. **********At the National University, where students crammed for exams recently amid lush, 17th-century colonnaded patios, were signs of decadence such as broken glass panes and splintered desks. Mr. Alfonsin's education aides have vowed to re-establish university independence. **********So much stress is put on education here that Argentines elsewhere often call a Cordobes el docto, meaning the doctor. **********It is a milieu that gave rise to a medical student, Che Guevara, though old running mates of his at a dinner party one night still called him Ernesto. They said he was socially sensitive but not particularly radical before he left nearly 30 years ago to tour Latin America. He ended up helping lead the Cuban revolution and dying in 1967 in a Bolivian jungle. **********''He was happy - a lover of life and women when we knew him,'' said Eduardo Diaz, a 54-year-old contemporary. Che Guevara might be distressed to know that most of his friends and even his longtime college sweetheart are politically conservative today.   The Voice of the Interior **********If Cordoba's rebellious spirit has a target, it is not an ideology but provincial rights. Capturing a longstanding demand by local leaders for decentralization of the country's political and economic power is even the name of the city's sole newspaper: The Voice of the Interior. **********Mr. Alfonsin and his party, the Radical Civic Union, were helped by Victor Martinez, now the Vice President- elect, a popular former Mayor of Cordoba who was put on the ticket because of the city's importance. But Eduardo Angeloz, the 52-year-old Radical Governor-elect, said he intended to press even Mr. Alfonsin on provincial rights, such as industrial incentives and promotion of provincial exports. **********He said in an interview, ''We're raising the flag of federalism.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/13/world/spain-shows-interest-in-playing-latin-peace-role.html": {"writer_name": "John Darnton", "pub_date": "1983-03-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1011, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SPAIN SHOWS INTEREST IN PLAYING LATIN PEACE ROLE", "print_headline": "SPAIN SHOWS INTEREST IN PLAYING LATIN PEACE ROLE", "body_text": " **********There are signs that Spain's Socialist Government is interested in playing a role in bringing about peace talks in Central America. **********The interest, officials here say, can be detected between the lines of carefully worded official statements, in meetings with Latin American envoys and in articles in the Spanish press. **********Today Mexico's Foreign Minister, Bernardo Sepulveda Amor, arrived here for talks with Spanish officials. Cuba's Foreign Minister, Isidoro Malmierca Peoli, is expected here next week. **********Recently El Pais, the respected Madrid daily, said Mexico, Panama, Colombia and Venezuela were promoting a plan for a peace conference in the region and had asked the Spanish Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez, to intercede to get United States backing for it. **********The article, which referred to a meeting held by the four nations on the Panamanian island of Contadora in January, gave the impression that the mood in favor of such a disarmament conference - and for a Spanish role in it -was building throughout Latin America. **********In response to speculation, the Government spokesman, Eduardo Sotillos, told reporters last week that Mr. Gonzalez was ready to cooperate in a search for peace in Latin America provided that the initiative for talks came from the democracies there. 'Question of Assistance' **********This official stance - that Spain is willing to intervene only if it is asked to do so - appears designed to take into account Latin American sensitivities over involvement by a European and ''excolonial'' country. The Spanish Government is going to great lengths to avoid the impression that it is trying to impose itself as a mediator in the region, even though some officials believe that linguistic and historic ties should give Madrid special leverage. **********''It's not a question of mediation but of assistance,'' said Elena Flores, who heads the international department of the Socialist Party. ''Spain is willing to help but it all depends on if they ask us and what they ask us to do.'' Speaking as an official of the party, not the Government, Mrs. Flores said she saw a ''great prospective'' for Spanish-Latin American cooperation that would avoid ''the temptations of hegemony because of our limited resources.'' **********''We have a common language, a shared tradition, a common sensibility for understanding problems, and with the consolidation of democracy here, I believe that we can do things together,'' she said. **********The surge of interest in Latin America here springs from several causes. One is the assertion of a special affinity for the third world that accompanied the Socialists in their rise to power and formed a plank in their foreign policy platform in the October elections. It centers around the idea that Spain's peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy could serve as a model for Latin America. Fight Off 'Cultural Aggression' **********Some believe that Spain should be the champion of the Hispanic world. Recently Luis Yanez, president of the Institute of Iberoamerican Cooperation, told a Senate panel here that Spain should create a ''pole of autonomous culture'' for the Spanish-speaking community to fight off ''cultural aggression'' from North America and France. **********Another is the idea, not often directly stated, that a leadership role in Latin America could enhance Spain's overall prestige and serve as a powerful bargaining chip in its still unsettled relationships with the rest of Europe and the United States. **********Spain's top priority is to join the European Economic Community, overcoming the resistance of France, which fears that its own agricultural products will be undercut in price. The Government appears unwilling to run the risk of a rupture with Washington by withdrawing from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but is searching for near neutrality in the general conduct of foreign affairs. **********A third reason for Spain's interest in Latin America lies in the personal predilections of its 41-year-old leader, Mr. Gonzalez. He has had a longstanding familiarity with the region and knows many of the leaders through his position as vice president of the Socialist International, where he was in charge of Central American affairs. **********Mr. Gonzalez has several times publicly advocated what he calls a ''mini-Helsinki'' conference on security and cooperation in Latin America that, like the 1975 conference in Europe, would bring together all of the countries. Its goal would be to end hostility between Honduras and Nicaragua and the fighting in El Salvador and draw up agreements to curb arms imports and enhance overall security. **********Unlike the conference recently proposed by Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador, the Spanish version would not exclude the United States. Madrid views American participation as essential to the success of any major peace agreement. Says U.S. Should Recognize Cuba **********Mr. Gonzalez also believes that the United States should recognize Cuba. ''Twenty years of practicing isolation hasn't resolved the problem,'' he said in an interview in December. ''Maybe they should open another chapter and try a new road that would allow Cuba to participate in a plan of peace and security in the region.'' **********Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, has accepted an invitation to visit Madrid later in the year, according to Foreign Ministry officials.  The cordial relations between Madrid and Havana - Mr. Castro is said, for example, to supply cigars for Mr. Gonzalez - has caused speculation that the Spanish Prime Minister might someday serve as an important bridge between the United States and Cuba. Madrid would clearly cherish such a role. **********Last month Thomas O. Enders, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, came here for discussions with Mr. Gonzalez and his Foreign Minister, Fernando Moran. The trip was in itself one more sign of Spain's increasing visibility in Latin America. **********At a news conference afterward, Mr. Enders said he had ''profited'' from hearing Spain's views, but he also indicated that Washington did not need Madrid as a go-between with Cuba. He said the ''possibility of contacts'' already existed through the Swiss Embassy in Havana."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/21/world/kissinger-calls-printing-of-pentagon-papers-proper.html": {"writer_name": "Wolfgang Saxon", "pub_date": "1983-07-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 521, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KISSINGER CALLS PRINTING OF PENTAGON PAPERS PROPER", "print_headline": "KISSINGER CALLS PRINTING OF PENTAGON PAPERS PROPER", "body_text": " **********Former Secretary of State Henry A.

Mr. Kissinger was national security adviser to President Richard M. Nixon and, he said, ''most intensely concerned with controlling leaks'' that could compromise those talks. **********But he says in the magazine's August-September issue: ''I do not believe that it is the press's job to discipline itself about what information it receives, or to reject information it can obtain, on the ground that it might harm a negotiation. The media are in no position to make such a judgment.'' **********At the same time, Mr. Kissinger remained critical of government officials like Daniel Ellsberg, the former Government official who helped compile the 47-volume study on United States involvement in Southeast Asia from World War II to 1968. **********Mr. Ellsberg passed on the secret study to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1969. He later said he was the one who gave the documents to the press. **********''If the press broke into a Government office, I would think that highly improper,'' Mr. Kissinger told Robert Bendiner, the author, who interviewed him for American Heritage. ''And I have contempt for individuals in government who turn over to the press classified documents in their trust. But I don't have contempt for those in the press who receive it.'' **********Mr. Kissinger said he found the receipt of stolen information by the press deplorable.  ''But,'' he added, ''I do not think the media should censor themselves with respect to information that has come their way, provided they did not commit the act of theft or get somebody else to steal it for them.

That defeat not only left Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party entrenched for five years with an overwhelming majority in Parliament but also exposed shifting voting patterns among the working class that give the Labor Party scant hope of winning the next election. **********Another factor has been a decline in union membership at the rate of 500,000 members a year since 1980, primarily because of recession. Although unemployment fell slightly in August to just under three million, about 12.5 percent of the work force, the trend is still upward and industries with established unions are among the worst off.   Militancy Has Been Sapped **********The congress still claims more than 10 million members in 102 unions, just over half the work force. But militancy has been sapped by the unwillingness of many in the rank and file to risk jobs in strikes and by legislation imposing fines and jail terms on union members who strike in support of other unions. **********The congress's 51-member General Council elected today is the first based on a new voting system that gives more influence to the growing service-sector unions. Their increased role comes at the expense of large manufacturing- and engineering-sector unions whose members have usually been more militant on most issues than the more middle-class white-color unions. The large unions now have automatic seats but are excluded from voting for those seats to be filled by 83 smaller unions. **********The left wing fared better in the voting than had been expected. It is estimated that the conservative margin in the new council will be 6 to 10 votes, with several members labeled ''too hard to define.'' **********''The result will certainly be a move to the right - there is no argument about that,'' said Moss Evans, secretary general of the Transport and General Workers, with 1.5 million members the largest group in the congress. **********There has been speculation that a move to the right by the trade unions will strain the congress's relations with the Labor Party. The unions founded the party and are still both its major source of funds and a key bloc in determining its policies and leadership.   No 'Conscripts or Puppets' **********But many union leaders were dismayed by the disastrous squabbling among party leaders in the last campaign. Others are worried about the Labor Party's policies - and those of the more left-wing unions - which are thought to be out of touch with an increasng number of union members. They are painfully aware of polls showing that about one-third of all trade unionists voted for the Conservatives while others favored the Liberal-Social Democratic Party alliance. **********''We are not in command of an army of conscripts or puppets,'' Len Murray, the congress's general secretary, warned in debate today. **********One major threat to ties between the unions and the Labor Party is the Government's effort to capitalize on disaffection with the Labor Party by introducing legislation allowing union members to opt out of contributions to the party. Norman Tebbitt, the Government's Employment Minister, has asked the Trades Union Congress to suggest how to put the proposal into effect, a move that many labor leaders find galling. **********The disputes within the union movement on how it should respond to the political weakness of the left and the unflagging Government effort to chip away at union power were highlighted this morning in debate about whether the unions should talk to Mr. Tebbitt about legislation that would force uniform election procedures on the unions and require ballots before every strike. **********Mr. Murray and like-minded union leaders believe that the congress's refusal to discuss the legislation with the Government makes unions look unnecessarily recalcitrant, particularly since polls show that many union members support some of the voting reforms embodied in the legislation.   'As Baffled as I Am' ''I am sure that the majority of our members are as baffled as I am that some trade union leaders will travel halfway across the world to sympathize with Communist dictatorships, yet seek to prevent the T.U.C. from talking to the elected Government of Britain,'' Mr. Chapple said in a scathing reference to Arthur Scargill, the outspoken Socialist president of the mine workers. Last week, on a trip to Moscow for a convention, Mr. Scargill attacked Western defense policies. **********Mr. Scargill and others who oppoose talks with Mr. Tebbitt argue that there is no chance of influencing the Government to soften its attack and a grave danger of compromises that will simply make it more effective. **********In response to the proposal for talks, they introduced amendments calling for resistance rather than cooperation. One proposal threatened a nationwide strike in the event unions were fined or leaders imprisoned for refusing to obey the laws. Conservative leaders dismiss the proposal as an empty threat and ''a first step to oblivion'' because it is unlikely that most union members would heed a strike call on the issue."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/30/business/tandy-computer-s-hard-test.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1029, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TANDY COMPUTER'S HARD TEST", "print_headline": "TANDY COMPUTER'S HARD TEST", "body_text": " **********The Tandy Corporation, the world's largest retailer of consumer electronic products and one of the most profitable, got that way emphasizing price, distribution and service. **********It owns and operates more electronics stores than anyone with its worldwide Radio Shack chain. Its employees are generally knowledgeable; its products are widely regarded as inexpensive and reliable. **********''We consider ourselves a distribution system for the products of technology,'' says its chairman, John V. Roach. **********Today, Tandy begins perhaps the most severe test to date for that distribution system, and indeed for its entire marketing strategy. **********In Las Vegas, at Comdex, the premier trade show of the personal computer industry, Mr. Roach is to introduce Tandy's strongest entry into the business computer market, a machine designed to be competitively priced with the International Business Machines Corporation's Personal Computer and which is expected to be compatible, or very nearly so, with I.B.M.'s machine. **********Analysts differ over the prospects for Tandy's new product, which faces a host of I.B.M. lookalikes already on the market. David Bunnell, president of PC World Communications, a trade publisher in San Francisco, said such a machine from Tandy ought to make even I.B.M. nervous, thanks to the thousands of Radio Shack outlets. **********''Others have better technology,'' he added, citing the Compaq Computer Corporation of Houston, ''but they'll never get that kind of distribution.'' **********And Harry Edelson, an analyst with the First Boston Corporation of New York, says that the lookalike is the only way Tandy could hope to regain its lost market share in microcomputers. ''It's worth a shot,'' he said. ''Going the I.B.M.-compatible route minimizes the risk in a very hazardous business.'' **********''Tandy won't be wildly successful in market share with its PC,'' predicted David Lamb, an analyst with Link Resources in New York. ''But it will do fine in profits.'' **********The company, named after its founder, Charles David Tandy, who died in 1978, has traditionally done fine in profits. When Mr. Tandy acquired the bankrupt Boston-based Radio Shack 20 years ago, his primary business was leather goods retailing, not consumer electronics. But by 1975 the chain was doing so well that he spun off everything except Radio Shack. **********In the latest fiscal year, ended June 30, 8,868 Radio Shack outlets racked up more than $2.5 billion in worldwide sales. Earnings, totaling $278.5 million for the latest year, have risen at an average compounded rate of 30 percent a year in the last decade. Gross margins have remained in the 58 to 59 percent range in the last five years, at least 20 percentage points higher than the average for competitors, analysts say. **********A good deal of that growth has come from microcomputers, an industry Tandy helped found back in 1977. Although Radio Shack stores offer an assortment of goods, from batteries to toys to stereo sets, in just six years microcomputers and related products have become the company's biggest-selling items, accounting for some $875 million, or 35.3 percent, of total volume in the 1983 fiscal year. **********Radio Shack's microcomputer offerings include everything from a low-end home machine, the Color Computer, to powerful, multi-user business systems with five-figure prices as well as pocket computers and the popular Model 100 portable. **********While other microcomputer makers are either awash in red ink, have filed for bankruptcy or left the business altogether, Tandy says it has made money because it manufactures most of its products and controls distribution. **********In any case, analysts agree that Tandy's vast distribution network has enabled Radio Shack to maintain its profits by staying out of the vicious computer price wars that its competitors began last year. It has, however, cut the price of its home model, the Color Computer. **********Tandy, however, has paid for its profits with a steep loss of market share. In 1979 Radio Shack accounted for 40.5 percent of sales in the industry, according to the International Data Corporation. Last year, Radio Shack's share was estimated at a mere 8.6 percent. **********And although today's introduction of its new product would indicate that the company is in microcomputers to stay, analysts such as Mr. Edelson of First Boston predict that Tandy will not be a major force in the market unless it alters the way it does business. **********He says, for example, that Tandy may be overestimating the advantage it gets from its distribution system. Customers crowded Radio Shack stores as recently as three years ago because only Apple Computer and a few other companies made microcomputers and they were hard to find in other stores. Now Radio Shack competes with Computerland, K Mart, Sears, Roebuck and a host of local specialty retailers. **********Mr. Edelson estimated that at least one rival manufacturer, Commodore International Ltd., may have topped Tandy by securing 10,000 retail outlets for its products. And, he added, there are so many home and personal computers out now, that consumers prefer to shop where they can compare the prices and features of different models, something they cannot do at Radio Shack's one-line stores. **********''Let them shop elsewhere and then come to us,'' countered Bernard Appel, Radio Shack's executive vice president for marketing. ''We don't want to be in the brand name business. We don't want the competition setting our prices.'' **********A trained sales force and widely available service are other ways Radio Shack can stay competitive and polish up what Mr. Bunnell of PC World Communications called ''a shlock image'' that it only recently has begun to shed. **********Tandy, in fact, is stepping up its sales force training programs and designates one staff member at each of its computer centers as responsible for maintenance and repairs. **********Such moves, along with the introduction of new products, are costly, however, and are some of the factors behind a warning at the last annual meeting from Mr. Roach, the company's chairman, that Tandy would not experience the same rate of earnings this fiscal year that it has seen in the recent past."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/18/business/bank-board-nomination.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 68, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bank Board Nomination", "print_headline": "Bank Board Nomination", "body_text": " **********President Reagan announced yesterday that he would nominate Edwin J.

Today, despite the improvement in orders for some steel products, the company is still struggling. **********On Tuesday, General Refractories got some help from its lenders when four banks in the United States and one in Canada agreed to restructure and extend for three years $29.5 million in loans. The financial package was based on the company's restructuring efforts, which began in February 1982. **********''When this program is completed, we will have a smaller and leaner company with considerably less debt,'' said Robert W. Smith, the president and chief executive officer. ''We plan to focus our resources in those product lines and geographic areas where we have the best profit potential.'' **********The company reported a loss of $63.5 million for 1982, compared with a loss of nearly $19 million in 1981. The 1982 loss included a one-time charge of $43.8 million from the cost of restructuring the company and write-downs of investments for affiliates. Sales dropped to $340.8 million in 1982 from $409.8 million in 1981. **********Russell Sheldon, a senior economist with the Mellon Bank, who follows the refractory business, does not expect refractories - and the steel industry to which they are tied - to regain their pre-1980 peak. But he does think there is reason for optimism among refractory producers, and predicts that domestic refractory shipments will grow by 18 percent in physical volume and 23 percent in dollar terms in 1983. **********Mr. Sheldon said such growth would put General Refractories, one of the top five domestic refractory concerns, on a better footing to survive. Pay Cuts and Layoffs **********The retrenchment aims in that direction. In February 1982, the first step was a 20 percent pay cut for all domestic salaried employees. By last January, 850 people of a total domestic work force of 2,100 had been laid off. The company has also announced that it will close its headquarters in Bala-Cynwyd and relocate administrative employees to the refractories division in Pittsburgh. **********In addition, General Refractories plans to sell its three building product plants, which manufacture insulation, and its building board business. **********The other major players in the refractory industry are Harbison Walker, which is owned by Dresser Industries; North American Refractories, owned by the Allied Corporation; Basic Refractories, owned by Combustion Engineering Inc., and Kaiser Refractories, owned by Kaiser Industries. General Refractories is the only independent in the group. **********General Refractories, founded in 1922, had easy success in that decade, as did many enterprises that fed the steel industry. The company started shedding its peripheral and nonprofitable businesses in 1979, when it sold the Ohio Lime Company, a limestone producer; two small electrical equipment businesses in Michigan; an industrial cleaning company in New York, and its half interest in a construction concern. **********The plan of the restructuring was to concentrate resources on its thermal control products - refractory and insulation products - and its mineral filtration products. Nearly 70 percent of the company's sales are derived from refractory products. The company sells about two-thirds of those products in foreign markets, and until recently it was able to rely on foreign sales to pull it through slumps in the steel industry in the United States, and to count on its domestic sales to balance overseas slumps. **********But as the steel industry in both the United States and Europe has not recovered from the recession, General Refractories has been pulled down by both markets. **********With little hope for an upturn, the company's chairman, John P.  Sachs, devised and executed the survival plan. Mr. Sachs is president of the Great Lakes Carbon Corporation, a privately held, New York-based producer of industrial carbon material that owns 26 percent of General Refractories' common shares. **********Last July he replaced four resigning members of General Refractories' 11-member board with specialists: a banker, an accountant, a steel industry executive, and an individual with years of experience in the Federal Government and in advertising. **********''We were faced with having to restructure some credit agreements and to adjust our market share in the shrinking refractories industry,'' Mr. Sachs said. ''These were professionals with many years of expertise and know-how that could help us reach that aim - drastically restructuring the business.'' **********In September, General Refractories' president and chief executive, John Hartshorn, retired and was replaced by Mr. Smith, 66 years old, who had spent 44 years with the United States Steel Corporation, retiring in 1981 as executive vice president. **********With the housecleaning mostly done, Mr. Smith envisions a slow recovery. He says General Refractories will not return to its 1981 revenue level of $409 million until at least 1985."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/18/business/nissan-view-on-quota.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nissan View on Quota", "print_headline": "Nissan View on Quota", "body_text": " **********Takashi Ishihara, president of the Nissan Motor Company, said today that Japan should not agree to limit its auto exports to the United States next year until it received assurance that the curbs would be removed in 1985.

At Fastnet last week, Ted Turner tried for another victory at sea. But the waters were calmer this year, and another boat came in first. **********If Ted Turner thrives in stormy weather, it is not only at sea. While the rest of the cable industry is going through a shakeout, R. E. (Ted) Turner, television's bad boy, and his company, Turner Broadcasting System Inc., appear to be on the verge of turning a profit for the first time since 1978. **********After losing $3.4 million last year on revenues of $165.6 million, TBS has reported a profit of $6.3 million for the first half of this year - roughly equivalent to its loss in the period a year ago - and is estimating a $20 million profit for 1983. **********Compared with the three major networks, that is a modest sum, but it contrasts quite favorably with the three networks' experience in cable. In the past year, CBS Cable and RCTV - which was half-owned by NBC's parent, RCA - have gone under, and ABC's services are foundering. **********''Everybody decided the ship was sailing and they'd better get on,'' the 44-year-old Mr. Turner said in an interview at TBS headquarters here. ''It's a highly competitive environment right now.'' He and TBS are responsible for much of that competition. If cable has a single pioneer, it is arguably brash, outspoken Ted Turner. The so-called ''Mouth of the South,'' Mr. Turner has shaken up the television industry repeatedly since he entered it in 1970 with the purchase of a failing Atlanta UHF channel, which in 1976 he turned into a superstation - beaming its signal via satellite to cable television systems across the nation.  While he is still a controversial and perhaps unpopular figure in broadcasting, there are few who would quibble with his claim - widely publicized in his trade promotions - that ''I was cable before cable was cool.'' Cable is ''cool'' now, and so is Mr. Turner.  After creating his superstation, WTBS, Mr.  Turner broke new ground with Cable News Network, a 24-hour-a-day all-news cable channel that has forced the broadcasters to increase their late-night news programming. Most recently, he has been talking up an ad hoc fourth network of broadcast stations to which TBS would transmit shows - from sports to the 1983 Miss World contest - that were once the automatic property of the big three.  For the past two years, TBS has taken in about half of the entire cable industry's advertising revenues, which were $241.8 million last year, according to Paul Kagan, the cable industry analyst. Most of the sales have been generated by the superstation, WTBS, which today offers a diet mainly of old movies, reruns and sports, and goes into 26 million homes.  CNN, which was begun in 1980, is now received in 20 million households via satellite relay.  Its spinoff, CNN Headline News, television news in 30-minute formats akin to all-news radio, is offered in 4.5 million cable households and, in addition, is carried by 131 broadcast stations.  ''This place has the opportunity to be very profitable by 1986 or 1987,'' said Robert Wussler, the former president of the CBS television network who is executive vice president of TBS and president of WTBS. Conceivably, some TBS executives say, its revenues could match any one of the big three networks by 1990. **********It is a considerable boast. Last year, both CBS and ABC's broadcast divisions had revenues of more than $2 billion. Other Turner executives remain more skeptical. In terms of advertising, ''the networks are still the only game in town,'' said one. ''We're not replacing the networks, we're supplementing them.'' **********TBS has significant perils ahead. Perhaps the most worrisome is the potential programming shortage, in the view of Bonnie Cook, an analyst with J. C. Bradford & Company who follows TBS closely. ''I see these big combinations taking place in the entertainment industry,'' she said, and they will increasingly compete for programming. The most noteworthy example is Tri-Star Pictures, the new movie-making consortium of CBS, Columbia Pictures and Time Inc.'s Home Box Office, which has more subscribers than any other pay cable service. **********COMPANIES will have an edge if they have their own production company, she suggested, ''and that's one thing Turner doesn't have, with WTBS.'' While the company is making some original programming, it may not be enough to fill its enormous appetite in the long term, Miss Cook said, particularly if the networks are able to syndicate shows. **********And in the short term, Mr. Wussler and others at TBS recognize, the company's flamboyant chairman and president could well have an idea that would jeopardize the company's newfound profitability. Each time that TBS has appeared to be entering a period of financial stability, it seems, Mr. Turner has headed into uncharted and risky waters - first with CNN, then with CNN Headline News. **********Now, Mr. Turner talks of making movies for families, and even building a studio in Atlanta. According to Mr. Kagan, TBS is contemplating a joint venture with Home Box Office to set up a satellite programming delivery service. While TBS management declined to comment on the report, it acknowledged that anything was possible. ''Ted's always going to be that way,'' Mr. Wussler said. ''I wait every day for Ted to call me in and say, 'Here's what we're going to do.' '' **********All those ventures are tangential to TBS's real business, in Mr. Wussler's view. ''We're in the circulation business,'' he said. ''The future is getting WTBS and CNN into as many homes as possible.'' **********Mr. Turner, for his part, said that he has no new ventures planned that would upend the company. ''I hope not to be in the red again,'' he said. Due to the company's hard-won financial stability, he said at a party in June to celebrate CNN's third birthday, TBS was no longer looking for a merger with another television network. **********In fact, his widely reported talks earlier this year with the three major networks have been interpreted as an effort by Mr. Turner to put a value on his holdings; he owns 87 percent of TBS, which is traded over-the- counter. A merger would thus have made him a substantial shareholder in one of the three major networks, but none of the major networks apparently took him seriously.  ''I said that I wanted a merger, I didn't want to sell,'' Mr. Turner recalled. ''It was all or nothing.'' **********Even if Ted Turner does not go off on another speculative venture, WTBS's and CNN's circulation - and thus their future - is under challenge. For one thing, the news services are facing competition from the Satellite News Channel, a joint venture of the Westinghouse Corporation - which owns Group W Cable - and ABC Video Enterprises. Introduced a year ago with bonuses of up to $1 per subscriber to system operators, SNC has signed up 7.3 million households and is projecting that it will be in more than 10 million by year-end. **********''SNC is absolutely eating into our market, they're costing us a large fortune,'' Mr. Turner complained. What's more, according to TBS, they are doing it illegally by withholding Group W cable franchise systems, including the one in New York. Accordingly, TBS is suing Group W for monopolistic practices. **********''Ted Turner does not react very well to competition,'' acknowledged Dan Ritchie, Group W's chairman. Group W, which denies the charges, has counter-sued, accusing CNN and WTBS of unfair competition. Mr. Richie noted that 87 Group W systems carry CNN, another 103 carry SNC and 72 carry both. The reason that Manhattan's Group W does not carry CNN, he said, is that, with 26 channels, it does not have the room for an additional service, and the system operator opted for SNC. **********Another threat to WTBS are the significantly higher copyright royalty fees that cable system operators must pay now for each distant signal. So far, WTBS has lost only 300,000 subscribers, but the fee increase could make it more difficult to add subscribers in new systems. Since most of those systems are in major urban areas, that could limit WTBS's potential viewing audience. The fees are ''confiscatory,'' said Mr. Turner, who is lobbying to change the copyright agreement. **********THE royalty fees are worrisome **********mainly because the superstation **********is TBS's only guaranteed moneymaker. Last year, WTBS contributed $96.6 million to revenues and $31.2 million to operating profits. That was an impressive profit margin, but the sum was not enough to make up for the losses of the news channels and the Turner baseball and basketball teams, the Atlanta Braves and Hawks. ''WTBS continues to be the locomotive of the corporation,'' said Mr. Wussler. WTBS ''is all we've got,'' said William Bevins, TBS's chief financial officer. **********CNN was actually profitable between last October and May, Mr. Bevins said, but the ink reddened again this summer with the renegotiation of contracts with systems operators. With SNC offering an alternative, systems operators reduced their per-subscriber payment to TBS to 10 cents from 15 cents, ''and it's going to go on down,'' said Mr. Bevins. (Such fees are important, as CNN sells only 40 percent of its commercial time. WTBS sells the same percentage over all, but it sells between 65 and 70 percent of its commercial prime time, for which advertisers pay a higher rate than for daytime.) This year, as in 1982, he said, CNN will probably lose $6 million and CNN Headline News will lose another $10 million. **********While CNN Headline News may be profitable next year, he said, ''it's too early to say if CNN will be profitable. We could make it profitable if we cut back service, but that's not in the cards.'' Instead, money is being plowed into the news-gathering operations, with two more overseas bureaus - Paris and Mexico City - opening next year. **********The sports teams, even the high- flying Braves, are also a drag on profits, said Mr. Bevins, ''but for us, the ball clubs are a program. If the club performs well, we have a free program, one of our best-rated. We will make a lot more from televising them than the clubs will lose.'' The Braves games, along with 4,200 movies under license, give WTBS a reliable source of supply. **********''We don't need to buy or make a thing 'til 1987,'' said Mr. Wussler. In fact, the company will have to acquire additional programming, he conceded, but ''I know where to get the others,'' he added. ''I see no reason why we can't have a steady stream of programming. We provide a very good national marketplace for programs that have been around home once or twice. There's no better marketplace for a third or fourth or fifth syndication.'' **********Still, TBS has spent more than $20 million in the past year or so to make or acquire programming. It has given $6 million to Jacques Cousteau for a series on the Amazon, which will run on WTBS next spring and be syndicated worldwide, and which nobody expects to pay its way. ''Someone had to keep Cousteau going, and it's a prestige thing to do, like a loss leader in the supermarket,'' said Mr. Turner. **********THE plan is to build up a substantial syndication business with **********the Cousteau show, other original programming and acquisitions that include some British family series, the Miss World contest and ''Centennial,'' the miniseries based on the James Michener novel. Some of the shows will be fodder for a fourth network; others will be sold outright for cash. But whether WTBS has the expertise for syndication is debatable. ''I'm not sure you can run something like that out of Atlanta,'' said one television executive. ''You need to be on the streets of Los Angeles or New York.'' **********''If you buy it right, you make money,'' said Henry Gillespie, a veteran programmer who is in charge of syndication at TBS. ''If you buy it wrong, you don't. We've done it more wrong than right. We're trying to become the best bidder.'' **********''More than ever'' is how Mr. Turner describes his commitment to cable and TBS, and branching out into original programming and syndication may be enough to occupy him for a while. But it is unclear how much longer he will be satisfied. **********What interests Ted Turner, according to Mr. Wussler, only partly in jest, is ''saving the country, saving the world,'' and there has been speculation that his next step will be to enter politics. In any event, the television industry would be mistaken to relax. ''His habit has been to keep putting his reach beyond his grasp,'' said Paul Kagan, the cable industry analyst. ''It's his style to go for the next brass ring.'' **********PROGRAMMING:THE TURNER WAY **********If Turner Broadcasting System is going to create more original programming, the likelihood is that it will be relatively high- toned, family-oriented and in keeping with Ted Turner's personal brand of morality and politics - ''archconservative with some big liberal holes,'' in the view of Robert Wussler, executive vice president of TBS and head of WTBS. **********Accordingly, the shows that WTBS has originated to date tend to be patriotic and upbeat. There is ''Portrait of America,'' a five-year project that has vowed to take an in-depth look at each of the 50 states. Another is ''Nice People'' which, as the publicity notes, focuses on ''unsung heroes who, as ordinary people, do extraordinary things for the well-being of others.'' Next week will bring the debut of ''Good News,'' a nightly news- format show that will recap the happier events of the day. Is that a Ted Turner inspiration? ''They're all his inspirations,'' said Mr. Wussler. **********Not all the shows are so light- hearted. There have been documentaries on world over-population, the capacity to grow food and youth unemployment. Such subjects rarely find favor with advertisers, but they do with Mr. Turner, and so they run on WTBS. ''He's able to do that because he owns the place.'' Mr. Wussler noted. ''Ted's a big fan of documentaries.'' **********''We'll stay in the positive programming area as much as we can,'' Mr. Turner promised in an interview last month. That, he added, is in marked contrast to network products such as CBS's ''Dukes of Hazzard'' - ''which dramatizes reckless driving and paints the law as bumbling, corrupt officials.'' **********But some WTBS programming is aimed at advertisers. The series on which WTBS is pinning some of its biggest hopes is ''Starcade,'' a video arcade- style game show aimed at the hard-to-get teenage audience. ''It will not win any Emmys or Peabodys,'' said Henry Gillespie, a veteran programmer who is in charge of syndication at TBS. ''In some cases, we might even say, 'that's not ours.' But it will be an important commercial entity on WTBS and in syndication.'' **********'''Starcade' is a kids' show,'' said Mr. Turner.

Dionne", "pub_date": "1983-12-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1681, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BARRING ALIENS FOR POLITICAL REASONS", "print_headline": "BARRING ALIENS FOR POLITICAL REASONS", "body_text": " **********A week ago the State Department rejected visa applications from Nicaragua's Interior Minister, Tomas Borge, and Roberto d'Aubuisson, the President of the Salvadoran Constituent Assembly. **********A White House official explained that the Government had denied a visa to Mr. Borge, a leading official of the left-wing Sandanista Government, because it did not want to give him ''a propaganda platform'' in the United States. Mr. d'Aubuisson, leader of the right-wing party known as Arena, was said to have been kept out because of the Administration's concern over terrorist death squads to which he has been linked. **********The action has prompted questions on whether - and under what circumstances - the Government should deny visas solely on political grounds. The White House was reported to have been sharply divided from State Department officials on the decision to deny entry to Mr. Borge and Mr. d'Aubuisson. **********Defenders of the Government's action argue that the denial of such visas is an important instrument of foreign policy and that the Government has broad rights to determine who can enter the United States. **********Opponents of the Government's action argue that a refusal to grant visas on political grounds denies Americans access to information that might contradict a given Administration's position. They also argue that such denials are inconsistent with the country's tradition of civil liberties and tarnish the United States' image abroad. **********The Background **********Under Section 212 (a) 27 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Government can exclude foreigners ''whose activities would be contrary to the public interest.'' **********Section 212 (a) 28 of the act permits the Government to exclude foreigners who are members of Communist or anarchist organizations, as well as those who are not members but ''write, publish, circulate, display or distribute any written or printed matter advocating or teaching opposition to all organized government'' or ''advocating and teaching the economic, international and government doctrines of world Communism.'' **********The law, known as the McCarran- Walter Act, was enacted in 1952 and includes many other grounds on which the Government can keep foreigners out of the United States, whether they want to live here or simply visit. It has frequently been invoked to exclude not only foreign government officials but also artists, writers and opposition politicians. **********Aryeh Neier, a law professor at New York University and vice chairman of the Fund for Free Expression, an organization that tries to promote free speech around the world, opposes any exclusion of foreigners on ideological grounds. But he said that ''the courts have always differentiated between what one may do to Americans inside the country and what one may do to outsiders who want to come in. **********''The courts,'' he continued, ''have held that noncitizens outside the country do not enjoy the same First Amendment rights as do citizens or even noncitizens who are inside the United States.''  Degree of Discretion at Issue **********Few people - most of them ardent libertarians - say the Government should open America's borders to all comers. The differences on the issue are over how much discretion the Government should have to keep foreigners out and whether political reasons are ever sufficient grounds for excluding either those who want to move to the United States or those who simply want to visit. **********The Argument For Political Exclusion **********Most of those who argue that the government should be able to keep out foreigners on political grounds acknowledge that the issue is a sensitive one and that the Government should use its power with discretion. **********But they contend that it is a power the Government should nonetheless have in reserve for certain cases. **********''Is there never, ever a foreign policy reason for refusing entry to a foreigner, especially a foreign government official?'' asked Elliott Abrams, the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs. ''My own view is that there are definitely dangers of abuse, but there are at least a few circumstances when we might send the wrong message by letting someone in - for example, by letting in a political figure who had violated human rights.'' **********''We're not keeping anybody's views out,''' Mr. Abrams added. ''Views are admitted to the United States without visas. We are keeping out certain officials for certain foreign policy reasons.'' **********Charles Fairbanks, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Human Rights, said: ''If you can't keep out Goering, there would be something wrong with the law. '' He added: ''My mind goes back to the 30's because there were all these high-ranking Nazi missions that went around the world to convince the public in countries where rearmament efforts were going on that Germany was not dangerous and was not violating human rights. And I would think that there would be circumstances that you would want to send the diplomatic signal that such a mission cannot proceed.''  Borge Decision Defended **********Mr. Fairbanks said that in denying a visa to Mr. Borge, the Government was not trying to ''keep out what Borge has been saying,'' since Nicaragua's position on the conflicts in Central America and the United States' role there had been widely reported in the American press and on television. **********''It's because it's a high official and because the decision has a diplomatic character,'' Mr. Fairbanks said of the decision to deny Mr. Borge a visa. ''We're at an important and delicate situation in managing our relations with Nicaragua and in the Contadora project and we might want to send some kind of diplomatic signal by keeping Borge out.'' He was speaking of the Contadora group of Latin American nations - Mexico, Panama, Colombia and Venezuela - that is trying to resolve the conflicts in Central America. **********Juliana Pilon, a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research institute in Washington, said she believed the power to deny visas should be used ''very, very seldom,'' but that the power nonetheless constituted ''a form of political warfare or diplomatic warfare.'' **********''There is definitely something to be said for denying visas to people who would use this country as a platform for propaganda,'' she said, ''or for people whose very presense in the country would be seen as symbolic.'' **********The Argument Against Political Exclusion **********Arthur Helton, director of the political asylum project for the Lawyers' Committee for International Human Rights, another group that lobbies for freedom of expression, said that opponents of political exclusion recognized that ''there are legitimate national security interests the U.S. can have.'' **********He said he and most other opponents of exclusion on political grounds could support keeping would- be visitors or immigrants out ''if there's specific reason to belive that someone may engage in terrorist activities.'' **********But the existing law, he said, contains provisions that ''sweep far too broadly'' and permit the Government ''too much discretion so that the political climate can influence the decision-making process as to who will be admitted.'' **********He added that as a practical matter, ''people who wish to do nothing more here than present ideas'' can always find other ways to get their views across to the American people, so that exclusion, he contended, did not even accomplish the Government's goals. **********''They can write their ideas and send them here,'' he said, ''or even just telephone them over the border.''  Old Law Is Attacked **********Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, has introduced a bill to repeal many of the provisions of the McCarran-Walter Act that give the Government a broad basis on which to exclude visitors. **********''The assumption should be that anybody can come here to visit unless they are going to be violent, going to overthrow the Government, are terrorists, have an infectious disease, are ex-Nazis or are so mentally ill that they might cause problems because they are out of control,'' Mr. Frank said. **********Mr. Frank said that refusing visas on political grounds damaged the country's image abroad. ''It's degrading, the spectacle of the United States being afraid of these people,'' he said. **********He cited as especially disturbing the United States' decision last March to deny a visa to Hortensia Bussi de Allende, the widow of the Chilean President, Salvador Allende Gossens. Mrs. Allende was refused a visa, ''because her entry to make various public appearances and speeches has been determined to be prejudicial to U.S. interests,'' a State Department official said at the time. **********''Here we are yelling at the Russians, as we should because they do not have an open society,'' Mr. Frank commented, ''and then we say that Salvador Allende's widow can't come and make a speech.'' **********The Outlook **********The existing provisions allowing the Government to deny visas on political grounds have survived previous legal tests. In 1972, for example, the Supreme Court upheld the decision to deny entry to a Belgian Marxist scholar and journalist who had been invited to speak before academic and other groups. **********The Court said that the ''plenary government power to make policies and rules for exclusion of aliens'' prevailed over the First Amendment rights of Americans. **********Mr. Helton, however, said he expected new legal challenges to the McCarran-Walter Act's exclusion provisions, possibly involving the cases of Mr. Borge and Mr. d'Aubuisson. **********In the meantime, there appears to be no overwhelming sentiment in Congress to repeal or modify the act's provisions, and the the Government will probably continue to have broad power to deny admission to the United States for political or diplomatic reasons. **********But Representative Frank said Congress would hold hearings next year on his and other proposals to modify the law, and that some of his colleagues in Congress had expressed interest in limiting the grounds on which visas and admission can be denied. Under Mr. Frank's proposal, the broad list in the McCarran-Walter Act would be narrowed so that only criminals, suspected terrorists, the dangerously insane, the infectiously ill and former Nazis could routinely be denied visas."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/31/world/arens-says-syrians-bombed-marines-building-in-lebanon.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 104, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arens Says Syrians Bombed Marines' Building in Lebanon", "print_headline": "Arens Says Syrians Bombed Marines' Building in Lebanon", "body_text": " **********Defense Minister Moshe Arens of Israel today accused Syria of bombing the United States Marine headquarters in Beirut and attacked the Syrians as a group with ''subhuman moral standards.'' **********''Nobody else could have done it,'' he said in a television interview from Israel that was broadcast on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation.''

Gillespie, the United States Ambassador to Grenada, said Thursday that he thought the number of Cubans killed was about 25, or about half the number previously reported by the United States. The American death toll in the invasion has been put at 18. **********The repatriation of the Cubans, 11 days after United States troops first invaded the tiny eastern Caribbean island, came after long negotiations between United States and Cuban officials that ended at 5:15 A.M. today.   Greetings From Castro **********The first plane, an Aeroflot Ilyushin 62, arrived shortly before midday carrying 53 diplomats and their families from Cuba, the Soviet Union, North Korea, Bulgaria and East Germany. It was greeted at Jose Marti Airport by Fidel Castro, members of Cuba's Politburo, a military honor guard and band. **********Mr. Castro warmly embraced the Cubans as they stepped off the ramp and shook hands somewhat more formally with the diplomats from the Eastern bloc. The diplomats left the airport by bus, traveling along roads lined with workers and schoolchildren who had been released from their normal routines to bid them welcome. **********The diplomats left Grenada soon after midnight and stopped in Merida, Mexico, before heading to Havana. With their arrival the Government said all its diplomats had been removed from Grenada except ''the minimum we consider indispensable to remain there until the evacuation of those fallen in combat and the solution of other pending problems.'' Among those remaining on the island was the Cuban Ambassador, Julian Torres Rizo. **********The Government published a list today of 679 Cubans who it said were alive on Grenada and awaiting transportation back to Cuba. It published a separate list of 38 Cubans whose fates it did not know. It said, however, that it knew 9 Cuban citizens were in the Soviet Embassy, making 27 the maximum number that could have been killed in last week's hostilities. **********Counting the 57 wounded Cubans and 10 medical personnel who returned earlier this week, the total number of Cubans on the island at the time of the invasion would be 784. **********The Cubans had hoped to evacuate all personnel as quickly as possible, using their own aircraft. But a diplomatic note from the United States interest section in Havana said that ''the airport facilities in Grenada are currently not in condition to receive aircraft.'' **********Under a plan accepted by the Cubans this morning in what they said was an effort ''to avoid delaying in the least the return of our comrades,'' it was agreed that United States planes would shuttle the prisoners from Grenada to Barbados and Cuban aircraft would take them from Barbados to their homeland. Because of delays involved in this procedure, the process of evacuating all Cuban personnel is expected to take several days. **********The first plane sent under the negotiated plan left Cuba at 7:12 A.M. today and was to arrive here this evening. Cuban officials said this evening that they did not know how many passengers would be on board. **********The Cuban Government also included in one of its communiques today what it called the ''surprising news'' that it had not yet been decided on Grenada whether to rupture diplomatic relations with Cuba. **********The communique, citing an Agence France-Presse report, quoted the island's Governor General, Sir Paul Scoon, as saying that he had asked only ''that the Cuban mission be reduced to a minimum, pending the decision the provisional government adopts.'' The Cubans said earlier this week that they had been given 24 hours to remove all their diplomatic personnel from the island, a demand they had refused.   Wounded Cubans Interviewed **********Thursday night, the Government made interviews available with the wounded and ill Cubans who returned here Wednesday. Looking cleaner and calmer than when they arrived, most did not fit the image of the well-trained military men who the Pentagon said had offered stronger than expected resistance in the first phases of the invasion. **********Of five who were interviewed, four said they were construction workers and had been sleeping when the attack began and had no arms available to them. The fifth was a first lieutenant in the Cuban infantry, Emilio Montoya Garcia, who showed a small, ugly wound that he said was the result of shrapnel. **********One of the construction workers, Miguel Adama Gay, a 44-year-old steamroller operator who worked on the Point Salines airport, said he had not seen any Cuban military personnel in that area. ''They never came down there,'' he said. **********The four civilians offered few complaints about their treatment after capture on Grenada, although each said he had been questioned twice - once by a man in military dress who spoke fractured Spanish and a second time by a man in civilian dress who spoke Spanish fluently. **********They said that some of their colleagues had reportedly been asked whether they wanted to defect but that they knew of no one who had decided to do so. ''They didn't ask me, I'm too old for them to went me,'' said Ramon Rodriguez, a wizened, 60-year-old electrical engineer. **********The military man, Lieutenant Montoya, painted a different picture. He said he and several others had been kept out of doors after their capture from Oct. 25 to Oct. 27, in blistering heat by day and downpours by night, and that their treatment improved only after visits from Red Cross personnel. **********He also said that he had been subjected to ''psychological pressure,'' such as assault troops threatening him with rifles, and that he had for a time been prohibited from speaking with his colleagues."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/08/world/around-the-world-danish-captain-is-fined-for-fishing-near-britain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 198, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Danish Captain Is Fined For Fishing Near Britain", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Danish Captain Is Fined For Fishing Near Britain", "body_text": " **********An English court convicted the captain of a Danish trawler today for his ''flagrant and deliberate breach'' of new British laws banning Denmark from fishing inside a 12-mile zone and fined him $51,200. **********The captain, Kent Kirk, had sought his conviction to contest Britain's new fishing laws in the European Court of Justice. **********He said he would appeal his case through the British legal system first. **********As he left the court in this North Sea fishing port, Captain Kirk was cheered by a small crowd of mostly young people.

And when dozens of business leaders, theologians and academics lined up against each other at the university this week, the debate over the economy was fought as hard as any gridiron encounter. **********More than 250 people packed the sessions of a three-day symposium on ''Catholic Social Teaching and the American Economy.'' Many hoped to influence and to help shape a pastoral letter on the economy, whose first draft is expected from the American Conference of Catholic Bishops in the fall of 1984. **********Containing the first economic pronouncements by the American branch of the Roman Catholic Church in 65 years, the letter is expected to generate even more controversy than the bishops' recent letter on nuclear war. **********The organizers said, however, that the topics reflected the bishops' concern about equity. ''That concern surfaces when there're enough unemployed people clamoring for people to listen to their cries,'' said the Rev. Oliver Williams, who teaches ethics in Notre Dame's business school. **********''The first question after that is, 'What do the bishops know about the economy?' '' he continued, ''And the answer is not a heck of a lot. But they 're learning. That's what this conference is about.''  Forum for Views Within Church **********The symposium, attended by the five bishops who will draft the letter, was actually a public forum for various views within the church. It is the only public hearing scheduled on the letter's contents. **********There appeared to be a widespread agreement on the need for Government policies that encourage continued economic growth. But that consensus broke down on matters of equity. Topics such as a guaranteed minimum income, materialism, industrial policy, union membership and full employment often pitted businessmen and conservative economists against theologians and social activists. **********''I came here with some trepidation, but I wanted to see where they were coming from,'' said John B. Caron, president of Caron International, a New York-based manufacturer of knitting yarn. He took to the floor to object when one cleric suggested that the letter contain a section on rights to union membership. He told of a Caron plant in Kentucky that might be forced to close without union concessions.  Symposium's Main Topics **********Lay business leaders have been questioning the wisdom and fairness of such a statement ever since the bishops made their intentions known last month. And the symposium's main topics - economic planning, employment, the poor and the disadvantaged, and trade with developing countries - did little to allay their fears that the document would be excessively liberal, or even leftist.  Charges of unfairness to business greeted the bishops' last letter on the economy, in 1919. Business leaders labeled as socialistic its call for health care, a minimum wage, Social Security and unemployment insurance, church historians said. **********The bishops are sensitive to these doubts and have postponed the publication of the final draft of their letter until after the Presidential election. But Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland of Milwaukee promised the debate would affect 1984 politics. ''It would be naive to think what we are considering does not have political implications,'' he said at a news conference. **********Organizers invited to their forum people with various shades of opinion. Marina Whitman, chief economist at the General Motors Corporation; Peter G. Peterson, chairman of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, and Michael Novak of the American Enterprise Institute were some representatives of the conservative viewpoint. **********Liberals on the various panels included F. Ray Marshall, Graciela Olivarz and C. Fred Bergsten, all former Carter Administration officials. **********The attempts at even-handedness left some of participants a little frustrated.

The initials stand for Dr Pepper and Castle & Cooke. It was undeterred by a definitive takeover agreement for $512.5 million that Dr Pepper had signed with another investment group the day before. And it apparently was not put off by a decline in Dr Pepper's earnings in the last year, as it slipped from third to fourth place nationally behind Seven- Up, Pepsi and Coke. **********Sam Schneider, a spokesman for Castle & Cooke at its Honolulu headquarters, said the company was interested in Dr Pepper for the same reason that it had been interested in the A&W root beer business, which ''was acquired through a similar type of arrangement in August.'' **********Mr. Schneider said Dr Pepper would help to provide ''a steady flow of year-round earnings, particularly in the summertime when our earnings have tended to be weakest.'' **********For its part, Dr Pepper is not saying no.

Theodore J. Forstmann, a general partner, cited ''the uncertain nature of virtually every element in their financing scheme.'' **********If DPCC is successful in acquiring Dr Pepper, its bid could be even more costly because of a provision in the Forstmann Little agreement.

In such a buyout, assets of the company being acquired are used to secure financing for the purchase. **********Commenting on Dr Pepper's attraction for Castle & Cooke, Lawrence Adelman, a securities analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds, said: ''Somebody approaching Dr Pepper has to take into consideration that it has the marketing prowess, financial resources and belief that can drive the volume up.'' **********An official of Drexel Burnham, who requested anonymity, asserted that Ian R.

The Commerce Department reported last week that investment by companies in plants and equipment will plunge 5.2 percent this year, after inflation, to $315.7 billion, marking the fourth consecutive sluggish year for capital goods. **********The fact is, abundant supplies are the economy's problem right now and not its cure. Business slashed excess inventories at a record rate in November, the twelfth decline in 13 months. And industrial production continued its descent in December, leaving one-third of the nation's production capacity idle. **********Economists do not expect investment to recover until most excess capacity has been put back to work.  ''Barring some random event, capital spending is going to come back very slowly,'' said Lee W. Haskins, chief economist of Pittsburgh National Bank. ''There will be only minimal gains early next year and no boom until the end of 1984.'' Upturn in Commodities? **********The slump in commodity prices, aggravated by surplus supplies of just about everything, persisted long after the stock and bond markets took off last summer. But even when commodity futures began to improve slightly in the fall, analysts remained skeptical that they were foreshadowing an economic rebound. The weakness in cash prices lasted through December, and forecasters like to see both futures and cash prices moving in the same direction before they announce a trend. **********Finally, cash prices inched forward enough last week for some commodity experts to proclaim an end to a two-year decline. ''The hints are there that we're in the early stages of an upturn,'' said William Jiler, president of the Commodity Research Bureau. **********The change reflects a bull market in silver and industrial metals.  Lumber is headed up, thanks in part to the housing recovery. Cocoa, coffee and sugar are weak, but corn, soybeans and wheat prices have risen somewhat. **********A recovery of commodity prices would be a bad omen for inflation, because futures prices are eventually reflected in consumer prices.  ''What the markets are really telling us is that the politicans are going to inflate again,'' said Mr. Jiler. Investing in Bankruptcy **********Bankruptcy, the ultimate dread of corporate managers, can offer the daring investor the opportunity to earn handsome returns by buying the shares of selected companies soon after they file their insolvency petition. That may be what Bear Stearns had in mind at year-end when it bought 34 percent of Revere Copper & Brass, in bankruptcy proceedings since October. Bear Stearns then watched the stock almost double in the next few days. **********Standard & Poor's, in a report on speculating in companies that have filed for bankruptcy, suggests looking at companies that file early, before their assets are dangerously depleted. Companies with large portions of unsecured debt are favored, too, because unsecured creditors are often willing to forgive part of their claims. New management is also a plus, the report said. It predicts that HRT Industries, Lionel and Wickes, in addition to Revere, should do well as they restructure in bankruptcy proceedings. Hoping for Soviet Trade **********Trade between the United Sates and the Soviet Union hit a peak of $4.5 billion in 1979. Since then, the figure has been dropping fast because of embargoes and sanctions. **********Export-minded executives, following the mid-November journey of 250 American merchants to Moscow, are trying to forge a movement to increase Soviet trade. Last week in Chicago, 150 people turned out for a pro-trade conference sponsored by local business groups. Most panelists predicted the Soviet Union would increase imports this year because of a crash program to build up its energy sector and because the nation's new leaders want to accelerate growth. **********Promising areas include machinery, farm equipment, computers, chemicals and petrochemical equipment and food processing equipment.  Some optimists predict that, if the United States were to change its policy, trade could grow to $10 billion by 1985 and $35 billion by the end of the decade. **********A number of participants would like the United States to extend credits and most-favored-nation trading status to the Soviet Union.  But they doubted that such sweeping changes would come soon. **********Winston Williams,Chicago"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/05/world/israeli-warplanes-strike-at-palestinian-targets.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 817, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ISRAELI WARPLANES STRIKE AT PALESTINIAN TARGETS", "print_headline": "ISRAELI WARPLANES STRIKE AT PALESTINIAN TARGETS", "body_text": " **********Israeli warplanes attacked Palestinian positions in the hills east of Beirut today hours after a truck bomb attack on an Israeli compound in Tyre.

One basic military fact has emerged: the Alliance is stuck with a forward strategy. **********The term means that if a crisis developed between the alliance and the Warsaw Pact, North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces would move out of their peacetime deployments to positions near the frontier between East and West Germany. **********The strategy has been criticized by many military men in the West and by civilian students of West European defense. They argue that to put the bulk of the West's forces so far forward invites a single Soviet smash through one of the two main corridors into West Germany - at Fulda and Hof - which, if successful, would burst into NATO's rear areas and would be followed by attacks on the alliance's flanks. **********NATO has been wedded to this forward strategy since West Germany joined the alliance in the 1950's.   'Political Imperative' **********Allied staff officers argue that the strategy is a ''political imperative'' because it protects West Germany, the strongest continental military power, from invasion. **********As the alliance has developed, so have strong military reasons for retaining the strategy. As staff officers emphasized, there is little depth in Western Europe behind the prospective front. A Soviet breakthrough would put allied air bases, ammunition and fuel depots at immediate risk. **********Another geographical factor in assessing the defense of Western Europe is that any eruption of Warsaw Pact forces, if successful, would spill out into a much wider land mass in which the Soviet forces would be able to use their numerical superiority. **********The alliance's answer has been to organize ground and air forces powerful enough to halt the main Soviet attack and destroy the leading formations, or, to use a favorite NATO military word, to ''attrit'' the enemy. This goal is in sight, according to staff officers. Over the last two years there has been a steady improvement in the quality of weapons, training and logistical support. **********The allies' stated strategy remains a defensive one. Nevertheless there are developments within supreme headquarters that point to an important strengthening of the alliance's ability to punish not only the attacking Russian forces but those of the second echelon. These are the troops that would follow after an initial attack was launched. **********Although little attention has been paid to these developments outside military circles, some sources here regard them as promising the most significant change in the alliance's military potential in the last 20 years.   Precision-Guided Munitions **********The Warsaw Pact's potential to reinforce any breakthrough with divisions drawn from the military districts of central Russia is a longstanding allied problem. But both the military and their scientific advisers here see in non-nuclear precision-guided missiles, fired either from the ground or from aircraft, a weapon capable of interdicting these reinforcing divisions. **********The United States, Britain and France are developing such weapons but not on the scale required in a war. The allies also are developing special bombs and missiles to destroy hostile air fields. The electronic jamming of Warsaw Pact communications also is emphasized. **********''Everything comes down to money,'' one staff officer said. Costs for research, development and production of the new weapons will add to defense expenditures that many of the smaller member nations already view as excessive. Other officers point out that even if parliaments raised military expenditures, there would be no assurance that the funds would be spent on the most vital weapons systems."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/08/business/advertising-campbell-mithun-gets-the-jockey-for-her-line.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1983-02-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Campbell-Mithun Gets The Jockey for Her Line", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Campbell-Mithun Gets The Jockey for Her Line", "body_text": " **********Campbell-Mithun, the Minneapolis subsidiary of Ted Bates Worldwide, has been named agency for Jockey for Her, a recently introduced line of women's panties from the same people who have been supplying males with Jockey shorts over the years. **********Jockey International in Kenosha, Wis., announced in September that it was going into three markets - Dallas, Los Angeles and Milwaukee -with the brand, which includes bikinis, hipsters and full panties.

Some Western diplomats said they were surprised at the restrained tone that many Africans took toward the United States, since Washington had not only linked the issues of independence and the Cubans, but had taken the leading role in negotiations with Angola and South Africa.

The first of these is that Israel's right to exist is neither open to doubt nor open to question. She is one of our strongest friends and surest allies. Our morality and our national security alike demand that we protect and defend her. So let us say it clearly and let us say it frankly. America's commitment to a free and independent Israel will never fail and never falter. Not for an hour. Not for a minute. Not for an instant. **********And that commitment - coupled with the drive and ingenuity of the Israeli people themselves - is why the passage of time will never erode Israel's ability to defend herself. So delaying or abstaining from the peace process will not serve the interests of the moderate Arab states. But a fair and comprehensive peace negotiated under the Camp David process will - and such an agreement is more feasible now than it will be in the future. **********As for the P.L.O., it is time they shed their delusions and discarded the politics of fantasy. Since the war in Lebanon, they have become militarily irrelevant. And unless they stop disrupting the peace process at the expense of more realistic Arabs, they will become politically irrelevant as well.   An 'Evenhanded' Policy **********And that brings us to the so-called rejectionist states. So long as they persist in undermining conciliatory measures like the Israeli-Lebanese agreement and the Reagan peace initiatives, they will increasingly weaken their position. **********In the meantime, the United States must do a better job of promoting the peace process. And in my judgment, we have unwittingly sown confusion in the Arab world by endlessly proclaiming our fidelity to an ''evenhanded'' Middle East policy. Of course, we do want good relations both with Israel and the Arab states. But in practice, so-called evenhandedness has all too often meant a tilt away from Israel. **********We need leaders who truly understand the interests of both our countries - and who are willing to stand up and express them frankly. **********And just what are these interests? The first and foremost is our unshakable commitment to Israel's security and prosperity. **********And let me also say that it's time this Administration stopped its use and abuse of sanctions against Israel in the mistaken belief that they will somehow advance the peace process. By now, we should have learned that sanctions don't address the fundamental problem of Arab intransigence. **********A second interest we have in the Middle East is to encourage Arab acceptance of Israel's right to exist and Israeli acceptance of legitimate Palestinian aspirations. But let there be no misunderstanding. The P.L.O. has proven itself to be little more than a gang of international thugs. And until they abandon the use of terror and renounce forever their oath to destroy Israel, the United States should neither recognize nor negotiate with them. **********Arab nations must understand that the United States cannot and will not deliver Israeli concessions to them. At the same ime, Israel should refrain from actions that may undermine the Camp David process. But on one point, let there be no uncertainty: Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. And when the Camp David negotiations are completed - or if the Camp David process irretrievably breaks down - I believe the United States should be prepared to more its embassy there. And let me say that I hope we never see that city divided again.   Better Ties to Arabs **********Another interest we have in the Middle East is deterring the threat posed by aggressors like Syria, Libya and the Soviet Union. **********Our fourth and final interest in the Middle East is improving U.S.-Arab relations. We share many economic and strategic ties with those countries - and we must pursue them in an atmosphere of friendship and cooperation. **********But even if the United States does all the things I have suggested today, peace in the Middle East is by no means guaranteed. The process will likely be long - and progess will likely be slow. It will call for all the wisdom we have and every ounce of patience we've got. We can point the nations of that region in the direction of peace - and we can remove some of the hurdles that stand in their path.

But it was unclear whether there had been any clashes today. **********Honduras made no immediate comment on the Nicaraguan charge.  But a Government spokesman in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, asserted that some Nicaraguan soldiers violated Honduran territory Saturday in an attempt to smuggle arms to guerrillas in El Salvador. **********The only specific action reported here today as having occurred between Nicaraguan troops and exiles was an attack on Saturday in which exiles said they killed 20 Government soldiers. According to the Nicaraguan rebels' radio station, a guerrilla group killed the soldiers while ambushing a 20-truck convoy in Nueva Segovia Province in northwestern Nicaragua. It said three insurgents were wounded. **********The broadcast added that attacks on Nicaraguan troops continued this week in northern Nueva Segovia and Matagalpa Provinces.

He said the army was keeping troops off the highways in the area after 5 P.M. to avoid casualties in ambushes. Rebel Attacks Seem to Increase **********Reporters have been unable to travel to the areas to check the reports. The sporadic attacks by members of the rebel Nicaraguan Democratic Force have apparently intensified in northwestern Nicaragua in the last two weeks, but there has been no indication that the fighting is a serious threat to the Government. A Government spokesman estimated last week that 2,000 counterrevolutionaries were inside Nicaragua, which is believed to have about 22,000 soldiers and 40,000 militiamen. **********The Nicaraguans said the firing by the Honduran patrol on Sunday was in support of United States-backed Nicaraguan exiles. The Foreign Ministry said it would protest to Honduras, as it has many times after reports of skirmishes near the border. **********The Honduran Government spokesman made his charge about Nicaraguan arms smuggling to El Salvador in a meeting with reporters. He said Honduran security forces intercepted 12 Nicaraguan soldiers carrying a ''large quantity'' of weapons on Saturday at Nacaome, more than two-thirds of the way across the 70-mile neck of Honduran territory between Nicaragua and El Salvador. **********''That is why we can say with certainty that Nicaragua is violating Honduran territory by sending small groups of soldiers and weapons to El Salvador to strengthen and supply the guerrillas in that country,'' he said. **********He said Honduran security agencies ''estimate that Nicaragua is using various alternative routes'' through Honduras to supply the Salvadoran guerrillas. ''Those shipments take place every 48 or 72 hours,'' the spokesman said. Nicaragua Doesn't Respond **********Nicaragua's leftist Government did not comment on the Honduran charge, but it has repeatedly denied charges by the United States and El Salvador that it is funneling Soviet and Cuban weapons to the guerrillas. **********It is estimated that there are 26,000 Nicaraguan exiles in Honduras, most of them in refugee camps along the border. They include 5,000 former members of the national guard under President Anastasio Somoza Debayle. They escaped after the Sandinists drove the President into exile in July 1979. The exiles also include 15,000 Miskito, Sumo and Rama Indians who fled to Honduras after Nicaragua put them out of their villages on the Caribbean coast. **********Honduras has repeatedly denied that the Nicaraguan guerrillas operate from its territory, and the United States has refused to answer Nicaragua's charges that it arms, trains and otherwise supports them. **********The Reagan Administration cut off all United States aid to Nicaragua in 1981, charging that the Sandinists were aiding the guerrillas in El Salvador. **********The anti-Government Nicaraguan guerrillas are said to have formed a crescent of outposts in northwestern Nicaragua.  Government spokesmen said last week that the exiles had been infiltrating Nicaragua in small contingents.  Defense Minister Humberto Ortega termed their action ''not serious'' but said their intent was to provoke confrontations that might lead to war with Honduras. **********In a statement covering what it denounced as ''aggressions against Nicaragua'' in January and February, the Government said the first occurred Jan. 16 when, it said, 60 guerrillas attacked more than 200 farm workers, killing 2 children and wounding 14 others. **********Other attacks in January, it said, included ambushes of trucks and other vehicles, attacks on farms and a border port.

It is expected to save taxpayers $30 billion over the next 12 months. **********Paychecks will start to look different in the next week or two as employers adjust withholding to reflect the final 10 percent cut in income tax rates. The extra take-home pay is expected to stimulate consumer spending and the nation's economic recovery in the second half of this year. **********Amounts Involved **********In most cases, the reduction in withholding will be about 10 percent. For single taxpayers, the increase in weekly take-home pay will run from 10 cents (for those earning $82 a week) to a maximum of $16.20. **********For married taxpayers, the weekly withholding reduction will run from 20 cents (for those earning $140 a week) to a maximum of $21.60. The maximums apply to single taxpayers with salaries over $35,000 a year and married taxpayers with salaries over $50,000 a year. **********For most families and single people, however, the extra amount in their paychecks will be not much more than $2 to $7 a week. The Third Stage **********The first stage of the reduction in individuals' income tax rates was a 5 percent cut on Oct. 1, 1981. The second was a 10 percent cut on July 1, 1982. Now comes the final cut of 10 percent. Although the three steps add up to 25 percent, the overall reduction is actually about 23 percent, because the cuts in the second and third years are on a lowered rate. **********''The tax cut is one of the reasons to be optimistic in the second half of the year,'' said Martin S. Feldstein, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, who just this week supported upward revision of the Administration's economic forecast. **********Walter W. Heller, who was chairman of the council in the Kennedy Administration and a sometime opponent of the tax cut, said ''it is one more element in the consumer reawakening'' that is propelling the economic recovery. **********The expectations for this final installment of the tax cut are much higher than those for the 10 percent cut that was effective last July 1. At that time high interest rates, a rising unemployment rate and the wary mood of consumers combined to offset the stimulus. High interest rates made houses and cars too expensive, and the gloomy outlook for the economy made people want to hold onto their cash. Questions About Effects **********But Mr. Feldstein, Mr. Heller and other economists say the tax-rate cut won't result in a sudden economic spurt. They say they have already factored the tax cuts into their earlier forecasts of growth in the economy this year at a slightly lower rate than the average in the early months of previous recoveries from recessions. **********Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of Chase Econometrics, an economic consulting firm, doesn't think the tax cut is so vital. ''If there were no tax cut on July 1, this recovery would continue,'' he said, ''and at only a slightly slower pace.'' **********Mr. Chimerine added: ''To the extent that we are getting more consumer spending from the tax cut, and we will, we will lose some of the stimulus because the tax cut means higher deficits and higher interest rates. So the net stimulative effect is there but it is not extremely large.'' **********Some consumers may have been spending the tax cut in advance, according to Robert Ortner, the chief economist at the Commerce Department. He said that a rise in retail sales in March, April and May could have been reflected anticipation of the July increase in takehome pay. What Consumers Will Do **********Mr. Ortner reflects the Administration's hope that the consumer will spend, rather than save, most of the tax cut when he says: ''Consumers are already spending the money, and they need the tax cut to continue. The economy needs it. The unemployment rate needs it.'' **********This exhortation to spend is a far cry from the call for increased savings that was the rationale of the President's supply-side economics when he pushed for enactment of the three-year across-theboard tax cut in 1981. **********Mr. Heller, noting the change, said the recovery was now being propelled by ''good old demand management,'' the kind of stimulative economic policy that President Reagan said he wanted to get away from. **********Mr. Feldstein agreed, but he said that the reduction in tax rates would spur work incentives and savings in the future. Overall Data **********Including the first phase of the tax cut on Oct. 1, 1981, the maximum decline in weekly withholding now comes to about $40 for single people earning about $35,000 or more and about $44 for married people earning more than $50,000. **********The reason that the withholding stops at a maximum of $16.20 for single taxpayers and $21.60 for married taxpayers is that the maximum withholding rate remains unchanged at 37 percent, as it did a year ago. This means that single people with salaries above $35,000 and married people with salaries above $50,000 do not get a full 10 percent reduction in their withholding. **********Treasury officials said that the 37 percent withholding rate was not being reduced because people at these income levels are already under-withheld since tax rates go as high as 50 percent of adjusted gross income. But people at this level can increase their take-home pay by an additional amount by increasing the number of allowances or exemptions they claim. **********There will also be a group of lower income people in the bottom income tax bracket - under $10,000 for married taxpayers and under $5,000 for single taxpayers - who will get no reduction in their withholding this July. **********According to the Treasury Department, these people got the full three-year reduction withholding a year ago when their new withholding rate was rounded down to avoid a fraction. In other words, a year ago their withholding tax was cut more than 10 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/26/world/south-african-visits-europe.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 60, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "South African Visits Europe", "print_headline": "South African Visits Europe", "body_text": " **********Foreign Minister Roelof F.

Trade in Services Off, Too **********And nonmerchandise trade is not helping any. For years, the country relied on gains from other international business activities, such as banking, insurance and travel services, to compensate for shortfalls in the export of goods. But that advantage, too, has faded, widening the overall deficit in the balance of payments. **********Robert J. Ortner, the Commerce Department's chief economist, said the deficit on this overall basis, which is known as the current account, could reach $25 billion this year, far exceeding the record current account deficit of $15 billion in 1978. **********''It certainly looks alarming,'' he added.  ''With the recovery under way, we don't want to delude ourselves that the problem will go away,'' said Patricia E. Barrett, director of trade policy at the New York-based National Foreign Trade Council, an association of leading trade-oriented businesses. ''Indications are it's going to get worse before it gets better.'' **********The principal cause of the merchandise trade deficit is the strong dollar, which makes imports a bargain in American stores and American goods more expensive for shoppers abroad. But there are other aggravations as well. **********These include the financial plight of the developing countries, the slow pace of recovery in Europe, the deteriorating finances of oilexporting countries, the bountiful crops in food-exporting countries and an increasingly aggressive international competition for sales. **********And oil imports could become a problem again. As the recovery strengthens, American industries, utilities and automobiles are burning more fuel, and according to the Department of Energy, imports have risen from 3.4 million barrels a day in January to 4.3 million for the week ended July 1. **********Last year, the United States recorded a merchandise trade deficit of $42.7 billion, slightly larger than the previous record, set in 1978, of $42.4 billion. Current Account Deficit **********The surplus normally recorded by trade in services has often offset the merchandise deficits in the overall, or current account, calculation. But after showing surpluses in 1980 and 1981, the current account had a deficit of $11 billion last year. ''It's a leakage of business activity. The growth in demand in this country is being met by foreign sources,'' Mr. Ortner said. **********Deficits and surpluses in trade were once unimportant to the United States, a country that through most of its history could depend on its vast internal market for growth. But in the past 20 years, foreign industries have discovered that vast market, too, while American industry was less successful in developing foreign markets. **********Mr. Ortner, of the Commerce Department, said American exports represent 8 percent of the country's total output of goods and services, almost twice the level of 1970. ''If you go beyond the industries that actually export goods, to all the other industries that support them, that figure could more than double,'' he said. **********All those industries represent jobs. A Commerce Department study says that export-related employment fell from 6.2 million jobs in 1980 to 4.9 million in 1982, a drop that represented 40 percent of all the American jobs lost in the two years. The weaker trade performance is a major reason why the overall unemployment rate, 9.8 percent in June, is considered unlikely to fall below the 6 percent that the Government now considers the rock-bottom level in a strong economy. The Lofty Dollar **********Most executives and economists single out the dollar as the chief reason for the weakness of American exports. ''The British pound is down 35 or 40 percent against the dollar,'' said Thomas A. Holmes, chairman of the Ingersoll-Rand Company, a leading American exporter of compressors, pumps, mining equipment, oil drilling equipment and other gear. **********''That differential means we have to drop our prices by that much or raise our productivity by that much,'' he said. ''This is a major problem for us. It has taken us 100 years to gain our positions in these countries, and we're not anxious to abdicate them.'' **********To compete, Mr. Holmes said, an American manufacturer has to buy more and more parts for equipment abroad, with strong dollars, to close the currency differential. **********Most economists attribute the dollar's strength to the Federal budget deficits, now running at up to $200 billion annually. They contend that the deficits force the Treasury to compete with consumers and industrial borrowers for funds. With more demand for dollars, their cost - interest rates - has to rise. **********The higher interest rates, in turn, lure foreigners to sell their currencies and buy dollar investments, easing demand for those currencies and putting a premium on the dollar. **********Even without the dollar problem, American industry is hard put to find foreign customers.  Walter K. Joelson, chief economist at the General Electric Company, said even the oil-producing countries offered little promise.  Nigeria, Venezuela and Indonesia have all but ceased their ambitious development plans, with the drop in oil prices. **********Europe is beginning to recover from the world recession, which in normal times would signal a revival of European purchases of American goods. But many economists expect nothing more than a tepid recovery there. Hard-Pressed Customers **********In addition, Mr. Joelson said, European nations have record unemployment, while their governments face constraints on spending to create jobs. So Europe, like the United States, looks to the third world to provide business for its industries. **********Many of the developing countries are big borrowers from the West.  But because of the recession and other factors, some have had to reschedule their debt payments and promise to cut spending of hardto-get Western currencies on imports. **********Now there is a new restraint, said Lionel H. Olmer, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade. Normally, an American company would go to its bank for 120-day supplier credits, or loans, to give a foreign customer to help it make the purchase. **********''Supplier credits probably accounted for half our trade with Mexico,'' he said. But now banks have become reluctant to extend the credits, he said, and the loans ''have slowed down to a trickle.'' **********Such restraints have had a telling effect on trade. Mr. Olmer said that Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela bought 40 percent less in American goods during the first four months of this year than in the first four months in 1982. **********In addition, Mr. Olmer said, with import restrictions, the developing nations can buy only those goods essential to their survival, energy and food. He said: ''That means they're not going to import capital goods, like machinery and aircraft. And what do we export? Capital goods.'' **********Such restrictions are showing signs of becoming counterproductive.  ''Mexico,'' Mr. Olmer said, ''has done a dramatic job in stopping imports, but that's beginning to have an effect on its ability to export, because they can't buy the commodities they need to make goods for export.'' **********These problems, Mr. Olmer thinks, are probably transitory. But other problems are likely to linger. World markets have become vastly more competitive, said Dean D. Thornton, a vice president for marketing at the Boeing Company in Seattle. **********''There's been a fundamental change,'' Mr. Thornton said. ''U.S.  commercial aircraft manufacturers dominated the world market. They made well over 90 percent of the world's jets. There were three companies - Boeing, Lockheed and Douglas. The only question was which one got the sales.'' **********Then, he said, France, West Germany and Britain collaborated in the formation of Airbus Industrie, now a leading competitor.

The couple, part of a group that had been touring Soviet Central Asia, declined to give their names. ''No sense in having people worry,'' the doctor said. **********The main concern for many Westerners was whether Aeroflot would accept their tickets for rerouted journeys aboard the Soviet carrier and other airlines still flying.

Like the travelers affected by the rejection of American tickets on Wednesday, the travelers were told they would have to buy new tickets from Aeroflot, paying with cash or credit cards, and claiming refunds on their original tickets later. **********The action against holders of United States airline tickets was originally explained by an Aeroflot spokesman as retaliation for restrictions imposed on Aeroflot this week by the United States Civil Aeronautics Board, which acted at President Reagan's request."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/01/world/reagan-to-block-f-16-s-till-israel-leaves-lebanon-transcript-of-speech-page-a8.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1983-04-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 894, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Transcript of speech, page A8.", "print_headline": "REAGAN TO BLOCK F-16'S TILL ISRAEL LEAVES LEBANON; Transcript of speech, page A8.", "body_text": " **********President Reagan said today that until Israel withdraws its forces from Lebanon, he will not permit the transfer of some 75 F-16 fighter jets that have been held up since last summer. **********''We are forbidden by law to release those planes,'' Mr. Reagan said.  He implied, but did not state explicitly, that Israel had violated the terms of an arms supply agreement with the United States stating that American military equipment can be used only for defensive purposes. Under the Arms Export Act, the President has discretionary authority to cut off military sales to any nation found in substantial violation of such an agreement. **********The President's remarks were in response to questions after a televised speech in Los Angeles that was devoted to arms control. In the speech he offered his most extensive critique to date of the proposal in Congress for a nuclear freeze resolution. **********Mr. Reagan appealed to supporters of the measure to put aside ''partisan politics'' and unite behind his Administration's arms control proposals to the Soviet Union. (Page A8.) **********The President's comments on Israel caught the State Department by surprise, since for eight months the Administration has refrained from saying Israel had violated the agreement by its invasion of Lebanon. In addition, officials have declined to give a reason for delaying the release of the F-16's to Israel. **********Some concern was expressed that Israel might react strongly to Mr.  Reagan's comments and prove more recalcitrant in the negotiations now going on over its withdrawal from Lebanon. **********Mr. Reagan said the effort to bring about the withdrawal of Israeli, Syrian and Palestine Liberation Organization forces from Lebanon had been ''a frustrating experience.'' Until this is achieved, he said, it is impossible to proceed ''with the general subject of overall peace.'' **********Philip C. Habib, Mr. Reagan's special envoy to the Middle East, was on his way back to the United States today after another round of inconclusive talks. And Yasir Arafat, the head of the P.L.O., arrived in Amman for talks with King Hussein of Jordan that are supposed to be crucial to whether the King goes along with Mr. Reagan's call for expanding the Middle East peace negotiations. Some officials have said that King Hussein will not agree to enter the talks until Israel agrees to terms for pulling out of Lebanon. A Previous Delivery Delayed **********After Israel bombed an Iraqi nuclear reactor in the summer of 1981, Mr. Reagan held up delivery of fourteen F-16's and two F-15's, informing Congress that Israel might have violated an arms sales agreement. But on Aug. 17, 1981, the delivery was allowed after a new cease-fire and discussions with Israeli officials. **********In June 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon and carried out repeated air attacks on Beirut and other locations. Without any formal notification to Congress, the Administration held up the delivery of the 75 F-16's now at issue. The official reason given was that the delivery required a Presidential authorization. **********Privately, officials said then that the planes would not be released as long as Israel was attacking targets in Lebanon with American planes. But the planes were not released even after the fighting stopped. Matter Was 'Under Review' **********As questions were raised on Capitol Hill and elsewhere as to whether Israel had violated United States law and agreements in using American equipment in Lebanon, the State Department said only that the matter was ''under review.'' **********More recently, however, the Pentagon went ahead with the sale of Sidewinder missiles to Israel and Israel agreed to share with the United States intelligence information gathered from the war in Lebanon, particularly its success against Soviet-made aircraft and anti-aircraft missile systems. **********The Israelis, arguing that the installation of Soviet-made SA-5 antiaircraft missiles in Syria had increased their need for more planes, have requested the release of the 75 F-16's. Officials have said that Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger has argued against turning the planes over before Israel pulls out of Lebanon. 'Letting Lebanon Be Lebanon' **********Mr. Reagan was asked in Los Angeles today why the planes were not released, given the Soviet buildup in Syria. He replied, ''You must realize that under the law - the law exists now - those weapons must be for defensive purposes, and this is, again, one of the obstacles presented by the stalemate in Lebanon. **********''While those forces are in the position of occupying another country that now has asked them to leave, we are forbidden by law to release those planes,'' he said. ''They're F-16's, the planes that are on order. And it's as simple as the other forces returning to their own countries and letting Lebanon be Lebanon.'' **********Mr. Reagan also said, ''Israel can only know real security if it doesn't have to remain an armed camp far beyond what its size warrants.'' **********He said it should ''know the security of being surrounded by neighbors that recognize its right to exist as a nation and have signed peace treaties with it.'' He said the goal of his Middle East policy was ''to create more Egypts,'' or Arab states that would live in peace with Israel."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/03/world/around-the-world-arafat-criticizes-west-at-geneva-conference.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arafat Criticizes West At Geneva Conference", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Arafat Criticizes West At Geneva Conference", "body_text": " **********Yasir Arafat, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, criticized the United States and other Western countries today for not taking part in the United Nations conference here on Palestinian rights. **********Mr. Arafat, speaking at the conference, said the nonparticipating countries had refused to ''meet their responsibilities,'' and he asked the 134 nations present to take all the action required to assure Palestinians a ''just peace and the right to live in dignity in their homeland.'' **********The United States and Israel are boycotting the session on the ground that its sponsors wanted it only as a platform for ''one-sided judgments'' in support of the P.L.O.

The sources said Purolator Inc. would handle courier deliveries. **********MCI officials, while acknowledging that the company would announce a data communications service Tuesday, declined to provide details. But the company has made little secret of its desire to expand beyond voice communications into fast-growing data communications. **********Analysts said MCI would make a strong entry because of its reputation for going after the highest-volume markets first, offering low prices and marketing services with savvy. **********''I think they will put an incredible amount of price pressure on the couriers and an incredible amount of service pressure on Western Union,'' said Paris Burstyn of the Yankee Group, a telecommunications consulting and market research firm in Boston. **********In entering the field, MCI will face a host of entrenched competitors.  Companies such as the GTE Corporation's Telenet and Tymshare's Tymnet already offer computer-to- computer communications. Western Union's Mailgram and the Postal Service's E-COM service deliver printed messages generated by computer. And Federal Express, the leader in the overnight document delivery business, is moving into electronic delivery, probably through facsimile transmission. Market Is Put at $1 Billion **********Stephen A. Caswell, editor of Electronic Mail and Message Systems, a trade publication, said that there were numerous competitors in the electronic message market, which he put at $1 billion, including telex service. Despite the competition, he said, the quality of MCI's management should give the company an edge. **********Analysts noted that a data service would help MCI to better utilize the communications lines it already has in place for its long distance service. **********Sources said that MCI had an agreement with the Dow Jones News Retrieval Service, a leading provider of computerized information services. The Dow Jones service's subscribers will automatically be able to use MCI's electronic mail service. **********To use the MCI mail service, customers would tie into a special MCI data communications network that the company had built by Bolt Beranek & Newman, a Cambridge, Mass., communications concern. It is believed that there would be local connections to the network in 35 cities and toll-free numbers for those outside the cities. **********The messages could then go through the network to the recipient's terminal if the recipient also subscribed to the service. If not, the messages could be printed at one of 15 printing centers set up by MCI.  Sources said the company would charge on the basis of what it calls MCI Mail ''ounces,'' with an ounce being 7,500 characters, or three or four pages of text. Sending a message directly from one computer to another will cost $1 an ounce; sending to a printing center for onward delivery by first-class mail would cost $2 for the first ''ounce.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/20/world/cypriots-debate-us-use-of-base-for-beirut-force.html": {"writer_name": "Judith Miller", "pub_date": "1983-11-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 915, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CYPRIOTS DEBATE U.S. USE OF BASE FOR BEIRUT FORCE", "print_headline": "CYPRIOTS DEBATE U.S. USE OF BASE FOR BEIRUT FORCE", "body_text": " **********The United States is using Cyprus's largest civilian airport to supply American troops in Lebanon, prompting opposition within the Cypriot Government. **********The operation is well known on Cyprus, but apparently has not attracted much attention elsewhere. **********Spyros Kyprianou, the Greek Cypriot President of Cyprus, has so far resisted demands by the Communist Party, a partner in his coalition Government, to curtail the Americans' use of Larnaca Airport in addition to Britain's use of one of its bases on Cyprus to supply contingents of the international force in Beirut. **********Several Western diplomats and military officials here said that pressure against the supply operations could increase if the four-nation force's stay in Lebanon became prolonged or if a cease-fire there collapsed and the political situation deteriorated. **********Political Strains on Cyprus **********In addition, some analysts said the Turkish Cypriots' decision of last Tuesday to declare their northern third of Cyprus a sovereign, independent state could eventually jeopardize the use of Larnaca. Political strains could develop, officials said, if Cyprus pressed the United States to use economic sanctions and tougher measures against the Turkish Cypriot state and nations that recognize it. **********The United States is unlikely to support sanctions against Turkey, which, like Greece, is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and a strategically located ally. As a result, the officials said, Greek Cypriots might be tempted to withdraw permission to use Larnaca, which is on the Greek side of the island. **********The United States has had the supply operation here for more than a year. **********In August 1982 the Reagan Administration entered an agreement with the Cypriot Government to permit the use of Larnaca Airport for sending military personnel, mail and such general cargo as food and medicine through Cyprus to Lebanon. Officials said both Governments had assumed that the force's stay in Lebanon would be short and, therefore, that the supply operation would be temporary. **********Now, 15 months later, the number of American servicemen in Beirut has grown from 1,200 to about 2,000 at times and cargo shipments from Cyprus involve about seven or eight flights a day. The flights are by fixed-wing C-130 and C-141 transport planes, which land at Beirut airport, near the Marine outpost in Lebanon. Also flying from Cyprus are some helicopters that carry cargo to and from Navy warships off the coast of Lebanon. **********In September, described as a ''banner month'' for Larnaca, 650 flights carrying 1.25 million pounds of cargo and more than 900 military passengers left the Cyprus airport bound for Lebanon, according to American figures. **********Larnaca and one of the British bases were also used to transport wounded marines to hospitals on Cyprus and elsewhere in Europe after the suicide bombing attack last month on French and American forces in Beirut.   Could Get Along Without It **********Military officials say that if Larnaca were not available, cargo would probably have to be sent through Suda Bay, in Crete, and probably by sea. Greece, another site of American bases, has refused to allow any support - even permission to overfly the country - for the international force in Lebanon, American officials said. **********''We could get along without Larnaca,'' an American military spokesman here said, ''but supply would be far more costly and far slower.'' **********Military experts extimated that the United States has spent slightly more than $1 million on fuel, landing and parking fees at Larnaca. **********Western diplomats said the United States had adopted a very ''low key'' approach to its use of the airport. American military personnel, for example, are required to use a back entrance to the airport that is closed to the public. The American Embassy in Nicosia has issued no publicity about the use of the airport. **********American Embassy officials discuss Larnaca at least once every four or six weeks with Cypriot counterparts, who are kept ''promptly and fully informed'' of transport activities, American officials said. **********Still, the Communist Party's opposition to the supply operations has prompted the Cypriot Government to insist that the United States not use Larnaca to provide any type of support to the Lebanese Army or to any other faction in Lebanon other than occasional shipments for the French and Italian contingents.   Radio Request Rejected **********The Cypriot Government also recently rejected an American request to install special radio antenna at the airport to improve communication between air controllers and pilots of cargo planes. The Cypriot Government feared that this would create an impression that the use of Larnaca was permanent, a Western official said. **********Britain's supply of its 110-man force in Beirut is provided through Akrotiri, one of its two sovereign bases here where about 10,000 British servicemen and dependents are stationed. Because the British retain sovereignty over the bases under the 1960 agreements that gave Cyprus its independence, they can use the bases at they choose, a spokesman said. Given local opposition to continued British presence here, however, Britain, too, has kept Cypriot officials ''fully informed'' of activities on the bases, the spokesman added. **********A few months ago, a British decision to permit Italy to station fighter planes at Akrotiri for protection of the Italian contingent in Lebanon touched off a major political debate here. It was defused when Italy announced that tension in Lebanon had lessened and the planes were no longer needed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/02/world/official-ties-cuba-to-us-drug-traffic.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-05-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 391, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OFFICIAL TIES CUBA TO U.S. DRUG TRAFFIC", "print_headline": "OFFICIAL TIES CUBA TO U.S. DRUG TRAFFIC", "body_text": " **********Lawrence S.

That depends on how one defines realism.  As the term is used by modern writers and artists, realism means looking at life as it is, without being visionary or idealistic.  Thus, an ashcan is an ashcan, a jobless worker is a jobless worker, not a heroic, if drafted, soldier in the fight against inflation. The President now, realistically, sees a string of deficits in the $200 billion to $300 billion class stretching far into the future unless painful surgery on the budget is performed; once, he envisioned a balanced budget, first in the current, 1983 fiscal year, then in the 1984 fiscal year. **********But, as used in philosophy, realism is also the doctrine that abstractions are objectively actual. This was opposed to the medieval doctrine of nominalism, which held that all universal or abstract terms, such as ''justice'' or ''government,'' were mere necessities of thought or conveniences of language, and therefore existed as names only. **********President Reagan appears, oddly enough, to be a realist in both the medieval and modern senses. In the medieval sense, he praised his Civil Rights Commission as ''an ongoing part of the struggle for justice'' and sent the Democrats into wild applause by asserting that government ''must take the lead in restoring the economy,'' a doctrine that appeared to contrast sharply with his earlier, apparently nominalist position that ''government is not the solution.'' **********However, the President might be defended against the charge of having switched from nominalism to realism by pointing out that what he actually said was ''we in government,'' presumably referring to himself, Vice President Bush, Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger and other actual people who would lead the economy out of the recession, rather than referring to the abstraction of ''government.'' Hence his statement may not have been philosophically ''realistic.'' **********The heart of the economic issue is whether the Reagan team has set forth a program that, both nominally and realistically, can restore prosperity. The economic assumptions underlying the President's budget projections are that ''nominal'' gross national product will rise 6.7 percent in 1983 and 9.4 percent in 1984, while ''real'' G.N.P. is forecast to rise only 1.4 percent in 1983 and 3.9 percent in 1984. In economics, ''nominal'' means ''without correcting for inflation,'' and ''real'' means ''after correcting for inflation.'' **********Such slow rates of real growth imply a very slow decline of unemployment. In fact, unemployment, which averaged 9.7 percent in 1982 (and wound up the year at 10.8 percent), is expected to average 10.7 percent in 1983 and 9.9 percent in 1984, a Presidential election year. **********The Democrats and even many Republicans may be unable to contemplate such awful numbers or the longer-term economic projections. The Administration foresees an increase in real G.N.P.  of 4 percent a year from 1985 through 1988. And it forecasts that inflation, as measured by the G.N.P. deflator, will decline from 4.9 percent in 1985 to 4.4 percent in 1988. **********At those rates of growth in real G.N.P., the Administration projects unemployment at 9.1 percent in 1985, 8.2 percent in 1986, 7.4 percent in 1987 and 6.6 percent in 1988. And, based on its ''cautious'' economic assumptions, the Administration derives the huge ''baseline'' budget deficits it foresees if Congress does not give the President the savings proposed in his fiscal 1984 budget. **********Those baseline deficits are projected to climb to $231 billion in the fiscal year 1984. Then they will climb to $253 billion, $271 billion, $292 billion and finally to $300 billion by the fiscal year 1988 - a total of $1,347,000,000,000 - doubling in five years the national debt contracted over 207 years of United States history. The President's proposed savings would cut that five-year, $1.3 trillion increase in the national debt to a mere $790 billion. **********A stronger recovery would also scale back the prospective deficits. A rate of real economic growth greater than now forecast, the Administration estimates, would shrink the deficit $20 billion a year, leaving a $90 billion deficit in 1988. **********And a further increase of 1.33 percent in real G.N.P. in each of the next five years would result in a balanced budget by 1988. But that would necessitate real growth's averaging an historically high 6.33 percent from 1985 through 1988. **********An alternative route to balancing the budget would be through a faster rise in nominal G.N.P., even with no greater rise in real G.N.P. But since that spells inflation, neither Republicans nor Democrats dare consider it; there are limits to both nominalism and realism. Yet, whatever the formally stated philosophies, with such levels of unemployment and deficit in prospect, inflation could happen as a phenomenon of political nature."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/30/world/reagan-presses-moscow-on-missiles.html": {"writer_name": "Hedrick Smith", "pub_date": "1983-10-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 624, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REAGAN PRESSES MOSCOW ON MISSILES", "print_headline": "REAGAN PRESSES MOSCOW ON MISSILES", "body_text": " **********President Reagan invited the Soviet Union today to present its newest arms proposals officially in Geneva and called on Moscow ''finally to negotiate seriously'' on limiting medium-range nuclear missiles. **********With several American proposals already made at Geneva and barely more than a month before American medium-range missile deployments in Europe are to begin, the President contended that ''all of the elements for a mutually advantageous agreement are on the table.'' **********''The Soviet Union has now advanced some additional proposals of its own,'' he said in his weekly Saturday radio broadcast. ''We will study these proposals and will address them in the talks in Geneva.'' **********Other senior Administration officials said that proposals publicly suggested by Yuri V. Andropov, the Soviet leader, in a Pravda interview on Wednesday have not been put forward officially by Soviet negotiators in Geneva. Mr. Andropov offered to accept a total of 140 missiles in the European theater, a somewhat lower total than previously; a limit on deployments of SS-20 missiles in the Far East, and flexibility on a ceiling on nuclear-armed bombers.   No New Proposals The President's broadcast contained no new proposals or hints of any potential diplomatic breakthrough in the arms talks. **********Both Mr. Andropov's move and the President's response today, which highlighted a decision Thursday by Atlantic alliance defense ministers to remove 1,400 short-rage tactical nuclear weapons in Europe over the next five years, seemed intended partly to influence European public opinion in the final weeks before the American missile are scheduled for deployment. **********In the face of Mr. Andropov's threat to halt the medium-range missile negotiations once the American deployments begin, Mr. Reagan asserted, ''We will stay at the negotiating table for as long as necessary to achieve such an agreement.'' **********Other Senior Administration officials pointed out that for the last two years the Geneva talks have continued while the Soviet Union was deploying more SS-20 missiles aimed at Western Europe and charged that it was unreasonable for Moscow to break off the talks when American deployments began. **********In the tone of his comments, the President seemed intent on underscoring the possibility for agreement, although some American officials and many Europeans have become skeptical. But Mr. Reagan did point to the main remaining problem: Moscow's insistence that the United States forgo deploying any missiles.   NATO Reduction Emphasized **********''Unfortunately, the Soviet proposals permit them to retain SS-20 missiles while not allowing NATO to deploy its own,'' Mr. Reagan said. **********His main emphasis, however, was on the approval of the plan to dismantle and destroy 1,400 short-range tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. **********''This step stands in stark contrast to the actions of the Soviet Union,'' Mr. Reagan said. Once this step is carried out, he said, the United States will have reduced its European nuclear arsenal by one-third since 1979. In that period, he contended, Moscow has added more than 200 SS-20 missiles, carrying 600 warheads. **********''The comparison of Soviet actions with NATO's reductions and restraint clearly illustrates, once again, that the so-called arms race has only participant - the Soviet Union,'' he said. **********Administration officials said the President had decided to stress the NATO decision as a way of rebutting public criticism that the Administration was participating in a ''mindless piling up of arms.'' **********''After this reduction is completed, we will have fewer nuclear weapons in Europe than at any time in the last 20 years,'' one American official said. **********In 1979, orders were given to reduce the American arsenal of nuclear warheads from 7,000 to 6,000 by retiring some of the older tactical weapons.

Yesterday, the nation's main arbiter in such matters made it official: The recession ended late last fall. **********The National Bureau of Economic Research - a private, nonprofit research organization whose pronouncements on economic booms and busts are considered the final word by many economists - announced that the trough of the downturn came last November. **********The recession began in July 1981, the bureau said, making the 16-month slowdown one of the longest two of the nine recessions since World War II. The other 16-month recession ran from November 1973 to March 1975. **********''We think of the economy as being cyclical - that is, as having business cycles,'' said Donna L. Zerwitz, a spokesman for the bureau's Business Cycle Dating Committee, a group of leading forecasters who met Thursday night. ''The trough of the most recent cycle occurred in November.'' **********What some say is noteworthy about the bureau's declaration is that it differs from the consensus among leading economists. Many, including some in the Administration, think the economy touched bottom last December or January. **********Why the difference?  ''The economy still appeared to be weak in December and into 1983,'' said Allen Sinai, a senior economist at Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass., forecasting concern. ''The recovery was so narrowly based that it didn't show up in a broad-based way in a lot of statistics.'' **********Miss Zerwitz ascribed the difference to the various ways in which the bureau and outside economists gauge the economy.  The selection of November as the trough reflected what the bureau called the ''central tendency'' of some vital economic statistics to turn around either just before, during or after November. **********Real personal income, for example, and sales by manufacturers and in the trade sector both touched bottom in October. Industrial production and hours worked both reached their low point in November. In December, employment among nonfarm workers bottomed out, and unemployment peaked at 10.8 percent. **********In a purely statistical sense, the most recent downturn has been less severe than the typical post-World War II recession. On average, real gross national product, the value of goods made and services supplied after adjustment for inflation, has declined 2.8 percent in post-war slumps from the peak to the trough, compared with 1.1 percent in the recent recession. Industrial production, which on average has slid 11.4 percent, was down 7.6 percent this recession. **********But Mr. Sinai of Data Resources said the numbers understate the severity of the recent downturn because, unlike other dips, this recession was caused by extremely high interest rates that nearly crushed key industries that depend on credit, and thus some key industries such as automobiles, housing and home appliances suffered much more than the average. In addition, Mr. Sinai said, the recent slump followed almost immediately on the heels of another recession, a six-month downturn in 1979-80. **********When considered together, Mr. Sinai said, the recessions of 1979-80 and 1981-82 represent the worst economic decline in the United States since the Great Depression. **********''It really was, in many parts of America, a depression,'' Mr.  Sinai said. ''The fallout in terms of unemployment, business failures and failures of financial institutions devastated industries and whole geographic areas of the country. It was without precedent since the 1930's.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/28/business/ecuador-debt-talks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 52, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ecuador Debt Talks", "print_headline": "Ecuador Debt Talks", "body_text": " **********Ecuador's President, Osvaldo Hurtado, will hold talks with creditor banks this week in New York on his country's foreign debt, the Foreign Ministry said today.

The report has been challenged by some American employees here. **********The report, ''Americans at the U.N.: An Endangered Species,'' was published Feb. 13 by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington research group. The report's author, Juliana Geran Pilon, suggested that the decline in the American share of professional posts here, from 14.6 percent in 1972 to 12.6 percent today, made it more difficult to deal with anti-American stands. **********''Almost constantly outvoted in the General Assembly and in nearly every U.N. agency, the U.S. is also deprived of sufficient control of the administrative and policy posts to ameliorate the U.N.'s anti-U.S. and anti-Western pronouncements and resolutions,'' Mrs.  Pilon wrote. **********In 1972, Americans held 925 of the 6,333 professional posts in the Secretariat. In 1982, Americans held 984 of the 7,790 posts. 'You Can't Tell From a List' **********Asked for comment, many Americans working in the Secretariat took issue with Mrs. Pilon's conclusions.  Jay Long, principal officer in the office of William B. Buffum, the Under Secretary General for Political and General Assembly Affairs, said: ''I don't share the view that the influence of Americans has declined in the Secretariat. You can't tell from a list who influences whom or who has the ear of the Secretary General. Some of his closest advisers are American, and the same can't be said of - what shall I call them - our opposite numbers.'' **********Mrs. Pilon commented in a telephone interview, ''Americans are highly respected, but that does not translate into United States influence.'' Noting that Mr. Buffum, the highest ranking American on the United Nations staff, is an Under Secretary General, she said his ''post is far less significant'' than a similar one occupied by Ralph Bunche in the 1960's. **********Other officials here objected to Mrs. Pilon's statement that the United States was isolated and almost always outvoted in the General Assembly. **********One recalled that the chief United States delegate, Jeane J.  Kirkpatrick, said at a news conference in December that the United States had won some victories in the last General Assembly session, among them the rejection of an attempt to expel Israel. He said there was ''no correlation between the numbers of Americans working and the control or influence they exert.'' One Reason for Decline **********Several American officials here noted that the United Nations had tripled in size since its founding and said this meant the United States share of staff positions had to decline. **********Bradford Morse, the director of the United Nations Development Program, said, ''The question is not American influence but the influence of individual American officials who are international civil servants operating under the U.N. Charter.'' **********Another American official said he was pleased by the publication of Mrs. Pilon's report and its call on the United States ''to pay attention to the staffing of international organizations.'' He said the United States had ''a great deal at stake.'' **********Mrs. Pilon's report also touched on the percentage of Americans employed as officials in some specialized United Nations agencies based in Europe, saying it was smaller than the 12.6 percent in the Secretariat. She said it did not rise above 12 percent in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization or the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. **********At two offices in New York, however, a higher percentage of Americans was reported. James P. Grant, the executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund, said, ''The United States makes up more than 17 percent of my staff.'' Mr. Morse, the director of the Development Program, said his agency had 110 Americans on its professional staff of 580, or nearly 19 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/25/world/death-toll-in-japan-is-now-75-from-flooding-and-mudslides.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 77, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Death Toll in Japan Is Now 75 From Flooding and Mudslides", "print_headline": "Death Toll in Japan Is Now 75 From Flooding and Mudslides", "body_text": " **********The number of dead from flooding and mudslides in southwestern Honshu climbed to 75 today with the discovery of more bodies under mounds of mud caused by heavy rains and landslides, the police said. **********The National Police Agency said Shimane prefecture, 380 miles southwest of Tokyo, was the hardest hit area.

The first batch, of 9 Pershings in West Germany and 64 cruise missiles in both Britain and Italy, is being installed under a schedule to last through the end of 1988. **********The white paper repeated a pledge that the alliance would ''halt, modify or reverse deployments'' if an agreement on equality could be reached with the Russians."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/18/business/langley-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-jan-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 34, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LANGLEY CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 31", "print_headline": "LANGLEY CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/10/world/salvadoran-train-blown-up.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Salvadoran Train Blown Up", "print_headline": "Salvadoran Train Blown Up", "body_text": " **********A force of about 300 left-wing guerrillas ambushed and blew up a freight train today in central San Vicente Province, 30 miles from San Salvador, military sources said.

It reflects the severe impact of the recession on Western's multitude of telephone and telecommunications products. It also reflects a desire to make the company more efficient as A.T.& T.  moves into a competitive arena, stripped of the 22 local telephone company subsidiaries that have long purchased almost all of the equipment produced by Western. **********A.T.& T. said the Kearny plant would be closed in stages, probably over a two- to three-year period. In addition, 2,300 jobs are to be eliminated at Western Electric's Baltimore Works, which employs about 4,800, along with 400 out of 4,400 jobs at the Hawthorne Works in Cicero, Ill. **********The three plants are Western Electric's oldest, and the jobs to be eliminated represent 5 percent of the company's workforce.  ''The decision was related to the fact that our utilization was dropping as a result of the recession and some of the technology changes, and as we looked to the future, we couldn't see anything that would improve it,'' Paul Zweier, Western's senior executive vice president, said in an interview. **********He explained that as recently as 1979, Western was using 90 percent to 100 percent of its plant space and machinery, a ratio that has plummeted to about 60 percent. And he noted that demand for most Western products has fallen 30 to 35 percent since 1979. **********''It becomes a serious corporate problem when you have a lot of corporate investment and corporate machinery that isn't being used,'' he said. ''Something had to be done about it.'' **********Mr. Zweier, who worked as an engineer at Kearny for 13 years, said the company expected additional retrenchment as part of an effort to bring Western back to using 90 percent of its capacity within the next three to four years. **********Although the company expects that a number of workers will have to be laid off, it said that it hoped to reassign many of the affected employees and to eliminate some jobs by attrition. **********''It's extremely painful to take these actions,'' Donald Procknow, Western's president, said in a statement. ''We must, however, face realities in order to remain the best in our field. Increasing competition requires that we continue efforts to reduce overall costs and improve efficiencies.'' Challenge of Divestiture **********A.T.& T., under the settlement of the Justice Department's antitrust suit against it, must shed its 22 operating companies, which account for 80 percent of the nation's intracity telephone service, by Jan.1, 1984. **********Western's mission has been to manufacture or buy virtually all of the telecommunications equipment used by the Bell companies, which have accounted for 95 percent of its sales. In this new climate, Western faces the challenge of remolding itself into a company that can hustle for business against a growing number of rival manufacturers bidding for the business of the soon-to-be independent Bell subsidiaries. **********Founded in 1925, the Kearny Works is the second-oldest Western plant and is thought to be the largest employer in Hudson County. The plant consists of seven buildings along Central Avenue in the industrial section of the city, which is situated near Jersey City and has a population of 36,000. The Kearny Works mainly makes systems to convert commercial power to run various telecommunications equipment. That work is to be transferred to Western's more modern Dallas plant. **********The Baltimore plant makes protectors and connectors for cable and wire, work scheduled to be reassigned to Omaha. At the Hawthorne plant, the pulp cable operations will be shifted to Phoenix.  Hawthorne, Western's oldest plant, became renowned as the laboratory for the Hawthorne Studies, the landmark work-environment investigations of the 1920's, which found that if management merely paid attention to workers, productivity would improve. **********To reflect the planned moves, Western took an after-tax write-off of $317.6 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Even without the charge, however, Western suffered from both lower earnings and lower revenues in 1982. According to preliminary figures, Western said, it earned $337 million last year on sales of $12.4 billion. In 1981, the manufacturer earned $711 million on sales of $13 billion. Lower-Margin Products **********Ernest Liu, a telecommunications analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said the decision to cut back operations appeared to be a response to dwindling demand for Western products as well as reflecting a desire to make Western more competitive by reducing capacity for its more ''mundane'' products. **********He said Kearny made ''dull staple products'' that produced lower margins than more technologically advanced items like digital electronic and fiber optics products. **********Mr. Zweier acknowledged that advances in microelectronics and in silicon chips had created new products that have siphoned away demand from some of the labor-intensive products made at Kearny. **********Western employs 135,000 at 22 major facilities. Its workforce has been steadily shrinking over the years. Last year alone, 14,000 Western workers were laid off and 5,000 more jobs eliminated due to attrition or other reasons. During the past several years, Western management has offered many of the company's workers early retirement incentives in an effort to trim the workforce. **********Western last closed one of its principal plants in 1975, when it shut facilities in Buffalo and Greensboro, N.C.   Economic Impact Special to the New York Times **********KEARNY, N.J., Jan. 27 - Workers got word that 4,000 jobs would eventually be eliminated at the Kearny Works at 10 A.M. today in letters from Donald E. Procknow, the company's president, and Ronald Butterfield Jr., general manager of the plant. **********The phase-out, they said, would take ''several years'' and some of the job loss could be absorbed through attrition. ''Some layoffs are expected,'' Mr. Procknow's letter said. **********''The workers are totally bewildered,'' said Adam Papasavas, director of research and education for Local 1470 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. ''The one word I can say is shock. Our motto has been that Kearny is alive and well, and we would make it.'' **********''There'll be a lot of economic ripples spreading from this,'' said Kearny's Mayor, Henry J. Hill, who retired three years ago as the plant's manufacturing manager after 41 years with Western Electric. **********Mayor Hill said that a ''very small portion'' of the workforce lived in Kearny. But the plant is one of the town's biggest taxpayers. Last year it was assessed at $23.9 million, about 7.3 percent of Kearny's total tax base of $325.7 million. Its real estate taxes were $1.6 million in 1982. **********Mayor Hill said officials hoped to offset the loss of the $1.6 million by drawing new industry as the Western Electric plant was phased out. **********Last month, the company appealed to Kearny officials for tax relief. They agreed to reduce the assessment to between $17 million and $18 million for 1983 after Western Electric demolished an idle building in the complex, according to Ronnie Connors, assistant tax assessor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/02/world/china-insists-taiwan-s-fate-is-no-business-of-us.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1983-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 616, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHINA INSISTS TAIWAN'S FATE IS NO BUSINESS OF U.S.", "print_headline": "CHINA INSISTS TAIWAN'S FATE IS NO BUSINESS OF U.S.", "body_text": " **********China denied today that its commitment to a peaceful solution of Taiwan's future was a condition for ending United States arms sales there and accused President Reagan of distorting the communique on the issue signed last August by China and the United States. **********The Chinese Foreign Ministry also released a ''new'' proposal to Vietnam offering to discuss improving relations after Hanoi began a phased withdrawal of all its troops from Cambodia.

The African National Congress, the most prominent nationalist movement opposed to the white minority Government in Pretoria, said Monday that it was responsible for the attack. **********The congress is represented here in various ways, and South African statements soon after the raid laid great emphasis on assertions that the warplanes had struck installations used by the movement to plan guerrilla tactics and had also knocked out a Mozambican missile base. **********To judge by the damage displayed by the Mozambican authorities today, the result was less decisive. 3-Hour Tour of Target Areas **********Mozambique, South Africa's radical neighbor and ideological foe, has little obvious interest in seeking to hide or disguise the effects of an attack that it depicts as aggression, despite the economic ties between the two nations through the use of Mozambican ports by South Africa. In three hours of touring the places where South African planes struck, accompanied by Information Ministry officials, a correspondent gained the impression today that Pretoria's aim - or at least achievement -represented less than total vengeance. **********Casualties - 6 dead, including 2 children, and 26 hospitalized - were not so great as were caused in an earlier South African raid here in 1981, or as could have been caused by Pretoria's military machine. Damage, too, was not of the magnitude that could have been wreaked. If the tour by the Informations Ministry showed all there was to see - as the Mozambicans insisted it did - those buildings that were hit show little evidence of any current connection with the African National Congress, although some clearly had provided sanctuary for the exile movement in the recent past. **********Moreover, the scar on the city's psyche is probably less deep than that the car bomb caused in Pretoria. Mozambicans seem more resigned to their vulnerability and so, a day after the attack, the capital itself and the Matola suburb where the attack took place were tranquil. **********A tour of Matola with Information Ministry officials began in Rua Ingineira Pinto Texeira, a leafy street where rockets had plowed holes in an orange grove by an old Portuguese villa, scattered some shrapnel that wounded a girl, but left a chicken yard unscathed. **********The evident target of the rockets was a factory just behind the villa that produces jams and grapefruit juice. Three people died there Monday, battered by the blast of an exploding rocket channeled down a narrow alleyway. There was no evidence of any overt link with the African National Congress. 2 Children Hit by Shrapnel **********Then correspondents were taken to the home of an advertising executive, Francisco Morgadinho, who was not there when rockets wrecked a corner of the building. Just beyond his villa, however, and relatively undamaged, was another house that had been used until a year ago by South African exiles. Two children were wounded there because, a relative said, they went to look when they heard the planes and were hit by splinters of shrapnel. **********The place that came closest to fitting the description of a base for the congress was a house in a part of Matola called Liberdad, where rockets had plowed through a garden but had done little damage to a building whose inner walls were decorated with the slogans of the congress's military wing. **********''At this hour of destiny your country and your people need you,'' said one slogan, embellished by a drawing of a Soviet-type assault rifle. ''The future is yours.'' Another said, ''Umkhonto We Sizwe - the People's Army,'' a reference to the congress's guerrillas. The slogan was faded, not newly painted, and a neighbor said the exiles who had lived there moved out three months ago. **********Their departure, Western diplomats and Mozambican officials said, may have been part of a campaign by the Mozambican authorities to disperse concentrations of South African exiles and move them to the north of the country for security reasons following the 1981 South African raid. Nonetheless, diplomats said, there are probably several hundred South African exiles living in the Maputo area. **********A Ministry of Information spokesman said that the areas visited today represented ''all the places attacked by South Africa.'' If that is true, the inference is that the South Africans refrained from deploying the forces they might have used, for a variety of reasons. Raid Seen as a Warning **********First, a senior Mozambican official said, the intention may have been simply to cause fear and uncertainty as a warning to Mozambique and other African countries harboring South African exiles that retribution can be exacted swiftly, with impunity and possibly without restraint. **********In addition, the Mozambican argument runs, the attack was intended to satisfy a white minority constituency in South Africa clamoring for vengeance and for assurance that the homeland is not so vulnerable as Friday's bombing in Pretoria might suggest. As evidence of this theory, Mozambican officials cite the speed and efficiency of the public relations effort that surrounded it in South Africa. **********''This is a first answer'' to the Pretoria attack, a senior official said, ''but not the whole answer. Maybe they came to test our defenses or do reconnaissance for a later strike. But this was not a military attack against military targets.'' ---- Pretoria Says 64 Were Killed Special to the New York Times **********JOHANNESBURG, May 24 - In an official communique, the South African military said today that it had ''confirmed'' intelligence reports that 64 people had been killed in Monday's reprisal raid on Maputo, Mozambique. **********According to the statement, 41 of those killed were members of the underground African National Congress. Seventeen others, it said, were Mozambican soldiers. The statement said six civilians had died.  Commentators in the pro-Government Afrikaans press asserted today that it was a common ''terrorist'' tactic to conceal casualties. **********The military communique said, ''This was a clinical, finely planned operation directed against proven hiding places of the A.N.C. and was successfully carried out by professional people.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/18/business/us-steel-relights-a-furnace.html": {"writer_name": "Winston Williams", "pub_date": "1983-03-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1201, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. STEEL RELIGHTS A FURNACE", "print_headline": "U.S. STEEL RELIGHTS A FURNACE", "body_text": " **********By dawn it was apparent for miles around that the long-awaited day had finally arrived.  Clouds of bluish-white smoke billowed from the carbon-caped stacks. And gleeful but skeptical workers, some returning from months of unemployment, asked, ''How did it go?'' as they ambled through the plant gates. **********For the first time in 21 months, one of the aging blast furnaces at the United States Steel Corporation's Edgar Thomson Works is smelting iron ore, coke and limestone into pig iron. Shortly after 4 o'clock this morning, dozens of workers on the graveyard shift gathered around the furnace to watch the lighting, hoping they were witnessing the start of a lasting recovery in the feeble steel industry. **********''I'm happy and I'm surprised,'' said Arthur Williams, an employee of 17 years who returned to work Tuesday after 15 months of forced idleness. ''I thought they were going to keep it shut down for good.'' **********But Mr. Williams's optimism was tinged with caution: ''We may be back three weeks, three months or three years - you can't tell anymore about the economy.'' **********Steelworkers in the Monongahela Valley, the homeland of American steelmaking, have had good reason to fear for their jobs. Old plants here in the industrial satellite towns around Pittsburgh have suffered disproportionately from the shutdowns of recent years. **********The Edgar Thomson Works were once the most advanced of their time, but that time was 108 years ago, when the mill was built by Andrew Carnegie and named for a president of the Pennsylvania Railroad. **********About 20,000 steelworkers in the valley - half the total - are still without work. Only two of the valley's eight blast furnaces are working. Workers at nearby Weirton Steel in West Virginia are buying their plant to save their jobs. Even the steelworkers union has laid off scores of workers at its headquarters. **********But 1983 ushered in better times. The modest revival in auto sales and the buoyancy in the housing industry, and hence in appliances, have increased orders so quickly that the industry is now using 54 percent of its capacity; at the end of December, the furnaces were producing at less than 30 percent of their potential. Thirty-one thousand workers have been recalled throughout the industry. **********''There are going to be more recalls and more facilities put back into production after inventories are worked off,'' predicted Charles Bradford, metals analyst for Merrill Lynch. He figures there are enough orders in hand to justify production at 61 percent of capacity. Concessions by Unions **********Despite the improving economy, the valley's steelworkers are convinced that the timing of the relighting and the recall of 300 of the plant's 1,700 laid-off workers had more to do with labor concessions. **********The new contract, reached at the beginning of March, takes away one week of annual vacation. It freezes payments under the cost-ofliving allowance and reduces hourly pay by $1.25 an hour. A special vacation of 13 weeks every five years was abolished. **********''I thought we would have to give up something, but we gave up too much,'' said Clarence Sabol, a pipefitter with 33 years on the job.  He was recalled several days ago after being out of work for eight months. But two of his sons-in-law are still furloughed. **********Younger workers, however, tend to view the concessions more favorably. ''We make a lot of money,'' said Thomas Groark, a pipefitter for six years. ''I love to work. Giving up a few dollars isn't so bad to keep a job. And we still make a lot of money.'' Pervasive Caution **********Fear that the economy will falter is as much a concern as the company's stance toward the union. In an interview last month, David M. Roderick, chairman of U.S. Steel, was himself unusually guarded about the outlook. **********''One thing you learn in this industry is not to raise false hopes just because you see a little blip,'' he said, talking about the increase in orders. ''Business is still extremely depressed, and we think it will stay that way for the rest of the year.'' **********The strength in steel orders at the beginning of the year came in part from users concerned about the possibility of a strike and price increases. As these fears have faded in the past two weeks, orders have dropped dramatically. **********Poor business aside, U.S. Steel's need to reopen factories will be lessened by its decision to diversify into oil and chemicals. Signs of the shift away from investment in the steel industry are abundant. **********Next to the relighted furnace stand several towers covered in gleaming, unsoiled metal, part of the rebuilding of another blast furnace at Edgar Thomson. But the contractors were dismissed last summer when the company ran into financial trouble as a result of its acquisition of the Marathon Oil Company. Offices Are Empty **********Several hundred yards away, at the plant's administration building, many offices are empty, with wastebaskets and disconnected telephones strewn about. Paint is peeling throughout. **********''I don't believe anything they say about keeping this plant open,'' said Nathaniel Thomas, an 18-year veteran in the plant's foundry. **********Because the steel industry seems to be shrinking, workers with low seniority are looking elsewhere for jobs.  ''A lot of guys with less than 10 years' experience have the feeling that they are never going to be called back,'' said Lena Franklin, a placement specialist with the county's Jobpower Department. **********The department's headquarters, a converted eight-story department store, is jammed each day with local residents seeking training and job referrals. Mrs. Franklin said some women who made as much as $30,000 a year in the mills are training for clerical jobs that pay $5 an hour. Other steelworkers are training to become electronics technicians and nurses, leaving the valley for job opportunities and elsewhere. The Side Effects **********Just as renewed vigor in housing, appliances and autos is helping steel, so too is steel's rebound stirring hope in other businesses. **********''We're just hanging in there,'' said Betty Sandowski, speaking of the her family's retail furniture business on Braddock Avenue, the main business thoroughfare. About the blast furnace relighting, she shrugs. ''It's a beginning. We can only hope it leads to more and more,'' she said. **********But many small businesses may not be able to stick it out.  Braddock Avenue already looks like an economic disaster zone, with vacant shops and rundown hotels. **********And the windows of another business, Lincoff's Credit Jewelers, are plastered with signs reading: ''Closing our doors forever - final sale.'' The owner of the shop, a white-haired man who despite his gregariousness would not give his name, said the relighting at Edgar Thomson would not change his plans. ''There are always rumors that the company is going to do something with the plant, and nothing ever happens,'' said the man, who has been in business here for 58 years.  ''It's like crying wolf. How many times can you cry wolf?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/01/business/credit-markets-long-term-rates-are-up.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1983-08-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 798, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LONG-TERM RATES ARE UP", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; LONG-TERM RATES ARE UP", "body_text": " **********On the eve of the largest Treasury financing ever, the outlook for interest rates is more uncertain than any time in the past year. **********While securities dealers are smarting from large losses during the last few months, investor interest in the Treasury's $15.75 billion package of notes and bonds has been weak.

Currently, many Fed watchers say the central bank is holding its policy stable after a modest tightening move that began in May and raised the Federal funds rate slightly less than a percentage point, to about 9 1/4 to 9 1/2 percent. **********''Typically, after a tightening move, the Fed pauses,'' said Albert Gross, chief economist and senior vice president of Refco Inc., a securities concern. He said that a steady Fed policy in coming weeks was an important reason why note and bond prices might be near their lows. After the steep price declines since May, he said, ''a technical rally'' looms. **********Deficits a Major Problem **********Many people on Wall Street agree with Mr. Volcker that huge Federal budget deficits are the ''most serious obstacle'' to economic recovery, lower interest rates and lower inflation. The reductions in budget deficits estimated recently in the Administration's mid-year budget review were not convincing evidence that deficits are headed lower, some analysts said. **********Economists at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, which deals in Government securities, said in a recent publication that the estimate of $179.7 billion for the fiscal year 1984 ''appears too low'' because it assumes that Congress will approve $20.7 billion of deficit reduction measures and because the scheduled withholding tax on interest and dividends has been repealed. **********At the Treasury Department, officials estimated earlier this month that they would need to borrow $60 billion to $65 billion in the quarter ending Dec. 31, about the same amount as was borrowed a year ago. **********''This suggests,'' the Lanston analysts said, ''that the Administration is working with a fiscal 1984 budget deficit total which is reasonably close to the one it anticipates for the current year - $209.8 billion.''

Meyer, president and chief executive, was in the board room for the screening. There was coffee and danish cut in quarters.  After a talk on the marketplace for pool chemicals and an explanation of Olin HTH Pool Chlorinator's dominance therein, the house lights were dimmed and the screen came alive with the picture of an attractive woman in a swimsuit on a chaise under an umbrella, obviously at poolside with a convenient 100-pound drum of HTH at her side. **********And as the voice-over announcer intones the sales message, which has to do with a test designed ''to prove how easy it can be to have the most crystal-clear water,'' the woman rubs her hands together as she prepares to apply the sun cream, then applies it. **********Nothing ''new'' or startling so far. **********Suddenly, almost explosively, bubbles pour out of her mouth and as the viewer realizes with surprise that he has been looking at an underwater scene, she springs for the surface trailing even more bubbles, and the 30-second spot is over. **********An advertising agency had delivered on a promise. And the client, represented on this occasion by James W. Paine, business manager of HTH, and Franklin B. Lang, advertising manager, had a commercial that would demonstrate the benefit in a pool cleaner that research showed the consumer most wants: crystal-clear water. To get there, however, was no breeze. The three TV production companies who were asked to bid, as is the custom, declined to without a test because the request was without precedent. **********EUE/Screen Gems, which finally did the job, shot it in its own Burbank, Calif., pool, which was once graced by Esther Williams and is now used by ''Fantasy Island.'' **********Denise McKenna, the actress who had been auditioned under water, played her wordless role with weights in the seat of her suit as well as in her pony tail and a special job was created to brush the bubbles out of her hair each time she descended to the bottom. And since Miss McKenna was wet anyhow, a new ending for the spot was shot for use next year. Instead of her bubbling to the surface, the 1984 version will have her joined by a bubbling young man. **********HTH is, quite simply, the chemical calcium hyperchloride, which Olin introduced 50 years ago and which now has 80 percent of the calcium hyperchloride pool cleaner market and 32 percent of the total market, which is about $300 million at retail. The competition is so diverse, according to Mr. Paine, that there is no clear No.2 brand. **********The product is where it is thanks to a large degree to advertising. And Olin expects to keep it there the same way. The budget is $2.5 million, all of which will be spent in two months on TV, with equal investments in network and spot. **********The network (only NBC and ABC will be used) advertising breaks May 23 and, since the product purchaser is generally a male, the programming will be prime time and late night as well as sports. The spot starting dates differ with the geographical regions since pool interest changes with the coming of summer. The Northeast, which surprisingly enough has the greatest pool-ownership concentration even if they are above ground, begins May 16.

A Victory for Reagan **********At sessions earlier today, finance ministers representing most of the world gave the Reagan Administration a victory in acting to reduce the amount developing countries can bor- row from the I.M.F. next year. The United States had pressed for the cutback, to conserve the I.M.F.'s resources and to help gain passage by Congress of legislation authorizing an increase in the United States subscription to the fund. **********''It sure isn't going to help if we give away an awful lot of the funds that we haven't even raised yet,'' Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan said at a news briefing. ''And it certainly isn't going to help if the I.M.F. isn't seen as a responsible organization.''  Uncertainty About Congress **********Overhanging the finance ministers' session and other meetings here at the 38th annual meeting of the I.M.F. and its affiliated lending agency, the World Bank, is uncertainty as to whether Congress will approve the $8.4 billion American portion of an overall $42 billion increase in the fund's resources. **********That increase for the I.M.F. of roughly 20 percent was agreed to by the 146 member countries last February, but it needs ratification by the parliaments of individual members to go into effect. Only in the United States is there doubt about approval. **********Tuesday the annual meeting of the fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, as the World Bank is officially known, will be formally opened by President Reagan. He is expected to address Congress over the heads of the delegates and appeal for passage of the funding legislation. The House and the Senate have both passed a version of the bill, but reconciliation of the two measures by a conference committee is tangled, among other things, in heated partisan politics. **********According to White House aides, the President will emphasize general support for the International Monetary Fund, concern over the world economy and the importance of the I.M.F. in resolving the international debt crisis. **********The $11 billion package for Brazil is an example of the role the Fund plays in the crisis. The financing it has worked out will involve $6.5 billion from private banks, led by Citibank of New York. Of the rest, $2 billion will come from the treasuries of leading industrialized nations, known here collectively as the Club of Paris, and the remaining $2.5 billion would be provided in the form of loan guanantees from official agencies to facilitate Brazilian exports. **********About $8.5 billion of the package represents new funds. Early this year, Brazil obtained a $4.4 billion loan from the I.M.F., but after Brazil fell in arrears the I.M.F. stopped its quarterly payments. Commercial banks had also stopped lending. **********The $11 billion, an I.M.F. spokesman said, will allow Brazil to ''close the gap'' in meeting its internatinal payments on which the country had begun falling behind in May. Brazil owes banks and official lenders approximately $90 billion. **********To obtain the money, Brazil has agreed to arduous restraints on its domestic economy that include balancing its budget by 1984, forcing its 150 percent inflation rate down sharply and slowing the rate of wage increases for the labor force. **********Brazilian workers, like the rest of the economy, have been protected against inflation by getting raises equal to the inflation rate. Under the new agreement, they are allowed only 80 percent of the rate. **********The I.M.F.'s demands for restraints has caused turmoil in Brazil and led directly, on Sept. 1, to the resignation of the head of the country's central bank, Carlos Langoni. He was succeeded immediately by Affonso Celso Pastore. **********Since the beginning of the I.M.F.- World Bank meeting here, Mr. Pastore and Ermane Galveas, Brazil's Finance minister, have been meeting privately with leading American and West German bankers and with I.M.F. officials. **********Tonight Citibank held a black-tie dinner at Meridian House, an elegant former private home that now serves as a center for Washington's internatinal community. Mr. Pastore and Mr. Galveas were there but could not be reached for comment on the loan agreement. ''No one here will talk,'' the man answering the phone said. Borrowing Based on Quotas **********The earlier decision on the borrowing cutback, reached just after 1 A.M., following 15 hours of negotiations by the Fund's 22-member policy-making Interim Committee, relates to complex I.M.F. rules allowing members to borrow on the basis of quotas, or deposits, that each member makes in the common pool. **********Quotas for the entire membership were increased last February by $42 billion, or 47.5 percent, to slightly under $100 billion. Members now may borrow as much as 150 percent of their quotas annually over a period of three years, for a total of 450 percent. **********The United States wanted this cut back to 102 percent a year, or 306 percent for three years, to save resources. The 102 percent would provide access to an equal amount of money in the larger pool, the Americans maintained. But developing countries wanted the present access levels maintained. This would have given them access to larger amounts of cash from the I.M.F., which they said was needed because of the economic crisis. **********All loans made by the International Monetary Fund are conditional on seeking economic adjustment or austerity programs in the borrowing countries. All loans are approved by the executive board, where the United States has a veto on major decisions. **********Finally, in today's early morning hours, a compromise was put on the table by Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, in which there would be a two-tier access formula. In most cases there would be a 102 percent ceiling. But access could go as high as 125 percent of the quota."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/28/business/patents-electrical-connections-for-a-computer-lab.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1983-05-28", "snippet": "For several years, Edwin Z.

The plan would also give these nations more control over the creation of international reserves. **********The new reform effort will be presented as a low-key affair in contrast to earlier efforts, officials say. **********Key Role in Controlling Talks **********Italy is the key player in this new monetary reform effort, officials say, because it currently heads the Group of 10 - the secretive body bringing together the world's 10 richest countries plus Switzerland, both at ministerial and expert level - and thus effectively controls its discussions. G-10, as the body is usually called, traditionally serves as the forum in which the major financial powers debate monetary changes. **********Italy's central bank is quietly drawing up specific reform proposals to serve as the basis of discussion by the experts of the Group of 10. **********The Reagan Administration will have a chance to express its own views later this month when Beryl W. Sprinkel, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs, visits Rome for talks with the Italians. **********Meeting Set in Paris Nov. 17 **********The new round of monetary reform talks opens in Paris Nov. 17, when Lamberto Dini, deputy governor of the Bank of Italy, convenes a meeting of G-10 deputies to draw up a work plan for completing a program of international monetary studies that the I.M.F. ministers requested at their annual meeting in September. **********These studies will examine whether the world needs to create additional monetary reserves to finance economic recovery by issuing more special drawing rights, the artifical reserve unit sometimes known as paper gold, whether volatile exchange rates are affecting trade and investment flows and whether the I.M.F. can do more to coordinate more effectively the economic policies of the major industrial countries. **********2 Specific Reforms Sought **********The Italians apparently want to use the studies as a means of pushing the major Western countries toward agreement on two specific reforms by next March when they hope to convene the finance ministers of the Group of 10 to consider the results of the deputies' work. Besides Switzerland, the Group of 10 consists of the United States, Italy, Britain, Canada, France, West Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden. **********The first Italian objective is to reach an agreement to create a modest new S.D.R. issue equivalent to about $3 billion a year for three years. **********Although the Reagan Administration and West Germany fear that any futher expansion of international liquidity would be inflationary, the Italians argue that world reserves are now falling fast as countries in payments deficit find they can no longer borrow money from private banks to finance their imports and are forced to spend reserves. **********Help for Trade Recovery **********From a peak of $378 billion in 1980, total world reserves fell to $354 billion at the end of last year and currently stand at $325 billion. Those who favor a new issue of S.D.R.'s say it would help finance the recovery in world trade that is just beginning. **********But officials say the Italians are planning in the longer term to start discussing a more ambitious program. That plan would turn special drawing rights into a major international currency by allowing the I.M.F. to fund itself by creating these units at will and lending them out to countries in payments trouble instead of relying on subscriptions of national currency from its member countries. **********The reformers' second objective is to set up a new system of I.M.F. surveillance over the economic policies of the major Western countries to assure that they are compatible. **********U.S. Fiscal Policy Blamed **********European monetary officials argue that hopes that a convergence in inflation rates alone would stabilize currencies have proved unfounded. **********The blame for this is put on America's fiscal policy that has forced up interest rates and the dollar. Officials in favor of reform argue that the I.M.F. has showed itself powerless to influence economic policy in major countries in the past."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/05/business/mrs-thatcher-s-economy-on-trial.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1983-06-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2212, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MRS. THATCHER'S ECONOMY ON TRIAL", "print_headline": "MRS. THATCHER'S ECONOMY ON TRIAL", "body_text": " **********BRITAIN'S blunt-spoken Employment Minister, Norman Tebbit, declared on a news program last week that ''the Government has always been committed to unemployment.'' Quickly catching himself, Mr. Tebbit added, ''I mean improving unemployment.'' **********Curiously, there is a large dose of truth in both Mr. Tebbit's gaffe and his correction. From its first day in office, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Government has been dedicated to economic policies that have forced Britain's unemployment rate to record levels. The goal has been to control inflation, an achievement the Conservatives say is the prerequisite for the kind of economic recovery that will lead to a long-term improvement in Britain's employment figures. **********It was a risky strategy, but pollsters here say it looks like it is succeeding politically. Despite a host of economic ills that historically would have spelled electoral disaster for an incumbent British Government, Mrs. Thatcher and her party appear headed for a comfortable, perhaps overwhelming victory in Thursday's general election. **********If the polls are right, the political repercussions are bound to be felt throughout the industrial world. ''Thatcherism'' shares a great deal with the economic policies preferred by President Reagan, and he and his advisers are sure to view a Thatcher victory as a positive sign as he weighs running for a second term in 1984. **********The heart of Thatcherism is to make the fight against inflation the nation's highest economic priority. Curbs on growth in the money supply and on spending are the Government's main weapons in that fight, reliance on the free market to bring efficiency to industry is its creed, and high unemployment in the near term is the price it is willing to accept. **********Mrs. Thatcher is well aware of the close connections between her economic thinking and that preached, if not practiced, by leaders in other major industrial nations. Recently, after her return from the Williamsburg economic summit meeting, she attacked opposition critics with the observation, ''We should stop and ask ourselves whether it is likely that the Labor Party and the Liberal-Social Democratic Party alliance have got it right and the whole of the industrialized world has got it wrong.'' **********Both politicians and analysts agree that the major parties are more split than ever on fundamental policy issues. Both the Conservatives, on the right, and Labor, on the left, are now dominated by ideological thinking that is extreme by the standards of recent British politics. **********Conservatives, arguing that the basis for sustained recovery has been laid by the fight against inflation, claim that still more private enterprise and tighter controls on government spending are needed to make the nation economically competitive. **********The Labor Party wants to increase Government spending dramatically to lift employment; reintroduce exchange controls and force banks to cooperate in domestic investment programs; renationalize the stateowned companies sold to private investors; extend nationalization into new sectors, and take Britain out of the European Economic Community. **********The Liberal-Social Democratic alliance, attempting to convince voters that it should be taken seriously in its first national campaign, has staked out a middle ground calling for a modest increase in spending, continued membership in the E.E.C. and a general freeze in the nationalization-denationalization balance. **********Such divisions have made the economic issues in this election unusually clear-cut.  ''We believe this election will have a more significant effect on the future of industry and the economy than any since the war,'' said Walter Goldsmith, director general of the Institute of Directors, a nonaligned but overwhelmingly conservative association of top business executives. ''We believe that the present Government has broken the mold of British politics.'' **********Mrs. Thatcher's campaign has been aided by disarray among her opponents, widespread doubts about portions of the Labor Party's defense policy and admiration for her strong leadership during the Falklands conflict. But voters have been telling the pollsters that economic issues are the most important ones in the election. And clearly, her campaign has been helped by the failure of the opposition to persuade voters that her policies have made a shambles of the economy. **********IT'S not for want of ammunition.  During four years of Conservative rule, unemployment has tripled, t o just over 3 million people by the Government's own estimates, moret han at any time in British history. Some opposition leaders say thata ctual unemployment is far higher, and the Government acknowledges t hat the underlying trend is still rising. The official unemployment r ate stood at 12.8 percent for May, after changes in reporting that u nderstated the figure compared with previous months. **********Vast portions of the engineering sector have been decimated while others, such as shipbuilding and coal mining, remain uncompetitive.  While inflation dropped in April to an annual rate of just over 4 percent -down markedly from a peak of 21.9 percent in May 1980 - the underlying rate is still higher than the level in such important trading partners as West Germany, the United States and Japan, and it is expected to begin rising again later this year. **********Mrs. Thatcher's tenure in office also has seen a 19 percent decline in industrial production, the steepest in the industrial world, and a sharp drop in Britain's already low level of manufacturing investment. **********To make matters worse, the Government was unable to deliver on its promise to cut spending, and its increase in value added taxes - the British equivalent of a sales tax -wiped out the benefit of income tax cuts for all but the wealthy. **********However, the Labor Party and the Liberal-Social Democratic alliance have been unable so far to draw political blood with such bleak statistics. One reason is that many voters believe most of Britain's economic troubles were inevitable, no matter who was in power. **********''Part of British masochism is that we expect to perform worse than other economies,'' said Gavyn Davies, chief economic analyst at the investment house of Simon & Coates. **********More significantly, though, many voters have accepted the Conservatives' arguments that the problems reflect decades of mismanagement and that Britain's economic plight will be still worse if Mrs. Thatcher is not allowed to continue her programs. **********''I think that people have a feeling that it is not right to blame Mrs. Thatcher for what has happened,'' said Timothy O'Dell, an economist at the investment house of Phillips & Drew. ''There is a sense that it is medicine that had to be taken.'' **********One telling sign of the impact of such arguments is that the latest polls indicate that one-fourth to one-third of the more than 3 million unemployed themselves will vote Conservative. **********And the arguments are buttressed by positive signs that the ''medicine'' may be working: productivity is up, new businesses are being founded at a record rate, interest rates have come down and, according to a survey by the Confederation of British Industry, business confidence is at the highest level since 1978. **********Moreover, the 87 percent of the work force with jobs has fared well under the Conservatives by many measures. Real pay increases have substantially outstripped inflation and work hours lost to strikes have fallen. **********But another aid to Mrs. Thatcher's campaign has been the very difficulty of determining what her impact has been. ''It isn't possible to net out her effect from that of the world economic recession,'' Mr. O'Dell said. **********''She has had more of an impact during a world recession than she would have had in better times,'' said Lord Harris, general director of the Institute of Economic Affairs, a conservative think tank.  ''This Government has accelerated a lot of delayed adjustments.  There's no doubt that any other Government would have tempered the wind. You would have to call it the nerve factor.'' **********LORD Harris's view reflects the widely held belief that leaders in the other parties, and in the more liberal wing of the Conservatives typified by former Prime Minister Edward Heath, would have backed away from a full-scale assault on inflation as it accelerated the rise in unemployment. **********As for her impact on British business, Mrs. Thatcher is best known for her vocal opposition to powerful trade unions. After a false start in which she kept a 1979 campaign pledge that granted inflationary pay increases to public workers, she has assembled a team of ideologically committed Cabinet officials and trusted executives such as Ian MacGregor at the Government-owned British Steel Corporation, who have presided over severe cutbacks in employment, changes in work practices and tough wage bargaining in state-owned industries such as steel, coal and shipbuilding and in the health-care and transport sectors. They, in turn, have encouraged private business to take a tougher stance. ''I have never heard so many businessmen saying that they will not go back to the old ways,'' Lord Harris said. **********Conservatives and most of the business community say that this change in climate has led to productivity improvements and innovations that will make British industry competitive in the future and will eventually produce more jobs. **********Mrs. Thatcher's critics, on the other hand, charge that her confrontational approach has created an illusion of progress that will disappear in a wave of strikes once recovery restores some of the working class's bargaining power. **********''She is the archangel of conflict,'' said Roy Hattersley, the Labor Party's employment spokesman.  That is not to say that Mrs. Thatcher never lets politics influence economic decisions. Last fall, for instance, she quietly rejected the recommendation of Mr. MacGregor that British Steel close Ravenscraig, the last integrated steel mill in Scotland, after Scottish conservatives lobbied against the move. Nor is her approach to the economy entirely hands-off. By the Government's own count, there are 100 different programs to encourage small or new businesses financially. **********But in this campaign, neither the Conservatives nor their opponents seem interested in pointing out such deviations from pure Thatcherism. Both sides apparently feel they have a stake in proving that the Prime Minister has made as much difference as the rhetoric would imply. FOILING AMONETARIST EXPERIMENT LONDON **********Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979 as a confirmed monetarist, dedicated to the propositions that controlling the money supply was the key to winning the battle against inflation and that monetary restrictions could be imposed without damaging long-run economic growth. The foundation of her economic policy was to be a reduction in the growth rate of sterling M-3 - sterling deposits of British residents plus notes and coin. **********Like President Reagan, she quickly came to grief when a conflict developed between her tight monetary targets and an expansive fiscal policy. Her campaign promise to accept pay increases for public workers - a raise recommended by a commission appointed by the previous Government - forced the civil service wage bill up 24.5 percent, an inflationary wave that rolled through private sector bargaining contracts as well. In addition, interest expenses rose sharply as the Bank of England raised minimum lending rates by 5 percent in order to meet the monetary growth target. **********Finally, to keep the nation's deficit from overwhelming the monetary targets, the Government was forced to adopt various taxes that wiped out the benefits of income tax cuts for all but the wealthy. Thus it undercut its own effort to test the theories of ''supply-side'' economists who argued that tax cuts would actually increase private spending and stimulate economic recovery. **********These developments, and the growing importance of North Sea oil, sent the pound up sharply, catching British manufacturers in a squeeze between high financing costs, falling consumer demand and crushing foreign competition. They also undermined confidence in the validity of M-3 as a measure of monetary growth, since this measure by 1980 was showing a rapid expansion at a time when other monetary measures, interest rates and the exchange rate suggested that money was tight. **********A civil service strike in late 1981 made it impossible to track M-3 or the Government's borrowing requirements accurately, and gave the Government an excuse to reassess its policies at a time when it had become clear that no single money supply measure was proving an accurate predictor of inflation or economic performance. **********The result, concluded a Morgan Guaranty Trust Company report early this year, was a shift to several different monetary targets, with no commitment as to which would be considered most important. **********This pragmatism may be based more on political judgments than economic ones, according to City of London economists. Analysts here have noted that the Government has exceeded both fiscal and monetary targets this spring in an effort to spur the fledgling recovery and they have warned investors to watch for a quick tightening if the Conservatives win by a large margin. One immediate effect would be to drive the pound up again and undo the effect of a 15 percent decline from last November through March - a prospect that worries many businessmen who feel the recovery is still on shaky ground."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/07/business/executive-path-has-swerved-if-recent-history-is-any-guide.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 250, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Path Has Swerved If recent history is any guide,", "print_headline": "Executive Path Has Swerved If recent history is any guide,", "body_text": " **********William L.

A similar deficit is forecast for the next fiscal year. **********A record deficit did not keep interest rates from falling in the last year, when three-month Treasury bills declined to 7.6 percent from 12.2 percent and 30-year Treasury bonds dropped to 10 1/2 percent from 14 3/8 percent. Forecasts of still lower rates are widespread, on the theory that weak credit demand from businesses and consumers will leave plenty of room for huge Treasury borrowings without driving interest rates up. **********''I'm not so concerned about the deficit now as I am about the outlook for a few years from now,'' commented George Collins, president of the T. Rowe Price New Income Fund. Without changes in Federal tax and spending practices, he said, the deficits are ''structural - not temporary'' and could pose a risk to investors in future years. Pressures in Future Years **********''Rates can come somewhat lower,'' Mr. Collins said, ''though most of the run is out of the way.'' Because huge deficits in future years leave open the possiblilty that the Federal Reserve will try to ease the strain on the economy and buy a large portion of the debt, Mr.  Collins and others are unsure wether the recent declines in inflation and interest rates can be sustained. **********Allan C. Lerner, an economist at the Bankers Trust Company, warned that budget uncertainties were discouraging potential buyers of Treasury notes and bonds. ''Cuts in the entitlement programs'' would be the most credible signs of budgetary reform, he said. **********For now, ''a weak economy is serving to keep a check on rates,'' Mr. Lerner said, but he added, ''Clear signs of an economic uptrun will flash a warning signal to fixed-income investors, who are well aware of the Treasury's future demands.'' **********Various other analysts are more optimistic, saying that deficits may not be as much of a problem as some people fear.  ''There are now signs that the Administration is finally adopting a more realistic attitude about prospects for economic growth,'' said Aubrey H. Zaffuto, vice president and economist at the J. Henry Schroder Bank and Trust Company. Such a realistic appraisal, he said, will add to the credibility of economic policy makers and help the prospects for fiscal policy ''become a bit brighter.'' Outlook for Fears on Deficit **********Because the economy may peform better than expected, ''fears regarding the Federal deficit are likely to lessen as 1983 unfolds,'' said Frank Mastrapasqua, an economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. **********Although many analysts agree that the slowing of inflation means that the fundamental direction of interest rates is downward, there are several opinions as to when the decline may occur this year.  Several analysts, for example, expect most of the rate drop to occur in the next few months, while others say it may not come until the second half of the year. **********Those expecting rates to fall soon say it could happen when the Federal Reserve announces further reductions in the discount rate it charges on loans to financial institions. Further declines in interest rates are required to sustain the economic recovery, economists have said. Analysts at Money Market Services, a consulting firm, said the recent strengthening of the automobile and housing industries was based on pent-up demand from the last few years and would not continue without further declines in interest rates. Some Suggest Rise in Rates **********Economists at Citibank and Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a securities firm, are among those who have said that interest rates might go higher before they decline later this year. **********Analysts at both firms said it is possible that the economic recovery early this year, combined with too rapid growth in the money supply, would cause the Fed to begin making credit less available to the banking sytem rather than supplying all the needs of the banks as in recent months. That would lead to a temporary increase in interest rates. **********In the first-quarter version of their United States Economic Forecast, Citibank economists said the Fed's commitment to lowering inflation and keeping money supply growth under control makes them ''basically bullish on the bond market over the longer term.''

Andropov appears to be slipping in authority because of illness. As a result, diplomats say they doubt there has been any voice in the Politburo strong enough to argue for more flexibility in Geneva.  Developments in the missile talks this week have followed a script set out months ago by Moscow. Mr. Andropov and other leaders had long warned that once deployments of new American missiles in Europe began, there would be no ground for continuing the Geneva negotiations. **********They had also laid out in general terms the series of countermeasures that Mr. Andropov announced Thursday, including deployment of new seaborne nuclear missiles against the United States, additional placements of SS-20 medium-range missiles targeted on Western Europe and accelerated deployment of smaller tactical and battlefield nuclear weapons in Eastern Europe.  Some Western envoys say they believe that the Kremlin decided from the outset of the Geneva sessions two years ago that it would never sign an agreement licensing the deployment of new American nuclear missiles ''on the threshhold of our house,'' as Mr. Andropov put it in his latest statement. **********In this view, the Soviet leadership was united in its conviction that the Pershing 2 and cruise missiles pose a threat to the Soviet Union as great as any they have faced since the American nuclear monopoly ended more than 30 years ago. **********But there is another view that attributes the walkout in Geneva in part to Mr. Andropov's health, a political vagary in Moscow that could scarcely have been foreseen at an earlier stage of the talks. The Soviet leader, who as late as August appeared to be swiftly consolidating his power, has been out of public view for more than three months, and there are reports that he has a kidney ailment and has spent at least part of his absence in the hospital. **********Diplomats generally agree that Mr. Andropov relied heavily on military support when he was chosen to succeed Leonid I. Brezhnev a year ago, and that military influence in the Kremlin has probably never been higher since World War II. **********Statements by Soviet marshals have demonstrated their implacable opposition to the deployment of any American missiles in Europe, and any chance that they could be won over to a more flexible view almost certainly depended on Mr. Andropov's gaining clear primacy within the ruling group. **********Whether Mr. Andropov would have persuaded the military chiefs, diplomats admit, is unknowable, but their conclusion is that without him, a last-minute compromise that could have stopped the American deployments became highly improbable.   Format Could Be Different **********By the same token, the diplomats say they believe that it could be some time, if at all, before the Kremlin agrees to resume negotiations. And they say the probability is that if Moscow is to join negotiations again, it will have to be in a different format, possibly at a new forum that would merge the talks on medium-range weapons with the parallel set of negotiations on strategic arms, also being held in Geneva. **********Before Mr. Andropov's statement Thursday, Soviet officials had privately acknowledged that there would be some logic in this, in light of their own insistence that the American nuclear missiles in Europe constitute a strategic threat to their own armory that their medium-range missiles do not pose to the United States strategic force. Westerners who have pressed the Russians on this, however, have found them evasive, and there was nothing in Mr. Andropov's statement to give encouragement about new talks. **********The Russians proved unyielding in their refusal to ''give our blessing'' to any new American missile deployments, no matter how far reduced from the original deployment plan. **********One Western envoy who has dealt directly with the Kremlin on the issue described this as ''the impossible condition'' for the United States, since it would have left Moscow with a monopoly in Europe of modern land-based missiles.   'Answer Is Self-Evident' **********The envoy, closely involved in arms negotiations with Moscow for a decade, said the Soviet position was unusually unyielding, even by the tough standards of Soviet negotiators, and added: ''You have to ask yourself who in the hierarchy here could set such a condition and insisted on it? I think the answer is self-evident - the military.'' **********Defense Minister Dmitri F. Ustinov and other high-ranking officers have described the missiles as the embodiment of American plans for a ''nuclear blitzkrieg'' on Soviet command and communication centers. **********Some diplomats say they feel the Soviet leadership may now focus less on this issue because their pronouncements on the American missiles have raised profound fears across the country, to the point that ordinary Russians frequently ask Americans here why President Reagan is planning a nuclear war. **********What diplomats say they expect now is a variant of the previous Soviet strategy, without the negotiations. While the negotiations were going on in Geneva, Soviet leaders never abandoned hope of achieving their goal of blocking the United States missiles on the political battleground of Western Europe, and it is there that efforts are likely to be concentrated."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/21/business/armatron-international-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 40, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ARMATRON INTERNATIONAL INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "ARMATRON INTERNATIONAL INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/01/world/killers-of-8-newsmen-in-peru-cite-police-role.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 218, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Killers of 8 Newsmen In Peru Cite Police Role", "print_headline": "Killers of 8 Newsmen In Peru Cite Police Role", "body_text": " **********Peasants in a central Andean village told reporters today that they were following police orders to kill strangers when they attacked and killed eight Peruvian journalists last week. **********Several hundred people, including family members, a representative of President Fernando Belaunde Terry and delegations from Parliament were at the airport today to meet an air force plane that brought the bodies of six of the eight journalists back to Lima. **********The air force jet brought the bodies from Ayacucho, 220 miles southeast of Lima and capital of the department where the eight journalists were beaten to death last week by about 100 peasants with machetes, clubs and stones. **********''They told us to kill any stranger that appeared,'' an unidentified peasant in the town of Uchuracay said of the police.

''We ended up on the bleeding edge of technology, instead of the leading edge,'' one computer systems executive at a major bank said sarcastically. **********The $17 million bill to remedy the situation contributed to Storage Technology's first drop in annual profits since 1974. They had grown at an average yearly rate above 40 percent for the last 10 years. Perhaps worse, though, was the damage to the company's reputation for sound engineering at an especially portentous time. **********Storage Technology is about to ship its new thin-film disk drive, the 8380, nearly 10 months after I.B.M. established a lead with its 3380. The 8380 is a glamour entry among a half-dozen new products on the way - products that Jesse I. Aweida, chairman and chief executive, is counting on to contribute about another $1 billion in sales at Storage Technology in 1985. A Cool Reception **********That is a tall order, considering that the company passed $1 billion in total revenues - at $1.1 billion, a 17 percent gain over 1981 - for the first time last year. Net income, at $64.7 million, or $1.88 a share, dropped 21 percent.

''We feel very good about it. The evidence will probably be there no later than July.'' **********Storage Technology shares, which closed Friday at $20.875, unchanged, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, slipped from a peak of $40.25 in 1981. Mr. Aweida compares the slump to 1978, when Storage Technology was readying several new products but was out of favor on Wall Street. **********He is moving cautiously in an effort to perfect the 8380 manufacturing system well before Storage Technology pushes into heavy production. He plans to ship 100 of the units, priced at nearly $100,000 apiece, through the summer. If all goes well, the rate will go to 900 units in the fourth quarter, he said. **********Meanwhile, I.B.M. shipped more than 5,000 of the 3380 disk drives last year and is expected to add as many as another 15,000 this year, according to Frank R. Gens, a senior research analyst with the Yankee Group, a data processing and telecommunications research and consulting concern based in Boston. **********He and some other analysts pointed out that I.B.M. has stepped up the pace of its new product introductions. That gives competitors like Storage Technology less time to recoup their investment on their equipment that plugs into I.B.M. mainframes. **********One analyst, who asked not to be identified because Storage Technology is one of his customers, said I.B.M. is readying a disk drive with 2,500 billion bits of memory storage capacity - more than twice the 1,000 billion bits of memory in the 3380 -that it could announce as early as next fall. The storage capacity in 1,000 billion bits is roughly equal to 125,000 typewritten pages. **********''That is what is holding Storage Technology's stock down,'' he said. I.B.M.'s Innovation Rate **********Beyond that, I.B.M.'s increasingly rapid rate of product innovation, coupled with aggressive price-cutting, has cast a cloud over most plug-compatible manufacturers, according to Ulric Weil, an industry analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company. **********Other analysts, however, doubted that I.B.M. would move so quickly to bring a new disk drive to the market, since an announcement that soon would discourage potential customers from buying its 3380 or agreeing to long-term leases, both of which the company is encouraging. **********Mr. Aweida said Storage Technology also is developing a version of the 8380 with double storage capacity, which he expects to ship sometime next year. Customers have told his sales staff that the I.B.M. sales force is hinting about an enhancement of the 3380, but Mr. Aweida indicated he doubts that it will be announced this year. **********In addition to Storage Technology, the other so-called plugcompatible manufacturers of peripheral equipment for I.B.M.  mainframe computers principally include the Amdahl Corporation, the Control Data Corporation and the Memorex division of the Burroughs Corporation. **********I.B.M., of course, is the leader in the plug-compatible industry.  Among the independents, Storage Technology does about two-thirds of the plug-compatible business, according to Mr. Aweida. **********These are not simply ''me too'' products, copies of I.B.M.  originals, Mr. Aweida asserted. For instance, Storage Technology just introduced a controller, called Sybercache, a plug-in accessory which speeds the entry and recall of data between a range of I.B.M.  mainframe computers and information storage units. **********''That's a good product,'' said Thomas J. Crotty, director of research for the Gartner Group, a research arm of Dillon, Read Inc.  Then, too, programs for certain I.B.M. computers, including the 3081 series as well as the 3082, 3083 and 3084, do not have to be altered when the Storage Technology 8380 disk drive is added, according to Ted Costello, a technology analyst with Sutro & Company, in San Jose, Calif. Oddly, changes in programs are necessary to run I.B.M.'s 3380 disk drive. **********''Who needs the headaches of reprogramming?'' Mr. Costello said.''With the arrival of the 8380, Storage Tech will be more compatible with I.B.M.'s market than I.B.M. is.'' Second-Half Rebound **********Storage Technology spent about $75 million on research and development last year, up from $50 million in 1981. Mr. Aweida said he plans to keep the figure at about 7 percent of sales again this year. Beyond that, the company has raised $250 million through limited partnerships in 1981 to finance its first mainframe computer, which is due for initial delivery in about a year. **********Mr. Aweida is telling Wall Street not to expect a rebound in profits at Storage Technology during the first half of 1983, but he is optimistic that a pickup in the economy will give the 8380 and other new products a lift in the second half. **********Analysts who expect the company to repeat past successes think its shares are an uncommon bargain among high-technology stocks, many of whch have doubled in price since last August. **********''Once they get their product cycle back on track, they should be off to the races,'' said Joseph R. Kapka, a technology analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc., in Santa Clara, Calif. **********''All the bad news is already in the stock,'' Mr. Costello, of Sutro & Company, added. ''Once they ship this new generation of disk drives, it won't take long to find out.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/13/world/around-the-world-sicilian-soccer-game-erupts-in-gunfire.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sicilian Soccer Game Erupts in Gunfire", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Sicilian Soccer Game Erupts in Gunfire", "body_text": " **********A stadium guard enraged by soccer fans' jeers fired a shotgun into the stands today, killing one person, the police said.

But in the biggest turnaround of this campaign, the crowds are now thronging to the Free Democrats' rallies. One week before the election Mr. Genscher, perspiring as he rasps through one speech after another, senses that he is going to save both his endangered party and his job as Foreign Minister. **********''I think when we get to the end of an election people are obliged to see the importance of the F.D.P. in the political system,'' the Foreign Minister said in an interview. ''I make the assumption that we will now be in the Bundestag -that is without doubt. I am also of the opinion that the Greens will be in the Bundestag too - weaker than us, but they will be there.'' Party Left Schmidt Coalition **********A month ago few would have bet on the Free Democrats' getting the 5 percent of the popular vote needed to get back into Parliament. By deserting Helmut Schmidt's Social Democratic-led coalition in September, Mr. Genscher was stigmatized as a ''traitor.'' His small party had been shut out of state legislatures in Hamburg, Hesse and Bavaria and had sunk to about 2 percent of the popular vote. **********The comeback has been slow, painful and hardly certain. Mr.  Genscher has traveled frantically on diplomatic missions abroad, guaranteeing himself prime television coverage at home. He has even been praised by Brigitte Bardot for opposing the import of baby seal pelts. **********The Free Democrats have not aroused great public enthusiasm despite their claim to be running a ''happy'' campaign. Polls still show Mr.  Genscher to be the most unpopular politician in the country, and he has been obliged to share the party limelight with the witty, toughminded Economics Minister, Otto Lambsdorff, who has pushed the Free Democrats to the right of their Christian Democratic partners on fiscal policy. **********If the Free Democrats slip back into Parliament next Sunday, it will largely be because one bloc of voters fears that the Christian Democrats alone cannot win a clear majority of seats and because another bloc fears that such a majority would make Franz Josef Strauss, the right-wing Bavarian, Foreign Minister. The Free Democrats' role as an all-purpose coalition-maker would then be ratified. Playing the Anti-Strauss Card **********In meetings Mr. Genscher leaves it to lieutenants to play the anti-Strauss card. An overflow gathering of 2,500 people in this southern city was told today that only three men could be the next Foreign Minister: Mr. Genscher, the volatile Mr. Strauss or Egon Bahr, whom the Government has tried to tar as a Moscow mole in the Social Democratic Party. **********Mr. Genscher is an unexciting speaker, and he resorts to straining his vocal cords, almost shouting, for dramatic effect. But he gets in some sharp jabs at the Social Democrats, saying they abandoned a common foreign policy in the eight years he served as Mr. Schmidt's Foreign Minister. **********He mocks Hans-Jochen Vogel, the Social Democratic candidate for Chancellor, for saying he alone can force Moscow and Washington to negotiate an arms agreement. ''I would be happy,'' Mr. Genscher says, shaping his hands into a vise, ''if he could force his own party to come together on security questions.'' **********The United States is the guarantor of West Germany's freedom, he continues, to hearty applause. A coalition between Mr. Vogel and the antinuclear, anti-NATO Green Party, he says, would make West Germany ''a wanderer between worlds'' and a ''plaything'' in international politics. A Change in Image **********In going from coalition with the Social Democrats to coalition with the Christian Democrats, the Free Democrats have lost their image as the country's foremost champion of civil liberties. In his speeches Mr. Genscher now puts little emphasis on such pet issues as the rights of Turkish and other foreign ''guest workers'' in Germany. **********Joining the Christian Democrats last fall, the weakened Free Democrats had to abandon the Interior Ministry to Mr. Strauss' man in Bonn, Friedrich Zimmermann, who just recently encroached on the Foreign Minister's turf by making a speech about recovering once-German territories in Poland. Mr. Genscher does not talk about recovering the Interior Ministry for his party in the next government. **********What remains of the old message is mainly an open appeal to the country's upper-middle classes to vote Free Democratic to prevent the Christian Democrats from overtaxing them. The Free Democrats are also appealing for West Germans to split their two votes -one goes for local candidates, the other for a party - giving the junior coalition partner the second. **********Chatting in a hotel bar between speeches, Mr. Genscher said he felt the ''overwhelming majority'' of West Germans ''support integration with the West.'' **********''You noticed the reaction today -you can see it in any gathering - when I contrast the difference between the stationing of American troops here to the Soviet troops in Poland, you can feel how the people really think and feel,'' he said. **********He said he welcomed the campaign debate on medium-range missiles, which he deals with in public by saying a return of the Bonn coalition to power will help persuade the Russians to reduce their nuclear arsenal. ''The missile question really does arouse the people,'' he said. ''I am of the opinion that the discussion of this subject in this election campaign has advantages; it works off emotions. And that is a gain for us.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/22/business/bluesky-oil-gas-ltd-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-jan-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 53, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BLUESKY OIL & GAS LTD reports earnings for QTr to Jan 31", "print_headline": "BLUESKY OIL & GAS LTD reports earnings for QTr to Jan 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/26/business/company-news-utility-planning-four-day-week.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 171, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Utility Planning Four-Day Week", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Utility Planning Four-Day Week", "body_text": " **********The board of the cash-short Washington Public Power Supply System voted today to put 3,900 workers on a four-day week at its headquarters and a nuclear power plant construction site to save money. **********The executive board also adopted a resolution stating it has no intention of declaring bankruptcy in order to get out of its obligations on two plants on which construction has been stopped. **********If the board had not acted, by May 1 the system would have had only enough money left in its construction budget for the No. 3 Satsop plant to cover outstanding bills, Mr. Peterson said.

But it was possible, and Interfirst's two senior officers came here to explain their case. **********The men, Elvis L. Mason and Robert H. Stewart 3d, have been considered among the best bankers in the business, locked in an amiable rivalry. Mr. Mason is Interfirst's chairman and chief executive officer; Mr. Stewart formerly was a chief executive officer and most recently chairman of the executive committee. **********But in announcing the loss, the bank also said it had dismissed William D. Breedlove, who had been chairman of the Interfirst Bank in Dallas, which accounts for about half of the group's total assets. Mr. Stewart replaced Mr. Breedlove as chairman of the Dallas bank. **********''The financial markets have complete confidence in Bob,'' Mr. Mason said in an interview here. **********So highly regarded have Mr. Mason and Mr. Stewart been that they were often considered to be among the top candidates for some of the choicest banking jobs in the country. For example, when the First National Bank of Chicago was looking for a new chief executive officer a few years ago, both Mr. Mason and Mr. Stewart were among the top candidates. The job eventually went to Barry Sullivan, formerly of the Chase Manhattan Bank. **********Most of the problem loans were to the energy industry and Mr. Mason said that such problems were endemic to Texas banking, where most banks are heavily engaged in financing the energy industry. ''No bank in Texas has found it easy to come to grips with credit problems,'' he said. **********Many Texas bankers here at the convention were predicting that other banks in the state would eventually report comparable losses, though much smaller in actual size because most banks are far smaller than Interfirst. In some cases, the problems are not merely in energy lending but also in agriculture. **********To reassure the banking community, Mr. Mason and Mr. Stewart flew into Honolulu Saturday and attended receptions given by other banks.

But early last week, Mr. Mason began meeting with major bankers in New York to let them know of the extent of the problems and to reassure them of Interfirst's basic strength. **********''It was an effort to be certain that the heads of some of the biggest banks in the country were not surprised,'' Mr. Mason said. ''We thought it important to brief them in advance. We didn't expect to have any trouble raising money, but we wanted to be sure other banks understood our position.'' **********Mr. Mason stressed that the big provision for loan losses - $430 million - was taken to make sure that there would be enough to deal with any unforeseen problems in the future. And he indicated that the company might even recoup some of the $334 million in loans it charged off during the quarter, mostly in the oil and gas sector. **********Mr. Mason said that a ''substantial portion'' of the problem loans were concentrated among 40 or 50 credits. But he added that despite the loss of almost $200 million, Interfirst's primary capital, at 6.2 percent of total assets, is among the strongest of the nation's 15 largest banks.

Andropov's latest arms control statement. **********The official said the Soviet leader, in an interview in Pravda made public on Friday, had made one forthcoming statement - that Moscow would destroy and not just relocate any missiles it agreed to reduce from its force of missiles in the European part of the Soviet Union. **********''The difficulty in his remarks, however,'' the official said in an interview, ''is that they don't address the two basic problems in the negotiations.'' **********Problem of American Missiles **********The official, who is involved in arms control policy and asked not to be identified by name, said the first problem was Mr. Andropov's continuing insistence that no new American missiles, either Pershing 2 or cruise missiles, should be deployed in Europe as planned by the Western alliance. Mr. Andropov repeated that the Soviet Union would reduce its force level in Europe to match the total of French and British missiles there - some 162. But he stressed again that there could be no new American deployment. **********''Until he acknowledges that the United States has the right of parity with the Soviet Union on missiles, there will be no deal,'' the American official said.   Missiles in Asia **********The second problem, he said, dealt with the renewed American insistence that any agreement on limits on the Soviet SS-20 mobile missile system be ''universal,'' meaning that any limits be imposed not only in Europe but in the Soviet force in Asia as well. This is to prevent the Soviet Union from agreeing to tight limits on the size of its force in Europe while continuing to build new missiles in Asia, or retaining large numbers of missiles in Asia that in an emergency could be moved quickly to Europe. **********There are about 350 SS-20 missiles, each with three nuclear warheads, in the Soviet Union, of which about 250 are in the European part and the rest in Soviet Asia. **********Until Friday, the Soviet side had left open the possibility of making cuts in its European force and moving the remainder to the Asian area. Mr. Andropov said on Friday that those cut would be ''liquidated.'' The senior official said there was considerable speculation within the Administration that Mr. Andropov's remarks were only the start of what will be a concerted Soviet effort to appear increasingly forthcoming as the date for deployment of the American missiles grows near, while at the same time warning that the deployment will cause a new chill in relations.   'Seek a Delay in Deployment' **********''They will do their best to get the West Germans to seek a delay in deployment, to give more time for negotiations,'' the official said. The first deployment of some Pershing 2 missiles is to begin in West Germany, with cruise missiles to be deployed later in Britain, Italy, and West Germany, and perhaps in Belgium and the Netherlands. **********Another official said the chief American negotiator at the talks on medium-range missiles, Paul H. Nitze, has told aides in Washington that he does not expect any substantial progress until the first missiles are actually deployed and Moscow realizes it cannot prevent the step. **********In a formal comment on Mr. Andropov's latest proposal, the State Department said on Friday night: **********''We have seen the reports of General Secretary Andropov's comments. We have long asked the Soviets whether they intended to destroy missiles or merely relocate them, and have made clear that mere relocation would not be a serious arms control measure. If the Soviets were to confirm this position at the negotiating table in Geneva, we would consider it to be a positive sign.'' **********''Unfortunately, however, the Soviets continue to claim a right to match independent British and French nuclear forces,'' the department said. ''Thus there does not appear to be any change in the Soviet pursuit of an unequal outcome that would allow them to maintain most of their existing SS-20 forces while blocking NATO from deploying a U.S. deterrent to that force, and thus maintaining a Soviet monopoly in these systems.''  Talks Resume Sept. 6 **********''Moreover, the Soviets continue to seek an agreement that would be limited only to Europe,'' it said. ''The sizable Soviet SS-20 force in Asia apparently would remain unconstrained and could continue to grow, as it currently is doing. Because of the range, mobility and transportability of the SS-20, these missile would continue to pose a threat to Europe as well as Asia.'' **********The department said the United States would explore with the Russians any possibility of progress when the negotiations resume on Sept. 6 in Geneva. **********Secretary of State George P. Shultz is also due to meet in Madrid that week with Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko. They will be there for the closing ceremonies of the East- West meeting on the Helsinki security and cooperation conference. And they will meet again later next month in New York. The missile question is likely to be raised both times. **********When the negotiations on medium-range missiles began in 1981, the United States said it would cancel plans for deployment of the 572 missiles only if Moscow agreed to the destruction of all of their missiles in the same category, and added that the SS-20's had to be dismantled even if they were based in Soviet Asia. **********Earlier this year, under pressure from the European allies, the United States modified its proposal and said it would agree to a compromise by which the United States and the Soviet Union would agree to an equal number of missiles, fewer than the 572, and more than zero. American officials have said the Soviet Union has refused to discuss any compromise that would allow the United States to deploy any missiles and has also rejected the earlier proposal for the abolition of all such missiles."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/09/business/business-people-diasonics-lists-changes-in-fischer-acquisition.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1983-06-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 210, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Diasonics Lists Changes In Fischer Acquisition", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Diasonics Lists Changes In Fischer Acquisition", "body_text": " **********Diasonics Inc., a growing maker of high-technology medical equipment, said yesterday that Albert S.

A related concern on the agenda with Prime Minister Nakasone is the state of the Japanese yen, which officials of both nations feel is undervalued.

She said the participants in the conference here spoke with ''complete unanimity'' in accusing the United States of holding up progress on Namibia.

''This is the future of the oil industry,'' said Randall G. Gossen, production manager here at the oil sands pilot project of Imperial Oil Ltd. **********Imperial is near a final decision on whether to proceed with a smaller oil sands project at Cold Lake than a previously abandoned ''megaproject.'' The British Petroleum Company and Petro-Canada recently announced a 7,000-barrel-a-day plant. And the oil industry is pressing ahead with plans for some 60 pilot projects. Production Costs Reduced **********Moreover, production costs have been reduced at both of Alberta's existing oil sands plants, which together account for 10 percent of Canada's petroleum production. **********At one plant Syncrude Canada Ltd., a joint venture involving private companies and the Canadian and Alberta governments, has reduced its operating cost to $19 to $20 a barrel. In some months it has been as low as $12.50. **********At the other plant Suncor Inc., a unit of the Sun Company, has overcome technical problems that previously made it an achievement just to operate continuously as long as eight hours. Both the Syncrude and Suncor projects are near Fort McMurray, Alberta. **********But future progress will not be easy. Oil from the sands is thicker than molasses, so it requires expensive upgrading if it is to be used for much besides asphalt. **********A key question is how much bitumin, as oil from the sands is called, can be sold in existing markets, mainly refineries in the northern tier of the United States. After such markets are saturated, the bitumin will have to be upgraded into much higher-quality crude oil before it can be sold. Most companies are trying to avoid the cost of upgrading it until it is absolutely required. Mining or Steam Injection **********Moreover, there are few natural underground pressures that would force the heavy oil to the surface. So it must be either mined as if it were a mineral or coaxed from the earth through such expensive techniques as steam injection. The consequence is a production cost estimated to be 20 times that of Saudi Arabia's gushers. **********''It isn't all sweetness and light getting the stuff out,'' said G.E. Courtnage, vice president of Esso Canada Resources, an Imperial subsidiary. **********Further, Alberta and other producing areas are currently unable to sell all the conventional oil they pump. Investment in alternative fuels has been sharply curbed by lower oil prices. Expectations of future price rises have diminished in magnitude, and prospects for big offshore finds overshadow oil sands, in the opinion of many analysts. **********A major result has been the cancellation or postponement of the bigger projects intended to tap the tar sands, as the deposits are sometimes called. The most prominent were Alsands, a Shell Oil project that was meant to produce 137,000 barrels of top-quality oil a day near Fort McMurray, canceled last year, and a 140,000-barrel-aday Imperial plant here that was shelved in 1981. Wary of 'Megaprojects' **********Both companies withdrew from the project because of the combination of inflation, high interest rates, plunging oil prices, shifting government policies and the immense capital cost. **********''Big is ugly - people are scared of the megaprojects,'' said Ian Doig, an independent Calgary oil analyst.  Donald K. McIvor, chairman of Imperial, recently said that carrying through the originally planned Cold Lake project, with a cost estimate that had surged to $12 billion, from $7 billion in 1977, would be equivalent to ''betting the company'' on one investment. **********Accordingly, Imperial (which is 70 percent owned by the Exxon Corporation) and other companies are responding to capital limitations by adopting more modest projects that could later be expanded. An example is the plan recently announced by British Petroleum and Petro-Canada. The companies will spend $200 million on a 7,000-barrel-a-day oil sands plant at Wolf Lake, Alberta. They expect to put $750 million more into the project over its 25-year life. **********The Wolf Lake endeavor is aided by royalty concessions from Alberta's provincial goverment and tax cuts by Ottawa. After capital in the project has been recovered plus a 10 percent return, full payments to the governments are to be reinstated. Plants to Get World Price **********In addition, the national Government is allowing all oil sands plants to receive the world price for their product, something Suncor attained only in 1981. Unlike the United States, Canada still has price controls on crude oil. **********Both the Cold Lake and Wolf Lake projects would involve pumping the heavy oil to the surface through wells. To facilitate this process, steam is injected - at first in bursts and then continuously. **********This method differs from that of Syncrude and Suncor. They use strip mining to extract the oil sands, from which the oil is then squeezed. Less than 10 percent of Canada's oil sands can be mined, while wells must be used for the rest. Of the 1,000 billion barrels of oil believed to be trapped in the sands, about one-fifth could be recovered with present technology. **********The Canada Center for Mineral and Energy Technology, a federal research arm, is now advocating smaller plants producing about 25,000 barrels a day rather than the 100,000-barrel giants previously considered necessary to take advantage of scale economies. The shorter construction time and smaller initital investment, the center calculates, mean that companies can get back their investment in 15 percent less time. Decision on Further Outlay **********Imperial will probably decide later this summer whether to spend $400 million to build 20,000 barrels of additional daily capacity.  That would be in addition to the 13,000 barrels a day now produced in a pilot project. Further 10,000 barrel-a-day increments would then follow as needed. **********But development depends on oil prices. Financially struggling Venezuela, which boasts trillions of barrels of exceptionally heavy oil, has recently postponed exploitation of its rich Orinoco oil belt as a result of declining prices. **********''If prices took another $5-a-barrel drop, it would take the fun out of it,'' Imperial's Mr. Courtnage said of the Cold Lake project."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/10/business/first-chicago-in-pact-for-american-national.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1983-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 525, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FIRST CHICAGO IN PACT FOR AMERICAN NATIONAL", "print_headline": "FIRST CHICAGO IN PACT FOR AMERICAN NATIONAL", "body_text": " **********The Walter E.

After winter hibernation in storage parks, swarms of small cars emerge from covers of plastic, canvas or cardboard to undergo preparations for the open road. **********Readying a Zhiguli, Moskvich or Zaporozhets for a trip to the dacha can be taxing. With spare parts in pitifully short supply, replacing items that have been pilfered can take weeks of hunting, often ending only with the payment of a bribe. Cars that have survived the winter intact must be cleaned and tuned lest they fall foul of regulations authorizing police officers to pull dirty or noisy vehicles off the road. **********Hazards on the Highway **********On the highway, there are fresh problems. Police officers lurk in every hollow with the scourge of Soviet drivers, the pocket holepunch. Jumping a light, speeding or giving the officer an argument can result in a license's immediate perforation. After three punches the license is seized, obliging the offender to spend months requalifying at driver's school. **********About 50,000 people die in accidents every year, which is more than the 1982 traffic death toll in the United States, where there are many times more vehicles. Even major highways are strewn with potholes after the six-month winter, and long stretches lack even a center line. Road signs are erratic, and routinely ignored. Drunks staggering into the road are a hazard day and night. **********It's small wonder Russian drivers say that owning a car brings joy twice in an owner's life - when it is picked up and when it is sold.  In between, they say, there is only torture. **********The travails are the greater for the passion that attaches to driving. Mass production of private cars was virtually unknown until the 1970's, and the result has been car craze of the kind that flourished among Americans in the days of the Model T. Even now output runs at barely 1.4 million cars a year, about one-sixth of the Detroit figure; and a third of these are exported, the bulk to Eastern Europe. Languishing on the Waiting List **********At least two million people languish on the waiting list. Full payment is demanded in advance, and delivery can take years. For many the only shortcut is a bribe, sometimes as cash payment that can double prohibitive sticker prices. **********The most expensive of the six basic models on the market, the Volga, a four-cylinder sedan about the size of a midsize Ford, runs about 15,000 rubles, more than $20,000 at the official rate of exchange. The most popular, the Zhiguli, a copy of a 10-year-old Fiat 124, comes in four versions that start at $9,000. The cheapest model, a Zaporozhets, about the size of an English Mini, costs $5,700. **********At prevailing wage rates, an industrial worker would have to commit about 43 months' cash income to buy a top-of-the-line Zhiguli, about 10 times as much as his American counterpart would have to put toward a comparable car. Nor does he have any assurance that the vehicle delivered will be in sound running order, as the volume of outraged letters to the Soviet newspapers attests. **********Readers writing to Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya told last year of new cars that had to be towed off the lot because of missing batteries, improperly assembled gearboxes and other woes. One Zaporozhets owner told how he had had his new car replaced on the warranty twice, but had not turned a wheel in four years because of defects. 'A Pig in a Poke' **********A man described the scene as his wait for a new Zhiguli ended: ''After filling out the documents, the store officials wheeled the car out and said, 'Take it away.' The car was filthy, and even from a cursory inspection it was not ready for delivery, some parts being missing. When I asked why the pre-sale service had not been carried out, they made fun of me and advised me to take it as it was, or others would take it. Our family saved money for many years and bought a pig in a poke.'' **********Obtaining parts is a nightmare. The state runs a network of special over-the-counter stores, but the hoarding of parts for black market sale causes most of the supplies to be re-directed to the service centers run by manufacturers, where customers are supposed to prove their need for an item. **********This creates new opportunities for unscrupulous service mechanics, who take payoffs of up to 10 times the state price to ''find'' a needed part in the stores or charge a fee to move customers' cars to the head of the line. An owner can wait months for attention.  Although the number of mechanics has increased from 6,000 to 10,000 in a decade, the number of private cars has risen even more swiftly, to 8.5 million, and service centers are swamped. **********One official estimated that 5 of every 10 cars are fixed ''on the side'' by free enterprise repairmen operating illicitly in backstreet garages, usually with stolen parts. **********Customers who persist at the official centers risk having their vehicles cannibalized by mechanics who substitute faulty parts for good ones, a practice so common that most centers now itemize removable objects before accepting a machine for service. One Moscow official estimated that less than a quarter of the demand for the most frequently needed Zhiguli parts can be met from state supplies.  The balance must be made up by the street-corner market in stolen parts, most of them taken from parked cars. Pride in Washing and Polishing **********For all their troubles, dedicated motorists outnumber those who sell their cars. With public transport erratic and overloaded, private cars have given new freedom to families looking for a weekend in the country or a picnic at a secluded spot out of town. **********In the spring it is common to see squads of Zhigulis and Moskviches lined up by a lake or a river as proud owners wash and polish them to an impressive shine. But the motorist can never relax. If he escapes the attentions of the police he has to keep a wary eye on other drivers, whose rudeness is a subject of frequent criticism in the press. ''Drivers, fenced off from the rest of the world, are becoming less sensitive to others of their kind, and to everything living,'' Sovetskaya Rossiya complained last year. **********The paper suggested that many problems could be averted by restricting drivers' licenses to ''good decent people,'' but it added disconsolately that the idea, though just, was perhaps naive."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/05/business/more-steel-closings-expected.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1983-12-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1066, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MORE STEEL CLOSINGS EXPECTED", "print_headline": "MORE STEEL CLOSINGS EXPECTED", "body_text": " **********The production capacity of the nation's steel industry is likely to shrink at least 10 percent over the next two or three years, analysts say. The first of a new wave of plant closings and write-offs, they predict, will be announced by the United States Steel Corporation later this month. **********In addition, the company resulting from the proposed merger of the Republic Steel Corporation and the LTV Corporation, the parent of the Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, is expected to close several major facilities early next year. **********Industry analysts, steel company executives and even union officials say the industry will cut back to reduce costs and make domestic steel more competitive with lower-cost imports. The domestic industry is still operating at less than 60 percent of capacity, even though the economic recovery is a year old. **********Cut of 15 or 20 Million Tons **********''The big thing that's going to happen in the next few years is the industry's restructuring,'' said Peter L. Anker, an analyst with the First Boston Corporation. ''I think that 15 or 20 million tons will be cut in the next three years.'' **********According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, domestic steelmaking capacity totals 153 million tons of raw steel. Many analysts say, however, that because of such recent moves as Armco's shutdown of its Houston Works and the closing of facilities in Lackawanna, N.Y., by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the capacity is actually more than 10 million tons below that figure. **********For months, officials from U.S. Steel, the nation's largest steelmaker, have said they are studying a reconfiguration of their operations and will announce their decisions in the fourth quarter. **********Analyst Meeting Put Off **********Speculation that large write-offs will be announced later this month increased last week when U.S. Steel postponed until after the year-end a meeting with financial analysts that was scheduled for today. The company said it wanted to hold the meeting only after its restructuring decisions are disclosed. **********John C. Tumazos, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company, predicts that U.S. Steel will announce as much as $1 billion in write-offs after its board meeting, tentatively scheduled for Dec. 27. The anticipated write- offs, analysts said, would be the company's largest since it shut 13 facilities and laid off 13,000 workers in 1979. **********Mr. Tumazos said that with U.S. Steel opening a state-of-the-art pipe mill in Fairfield, Ala., it will likely shut its 2.9 million-ton-a-year National Duquesne Works in Duquesne and McKeesport, Pa. **********Tin Can Market **********With tin plate capacity far above demand because of aluminum's erosion of the tin can market, Mr. Tumazos and other analysts predict the company will permanently write off its already shut tin mill and possibly other facilities at its Fairfield Works. **********Although U.S. Steel now says there is a good chance it will build a much postponed rail mill at its South Works in Chicago - that is, if it wins further government aid and union concessions - Mr. Tumazos and other analysts say the company will still write off the South Works' 2.2-million-ton- a-year basic oxygen furnaces and its plate and structural finishing mills. **********Frank Valenta, director of the Cleveland district of the United Steelworkers of America, said the company will likely close its Cuyahoga Works in Cleveland, where rod and flat-rolled steel are made. He said company officials told him that they would close the mill unless the union accepted further concessions. According to Mr. Valenta, the plant's 500 workers have voted against new concessions. **********'A Lost Year' **********''I'll be very surprised if they don't move this quarter to take their write- offs,'' said Charles A. Bradford, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, about U.S. Steel. ''The industry sees 1983 as a lost year, so they figure they might as well take their write-offs now and look forward to an improved 1984.'' **********A U.S. Steel spokesman declined to say which facilities, if any, the company plans to close. Nor would he say whether there will be an announcement later this month about his company's efforts to import 3 million tons of semifinished slabs a year from Britain for its mill in Fairless, Pa. **********Analysts also predicted that if the Department of Justice and shareholders approve the proposed merger of Republic Steel and LTV, the merged company will soon move to close inefficient or redundant facilities. **********Peter F. Marcus, an analyst with Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins, predicts that the merged company will reduce its capacity to 19 million tons, from 24 million.   Likely Targets **********The most likely targets for permanent write-offs, analysts say, are Jones & Laughlin's mill in Alquippa, Pa., which makes flat-rolled products, and Republic's Buffalo mill, which makes bars. **********Another facility that many analysts predict will be written off is the pipe mill that the National Steel Corporation, now a subsidiary of National Intergroup Inc., built in Liberty, Tex., in 1976 at a cost of $60 million. A spokesman said National is looking to sell the already closed mill, but with pipe demand as depressed as it is, analysts said the company may not be able to find a buyer. **********Edmund Ayoub, chief economist for the steelworkers union, agreed that capacity will be cut because of the industry's low operating rate. He said dropoffs in domestic production have been caused by downsizing of automobiles, greater use of aluminum and thinner steel in automobiles and increased imports of steel and of goods that contain steel. **********Sharp Reduction in Employment **********Shipments of finished steel by domestic steelmakers dropped from 100 million tons in 1979 to 61.6 million last year, with industry employment plummeting from 453,000 to 289,000 during that time. Shipments are expected to be 68 million tons this year and 78 million next year. In the United States, 100 tons of raw steel produce on the average 80 tons of finished steel. **********''The prospects for substantially improving shipments are unlikely,'' said Mr. Ayoub, ''unless there is a major capital goods boom or massive investment in the nation's infrastructure, neither of which appears to be in the offing.'' Like the American Iron and Steel Institute, his union supports a temporary quota on imports to protect the industry so it can modernize and compete better with foreign producers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/08/business/kerr-mcgee-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 55, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KERR-MCGEE CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "KERR-MCGEE CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/15/business/about-real-estate-status-of-new-york-tenants-rights-to-sublet-is-hazy.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Oser", "pub_date": "1983-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 862, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STATUS OF NEW YORK TENANTS' RIGHTS TO SUBLET IS HAZY", "print_headline": "ABOUT REAL ESTATE; STATUS OF NEW YORK TENANTS' RIGHTS TO SUBLET IS HAZY", "body_text": " **********A recent decision in a New York sublet case seems to have added to the confusion over who the courts believe should have the right to control the choice of new occupants when tenants move out of rental apartments. **********In the case, called Vance v. Century Apartments Associates, the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court appears to have stepped away from the view that the applicable state statute, known as Section 226b, confers broad powers upon tenants to select their successor tenants through a sublease or assignment. **********The purpose of Section 226b, the majority in the Vance case said last week, was to prevent a landlord from withholding consent ''to a legitimately proposed assignment or sublease to a financially responsible assignee or subtenant.'' The law's purpose, it added, ''was not to create a new class of landlord.'' **********But an earlier Appellate Division ruling, in Conrad v. Third Sutton Realty, opened the door to that very result in the opinion of many apartment owners and managers. Apparently either a test case will have to reach the Court of Appeals or the Legislature will have to act before it becomes clear to tenants and owners alike just how far tenants' rights go. **********In a sublet, the prime tenant retains all rights in the apartment.  In an assignment, the prime tenant yields those rights to the assignee. **********Part of Section 226b says: ''A tenant renting a residence in a dwelling having four or more residential units shall have the right to sublease or assign his premises, subject to the written consent of the landlord given in advance of the sublease or assignment. Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the landlord unreasonably withholds consent for such sublease or assignment, the landlord must release the tenant from the lease upon request of the tenant.'' **********The law also states the procedure and timing for all of this to be done. **********The Legislature approved Section 226b in 1975. For years landlords interpreted it to mean that, if they denied a tenant's request for a sublease or assignment, the tenant was merely released from his obligations under the lease without penalty. But, it was thought, the tenant could not proceed to sublet or assign without consent. **********Then came the Conrad case. The building's owner, Third Sutton Realty, denied consent to sublet but did not say why. The court found that its failure to provide reasons for rejection amounted to consent. It even described Section 226b as intended to give tenants ''a valuable right and asset, to offset an owner's ability to obtain vacancies for the purpose of reletting.'' Later lower court decisions extended the Conrad philosophy to assignments as well as sublets. **********But what are ''reasonable'' grounds for rejection? That has yet to be established. In one case, Kreitman v. Einy, the Appellate Division ruled that the existence of a waiting list for an apartment is not reasonable ground to deny a tenant the right to assign his lease. **********If the Kreitman case or any similar case gets to the Court of Appeals, it may become the vehicle for more definitive judicial guidance. It could also give the state's highest court an opportunity to distinguish between sublets and assignments in deciding when it is reasonable for an owner to withhold consent. The two are quite different relationships because an assignment creates a new prime tenant, while a sublet does not. **********Finally, the Court of Appeals might clarify the tenant's remedy if he is refused permission to sublet or assign.  The issues are particularly pertinent because of cooperative conversions. Many prime tenants who want to move may try to sublet their apartment, mainly to preserve their right to buy at the favorable insider's price if there is a co-op conversion. **********In the Vance case, Patrick Vance and his wife, Connie, sought permission through a lawyer to sublet their apartment at 25 Central Park West for a term 15 days shorter than the term of their lease while they moved to a larger apartment in Pelham, N.Y. **********The landlord rejected the request, saying there was no reason to believe the Vances ever intended to reoccupy the apartment or had any intention of maintaining it as their primary residence. It ''would appear that they are trying to keep a connection with this apartment, for reasons known only to themselves, perhaps for reasons of financial gain,'' the landlord said. **********The Appellate Division majority that found for the landlord consisted of Presiding Justice Francis T. Murphy Jr., Theodore R.  Kupferman and Fritz W. Alexander. The dissenters were Justices Arnold L. Fein and Bentley Kassal. Justice Kassal, in his dissent, said the statute clearly gives the tenant the right to sublet regardless of whether he intends to maintain the apartment as his primary residence in the future. **********The landlord in the case was represented by Jeffrey R. Metz of Finkelstein, Borah, Schwartz, Altschuler & Goldstein. The tenant was represented by Menachim J.

A drop of about $1 billion had been expected. **********Some economists predicted that the spurt in interest rates by more than a tenth of a percentage point for some short-term securities would lead to an increase in prime rates at banks, on which loans to most businesses are based. **********A higher prime rate ''would not be surprising,'' said Charles Lieberman, an economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. ''We did get Marty Feldstein's blessing for it.'' Martin S. Feldstein, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, testified before Congress this week that an increase in the prime rate might be warranted. The prime rate currently stands at 10 1/2 percent. **********Watching Federal Funds **********''If the Federal funds rate gets above 9 1/2 percent, and if it hits 10 percent on any day, that might be enough to push up the prime,'' said Edward H. Boss Jr., vice president and economist of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago. **********The rate on Federal funds, which are overnight funds that banks trade among themselves, is the rate that is most directly affected by Federal Reserve policy. Changes in the Federal funds rate often foreshadow movements in other interest rates. **********When the money supply grows more rapidly than desired by the Fed, the central bank often reduces the amount of money available to the markets, driving up the Federal funds rate. Markets Chagrined **********For that reason, the money markets were chagrined by the Fed announcement yesterday. The Government's 30-year bond dropped more than a point in price following the money supply announcement, to 89.22 from 90.27. That was on top of a steep decline earlier in the day. The full day's decline from Thursday amounted to almost 2 1/4 points. **********Short-term rates also climbed sharply following the Fed announcement. The rate on three-month Treasury bills rose 14 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 9.25 percent, and six-month bills rose 14 basis points, to 9.36 percent. **********The reaction was not only to the $300 million increase in the basic money supply, but also to an upward revision of $200 million for the previous reported week, ended July 6. That made last week's money supply increase $6 billion instead of $5.8 billion. **********M-1, the basic money supply, is supposed to reflect money that is readily available for spending. It consists of currency in circulation and balances in check-like accounts in banks and savings institutions. **********Earlier in the year, M-1 grew far more quickly than the Federal Reserve had wanted, and this week Paul A. Volcker, the Fed chairman, announced that a new base had been established for money growth, because any attempt to bring M-1 into line with the original targets would have imperiled the economic recovery. Mr. Volcker also said that the growth rate for M-1 would be widened to a range of between 5 percent and 9 percent, up from a range of between 4 percent and 8 percent. Some Bankers Are Unruffled **********Some economists said they thought the markets had overreacted to the money supply figures. Cengiz Israfil, for example, vice president of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, said that Mr. Volcker, in his testimony before Congress, had stated that the Fed would deemphasize M-1 in formulating policy. ''There seems to be no further tightening from what already had been announced,'' Mr. Israfil said. **********Under the new targets, M-1 can rise by somewhat more than $800 million a week. Thus, with the $300 million rise announced yesterday, the money supply, at $514.6 billion, is only $2.4 billion above its new target, Mr. Israfil said. 'Pleasant Surprises' **********And Philip Braverman, vice president of the Chase Manhattan Bank, predicted that ''there will be pleasant surprises announced on Monday that should temper today's bearishness in the money markets.'' **********Mr. Braverman said that the Administration will announce that, because of the stronger-than-expected economic recovery, the budget deficit will be smaller than predicted and that Government borrowings this quarter would be $5 billion below the $55 billion that had been expected. Lower borrowing demands by the Government relieve pressures in the credit markets and can lead to lower interest rates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/25/business/reliance-group-in-pact-for-pargas.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reliance Group In Pact for Pargas", "print_headline": "Reliance Group In Pact for Pargas", "body_text": " **********Pargas Inc. and Reliance Group Holdings Inc. said they had signed an agreement whereby Reliance Group would acquire Pargas for $37.25 a share, or a total of $155 million in cash.

Shultz to discuss South Africa's occupation of South-West Africa and the presence of Cuban troops in Angola, Administration officials said. **********The officials said the visitor, Lieut. Col. Manuel Alexandre Rodrigues, held talks with State Department officials and might meet Vice President Bush on Thursday or Friday. Colonel Rodrigues, who is Interior Minister, is regarded as the No.2 man in Angola. **********The United States and Angola have no diplomatic relations, and the possibility of establishing ties after a withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola was also discussed in the last few days, officials said. **********Minimum of Publicity **********This is the 11th round of Angolan-American talks in two years, officials said, and the first in Washington. Other sessions have been held in Luanda, the Angolan capital, at the United Nations and in other cities abroad.  Like this round, they have been held with a minimum of publicity. **********The last session, between Colonel Rodrigues and Frank G. Wisner, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, was held on March 15 and 16 in Paris. **********The Angolans asked the United States then to hold the next meeting in Washington. This led to hope within the State Department, officials said, that Colonel Rodrigues would carry with him a detailed proposal for parallel Cuban and South African withdrawals as a way of ending the stalemate. 25,000 Cubans in Angola **********But the officials said the Angolan had not made such a proposal.  He has indicated in conversations, however, that Angolan officials understand that it will be impossible to achieve the independence of South-West Africa, commonly known as Namibia, unless there is an agreement on some kind of parallel action to end the presence of the 25,000 Cubans in Angola and the 15,000 South Africans in Namibia. **********The United States has also told Angola that until there is agreement on troop withdrawals, it will not be possible to normalize relations between Washington and Luanda. **********The United States and four other Western nations - Britain, Canada, France and West Germany - have been negotiating with Angola and South Africa on conditions for the independence of Namibia within the framework of United Nations Security Council Resolution 435. **********That resolution calls for a cease-fire, South Africa's withdrawal from the territory, the deployment of United Nations forces and observers, and elections. **********The South Africans, backed by the United States, have said they will not leave Namibia until they are sure the Cubans have left neighboring Angola. The United States, which backed the losing side in the 1975 Angolan civil war, has also made the withdrawal of Cuban forces a condition for diplomatic ties. **********The Angolans have repeatedly rejected any formal attempts at directly linking the South African withdrawal from Namibia with the Cuban withdrawal from Angola. The Angolans have noted that the Security Council resolution said nothing about the Cubans. An Understanding Reported **********But American officials said that although there was no direct link, the Angolans had made it clear that they understood there had to be a parallel withdrawal during roughly the same time period for there to be an accord. **********Mr. Shultz, at a news conference on Tuesday, said, ''We and others have been working long and hard to bring about an independent Namibia, and we find that in order to do that - it is obviously not an integrated part of the negotiation - but in order to bring it off, we have to see some sort of program for the withdrawal of foreign forces, Cuban forces in this case, from the area so that South Africa will have confidence that it is not being surrounded or having on its borders the Soviet proxy forces.'' Cloaked in Secrecy **********Colonel Rodrigues's trip here has been cloaked in secrecy. Upon arrival in New York last weekend he was taken to a house in suburban Connecticut for preliminary talks with American officials, and then flown to Washington. His meeting with Mr. Shultz was not on the Secretary's official schedule. **********First word of his presence in this country came from a dispatch by Agence France-Presse from Luanda that was confirmed by State Department officials when reporters asked about the article. **********According to American officials, Colonel Rodrigues is the senior Angolan official in charge of the security forces, and is the principal liaison with the Cubans. He also has been in charge of the talks with the United States and has been involved in the recent talks between Angola and South Africa on establishing a cease-fire. **********Only President Jose Eduardo dos Santos is regarded as more important in Angola than Colonel Rodrigues, officials said.  American officials refused to predict today if the sides were any closer to an agreement. One official said he thought the Administration was overly optimistic in the past about an early accord, and it would be better now to avoid setting any more target dates.

Sales in the latest quarter were $4.3 billion, up from $3.3 billion a year before, while sales for the full year totaled $18.9 billion, up from 1981's $13.9 billion. **********A Different Kind of Market **********The company's 1981 earnings, achieved in spite of lower sales revenues, were primarily attributable to the profitability of tubular piping that year, according to Charles Bradford, a steel analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith. U.S. Steel is the largest producer of tubular piping, which is used in energy exploration, and the product was ''extremely expensive'' in 1981, Mr. Bradford said.  An oversupply of oil on world markets and declining petroleum prices dampened oil and natural gas exploration last year. **********The company reported that its steel operations showed an operating loss of $852 million last year as its shipments of steel dropped to their lowest levels since 1938. Last year U.S. Steel shipped 10.3 million tons of steel products, down from 16.6 million tons during 1981. **********The big steelmaker was spared harsher losses last year by the performance of its nonsteel operations, which David M. Roderick, the company's chairman, said were profitable ''despite the severity of the recession.'' U.S. Steel, which acquired the Marathon Oil Company last year, said that oil and gas sales accounted for 51 percent of its total sales in 1982, while steel accounted for 28 percent. A Good Year at Marathon Oil **********The company had told analysts last November that it expected a loss for 1982. It lost $82.4 million in the third quarter of last year after earning $4.3 million in the second quarter and $79.9 million in the first. **********Like most other steel companies, U.S. Steel has sought to diversify and thus reduce its dependence on steel. About 40 percent of its assets are now in Marathon. **********Mr. Roderick described Marathon as having had a ''very good year.'' Marathon's operating income, before foreign taxes, was $1.2 billion, its corporate parent said. **********But Mr. Bradford said that figure was ''very, very misleading.'' He explained that taxes would probably shrink Marathon's contribution to U.S. Steel's overall 1982 results to about $350 million. **********He also noted that yesterday's financial report showed that U.S.  Steel's cash and marketable securities had declined in value drastically, to $500 million, from $2.4 billion at the end of 1981. **********Shares of U.S. Steel ended yesterday's trading at 19 7/8, up 1/8, on the New York Stock Exchange. Wheeling-Pittsburgh **********The Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation, the nation's ninthlargest steel producer, continued the pattern of steel company losses in 1982. The company reported a fourth-quarter deficit of $33.2 million, in contrast to a profit of $13.6 million, or $3.19 a share, a year before. Sales fell to $157 million from $246.8 million. **********For the full year, the company lost $58.8 million on revenues of $755 million, against 1981's profit of $60.1 million, or $7.03 a share, on sales of $1.15 billion. **********Dennis J. Carney, chairman and chief executive officer, said Wheeling-Pittsburgh expects ''continuing very low levels of operation and losses during the first half of 1983,'' with any recovery in the second half of the year dependent on ''an upswing in the U.S. economy and a reduction in the record volume of steel imports.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/23/business/us-petroleum-data.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Petroleum Data", "print_headline": "U.S. Petroleum Data", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/18/business/mortgage-growth-investors-reports-earnings-for-yr-to-nov-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 51, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MORTGAGE GROWTH INVESTORS reports earnings for Yr to Nov 30", "print_headline": "MORTGAGE GROWTH INVESTORS reports earnings for Yr to Nov 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/11/business/two-lex-acquisitions.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Two Lex Acquisitions", "print_headline": "Two Lex Acquisitions", "body_text": " **********Lex Service P.L.C. said today that it had bought Sasco G.m.b.H. and Panel G.m.b.H., two private West German distributors of electronic components.

The first two were in Brussels in 1971 and 1976. **********The conference is meant not as a strategy and working session but as ''an international demonstration,'' according to Theodore R. Mann, chairman of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry. He said one of its goals would be to dramatize to the United States Government the broad American interest in the issue. **********Mr. Mann had both praise and criticism for the Reagan Administration's efforts. ''I think it's in the consciousness of the President and the Secretary of State,'' he said, noting that Secretary of State George P. Shultz had raised the issue with Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko of the Soviet Union. **********But the general state of Soviet-American relations worked against relaxation of the restrictions, he said. ''I don't see the point in being uncivil in relations between nations,'' Mr. Mann said, speaking of some of President Reagan's harsh comments about the Soviet Union.  ''I don't think calling them liars and cheats and an evil empire is proper discourse among superpowers in a dangerous world. I think this has something to do with the Soviet Union's treatment of human rights issues the United States thinks important.'' Mrs. Kirkpatrick Disagrees **********Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the United States representative at the United Nations, disagreed. She said at a news conference here that it was impossible to read the minds of Soviet leaders. ''The Soviets turn on and off the flow of emigration,'' she said, ''and they've been doing it for some time. None of us is quite sure what the causal relationship is at a given time.'' **********Since 1971, about 270,000 Jews have emigrated from the Soviet Union, about 10 percent of the Soviet Jewish population, according to Jerry Goodman of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry. Of those, he said, about 170,000 have come to Israel, with most of the rest going to the United States. The rate of emigration has plummeted in recent years, down from a high of about 4,000 a month in 1979 to just 81 in January and 125 in February. **********''We had more Jews come out of Ethiopia in January than out of the Soviet Union,'' Mr. Mann said.  Last week, a 16-member delegation from the American Jewish Committee visited Leningrad and Moscow, talking with 25 to 30 poeple who have been refused exit visas and gathering impressions of what they portrayed as a hardening Soviet policy. The Soviet Position **********Maynard I. Wishner, president of the committee, said at a news conference today that many of those applying for permission to emigrate were being turned down without being given reasons and that the authorities appeared to be intercepting official invitations mailed by relatives abroad. Soviet procedure requires such invitations as evidence that emigration is being sought to reunify a family. **********Soviet officials have adopted the argument that all those who wanted to leave have left, Mr. Wishner reported, and that those few remaining have been held because of special technical reasons, such as their possession of state secrets. **********''I'm here to tell you that's a lie,'' Mr. Wishner declared, saying many Jews wanted to leave but could not. Nobody can say with certainty how many, he said, although another member of his party said that approximately 300,000 requests for family invitations had been received in the West from Soviet Jews. **********Mr. Wishner also conveyed reports of a surge of anti-Semitism. In Leningrad, he said, his group was told by Jewish activists of a game called concentration camp that is played by some children of early high school age. Number Instead of a Name **********''A child is given a number,'' Mr. Wishner explained, ''and invariably, we are told, it is a Jewish child who's given a number and by his school comrades is referred to by that number over the next period of days - called not by name, but by that number.'' **********Tuesday's opening session is to be addressed by Mrs. Kirkpatrick, President Yitzhak Navon of Israel, and Simone Veil of France, former President of the European Parliament. **********The meeting has drawn about 500 American delegates, Mr. Mann said.

So far, the company has been able to hold up its end of an increasingly heavy financing burden, and has retained the support of a majority of the project's other owners. **********But cracks have appeared in the once united front. A growing minority of the power companies with equity shares in the Seabrook project want the second reactor, now about 15 percent finished, either canceled or delayed while work continues on Seabrook 1, which is more than half completed. **********At an owners' meeting last month, however, the dissidents were easily outnumbered by a roughly 4-to-1 margin, with votes cast in proportion to the shares of ownership in the project, which is intended to supply electricity throughout New England.Costs Up Sharply **********One of the larger opponents was the New England Electric System, a Massachusetts-based utility holding company and the owner (through a subsidiary) of 10 percent of the project, whose cost estimate now ranges from $5.24 billion to $8.5 billion, up from less than $1 billion. ''We came to the conclusion that, due to a combination of factors, Seabrook 2 was no longer in the best interests of our customers,'' said Guy W. Nichols, New England Electric's president and chairman. **********It would take an 80 percent vote to cancel the project, so Public Service of New Hampshire, which owns 35 percent of Seabrook's shares, holds veto power. The company took the May vote as a ringing affirmation of the project. ''I don't see any cracks in the foundation,'' said Robert J. Harrison, president of the utility. ''I see one or two or three companies that felt it would be better to slow down.'' **********New England needs Seabrook, Mr. Harrison said, contending that calls for a delay or cancellation reflect short-sightedness among dissenting utilities. ''There will be a need for this capacity, and more, by the mid-1990's,'' he said. Critics disagree. They say that other sources and conservation - some of which may be the inevitable result of large rate increases that Seabrook will bring -will eliminate the need for Seabrook 2.Hundreds Jailed in Protest **********The Seabrook project has had its enemies since it was first proposed in 1972. Some of the fiercest environmental and political battles in the electric industry have been fought over the project.  One of the most memorable antinuclear demonstrations occurred in 1977 at the Seabrook plant site, an hour's drive from Public Service headquarters in Manchester, N.H., when hundreds of protesters were jailed for trespassing. **********But what the Clamshell Alliance, the principal organizer of the demonstration, could not accomplish, a cash-flow squeeze might. For the project, like other nuclear plants constructed in recent years, has seen vast cost increases that have caused increasingly difficult problems for its owners, particularly those whose shares are large relative to overall assets. **********Seabrook originally was to cost less than $1 billion. Today, because of regulatory changes, increases in construction costs and other factors, according to Public Service, the general contractor puts the cost at $5.24 billion, a figure called far too low by almost everyone familiar with the project. Even Public Service, ''for planning purposes,'' acknowledges that Seabrook may be more expensive than current official projections. Estimates by analysts range to more than $8.5 billion. **********Such numbers add up to problems for the owners, who anxiously await completion of the first reactor so it can be listed as an asset on which companies can earn a rate of return, thereby producing not only power but also cash flow. The New England states generally do not allow utilities to put unfinished plants into rate bases. **********When will Seabrook 1 be ready to go into operation? Public Service's contractor puts the date at December 1984; the company, which officially goes along with that estimate, nonetheless said last week that for financial planning purposes it would assume a start-up date of July 1985. Many analysts, however, doubt the plant will be ready before 1986.Utility's Bonds Downgraded **********Of all the owners, Public Service faces some of the most vexing problems, largely because of the huge size of the Seabrook investment compared with the company's other assets, roughly a 5-to-1 ratio upon completion. That, along with increasing costs and what Wall Street perceives to be unfriendly regulatory treatment in New Hampshire, worries many in the financial community. Moreover, by a number of financial yardsticks, the company compares poorly with 116 other investor-owned utilities across the nation, according to a study by Dean Witter Reynolds Capital Markets. And Moody's and Standard & Poor's have downgraded the company's bonds to ''speculative'' and ''very speculative.'' **********''Public Service Company is leveraged more than is prudent,'' said Jeff Hoffman, chief utilities analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''There is no question that Seabrook turned out to be more expensive than anyone thought it would be.'' **********Investors, however, continue to like Public Service. The company has confounded its critics, not to mention some of its friends, by showing a consistent ability to obtain capital financing even in tough markets, albeit at a premium. Public Service shares closed yesterday at $18.125, unchanged, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. **********The company's financing acumen will be more severely tested in the next several years, however, whether Seabrook 2 is canceled or not, because more than $400 million will have to be raised annually."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/07/world/kenya-tanzania-agreements.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 49, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kenya-Tanzania Agreements", "print_headline": "Kenya-Tanzania Agreements", "body_text": " **********Kenya and Tanzania have signed agreements on trade, transportation, tourism and telecommunications, the official Tanzania radio said today.

It came after three days of intensive political negotiations and an evening of street violence, both in reaction to the commission's report that Israeli leaders bore ''indirect responsibility'' for the killings of Palestinians in Beirut last September by Lebanese Christian Phalangists. **********As the ministers were deliberating, a hand grenade exploded in a group of anti-Government demonstrators outside the office of Prime Minister Menachem Begin. One man was killed and nine people, including two policemen, were wounded. The demonstrators had been heckled, taunted, shoved and punched by mobs of Government supporters as they paraded from the center of Jerusalem. (Page A10.) **********Sharon Said to Refuse to Quit **********Emerging from the meeting, which continued after the blast, Mr.  Sharon denounced the grenade attack as ''lunatic.'' When asked whether he was still Defense Minister he walked away. **********''I have no intention to react to the Government's decision, which speaks for itself,'' Mr. Sharon said, ''and I don't intend to say anything about my future steps.'' **********This morning, however, he submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Menachem Begin, effective Monday. Israel Radio said Mr.  Begin was likely to act as temporary Defense Minister. **********Mr. Sharon was reported to have told the Cabinet Thursday night he would refuse to resign. In turn, Mr. Begin was said to have told political associates that he could not bring himself to dismiss Mr.  Sharon. **********The possibility had been mentioned that Mr. Sharon might be retained in another Cabinet post, or as a minister without portfolio, with continued policy-making influence. Today, there were conflicting reports about whether he had resigned from the Cabinet or would remain in another capacity. Both Despised and Loved **********The Defense Minister has been the chief architect of Israel's strategy in the Lebanon war and of the Begin Government's policy of Jewish settlement on the West Bank. He has brought considerable friction to relations with the United States. **********A former general and war hero, he is both despised and loved in Israel. Many respect his tough, determined approach to complex problems, but others regard him as dangerous. One general who worked closely with him described him as having ''no moral brakes.'' **********The Government's decision, made on a motion by Mr. Begin and announced by the Cabinet Secretary, Dan Meridor, made no mention of early elections, which had been discussed by the six political parties that make up Mr. Begin's coalition. It was not clear whether these were a possibility or whether Mr. Begin might simply dissolve his Cabinet and form a new government from the present Parliament.  Most of the small parties oppose elections now, fearing they would lose seats. **********Mr. Begin and his Likud bloc, however, would do well, according to public opinion polls taken before the commission report.  The Prime Minister had opposed establishing a commission to investigate the massacre, arguing that Israel was not to blame. But enormous demonstrations and an uproar in the country, even within some of his coalition parties, forced a reversal. **********The result was a three-man panel that included the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Yitzhak Kahan, as chairman, plus Supreme Court Justice Aharon Barak and Yona Efrat, a retired major general. **********The commission's report said at least 700 died in the Beirut refugee camps, although no exact figure could be ascertained. Begin's 'Indifference' Condemned **********The commission found Mr. Begin accountable for showing ''absolutely no interest'' in the actions of the Phalangists after they had been ordered into the camps by the Israeli Army. This ''indifference'' deserved to be condemned, the panel concluded. **********Mr. Sharon was assailed for failing to anticipate the probability of a massacre by the Phalangists. ''No prophetic powers were required to know that concrete danger of acts of slaughter existed when the Phalangists were moved into the camps without the I.D.F.'s being with them in that operation and without the I.D.F. being able to maintain effective and onging supervision of their actions there,'' the commission said, using the initials for the Israel Defense Forces. **********''The sense of such a danger should have been in the consciousness of every knowledgeable person who was close to this subject,'' it said, ''and certainly in the consciousness of the Defense Minister, who took an active part in everything relating to the war.'' The panel said that this ''humanitarian obligation'' was paramount, but that ''this consideration did not concern him in the least.'' Three Generals Censured **********The three generals who came in for the strongest censure from the commission were the Chief of Staff, Lieut. Gen. Rafael Eytan; the Director of Military Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Yehoshua Saguy, and the division commander in the Beirut area, Brig. Gen. Amos Yaron. **********General Eytan is due to retire in April; otherwise, the commission said, it would recommend his resignation or dismissal. He ignored reports he was getting of murders in the camps and allowed the Phalangist forces to remain there, the panel found. **********General Saguy, although long opposed to the close Israeli ties with the Phalangists, failed to give adequate warning of the potential for a massacre, the commission said. General Yaron, who opposed Israel's entry into West Beirut, received reports of civilians being killed, the panel found, but did not pass them to his superiors and did not halt the Phalangist operations after receiving the reports. **********The head of Northern Command, Maj. Gen. Amir Drori, was also criticized, but his dismissal was not recommended. Attention Deflected From Begin **********One effect of the Cabinet deliberations in recent days has been to deflect attention from Prime Minister Begin as one of those accountable. The commission reported that Mr. Begin did not know beforehand that the Phalangists were being sent by his army into the camps. Nor did he learn of the massacre from his own officials; he first heard about it while listening to a news broadcast of the British Broadcasting Corporation late in the afternoon of Saturday, Sept. 18, hours after the Phalangists had left the camps. **********If, after learning that the Phalangists had gone into the refugee camps, he had taken an interest in what they were doing, the commission said, this ''would have increased the alertness of the Defense Minister and the Chief of Staff to the need to take appropriate measures to meet the expected danger.'' **********''The Prime Minister's lack of involvement in the entire matter casts on him a certain degree of responsibility,'' the report said.  There has been no indication, however, that Mr. Begin will suffer politically. Many of his most vocal supporters have made it clear that they are still behind him."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/11/business/conna-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-feb-6.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONNA CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Feb 6", "print_headline": "CONNA CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Feb 6", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/03/business/gulf-is-said-to-sell-nordic-operations.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 197, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gulf Is Said to Sell Nordic Operations", "print_headline": "Gulf Is Said to Sell Nordic Operations", "body_text": " **********The Gulf Oil Corporation is planning to sell its refining and marketing operations in Sweden and Denmark, including 818 service stations, to the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, according to reports in this country and Europe. **********At Gulf, Keith Anderson, a company spokesman, said ''we won't confirm or deny'' the reports.

'Back to the Drawing Board' **********''It seems to me,'' said Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, ''that we ought to go back to the drawing board and say, 'Mr. President, what are the marines doing there and under what terms would they be withdrawn?'

Senator Alan Cranston of California, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, spoke for many colleagues when he called the situation ''a total mess.'' **********''There is no clear way out,'' Senator Cranston said. ''We cannot retreat under fire and if we were to declare war we wouldn't know who to declare war against.'' **********The 1,600-man Marine Corps contingent has been stationed in Lebanonunder a compromise agreement worked out last month between Congress and the White House. The President won permission to keep the troops in the region for 18 months, well past next year's elections. In exchange the President signed the resolution passed by Congress while asserting that he was not necessarily bound by the restrictions of the War Powers Act.   Distinctly Different Views **********The agreement defused, at least temporarily, a potential Constitutional collision between the executive and legislative branches. But during the debate both sides voiced distinctly differentviews over what would happen should the situation change in Lebanon anforce new decisions about the size and scope of the marines' role. **********Under considerable pressure from Capitol Hill, Mr. Reagan said he would ''seek Congressional authorization'' if circumstances required ''any substantial expansion in the number or role of U.S. armed forces in Lebanon.'' But he and his assistants also insisted that Congress could not restrict the President's flexibility to act as Commander in Chief. **********Today Senator Charles McC. Mathias Jr., a Maryland Republican who contributed critical support for the President in last month's debate, warned Mr. Reagan he had to coordinate any future decisions with Capitol Hill. **********''The President has got to look at that narrow margin of victory as a limit on the unbridled exercise of Presidential prerogative,'' Mr. Mathias said.   Public Opinion a Factor **********To many lawmakers public opinion is another limit on President Reagan. The most recent New York Times/ CBS poll reported that by a margin of 2 to 1 those surveyed compared the United States involvement in Lebanon to the way it became entrapped in Vietnam two decades ago. For the first time since Mr. Reagan took office, those who disapproved of his handling of foreign policy outnumbered those who approved. **********An aide to the Senate Republican leadership said many lawmakers backed President Reagan's policy last month because they ''wanted to give the Administration a chance'' and did not like the idea of America ''turning tail and running.'' But they did not believe in the commitment of Americans troops, he added, and the tone on Capitol Hill is now likely to change. **********''A lot of people have been waiting for something to happen so they can say what they really feel,'' the aide said. **********During the debate over the War Powers Resolution, many lawmakers argued that the Reagan Administration had not adequately defined the role of the marines in Lebanon, and Senator Nunn dubbed their assignment ''Mission: Impossible.'' Today those complaints were repeated more loudly than ever. **********For example, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the Democratic leader, said in a statement: ''The Administration should talk with the other parties in the multinational force and reassess our reasons for being there, and these reasons should be clearly explained to Congress and the American people. The role of our marines has not been clearly defined. At present our people are just sitting ducks in a defenseless situation where they don't even know who is attacking them.'' **********These concerns were echoed by Henry A. Kissinger, the former Secretary of State, when he said on the ABC News program ''This Week'': ''I think these forces right now don't have a mission. I don't think it is clear what we are trying to achieve in Beirut.'' **********But if many lawmakers were alarmed by the situation in Lebanon, they disagreed sharply today over what course the President should take next. Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, said it was clear that ''our forces cannot adequately be protected in that country'' and called for a withdrawal within 60 days. **********Senator Nunn agreed that the troops should leave, but said they had to be replaced by United Nations forces.

Greenberg, president and chief executive officer of Coleco Industries. ''And we never try to be the lowest-priced competitor.'' **********For Coleco, a Hartford-based video game maker, that strategy has paid off handsomely. Last fall, its Colecovision game system, which can play software made by other manufacturers as well as its own, put the company in direct competition with Atari and Mattel for the first time. When the dust cleared in the second quarter of this year, Coleco was the only one of the big three video game producers to emerge with a profit. It earned $9.1 million, up from $7.4 million in the 1982 quarter. And for all of last year, profits soared to $44.9 million from $7.7 million in 1981. **********Despite its record, many investors and analysts remain nervous about Coleco as it poises for its next major dash, this time into the home computer market. Although the company has shown marketing savvy in toys and games, it has yet to prove itself in the computer big leagues, they say. **********This nervousness surfaced Wednesday, when Coleco's stock, an otherwise star performer in the bull market, fell 4 points on the rumor that the International Business Machines Corporation would introduce its long-awaited Peanut home computer on Sept. 1. The stock closed at 34 1/2 Friday, down 4 points for the week. **********Coincidentally, perhaps, Sept. 1 is when Coleco's Adam, a powerful, single-package home computer, is scheduled for shipment to merchandisers. **********Mr. Greenberg remains undaunted. ''The Peanut can't come quickly enough,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''All I.B.M. can do is lend stability to this industry.  A good product like that will focus attention on the Coleco solution.'' **********Coleco's solution, as Mr. Greenberg sees it, is a mass-market computer costing under $600 and combining what Coleco believes are the two primary uses for home computers - word processing and game playing. The Adam will be shipped with a word processing software program for the first use and a Buck Rogers-Planet of Zoom video game for the second. **********Among the Adam's prime competitors will be Commodore International, whose Commodore 64 unit begins at about $200. A Commodore package that is equivalent to Adam, however, would cost about $800 to $900. **********But as Coleco has proved with its games, price is not the only means to success. ''It's the marketing that's important,'' said Richard P. Simon, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''Coleco is more at home selling consumer products than technology, and that might be to their advantage.'' **********Strong Marketing A strong mass-marketing strategy focusing on quality and a centralized decision-making process have been the company's dominant characteristics since Mr. Greenberg took charge in 1973, analysts say. **********More recently, since it entered the electronic game business in the late 1970's with hand-held and tabletop games, Coleco has demonstrated an ability to move new products rapidly into the market, although sometimes, analysts say, the company has set deadlines it cannot meet. **********Coleco - an acronym for the Connecticut Leather Company, a leather tooling concern founded by Mr. Greenberg's father in 1932 - has gone through numerous phases in its trek toward high technology. Although video games and toys dominate the company, swimming pools and outdoor products still account for nearly 14 percent of sales and 8 percent of profits. Most of its second-quarter profits, however, were a result of the continuing strength of its home video game business, the flagship of which is Colecovision, the relatively powerful game-player unit that can be upgraded into a home computer system. **********Since its introduction last fall, Colecovision has sold about 1.4 million units, according to the Video Marketing Game Letter, an industry newsletter. Of that total, about 900,000 were sold this year, compared with 800,000 units by Atari and 300,000 by Mattel. **********That gives Coleco a far smaller customer base than Atari, which has sold about 9.3 million game player systems since the late 1970's. However, Atari has lost much of the software market. **********By contrast, Colecovision has so far been the exclusive maker ot its software. And because Coleco has had some of video's biggest hits, notably Donkey Kong, its software business has been a major source of profits.  That exclusive role was eroded last month, however, when two companies began shipping games playable on Colecovision. Other competitors are moving in, too. **********Mr. Greenberg argued that the availability of more software will encourage sales of the system, and that any lost market share in software will be made up in hardware sales. **********Another area of potential difficulty centers on the production of Adam. Coleco has said it will begin shipping Adam at the end of August, and have it in stores by Labor Day. However, a working prototype has yet to be demonstrated, according to several companies contracted to produce software for the machine. **********Mr. Greenberg said that some features of Adam would be altered from a model shown at the Consumer Electronics Show held in Chicago in May, but he insisted that the alterations were ''minor and subtle.'' **********''Our priorities are on utility, simplicity and value,'' he said. ''We concentrate on perceived consumer need. I think we've got what they want.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/28/business/briefs-071954.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Double R Fast Foods Inc.  said it had agreed to sell certain assets of its Roy Rogers fast food restaurants to a Marriott Corp. subsidiary for $750,000, plus forgiveness of certain debt owed Marriott and the assumption by Marriott of all secured debt, totaling $800,000. ***********  Durr-Fillauer Medical Inc.  said it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Nashville Surgical Supply Co., a closely held distributor of surgical supplies and equipment, for an undisclosed price. ***********  General Dynamics Corp.  said a subsidiary had received a $26.2 million Army contract for 94 tanks. ***********  Grolier Inc.  shareholder Howard Butcher 3d, honorary chairman and a director of Butcher & Singer Inc., disclosed in a filing with the S.E.C. that he holds 756,100 shares, or 6.2 percent, of Grolier."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/29/world/us-not-denying-sandinist-charges.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 649, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. NOT DENYING SANDINIST CHARGES", "print_headline": "U.S. NOT DENYING SANDINIST CHARGES", "body_text": " **********Reagan Administration officials acknowledged today that they were doing nothing to dispel the impression that the United States is covertly supporting anti-Sandinist forces fighting in Nicaragua. **********One official said that by allowing this impression to persist, the Administration hoped to cause problems for the Nicaraguan leadership and to persuade it to diminish its backing for guerrilla forces in El Salvador. **********Amid repeated press reports and Nicaraguan Government allegations of Central Intelligence Agency backing for anti-Sandinist forces operating principally from Honduras, the State Department has steadfastly refused to deny or confirm American involvement.

He said the ''opposition'' ranged from ''disillusioned public sectors to ethnic groups such as the Miskito Indians and includes former National Guardsmen and former Sandinists.'' **********Mr. Romberg, summing up the state of the opposition in Nicaragua, said it was ''diverse, nationalist and independent.'' Some 'Psychological Warfare' **********An Administration official acknowledged that there was ''a bit of psychological warfare here.'' The United States, the official said, is interested in raising doubts in the minds of Nicaraguan leaders about the extent of Washington's involvement in the hope that this will force the Nicaraguans to agree to stop their aid for the insurgents fighting in El Salvador against the American-backed Government. **********In this ''psychological warfare,'' the State Department seems to be repeating what the Nicaraguans say about the situation in El Salvador. The Nicaraguans have said that the guerrillas in El Salvador are acting on their own and reflect opposition to the regime. **********A reporter for The New York Times visited a camp Saturday inside Honduras where there were armed people, one of whom said they were all Nicaraguans. The reporter described crates in the camp that were labeled as United States-made armaments. **********Two Honduran soldiers stationed nearby described the people in the camp as Nicaraguans fighting to overthrow the Sandinist Government.  When asked about this today, Mr. Romberg said he would ''not address it one way or the other.'' Secretary of State George P.

The Chrysler Corporation, G.M.'s other major domestic competitor, is expected to follow G.M.'s lead in the next few days.  The G.M. and Ford programs, covering loans of any term, are available beginning Friday on 1983 models delivered by May 31, when the program ends, or ordered by April 30. **********New-car loan rates at banks have declined from 15 percent or more last year to between 12 and 14 percent now.

No Recovery **********The continuation of sales incentives was seen by analysts as tacit acknowledgment from the auto makers that an economic recovery has not taken hold. Industry executives have repeatedly said they would drop the costly incentive programs once car sales strengthen. **********One industry analyst said the new program could help sales a bit, but was not a cure-all.  Chrysler has extended its 11.9 percent program, along with cash rebates, until April 10, and the American Motors Corporation extended its 11.9 percent financing program on most A.M.C.

The financing will also be available on Chevrolet S-10 and G.M.C. S-15 light-duty trucks. **********The Ford program offers 9.9 percent financing or a $300 rebate on Ford Escort and EXP models, and Lincoln-Mercury Lynx and LN7 models, and on Ford Ranger light-duty pickup trucks built after Dec.1. Ford also said it will offer 11.9 percent financing for 36-month loans and 12.9 percent financing for 48-month loans on Ford Mustang and LTD, Mercury Capri and Marquis and Lincoln Continental, Town Car and Mark VI models, as well as on Ford Ranger pickup trucks built before Dec.1, the F-series pickup trucks and Ford Bronco and Bronco II utility vehicles. Consumers will be able to choose a $300 rebate instead of the reduced loan rate on the Mustang and Capri. **********Industry sources said that G.M. plans to inform its dealers that similar financing will still be available on car lines not covered by the new plan. A G.M. spokesman confirmed that it will offer its dealers $200 incentives for selling its troubled front-wheel-drive Xcar models, which have been subject to adverse publicity because of extensive Federal investigations and safety-related recalls in recent months.

''There has been a slowdown, yes,'' said Gerald Stautberg, owner of Jerry's Chevrolet in Baltimore. ''Any time you get enough bad publicity you get a slowdown.'' Chevrolet dealers report a 101-day supply of Citations, the Chevrolet X-car, while Pontiac dealers have a 117-day supply of Pontiac Phoenix models, nearly double the normal inventory. **********Industry analysts said they were not surprised at the program.  Lower fuel prices have sparked a surge in the sales of larger models, at the expense of the smaller ones. **********David Healy, automotive analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert in New York, said the program probably would not make much difference.  ''It's an attractive rate, but by itself it won't turn the industry around,'' he said.

Home of Philo and Maimonides **********It was Egypt that produced the scholars Philo and Saadia ben Joseph al-Fayumi and the biblical prophet Jeremiah. Rabbi Moses ben Maimon, or Maimonides, revered by many as the foremost interpreter of Jewish law and philosophy, spent more than half of his life in 12th-century Cairo.

Of these, only Shaar ha-Shamayim, a cavernous, recently restored building in the heart of Cairo's business district, functions regularly. **********As recently as 1948, there were about 100,000 Jews in Egypt. After the United Nations voted to partition Palestine, many Egyptian Jews were coerced into leaving. Egypt's wars with Israel spurred anti-Jewish campaigns, which included internments, expulsions and confiscation of property. By the time President Anwar el-Sadat came to power, there were only a few hundred Jews left; the vast majority had voluntarily or involuntarily gone to Israel. **********Now, most of Egypt's Jewish population, estimated to be 120 in Cairo and a few more than that in Alexandria, is old and widowed.   Last Rabbi Left in '71 **********Since the last rabbi left Egypt in 1971, the Jews have been without spiritual leadership. There are no kosher butcher shops and no functioning Jewish schools. The Jewish cemetery, like the famed Islamic city of the dead, has been occupied by squatters. The graves stand desecrated and neglected. **********The leader of the Egypt's Jews, gravely ill for several years, now lives in Paris.

The Moslems Feasted **********While the Jews fasted on Saturday to atone for sins of the last year, Egyptian Moslems feasted. **********The feast of sacrifice coincides with the climax of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, a trip that hundreds of thousands of Egyptian Moslems make each year. The feast commemorates God's command to Abraham, or Ibrahim, as Moslems call him, to sacrifice his son as a test of faith. Once Ibrahim agreed to do so, God sent a lamb to be killed instead. **********On Saturday morning, millions of Egyptian families killed sheep and cows to commemorate Ibrahim's obedience to the Lord and God's mercy. As the sun rose over Cairo, butchers roamed the strangely quiet city streets offering their services for the sacrificial slaughter. **********The holiday continues for four days and offices will remain closed. **********''At least both Jews and Moslems will not be working today,'' said one of the 19 Jews who attended synagogue in downtown Cairo.

An Englishman from Manchester entered soon after. **********At about 10, six Egyptian Jews, including Michael Salem, arrived. The rabbi sighed with relief. **********''At last, a minyan,'' he said, referring to the 10-man quorum needed for communal prayer. **********Minyans, Mr. Salem acknowledged, are increasingly hard to obtain in Cairo. During Rosh ha-Shanah, he said, two Israeli diplomats had to coax an Israeli security guard into the synagogue before services could begin. **********Mr. Salem said growing up as a Jew in Egypt had been difficult. ''I didn't even feel Jewish until a few years ago,'' he said.   A New Awareness **********For Mr. Salem, as for other Egyptian Jews, Egypt's peace with Israel in 1978 rekindled an awareness of Jewish culture and heritage. But it has not altered the demographic facts. **********The number of Israeli diplomats in Cairo now rival in size the city's Egyptian Jewish population. In fact, more Israeli diplomats, many of whom are of Egyptian Jewish origin, attended a Yom Kippur service on Friday night in suburban Maadi than did Egyptian Jews in downtown Cairo. **********The Maadi synagogue, which functions infrequently, is also endangered. It is cared for by Becky Salama, who says she is 64 but, according to friends, is actually 10 and maybe 20 years older. She sells mangoes from the synagogue garden to maintain the building. **********''I'm old and very sick,'' Miss Salama said. ''I don't know what will happen to the place when I die.'' **********If there is any hope that Egypt's Jews can be saved from extinction, it lies in two Jewish families who, until recently, feuded like Shakespeare's Capulets and Montagues.  Michael Salem's brother fell in love some time ago with the daughter of the rival clan, the Rousseaus. Her father forbade the marriage, because, it was said, the Salems were only second-generation Egyptian Jews of Iraqi origin. But love, apparently, has triumphed. The two are to marry next summer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/29/business/business-forum-why-free-markets-and-banks-dont-mix.html": {"writer_name": "Bevis Longstreth", "pub_date": "1983-05-29", "snippet": "FINANCIAL crises in recent years attest to a growing interdependencya nd vulnerability within the financial services industry.

The p roblems that faced Bache and Paine Webber in 1980, Drysdale, L ombard-Wall and Penn Square in 1982 and the international banks t oday with respect to their loans to third world countries, i llustrate the point. They are examples of how, with increasing f requency, the difficulties of a single financial institution t hreaten to set off a chain reaction, extending well beyond those c ompanies immediately involved. **********This situation calls for a re-examination of the way in which the industry is regulated.  There are two central approaches to bank and financial services regulation today. The first is regulation that assures soundness of an institution -avoiding illiquidity or insolvency. The second is regulation that provides a mechanism to protect customers in the event of a failure. **********Soundness regulation includes restrictions on how financial intermediaries such as banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies can compete in the market place, as well as restrictions on how portfolios can be managed. Post-failure mechanisms include the deposit insurance and similar loss-guarantee funds. **********Increasingly, those critical of our traditional regulatory system are speaking out. Some urge greater reliance on those institutions that insure and guarantee investors' funds, while apostles of deregulation would substitute disclosure and the discipline of the free market for the heavy-handed restrictions that soundness regulation has traditionally imposed. **********Those advocating that all financial services be deregulated and that free market forces be unleashed offer a seductive alternative.  Yet, the growing interdependence of financial intermediaries should give pause to policy makers tempted by the siren song of Adam Smith. **********My thesis is that: 1) Market discipline can only assure soundness in an environment where institutions are permitted to fail. 2) The links among financial intermediaries are often too extensive to prevent one failure from setting off others. 3) Therefore, the consequences of failures often impose unacceptable costs to our financial system. 4) Thus, to assure soundness, a new system of government regulation is needed - a system broad enough to encompass all financial intermediaries and flexible enough to enable the forces of full disclosure and market discipline to do their share of the job. **********Recent efforts of bank regulators to increase the amount of public information available about the financial condition of banks should be applauded. As a general proposition, accurate and up-to-date disclosure provides for the most efficient flow of capital among competing investments and deters excessive risk-taking by those seeking to attract that capital. **********There is no reason why disclosure should not have the same salutary effect on financial institutions as it does in other sectors of the economy. Relying on market discipline as a substitute for direct regulation, however, is an idea that should give us pause. **********For market discipline to operate efficiently, financial institutions must be fully exposed to the risk of failure. Indeed, if market discipline is to operate efficiently, banks and other financial intermediaries must be permitted to fail. But the growing interdependence among financial institutions and the resulting vulnerability makes a failure - at least among the larger ones - unacceptable. **********Yet, the expectation of government intervention in the event of a failure prevents the free market place from operating efficiently.  If large bank depositors and creditors are not exposed in the event of a bank failure, they lack the incentive to insist that the bank avoid excessive risk. Unrestrained, the bank is free to take risks beyond what would be compatible with soundness. **********WHILE the F.D.I.C. and others are seeking ways to alter the assumption that depositors and other creditors at the larger banks enjoy implicit protection of 100 cents on the dollar, that assumption will be hard to erode. And even if it were eroded, the belief in government's unwillingness to suffer large failures would persist. **********The current international lending situation illustrates the problems of permitting the free market to regulate financial institutions. The international banks seem to have miscalculated the long-term risks of huge lending to third world countries. But to let the banks suffer the full consequences of these miscalculations could create intolerable losses. And one cannot separate our domestic banking and credit system from the international system. Of the $268 billion in outstanding loans by private banks to the developing countries as of June 1982, more than 36 percent, or $98.6 billion, were claims of American banks. **********The expanding links among financial intermediaries are, in large part, a function of technological advances. Computers permit highspeed, low-cost data processing, which in turn fosters aggressive money management and vastly increases the number and velocity of money transfers. **********At the same time, the increasing velocity at which funds move contributes to the vulnerability of the financial system. When the objective is to get the highest return in the shortest time, cash reserve cushions are often reduced and the response time to delivery failures is shortened. **********These problems should show us that a new system of regulation by the Government is needed.  Before deciding how to secure the soundness of our financial system, we must draw a circle around those financial activities that must be protected against failure. Placement of the circle is difficult. In banking, for example, some would circle only the bank itself, others, the bank and its subsidiaries, and still others, the entire bank holding company structure. But as the lines of distinction between banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies continues to erode, drawing the circle becomes even more of a challenge. **********The interdependency problem also suggests the need for a government safety net to supply swiftly liquidity for financial intermediaries and act in other ways to protect the stability of the nation's financial system. At the present time we lack an adequate system. Too much today is left to chance and the serendipity of having adequate leadership in place when needed to cope with a crisis. Turnover in government is too rapid. We lack a coherent structure to house both the necessary tools and the institutional memory needed to enable new hands to use those tools wisely. **********As a point of departure for developing such a system, it would make sense to study the Federal Reserve Act. The Federal Reserve Board continues to be the most logical source of regulation and emergency funds. As many critics have observed, however, the act is archaic and inflexible. We need to amend the act to create a flexible framework within which the Federal Reserve Board, perhaps with the input from the President and Congress, could move to avert and arrest financial crises."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/20/business/durables-orders-off-3.6-in-july.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 520, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Durables Orders Off 3.6% in July", "print_headline": "Durables Orders Off 3.6% in July", "body_text": " **********New orders for durable goods fell 3.6 percent in July, the first decline since February, the Government reported today. **********The Commerce Department report said the slide in July orders ''was concentrated in the capital goods industries,'' which manufacture the equipment companies use to expand and modernize operations.

Alarm on Public Deficit **********He added, however, that the country would have to get ''tougher'' with the giant state companies whose debts have swollen the public deficit to a point that has alarmed the I.M.F. **********Brazilian officials are telling their creditor banks that they require at least $1.5 billion to overcome cash-flow problems between now and June.

Goal Is $6 Billion Surplus **********The key determinate in figuring the final total will be the degree of success Brazil has in meeting its goal of a $6 billion trade surplus this year. After a slow start at the beginning of the year, the country registered a $514 million surplus in March, and Government officials are hoping for a $700 million positive balance in April. **********The trade figures have been greeted with some skepticism, however.  There are rumors that Brazil bought petroleum on credit and sold it for cash as a March export to make its exports column look better. **********Against this backdrop, calls for a formal moratorium on debt repayments are growing, particularly from the political opposition in Brazil that was newly enfranchised last November by the first gubernatorial elections allowed by the ruling military in 17 years.  The opposition is arguing that recent riots in Sao Paulo are a sign that social conditions do not permit Brazil to impose austerity on the country to reduce its estimated $88 billion foreign debt. **********Among those supporting a repayment moratorium are Tancredo Neves, governor of the state of Minas Gerais and the most widely respected figure in the opposition Brazilian Democratic Movement Party. An official party statement on the economic situation called the I.M.F.'sprescription for the country ''suicidal and unacceptable.'' **********While the Government is discouraging talk of a formal moratorium, it is also withholding payments on many overdue foreign debts because of a lack of funds. These delayed payments reached a total of $999 million by the end of March, according to Jose Carlos Madeira Serrano, International Director of the Central Bank. Inflation, Public Sector Debt **********Two factors, soaring inflation and public sector debt, are drawing particular attention from Ana Maria Jul, the I.M.F. monitor who has returned to Brasilia two months ahead of her scheduled visit. Though the country pledged to bring inflation down to 90 percent from last year's 99.7 percent, first-quarter inflation registered 38 percent, which, projected annually, would produce a rate of 162 percent. **********Jose Milton Dallari, the Government's secretary of supply and prices, said he was still predicting a year-end figure of 90 percent. Joseph O'Neill, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Sao Paulo, however, said that member companies were operating on assumptions of 150 percent year-end inflation. **********The debt figure for the first quarter has not been made public, but Government officials concede it has greatly exceeded the $6.4 billion foreseen in the I.M.F. accord. In the period, the Government was $950 million over budget in outlays for subsidies for oil, wheat and sugar and special Banco do Brasil coverage for delayed payments on the foreign debts of state companies. New Formula Asked **********The country had agreed to reduce the deficit this year from 16.9 percent to 8.8 percent of gross national product. It is now asking the I.M.F. to replace this formula with one that would allow the country to establish a fixed numerical goal rather than one tied to its gross national product. It is arguing that the percentage formula was based on a 90 percent inflation prediction and could not take into account a 30 percent devaluation decreed Feb. 18 that had the effect of increasing public debt. **********The funds that Brazil is seeking abroad are supposed to go toward trade-related and interbank credits, but if there is resistance to that approach, the country may have to try to put together another jumbo loan. Those two categories were known as Project Three and Project Four of a four-part plan that Brazil put to international banks in December in New York. Project One, a jumbo loan of $4.4 billion, and Project Two, the rescheduling of $4.7 billion in amortization payments for the year, were signed on Feb. 28. **********Brazil had originally sought $10.6 billion in interbank credits but then lowered the goal to $7.5 billion. The country has only succeeded in attracting $6.2 billion. As for export financing, bankers say that an additional $1.5 billion is needed. **********Officials argue that the liquidity crunch will start to end in June with the accumulation of foreign currency from its trade surpluses.

Augusto Pinochet is being seriously challenged, according to supporters as well as opponents. **********Western diplomats and even many of the general's advisers say that the newfound willingness of hundreds of thousands of Chileans to defy the Government with protests and strikes in the last six weeks reflects a fundamental political shift in the country in favor of democracy. The general has said that there will be no elections until at least 1989. **********The Chilean ruler, who took over in 1973 in a violent coup that led to the death of the democratically elected President, Salvador Allende Gossens, is not about to be toppled, the officials and diplomats said. But they said the labor unrest had coincided with grumblings in the army over rumors of corruption in the general's family and his handling of the growing dissent. The army is General Pinochet's base of power and he could not survive the loss of its support, they said. **********'Reaching a Turning Point' **********''Pinochet is reaching a turning point,'' one Western diplomat here said. ''It's all part of a general movement to force a definition of the transition to democracy.'' **********But blocking the movement has been the stern personality of the 67-year old general himself, according to some of his advisers, who have been suggesting he open up the Government to allow more participation by the opposition. **********One senior official said the President does not want to appear to be giving in to pressure. An adviser outside the Government, as well as prominent Chileans who know the President, said his instinct has been to crack down on the dissent, not open up to it. State of Siege Considered **********The officials said that until a week ago, when he returned from a trip to northern Chile, General Pinochet was determined to declare a state of siege, suspending all civil rights. They said he was soothed by his aide, Brig. Gen. Santiago Sinclair, on the way from the airport and finally talked out of it by advisers such as Foreign Minister Miguel Alex Schweitzer Walters and Interior Minister Enrique Montero Marx. **********''Basically, he doesn't believe in democracy,'' one adviser said, pointing to a speech 10 days ago in which General Pinochet criticized politicians as being irresponsible and said that democracy was the ''culture dish'' of Communism. **********The general is said to be obsessed with Communist infiltration, even writing books about it, but Western diplomats and Government officials said the Chilean Communists are politically weak today. **********''It looks like a slow-moving Greek tragedy,'' a Western diplomat said. ''You have a personality and world view which is fixed and coming into increasing clash with political reality.'' 6 Killed in Protests **********The clash has led to six deaths in the two recent nationwide protests. Many Chileans fear the violence will worsen as militant political and labor leaders vow to continue the protests monthly. **********Union calls for a national strike last week failed as the Government arrested many of the leaders. But copper workers and truck owners struck in protest for the first time in 10 years and union leaders said they were uniting for future strikes.  Tonight the unions and the truck owners formally called off their strike. **********General Pinochet is scheduled to stay in office until at least 1989 under a Constitution approved overwhelmingly in a plebiscite three years ago. Since last year many supporters, such as business groups and conservative intellectuals, have recommended that he begin taking transitional steps such as holding municipal elections or ending the five-year-old state of emergency, which bans political activity. **********General Pinochet's response was to create a study commission in March and, two weeks ago, end prior book censorship, allow some exiles to return and publish the internal debates of legislative commissions. **********''It was too little, too late,'' one Government official said. Strong Line Recommended **********The isolation of the general is such that when Brigadier Montero, the Interior Minister, invited leaders of the right-wing National Party and the centrist Social Democratic Party to join the Government at secret meetings in the last two weeks they refused, advisers to General Pinochet said. **********Government hard-liners such as Economy Minister Manuel Martin Saez, one of the general's few close friends, have recommended he be tough. But Federico Willoughby, a right-wing former presidential spokesman, discounted the need for the advice. ''There is no one to the right of Pinochet,'' he said. **********General Pinochet has given only limited rein to the soft-liners, although in a Cabinet shuffle this year he gave them most top Government posts. His advisers said it was a way to keep their support and typical of a political acumen that had served the general well until now. Long a Popular Leader **********General Pinochet was popular among Chileans as late as six months ago, according to even his opponents. He was widely seen as a tough but honest leader who brought prosperity and peace after the chaos under Dr. Allende. **********But the country is gripped in a two-year old economic depression.  Unemployment is around 20 percent, according to the Government, and 13 percent of the work force are in emergency public works programs. **********Criticism formerly directed at his economic team's monetarist policies has now been turned on him. According to advisers outside the Government, his approval rating in secret Gallup polls commissioned by the Goverment has dropped from highs of around 70 percent three years ago to 18 percent today. **********They said said the general is now playing for time, six months or so, hoping the economy will revive. One option, they said, is a switch to populist, expanionist policies, but he is hemmed in by an agreement with the International Monetary Fund limiting spending in exchange for refinancing of an $18 billion foreign debt. Officers Reported Upset **********Meanwhile, many military officers are upset by reports that one of the general's daughters has received lucrative state contracts for her insurance brokerage business and a son-in-law has grazed his cattle on Government lands, Western diplomats and Chileans close to the military said. **********General Pinochet has listened to complaints by officials about his family, his advisers said. But the general, who is said to suffer personally over minor scandals and divorces among his five children, has not acted on the complaints as much as many officers say they would like. **********The army is intent on maintaining public order, but officers are uncertain if toughness by General Pinochet is the answer or the problem, one officer said.  A letter calling for a change of ''helmsman'' is reportedly circulating inside the army. **********But a military rebellion is unlikely any time soon, Chilean and foreign analysts said. The Chilean military is strongly hierarchical, is led by officers chosen by General Pinochet himself and traditionally has not engaged in coups. It took two years of chaos before the military overthrew Dr. Allende."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/business/tca-cable-tv-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-oct-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TCA CABLE TV INC reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 31", "print_headline": "TCA CABLE TV INC reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/16/world/around-the-world-cuba-labor-chief-denies-death-sentences-on-5.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-05-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 219, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cuba Labor Chief Denies Death Sentences on 5", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Cuba Labor Chief Denies Death Sentences on 5", "body_text": " **********The head of Cuba's trades unions has denied reports that five people were sentenced to death for attempting to organize a trades union in Cuba on the lines of Poland's banned Solidarity movement. **********But Roberto Veiga, who leads the Cuban Trades Union Federation, disclosed in a letter made public today that 33 Cubans have been given prison sentences for counterrevolutionary activities. **********In his letter to Ibrahim Zakaria, secretary general of the Communist-dominated World Federation of Trades Unions, based in Prague, Mr. Veiga strongly denied charges by some Western human rights organizations that five of those in jail had been sentenced to death for trying to organize a ''Solidarity type'' trade union in Cuba. **********''They never thought of defending trades union rights or of organizing a trades union,'' the letter said.

As soon as initial objectives had been achieved, 5,000 Army paratroopers from the 82d Airborne Division began moving in to relieve them. **********Most of the 700 Army Rangers who participated in the initial assault also have been relieved, the Pentagon officials reported. **********The officials said the relief action by the 82d paratroopers not only would free the marines for use in Lebanon but also would give one of the Army's premier units combat experience. The relief of the Rangers was necessary, they added, because Rangers are too lightly equipped for sustained combat. **********Fleet Diverted for Invasion **********The marines, members of the 22d Marine Amphibious Unit, operate from a fleet of five support ships. In all, there are 1,800 marines on the ships, 1,200 of whom went ashore in the invasion.  According to Pentagon officials, the fleet was at sea and headed across the North Atlantic toward Lebanon when it was diverted to take part in the Grenada invasion. **********''Now they're about to resume their journey,'' a Defense Department spokesman said today. ''They'll leave in the next few days and should arrive there in about two weeks.'' The marines currently in Lebanon are members of the 24th Marine Amphibious Unit, which is part of the multinational force that is trying to keep the warring factions in Lebanon apart. They have been under considerable military pressure and lost more than 200 men when a terrorist bomb exploded in their barracks.   Relief Scheduled Before Invasion **********Their relief by the 22d Marine Amphibious Unit was scheduled well before that incident, however, and, despite the diversion by the 22d to Grenada, apparently will take place just about as scheduled. Marine Corps plans call for relief of units assigned to Lebanon every six months. **********A few hours before the start of the Grenada invasion, Pentagon spokesmen insisted that the 22d Marine Amphibious Unit was still headed across the Atlantic toward Lebanon. The spokesmen have since said that they were never informed by the Pentagon's operations room that there had been a change of course. **********Defense Department officials would not discuss whether the carrier battle group that accompanied the marines to Grenada also would sail east with them to Lebanon to relieve the carrier group that is supporting the marines in Beirut. The group includes the carrier Independence, a guided missile cruiser and four destroyers and frigates.   Cuban Ship at Anchor **********In another development, Navy officials reported that a Cuban ship that was asked to leave St. George's harbor when the invasion began was still anchored 12 miles off the island. **********''We're not sure what it's doing there,'' one official said. ''She left when requested. But she dropped anchor the minute she reached international waters and there's not much we can do about that. She could be serving as a radio relay station, though there's not much Cuban radio traffic left.'' **********The ship is the Vietnam Heroico. According to Navy records, she is 430 feet long, has a capacity of 13,000 cubic feet of cargo and 218 passengers, and made a number of trips to Angola during the early Cuban military involvement there. **********The Navy officials said they did not known when the ship arrived at St. George's or what it carried. United States intelligence sources have reported some military equipment was brought to Grenada by ship shortly before the invasion, but they have not specified which vessel was involved."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/24/world/ap-says-its-shultz-caption-was-misleading.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 429, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A.P.

Andropov, the Soviet leader, Mr. Vladimov traced his passage from a literary celebrity in the 1960's to a denounced outcast in the 1970's, and finally to recent threats of arrest against him and his wife, and demands that he write a letter by Jan. 20 disavowing his ''anti-Soviet work.'' **********''I am ready to accept the already familiar thorns of a Russian writer and walk under the vaults of Lefortovo Prison,'' he said, declaring that he would not write such a letter. **********But the K.G.B. security police has also threatened to arrest his wife, he said, and he would not permit another to suffer because of him. **********Another Solution Proposed **********''I propose another solution, less damaging to our Government's prestige,'' he wrote. ''I am ready to quit Russia. To be forced to this is painful and humiliating for us. We have already proved our love for Russia by the patience with which we endured persecution, repression, humiliation.'' **********The Vladimovs' Moscow apartment was searched in February 1982 and again on Dec. 28, when most of his manuscripts and correspondence were seized. Last week, Mr. Vladimov was interrogated by K.G.B.  agents for two days, and his wife, Natalya Kuznetsova, for three days. The questioning was purportedly about two dissidents facing trials, but the Vladimovs said the interrogators had also threatened them. **********The letter Mr. Vladimov was ordered to write was to include a listing of his purported anti-Soviet activities and of foreign contacts, and a promise to work only through official channels. **********Neither Mr. Vladimov nor his wife was given any indication that they would be allowed to emigrate. On the contrary, the writer said, one interrogator, Lieut. Col. Aleksei G. Gubinsky, said, ''We don't let criminals leave.'' Invitations From Abroad **********In his letter to Mr. Andropov, Mr. Vladimov said he had received invitations from the French chapter of the P.E.N. club, an international writers association, from French publishers and from West German institutes in Bonn and Cologne that could serve as pretexts for his departure. **********The decision to seek emigration seemed a wrenching one for Mr.  Vladimov, who is 51 and suffered a heart attack two years ago.  ''Well, I have raised the white flag,'' he said in a preface to his announcement that he had sent the letter to Mr. Andropov. ''I have thought of leaving for many years, since 1971. We all do. You think about reasons for leaving every morning, and every afternoon you think of reasons for staying. No one wants to leave, no one wishes it. The question is only whether to give in or not, or to suffer a bit longer. Aksyonov, Zinoviev, Kopelev, Voinovich, they all left in grief, were forced to leave.'' **********Vasily Aksyonov, Aleksandr Zinoviev, Lev Kopelev and Vladimir Voinovich are among the Russian writers who found themselves incapable of writing within the strictures of Soviet literature and ended up abroad. One of Last Dissident Writers **********Mr. Vladimov is one of the last noted dissident writers, not jailed, but outside the orbit of official literature.  In explaining his delay in asking to leave, Mr. Vladimov said: ''I always expected there would be some change, that after Brezhnev's death the stagnation would lift, that there would be fresh air.'' **********Then his scarred face, a part discolored from birth, broke into a smile.  ''In any event,'' he continued, ''if there is change, we will return.'' In his letter to Mr. Andropov, Mr. Vladimov described the acclaim that in 1961 greeted his first novel, ''Bolshaya Ruda''(''Big Ore''). The 30-year-old author was ushered into the Writers Union, with its status and perquisites. But Mr. Vladimov's next work, ''Three Minutes of Silence,'' turned the literary establishment away from him. From Guard Dog's Perspective **********It depicted Soviet fishermen in the northern seas as a despondent and selfish lot, without hope. And then came ''Faithful Ruslan,'' the underground classic told from the viewpoint of a guard dog let loose after a labor camp is closed. The dog unwittingly turns on a trainload of workers who, to the dog, seem a group of rebellious inmates. **********The story, Mr. Vladimov said, was based on his mother's recollections. A teacher, she was swept up in Stalin's purge of 1952 and served three years. His father disappeared in a war prisoners camp in Nazi Germany in 1943. **********Unable to have ''Faithful Ruslan'' published at home, Mr. Vladimov sent it abroad and it was published in the United States in 1979 by Simon & Schuster. Meanwhile, Mr. Vladimov had left the Writers Union and become head of an unofficial chapter of Amnesty International, the rights group. **********Mr. Vladimov notes that national chapters of Amnesty do not report on rights violations in their own country and he denies being a dissident. It is a title, he says, that ''they force on you.'' **********''Every writer who writes anything in this country is made to feel he has committed a crime,'' he said. ''You finish and wonder, will they forgive me? It is impossible to work like that. A writer cannot work here. They take your manuscripts, typewriter, copies, drafts.  You never have a complete draft, you write a few pages, copy them and quickly hide them. You can never read the work in progress to your wife, and, if you give it to a friend, you have 'spread anti-Soviet slander.'

COMMUNIQUE EXCERPTS", "body_text": " **********Following are excerpts from the final communique of the ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, as contained in the English-language text distributed Tuesday by the 24-nation organization: **********At its meeting on 9th-10th May, the Council of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development at ministerial level agreed on a medium-term approach to sustaining and broadening the economic recovery now under way. They agreed that increased sustainable noninflationary growth in the O.E.C.D. countries must be aimed at in order to reduce the present very high levels of unemployment. **********Ministers recognized that the powerful economic linkages among countries and regions imply a collective responsibility to shape policies so as to strengthen the international trading, monetary and financial systems. **********Accordingly, their governments intend to: **********- Take advantage of room for growth, which is now emerging in an important part of the O.E.C.D. area, to promote job creation and higher employment. **********- Make use individually and collectively of the favorable conditions provided by economic recovery to reverse protectionist trends. **********- Work to resolve international debt problems in a trade expansionary way as recovery and adjustment by debtor countries proceed. **********- Provide more effective help to the poorer developing countries. Concern Over Unemployment **********Ministers welcomed the further achievements in reducing inflation.  They are very concerned, however, about the high and rising levels of unemployment. It is therefore encouraging that signs of an upturn have now emerged in several O.E.C.D. economies. While uncertainties and risks remain, ministers agreed that prospects for continuing recovery are better than they have been for several years, and that insuring the transition to sustained noninflationary growth and higher unemployment is the central task of policy. **********Ministers agreed on the following policy principles for all member countries: **********- Policies need to be set firmly in a medium-term framework to make clear the steadiness of policy intent. **********- It is important for the consistency of policies that each member country take account of the international implications of member countries' policies taken together. **********- The achievement of greater exchange rate stability, which does not imply rigidity, is a major objective and commitment to be pursued. Easing of Interest Rates **********As regards monetary policy, monetary aggregates should allow for output growth which is sustainable over the medium term, with continued control of inflation, permitting a continued easing of interest rates. Current monetary policies are generally consistent with this approach. Targets for monetary aggregates should not be lowered in response to lower oil prices. Similarly, monetary policy should not accommodate any resurgence of inflationary wage and other income claims. **********Structural budget deficits need to be reduced to make room for the investment needed to sustain growth and employment. Where future structural deficits loom large, it is important to act now to insure that deficits on this scale will not materialize, thus permitting interest rates to ease. Adherence to Monetary Policies **********In some other countries, accounting for about 20 percent of O.E.C.D. gross national product, further progress against inflation is required and structural impediments to better performance are more pronounced. As a result, growing room in the near term is less.  For such countries, ministers agreed that perseverance with nonaccommodating monetary policy is required and structural budget deficits must be reduced further as part of a consistent medium-term approach. **********In the remaining member countries, despite serious efforts, inflation remains very high, while the international recession and chronic structural problems mean high rates of unemployment and underemployment.

''At least for now,'' the analyst told his clients, ''these stocks seem uninteresting, and we would suggest other areas for new investment.'' **********Swept along with the rising tide of stock prices, all three issues - Asarco, Phelps Dodge and Newmont Mining - thereupon proceeded to score creditable gains. **********But Mr. Healy has not changed his mind about prospects for these companies. In an interview last Thursday, he said flatly, ''I would use the three stocks as a source of funds.'' In Wall Street parlance, that means he thinks money invested in these securities could be put to better use elsewhere. **********Basic factors affecting the copper industry, according to the analyst, have not changed. ''Despite the economic revival, copper's 'supply side' seems more than ample,'' Mr. Healy stated in his basic study. ''Mine capacity is still rising, and production, despite a good deal of shutdown capacity in the United States, is still outrunning demand. **********''Meanwhile, inventories, at the highest level since 1978, are still rising. The last three years of sluggish or nonexistent growth in the industrial countries have left copper demand less than supply, so even a vigorous economic recovery may not be sufficient to create a copper shortage.'' **********In yesterday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Asarco fell 5/8, to 41. Phelps Dodge, also down 5/8, closed at 31 1/4, while Newmont Mining eased 1/4, to 57. Last week, all three issues edged higher. **********Prices of these stocks have been climbing since the spring or summer of 1982, following sharp drops in earlier months. The shares of Asarco Inc., for example, have ranged between 18 3/4 and 44 1/4 during the last 52 weeks. They underwent a sustained decline for more than a year after the price topped out in the low 50's in late 1980.  The company is a leading producer of copper, silver, lead, zinc and other nonferrous metals. **********The Phelps Dodge Corporation, the largest independent domestic producer of copper, has seen the price of its shares fluctuate between 18 1/4 and 34 over the last 52-week period. In April 1981 the stock sold as high as 48 1/2. **********Shares of the Newmont Mining Corporation, a leading copper producer in the United States, have ranged between 27 5/8 and 62 during the last 52 weeks. This issue traded as high as 79 1/4 in August 1981. **********Meanwhile, a potentially negative signal for Newmont Mining's stock has turned up in the latest issue of Flow Watch, a summary of market indicators issued every two weeks by Salomon Brothers. During the 10 trading days ended May 20, Newmont Mining gained 1 3/8, to 56 3/4, although the Salomon computers detected a net money outflow of $10.4 million in trading of the stock. **********Flow Watch tracks the movement of money into and out of stocks.  These flows, when correlated with price changes, can indicate whether selling or buying pressure predominates. Although money flows are not an infallible indicator of future price action, a sign of ''selling on strength,'' as exhibited in recent trading of Newmont Mining, can represent a potentially negative investment situation, according to Salomon Brothers. **********At Drexel Burnham Lambert, Mr. Healy has constructed earnings estimates for the three copper companies by using certain price assumptions for the metal. He has also factored into his estimates the impact of an ''assumed'' copper strike lasting six weeks after the current labor contracts expire June 30. **********His estimate calls for Asarco, which suffered a loss in 1982 as a reflection of cyclical weakness in metal prices, to earn 75 cents a share this year, then $2.35 a share in 1984 and $3.60 a share in 1985. **********Projections call for Phelps Dodge, which also lost money last year, to show a much smaller deficit in 1983. The analyst estimates that the company then will earn $2.35 a share in 1984 and $3.35 a share the next year. **********Newmont Mining had a profit equal to $1.76 a share in 1982. Mr.  Healy projects earnings at $3.50 a share this year, followed by $6 a share in 1984 and $6.90 a share in 1985. **********''Based on our current outlook,'' he summarized, ''the copper issues look rather amply priced and seem unlikely to outperform the market over the medium term.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/16/business/tiger-in-talks-on-repayment.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 244, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tiger in Talks On Repayment", "print_headline": "Tiger in Talks On Repayment", "body_text": " **********Senior executives of Tiger International Inc. met with committees of its major bank and institutional lenders today in the first stage of negotiating extended repayment on $900 million of its $1.8 billion debt. **********''There is not going to be any Chapter 11 filing,'' a spokesman, Rosanne O'Brien, said. **********''Absolutely not.''

Mr. Salem was said to have added, ''If this progress continues next week, then we will definitely be on the right track for a comprehensive agreement.'') Border Area Is Issue **********Some officials close to the Israeli-Lebanese negotiations said the two sides had narrowed their differences over how much Israeli military involvement would be permitted in southern Lebanon after a troop withdrawal.

The sources gave no details, however, on what the specific duties and composition of such teams might be. **********An Israeli official said it would be ''overoptimistic'' to conclude that the security problems had been solved.  While Foreign Minister Shamir would not define areas of agreement, he did say Israel would continue its surveillance flights over Lebanon after it withdrew its 30,000 troops. **********President Reagan's remarks, made in response to questions after a speech in California on arms control, included an expression of frustration at the slow pace of the withdrawal talks.  It followed recent expressions of annoyance by Administration officials over Israel's rejection of an American package of security proposals for southern Lebanon. These are said to fall short of Israeli demands for a residual military presence in Lebanon. Israeli Demands Opposed **********Since the talks began, Lebanon and the United States have opposed such Israeli demands. Israel has suggested several forms of military involvement in a security zone, extending about 25 miles north of the Israeli-Lebanese border. **********Israel, convinced that the Palestine Liberation Organization will try to re-establish military positions in southern Lebanon, originally asked for five Israeli-manned outposts in Lebanon. These small bases, staffed by a total of about 750 Israeli soldiers and intelligence agents, would have monitored the area, searched for P.L.O. guerrillas and coordinated with local Lebanese militias in maintaining security. **********Neither Lebanon nor the United States accepted this, arguing that it would give Syria a pretext for leaving its forces in northern Lebanon and the Bekaa, Lebanon's eastern valley. **********Israel is reported to have stopped insisting on the outposts without formally withdrawing the demand. Instead, the Israeli negotiators are said to be concentrating on daily patrols with Lebanese troops, close communications and intelligence links with a southern brigade of the Lebanese Army and the stationing of Israeli Army advisers with Lebanese troops. Role for Major Haddad **********In addition, Israel wants Maj. Saad Haddad, a former Lebanese Army officer, named as the commander of the southern Lebanese brigade.  Since the mid-1970's, when he left the army, Major Haddad has run a militia trained and supplied by Israel in a narrow buffer strip on the Lebanese side of the Israeli border, giving Israeli troops free access to the territory for artillery positions and as a staging area for strikes against P.L.O. emplacements. **********Lebanon has reportedly agreed to integrate Major Haddad's militia into the army, making it the basis of a southern brigade. But the Government has objected to Major Haddad's becoming its commander because he is technically a deserter. **********Agreement on the other major area of negotiations, the question of normalizing Israeli-Lebanese relations, is said to be near. Israel, which originally demanded a formal agreement on an open border, has reportedly compromised and agreed to Lebanese pleas for a de facto open border after Israeli withdrawal, pending the beginning of formal negotiations about six months later."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/17/business/l-gas-regulation-106554.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 664, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gas Regulation", "print_headline": "Gas Regulation", "body_text": " **********To the Business Editor: **********Regulation is so unpopular today that it is a handy scapegoat for every economic ill. John Sawhill's mixture of non sequiturs and nonfacts about our natural gas price crisis (''The Deregulation of Natural Gas: The Reagan Plan Is Not Enough,'' March 23) is a good illustration. **********For example, Mr. Sawhill doesn't bother to explain when he writes that ''regulation is driving prices up at a time when competition should be forcing them down.'' And for good reason: It is not regulation that has caused the soaring prices but rather deregulation of ''high cost'' gas; an increasing share of total gas sales attributable to higher priced gas, and a producer-dominated Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that has reached for every opportunity to increase producer prices and to condone industry abuses. **********Only by ignoring a commission policy statement was an administrative law judge able to impose some minimal controls on Columbia Gas Transmission for numerous buying abuses, such as paying its producing subsidiary $10 per thousand cubic feet while refusing to take independently produced $2 gas. **********Perhaps most important are the take-or-pay and price escalation contract clauses that pervade the industry, and that would drive prices up even if they were not controlled, as they did in the early 1950's, before wellhead prices were brought under regulation. **********As to Mr. Sawhill's claim that deregulation won't drive up prices, numerous Energy Department and other studies refute that. A General Accounting Office study issued this February concluded that decontrol could produce price increases ranging from 18 to 110 percent, with 88 percent the most likely figure. According to a Dean Witter Reynolds analysis in 1981, accelerated decontrol would raise prices from a 1981 average of $1.70 to $4.50 in 1986. **********Deregulation of old gas - which is really what this controversy is about - could put $21 billion to $48 billion into the pockets of the big oil companies that own most of the ''old gas'' reserves and, incidentally, have little interest in gas exploration. As always, the residential consumer would pay, since industrial customers switch to residual fuel oil. **********Mr. Sawhill tries to minimize the burden on the householder by asserting that 80 percent of sales ''are to areas covered by more than one pipeline,'' implying options for the consumer. But 95 percent are served by only two pipelines - that rarely compete - and most of the major markets, including New York, Chicago, Washington and Baltimore, are served by only one. **********The ''flurry of mergers and other acquisitions that has characterized other industries moving through deregulation'' is something Mr. Sawhill seems to anticipate cheerfully. Does he really want more fiascos like Mobil-Montgomery Ward, Exxon-Reliance, Occidental-Cities Service and Pan Am-National, to mention but a few? Does he really think the Braniff bankruptcy and the current weakened and chaotic condition of the airline industry are good things? **********Gas prices are set not by a competitive ''free market'' but by following industry-administered oil prices that are many times the $1 to $2 cost of production, and far above the $10 to $14 a barrel that a truly competitive market would produce. What we need is not decontrol but better recontrol that will cover both the intrastate and interstate markets, and not exempt the so-called high cost gas.  The onerous take-or-pay and escalator clauses should also be voided (as the Federal Power Commission did in 1962) and there should be tight controls on pipeline abuses. **********Incentives for production are vital. A recent Energy Department study shows that drilling costs are falling and that $3 to $3.50 per thousand cubic feet is more than enough. In that case, we don't need to guarantee two Mercedes SL 380's in every gas producer's garage while millions freeze.

The p erception was that the appointment of Mr. Baxter - a former Stanfordl aw professor known for his conservative philosophy - signaled a t urning away from previous enforcement policies in favor of what was b illed as a more ''pro-business'' line. As one observer put it at t he time, the nomination was a ''message appointment.'' But two yearsl ater, the message seems more confusing and not as helpful as many h ad expected or hoped. **********To a large degree, the Administration has courted a ''soft-line'' reputation on antitrust through pronouncements by the division on various theories of antitrust law, such as its statements favoring so-called ''vertical'' restraints, including vertical price-fixing.  While this move, as well as others, may represent a departure from previous enforcement philosophies, the real question is not how drastic the changes are, but whether they are truly beneficial for American business. Over all, there is substantial ground for doubt. **********Certainly, some of the policies instituted under Mr. Baxter have benefited business and the public. And not all of these constitute ''softness'' in antitrust enforcement. For example, the program of terminating obsolete antitrust consent decrees should be applauded.  Even the most hard-line antitrust prosecutor cannot argue that a consent decree should be kept alive after any competitive need for it has expired. Similarly, the settlement of the A.T.& T. monopolization case, which will restructure the telecommunications industry, can be expected to have significant pro-competitive benefits. **********But the danger inherent in much of the Baxter program is that, far from being beneficial to corporate America, it creates confusion and uncertainty in the business community and generally among the public about the antitrust laws.SINCE 1890, interpretation of Federal antitrust laws, which the S upreme Court has called the ''Magna Carta'' of our economic f reedom, has been the province of the Federal courts. These courts h ave been careful to identify certain areas where flexibility is d esirable, and to apply a ''rule of reason'' test to gauge those p ractices. At the same time the courts have built a degree of c ertainty into antitrust by banning some practices - such as p ricefixing - in their entirety. As a result, while not all the p arameters of the antitrust laws have always been delineated by sharpl ines, American businessmen have generally been able to discern what c onduct is permissible and what is not. However, when the Government s ends out new - and often conflicting - signals, the possibility thatb usinessmen could be misled is real and fraught with risks. **********Vertical price-fixing is a good example. Since 1911, this practice -sometimes called resale price maintenance - has been considered a per se violation of the Sherman Act. While the Department of Justice has let it be known that it now considers such price maintenance to be generally pro-competitive, no businessman could prudently engage in such conduct since the courts, acting upon a challenge by a private party (such as a franchisee, customer or competitor), may disagree and award millions of dollars in treble damages. Moreover, members of Congress, which repealed the fair trade laws sanctioning resale price maintenance in 1975, have made it abundantly clear that the Baxter approach lacks widespread legislative support. **********Along the same lines, until - and unless - the courts change their interpretation of the antimerger law, acquisitions that are challenged in court, such as in hostile takeovers, are likely to be scrutinized under rules established over a period of decades, and not under the criteria in Mr. Baxter's new merger guidelines. **********This duality of standards is troublesome, revealing an inconsistency that in turn leads to confusion and chaos in this area.  No one disputes that new approaches to antitrust enforcement are often necessary and useful. For instance, over the past decade, economics has played an increasingly important role in antitrust and that evolutionary trend should continue. Likewise, it is clear that antitrust enforcers cannot stick their heads in the sand while American businesses are confronted with increasingly vigorous foreign competition, often operating outside the restraints of our laws. Nor should the antitrust laws operate as a deterrent to United States companies competing abroad or pooling resources so as to enter or participate more fully in world markets. But vigorous, consistent law enforcement is not at odds with any of these aims. **********Government antitrust prosecutors are charged with the faithful execution of the laws. They cannot condone what Congress and the courts have branded illegal or simply declare their own criteria of unlawfulness, whether it be ''pro-business'' or ''anti-business.'' Development of the antitrust laws has been an evolutionary process, now more than 90 years old. Interference with that process could mean no one will know either the state of the law or where it is headed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/29/business/business-people-142654.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 343, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE", "body_text": " **********Early Retirements At Bank in Illinois **********The human aspect of corporate misfortune was well illustrated yesterday, when two top officers of the Continental Illinois Corporation and of its flagship subsidiary, the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company, announced that they would take early retirement. **********The two are John H.

Andropov became the Soviet leader eight months ago on a pledge to improve the performance of factories and farms, which have turned in a steadily less impressive performance in recent years. Overall industrial growth last year was less than 2.8 percent, the lowest in decades. **********Western diplomats said the new moves appeared to reflect lessons learned from previous experience. Instead of trying to introduce changes all at once throughout the economy, as in the past, the authorities will limit the new experiments at first to a few industries to reduce confusion while offering a showcase for ideas that some Soviet economists have been advocating for years. 5 Ministries Selected for Test **********The five industrial ministries selected to test the new ideas are two national agencies -- responsible for the manufacture of heavy and transportation machinery and of electrical equipment -- and three ministries under the jurisdiction of some of the 15 republics that make up the Soviet Union: the food industry of the Ukraine, light industry of Byelorussia, and local industry of Lithuania. **********The announcement followed months of expectancy spurred by Mr.  Andropov's early speeches, criticizing overcentralization, bureaucratic inertia and slackness in the work force. **********When the speeches were followed by police roundups of shirkers and little else, there was speculation that the Soviet leader was facing opposition from bureaucratic interests with allies in the ruling Politburo. **********Western diplomats who analyzed today's announcement said it appeared to be a careful first step toward applying ideas that Mr.  Andropov discussed with workers at a Moscow machine-tool factory earlier in the year and on other occasions. Concessions to Conservatives Seen **********While the measures probably involve some concessions to Politburo conservatives, the diplomats said, they also reflect a widespread recognition that economic change can be effected only piecemeal if the party's power is to be sustained. **********The decree said the new measures, in addition to giving plants greater autonomy, were ''intended to strengthen centralized economic management.'' **********Diplomats said the apparent contradiction was a measure of the leadership's wariness of a bureaucracy with a vested interest in arrangements that have officials in Moscow making decisions usually within the prerogatives of plant managers in the West. **********Among the most important experiments in today's package is the decision to cut back on the number of indicators by which a plant's performance is judged and to assign new priorities among those that remain. **********While managers previously had to focus on meeting centrally decreed goals for the value of output, labor productivity, fuel savings and perhaps a dozen other areas, plants under the new plan will be able to give greater emphasis to the marketability of goods. Managers will have to pay close attention to demand instead of fulfilling quotas that often had little relationship to market requirements. To keep Greater Share of Profits **********Those Government plants that perform well under the new criteria would be able to keep an increased share of profits instead of handing them over to the central treasury. **********They would also be able to increase the amount of money allocated to wage and incentive funds, and thus to raise individual wages and bonuses. **********One sensitive point, management's freedom to reduce the often inflated work force, was kept vague, but the decree said the measures were intended to enable plants to meet their quotas ''with a minimum of manpower, material and fiscal resources.'' **********Exportability will move products well up on the scale of performance. With the country facing a hard currency squeeze as a result of slack energy prices and heavy imports of machinery and grain, the Kremlin has been laying new stress on breaking into Western markets with Soviet technology. **********Soviet exports consist mainly of crude oil and refined products, natural gas, timber and other raw materials. Manufactured goods accounted for only 12 percent of exports last year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/14/world/around-the-world-2-egyptians-removed-in-a-cabinet-shuffle.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 199, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 Egyptians Removed In a Cabinet Shuffle", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; 2 Egyptians Removed In a Cabinet Shuffle", "body_text": " **********Two Egyptian Cabinet members implicated in the corruption scandal of Esmat el-Sadat, the half-brother of the late President Anwar el-Sadat, have been removed from office. **********President Hosni Mubarak made the decision after meeting with Prime Minister Ahmed Fuad Moheiddin, and is to swear in the new ministers of the 33-member Cabinet on Monday. **********Ahmed Nouh, the Supply Minister, is to be replaced by Ahmed Nagey Shetla.

Initially it looked as if the beer interests might have it easier. **********But last year's session ended without action, and now the industry is locked in battle with tavern and food store owners, as well as consumer groups, who contend that the bill would lead to higher prices. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have also opposed the bill as anticompetitive. **********If passed, the legislation would allow a brewery to designate a single distributor in a territory, in which no other distributor could compete for the distribution of that beer. The practice of exclusive territories is already widespread in the industry. Nineteen states have laws mandating the exclusive arrangements. One state, Indiana, prohibits exclusive territories, and the rest of the states are silent on the matter. **********Supporters of the bill say that it would merely codify existing practices in the industry and would protect distributors from what they consider to be nagging antitrust lawsuits. **********''The exclusive territories have been the system in the beer industry for the past 50 years,'' said Robert Sullivan, the president of the National Beer Wholesalers Association. ''All this piece of legislation would do is to make people more secure. We'd like to get to the point where it's easier to handle at the courts.'' **********Opponents charge that the law would stifle competition among distributors and raise beer prices, and add that the distributors are actually trying to change the antitrust laws. **********''Their bill creates a whole new standard,'' said Lars Peterson, legislative assistant for the Food Marketing Institute, an association of grocers, chain stores and wholesalers. **********Since a Supreme Court ruling in 1977, the courts have applied what is known as the rule-of-reason in judging exclusive contracts between producers and distributors. In a challenge to such an arrangement, the court would weigh all the evidence to see if the result is anticompetitive. **********The proposed bill ''does not mention the rule-of-reason at all,'' Mr. Peterson said. **********Fewer Sponsors **********Last year, tthe bill had more than 200 co-sponsors in the House of Representatives and 65 in the Senate before the first hearings. But after a last- minute lobbying effort by the retail and consumer groups and several newspaper editorials opposing the bill, the Senate and House Judiciary Committees did not act before the session ended. **********In addition, both the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission opposed the bill. Abbott B. Lipsky Jr., then Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the antitrust division, testified that ''the malt beverage industry is a textbook example of those very special circumstances in which widespread use of exclusive territorial arrangements might have anticompetitive effects.'' **********This year the retailers and consumers seem to have already produced a standoff, and the bill's chances are not viewed as favorable. Despite the fact that there is a beer distributor in nearly every Congressional district, the main sponsor in the House, Representative Jack Brooks, Democrat of Texas, has only been able to muster about 70 co-sponsors. Senator Barry Goldwater, Republican of Arizona, introduced it in the Senate with six co- sponsors. **********Industry Determined **********But the beer industry is determined. ''There will probably be a major effort in 1984 to convince the Congress of the propriety of the bill,'' said Henry B. King, the president of the United States Brewers Association. ''It took the soft drink industry nine years to get their bill passed.'' **********It is the price of beer that is the key concern for the millions of beer drinkers in the United States. Jay Angoff, a lawyer for Congress Watch, a consumers group, said, ''The best argument the beer guys make is that the price of beer hasn't gone up as much as other things in the past few years. That's true, good, and that's why we want to keep the law the way it is.'' **********But there are no clear statistics about the impact on prices of the exclusive arrangements, and little evidence that people can point to from the soft drink industry. **********Jerry Murphy, from the National Licensed Beverage Association, which represents the tavern owners, asserted that the price of soft drinks has gone up since 1980, but he said he was not sure whether how much of the increase was due to the legislation. However, he contends that the beer bill would be more likely to lead to price increases. **********Effect on Prices in Indiana **********The effect on beer prices of Indiana's ban on the territories is not clear. A report from the Indiana Alcoholic Beverage Commission showed a 20 percent drop in the price of beer, and a survey by The Indianapolis Star in November 1982 showed that beer was cheaper where there were no exclusive territories. **********But at a hearing in July, Richard B. Willett, a partner in an accounting firm, Alexander Grant & Company, testified that there was no noticeable change in price where there was a rule against exclusive territories. **********Regardless of how the two sides see the issues, Judiciary Committee members are concerned that, if they pass an antitrust exemption for beer distributors, they will be flooded with requests from other industries. Indeed, the wine industry has already said it is interested."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/06/world/baker-says-effort-to-modify-tax-cut-faces-senate-loss.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Cowan", "pub_date": "1983-06-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BAKER SAYS EFFORT TO MODIFY TAX CUT FACES SENATE LOSS", "print_headline": "BAKER SAYS EFFORT TO MODIFY TAX CUT FACES SENATE LOSS", "body_text": " **********Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, the leader of the Republican majority in the Senate, predicted today that Reagan Administration forces there would defeat any Democratic attempt to modify the 10 percent income tax cut scheduled for July 1. **********On Monday the Speaker of the House, Representative Thomas P.O'Neill Jr., Democrat of Massachusetts, is expected to propose limiting the cut to $700 for each individual taxpayer or couple. Mr.  O'Neill has promised that the House would send such a bill to the Senate. Support For Paul Volcker **********On the CBS News program ''Face the Nation,'' and later in a telephone interview, Senator Baker made these statements: **********- He repeated and strengthened his earlier support for the reappointment of Paul A. Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Alternatively, Senator Baker said, he would like to see the job go to Alan Greenspan, the New York economic consultant, who was chief economic adviser to President Ford. **********- He said ''the future of Central America, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and others will be decided in Moscow and Washington,'' not ''in San Salvador and Havana,'' and that he hoped President Reagan would ''engage in meaningful conversation with the Soviet Union'' on the possibility of reciprocal restraint. **********- He said that ''the appropriations process was going to be the big issue for the rest of the year'' and therefore it was unlikely that the President would veto the pending bill to repeal tax withholding on dividends and interest. Although Mr. Reagan has promised to veto the bill, ''he can invest only so much in certain issues,'' Senator Baker said. Summit Meeting Suggested **********Senator Baker, who has said he will consider running for President if Mr. Reagan decides against a second term, used the word ''opportunity'' several times in the interview with respect to jobs and the economy and with respect to achieving an arms control agreement with the Soviet Union. ''There is a real chance we're going to see progress in this field soon,'' he said of the arms control issue. **********He voiced the hope that Mr. Reagan would meet the new Soviet leader, Yuri V. Andropov. ''These two leaders owe the obligation to the rest of the world to get together and get to know each other,'' the Senator said. **********The possibility of a summit meeting was discussed last week by Presidential advisers after allied Western leaders informed Mr.  Reagan at the Williamsburg conference that Mr. Andropov was interested in meeting him. **********Regarding budgetary matters, Mr. Baker referred to the 12 appropriations for the executive branch and said: ''It's going to be a donnybrook for each one. It will be a struggle to keep it within the President's budget.'' Even Odds on Resolution **********Mr. Baker linked the possibility of ''a siege of Presidential vetoes of spending bills'' - ''and I would cheer him on in that respect,'' he said - with his appraisal that ''the odds are no better than 50-50'' that the Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic House will agree on a Congressional budget resolution for the 1984 fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. A House-Senate conference to resolve differences in the resolutions from the two chambers is expected to start this week. **********''If you don't get a budget, you don't get a budget,'' Senator Baker added. ''The Government doesn't stop, but it would be too bad because I think it would call into question the efficiency of the budget process and our will and determination to get the budget under control.'' **********Under the 1974 Congressional Budget Act, a Congressional budget resolution is an attempt to impose a discipline on total spending and spending for major functions, such as the military, health and agriculture. The fear is that without a resolution, the individual spending bills may become swollen. **********Echoing threats by Mr. Reagan, Senator Baker said that in the absence of a budget resolution, the President might have to veto individual money bills as too big. Republicans have said that would be part of a strategy of blaming the Democrats for big budget deficits, which the Democrats attribute to the three-year Reagan tax cut enacted in 1981. Thanks Offered to Democrats **********Mr. Baker took pains in the television interview to portray himself as optimistic about America's future and as generous toward the political opposition. **********He thanked Mr. O'Neill and other House Democrats for having already sent two appropriations bills to the Senate, months earlier than has often been the case. Consequently, he said he was dropping his earlier plan to have the Senate recess from the Fourth of July until Labor Day, inasmuch as it would have a batch of money bills to consider in July. Both houses are scheduled to recess Aug. 5, until after Labor Day. **********Senator Baker said he hoped Congress could adjourn for the rest of the year by Oct. 1. ''I have a deep-seated belief that the Congress does not profit from being in session all year long, and that we ought to adjourn and go home and find out what's going on,'' he said. He has said he would not run for re-election in 1984. **********On Central America, Mr. Baker said he opposed the dispatching of American combat troops, ''but I would also be opposed to withdrawing the assistance we are now giving them.'' As for the region's future being ''decided in Moscow and Washington,'' Mr. Baker was reluctant to be drawn out after the television program, but confirmed that he hoped Mr. Reagan and Mr. Andropov could agree on mutual restraint. **********On the reappointment of Mr. Volcker, which he urged on the Senate floor in May, Mr. Baker said the Federal Reserve chairman was ''a known quantity'' and ''extremely qualified.'' **********''His reappointment would signal continuation of present policies, which include the probability of a gradual further reduction in interest rates, and I think it would have a calming and tranquilizing effect on the world economy,'' he said. **********Then, picking up a line uttered last week by Administration officials, a remark some in Washington heard as a hint that Mr.  Volcker would be dropped, Mr. Baker said: ''What I have just said to you doesn't say as well that he's the only man in the world that can do it, and the President could make a choice with other good men and women.'' He added, ''Alan Greenspan's name comes to mind.'' **********The Senate must confirm either Mr. Volcker's reappointment or the appointment of a successor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/12/business/finance-new-issues-american-express.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "American Express", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; American Express", "body_text": " **********The American Express Credit Corporation filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement for the sale of up to $600 million of debt securities.

A senior official of the Baghdad Government said recently that Iraq had already fired Soviet-made surface-to-surface missiles at Kharg Island, the Iranian oil terminal at the head of the gulf, and neutral military analysts believe that there will be further attacks from missile sites in Iraq. **********The type of missile supplied by the Soviet Union to Iraq, known as SCUD B in the West, has a range of 187 miles and is capable of hitting Kharg Island and other targets in Iran from sites deep in Iraq. Recently these missiles have hit cities 125 miles into Iran. However the SCUD B, which can carry either a nuclear or a non-nuclear warhead, is not an accurate missile and informed opinion in London is that the Iraqis might fire as many as 10 without hitting the Kharg Island terminal. **********Some analysts and officials here say they believe that the French-made Exocet missiles fired from super-Etendard fighter bombers, also French- made, would be equally ineffective against the terminal largely because their guidance systems are built to register on ships rather than stationary targets like Kharg Island, which at any time could be masked by tankers loading oil.   Danger From Exocets **********Exocets might sink one of the ships, the sources said, but the oil terminal probably would continue to function. **********The prevailing opinion, however, is that in time the Iraqis, using a combination of SCUDS and Exocets, will sink a foreign tanker in the gulf and force Iran to retaliate by closing the gulf to international shipping through naval action. **********The military analysts said, however, that Iran has neither the mine-laying capacity nor the command and control system to mine the Strait of Hormuz which runs from the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. **********Some sources believe that Iran will take the step if Iraqi attacks on gulf shipping become intolerable. They predicted that the oil-exporting nations of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates will demand escorts for tankers and that these could be provided by the United States, Britain and perhaps France.   Need for Air Cover **********Military sources also believe that the tankers and their escorts would require air cover to protect them from the Iranian Air Force, which is now thought to have about 75 aircraft operational. The estimate here is that approximately 45 of these are American-made F-4's and F-14's. The presence of the F-14's at bases in southwestern Iran, analysts said, explains the Iraqi Air Force's reluctance to press home bombing attacks on Kharg Island, since the F-14 is faster and more maneuverable aircraft than anything in the Iraqi inventory. **********Air cover could be provided by planes from American or British carriers in the Arabian Sea or as a last resort from Oman's Masira Island base. By closing the gulf Iran would create difficulties for the other gulf nations and weaken its position in the economic war. At present Iran is able to export far more oil than Iraq by using Kharg Island and ports at the eastern end of the gulf. **********Qualified sources here believe that Iran is not prepared to fight a naval war against Iraq or an international force. The Iranian destroyer Artemis, which is going through trials after expensive repairs due to war damage, is the only major Iranian combatant in the gulf and the navy's force of 12 missile-and gun-armed fast attack craft has been reduced to about six ships by Iraqi action. **********Iran's last option to meet growing Iraqi air and naval pressure in the gulf is to strengthen its offensive on the northern battlefront opposite the Iraqi oil-producing center of Kirkuk and the southern terminal of Iraq's only pipeline to the Mediterranean.   Support for Iraq's Economy **********The pipeline now carries about 800,000 barrels a day as a result of the introduction of chemicals to thin the oil and increase the flow. This and the subsidies from Saudi Arabia and other gulf nations have enabled Iraq to maintain its war economy. **********Iran's northern offensive, military analysts said, thus far has done little more than recapture some territory seized by Iraq at the start of the war in September, 1980. This area lies north and east of the town of Penjwin. **********A successful drive on Kirkuk and the pipeline would require more men, munitions and air power than Iran could mobilize in that area without seriously weakening its strength on other fronts, analysts said.  In any case, one analyst pointed out, a severed pipeline or a damaged pumping station can be quickly repaired. Iraq's lines of communication joining the fronts in the north, at Mandali northeast of Baghdad, Missan to the southwest and Basra near the Shatt Al Arab, suffice to insure rapid reinforcement when the Iranians attack at any point on the front. **********But the best estimates here are that Iraq cannot win a defensive war against a more populous Iran, which exports much more oil. Baghdad's only hope may be the intervention of outside powers to protect oil shipments and the eventual military as well as financial aid from the other gulf nations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/20/world/the-un-and-the-city-obligation-opportunity-and-irritation.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 695, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE U.N.

By all accounts, the results have been a mix of love, hate, tolerance and indifference. **********As perceived by many New Yorkers, diplomatic immunity has meant a kind of license for United Nations personnel to park illegally, ignore bills and legal summonses, scoff at lawsuits, walk away from criminal charges and behave with haughty insensitivity. **********As perceived by many United Nations diplomats, the cosmopolitan city has been surprisingly xenophobic, a place of noise, dirt, discourtesy, crime, outrageous prices and discrimination ranging from landlords who refuse rentals to racial slurs and bumper stickers proclaiming: ''Get the U.N. out of the U.S.'' **********But the city and its international diplomatic community have also brought each other mutual benefits whose loss, if the United Nations were to leave New York, would have a ''devastating impact,'' in the opinion of Gillian Martin Sorensen, who heads the New York City Commission for the United Nations. **********'Ups and Downs' **********''We've always had our ups and downs, our moments of strain and tension,'' Commissioner Sorensen said yesterday. ''But removing the U.N. from New York would make about as much sense as moving the Vatican out of Rome or the Pyramids out of Egypt. We belong together. Despite the strains, we nurture each other in very important ways.'' **********The nadir in relations between the city and the United Nations came in 1975, when the General Assembly passed a resolution equating Zionism with racism. Mayor Abraham D. Beame called the vote ''a sickening act,'' and there was talk in the City Council of closing the city's United Nations liaison office. **********The United States contributes 25 percent of the world organization's budget, which was $722 million last year and is expected to be $784 million this year. The United Nations, as a major purchaser, builder and employer, contributes $700 million a year to the city's economy. **********''There are a great number of stores and shops in the United Nations area that depend on diplomatic-related clientele,'' Commissioner Sorensen said. In addition, theaters, hotels, restaurants and other businesses receive the patronage of the diplomatic community.   Mutual Cultural Benefits **********But beyond financial considerations, she said, are mutual cultural benefits. ''New York wants to consider itself a world headquarters in commerce, finance, the arts, and being the world headquarters for the diplomatic community is also very important,'' she said. ''We've always played that unique role.'' **********Many diplomats, the commissioner said, ''are happy in New York - they enjoy the city, its options and energy, and the fact that the phones and the elevators work.'' The city, for its part, has also been proud of its role as home to the United Nations, a role that has added to the city's reputation for diversity and tolerance, she said. **********Over the years, since the founders of the United Nations agreed to build their headquarters on a parcel of donated land on Manhattan's East Side riverfront, the relationship between the city and the United Nations has been an uneasy balance of obligation and opportunity strained by immunities, privileges and costs.   Diplomatic Immunity Laws **********Some of the irritants - indifference to local parking rules, unpaid bills, the privilege of driving away from a minor car accidents - have eased to some extent in recent years by the passage in 1978 of Federal laws to limit diplomatic immunity in such matters to ambassadors and their families and other top- level staff members. Low- and middle-level diplomats lost such immunities. **********In addition, most of New York City's expenses for the protection of diplomats are now being paid by the Federal Government. Those costs had been the topic of an oft-heard complaint of New Yorkers. New York City still loses about $15 million a year in property and other taxes and in the costs of police protection, Commissioner Sorensen said. **********''But compared to the $700 million in benefits, the city is way ahead - no question,'' the commissioner said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/08/business/texas-gas-csx-acquisition.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 204, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Texas Gas-CSX Acquisition", "print_headline": "Texas Gas-CSX Acquisition", "body_text": " **********Another Supreme Court Justice declined Saturday evening to block the $1.07 billion takeover of the Texas Gas Resources Corporation by the CSX Corporation. **********Saturday's denial of the petition of the Water Transport Association came from Justice Lewis F.

''Extending the range of rapid communications between the United States and the Soviet Union would make an important contribution to stability.'' **********The proposals, which the Administration calls ''confidence building'' measures, would improve the existing hot line between the White House and the Kremlin by installing a high-speed facsimile transmission machine for the exchange of graphic material and large amounts of electronic data. **********The measures were submitted to Congress last month by the Pentagon in response to a request for a report on possible new initiatives for reducing the risk of nuclear war by miscalculation or accident. No legislative action is necessary on the proposals, which President Reagan formally adopted today. **********Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger briefed the Soviet Ambassador, Anatoly F. Dobrynin, on the proposals last month and said the envoy had promised to forward them to Moscow for comment.  So far, there has been no reaction from the Soviet Union, White House officials said. Hot Line 20 Years Old **********The existing hot line is a teleprinter link, set up 20 years ago after the Cuban missile crisis; it works at the rate of 60 words a minute - a relatively slow pace for the modern missile age. The machinery Mr. Reagan proposes would permit nearly instantaneous exchanges of block messages and maps. **********The proposals would also establish direct links between Soviet and American military leaders to parallel the hot line. The President said this could be used for ''the rapid exchange of technical military information, thereby preventing misunderstanding in a crisis.'' **********The White House would also use it for a previously proposed measure by which the two powers would exchange advance notice of ballistic missile tests and military exercises. **********Two other proposals would improve electronic communications with the nations' embassies in Moscow and Washington and provide for international consultation in the event ''a nuclear incident is precipitated by an individual or group.'' The President said he saw no increasing risk of such a possibility but considered it prudent to be prepared should ''the unthinkable happen.'' Rose Garden Ceremony **********Mr. Reagan announced his endorsement at a ceremony in the Rose Garden that included a bipartisan group of senators who have been closely involved in the Administration's effort to win approval of the MX missile in Congress. White House officials denied that Mr.  Reagan's remarks, in which he said the proposals would add momentum to the arms-control process, were timed to win additional support for the MX. **********''They add new dimensions to our communications efforts,'' the President said of the proposals, ''allowing us to contact each other rapidly at political, military and diplomatic levels, improving our capability to contain crisis situations.'' **********Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, who attended the Rose Garden session, said later that the proposals, if put into effect, , could lead to ''crisis control'' centers in both countries and could prevent terrorist groups from being the catalytic agents of a nuclear war. **********After the ceremony, the President had lunch privately with former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.  ''I feel basically optimistic about the possibilty of negotiating with the Soviets,'' Mr. Kissinger said later in discussing the President's arms-control proposals, ''and I think we're more or less heading in the right direction.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/08/business/business-people-oecd-deciding-on-top-economist.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 345, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "O.E.C.D.

Mr. Tufaro was questioning the man in Los Angeles in a bankruptcy case, and knew the witness had contradicted himself in a deposition several weeks before. **********But instead of spending hours wading through the 3,000 pages of the witness's testimony, Mr. Tufaro had an associate put the witness's name and the subject of his testimony into a computer connected to Mr. Tufaro's law office in New York. In seconds, the lawyer had what he needed on the computer screen in Los Angeles, a contradiction that helped him settle the case. **********Mr. Tufaro is with Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy, and his case is only one example of the ways in which computers are helping lawyers do their work more efficiently. **********'Revolutionizing Legal Practice' **********''The use of computers is clearly revolutionizing legal practice,'' said Francis H. Musselman, an attorney at Milbank Tweed and former chairman of the American Bar Association committee on the economics of law practice. **********One result is a reduction in the mountains of paper that threaten to bury most lawyers. Another is a cut in the time needed to prepare routine documents and to pore through bulky volumes to find pertinent cases. **********All of this, for now, is not cheap. Even a system for a modest law office can start at $20,000. The large firms would require a more formidable investment. **********Milbank Tweed has two 4341 Model II I.B.M. mainframes, and associated equipment; 220 terminals; 20 display writers, and two separate personal computers. **********Cost Is $3 Million a Year **********It leases the equipment for about $2 million a year. Operating expenses add another $1 million a year. To purchase the equipment, Milbank's administrator estimates, would cost about $6 million in capital costs, and about $2 million a year to operate - more expensive than the lease arrangement because of a different depreciation write-off. **********The use of computers by lawyers has created an intense competitive scramble among suppliers of hardware and software - especially between the two providers of computerized legal research systems. **********Mead Data Central, a division of the Mead Corporation, was first with its Lexis legal research system in 1973 and now puts more than 48,000 new cases and judicial orders into it each week. Lexis still dominates the field with an estimated 9-to-1 edge in sales. But its competition, the West Publishing Company, a leading publisher of law books, is making inroads. One attraction of West's computer research system, Westlaw, was that unlike Lexis it was accessible through most law firms' word processing equipment. **********Law School Discounts **********This fall, West began to offer big discounts to law schools, most of which now train students to use one or both of the computer research systems. The company also signed a five-year contract recently to provide computerized research to the Federal courts. **********Lexis has fought back by making its products increasingly compatible with other systems. In fact, software being developed by Inslaw Inc. for several New York law firms, including Milbank Tweed and Sullivan & Cromwell, will make various functions - for example, accounting, attorney timekeeping, and legal research - available on the same terminal, whether it is made by Lexis or the International Business Machines Corporation. **********Conducting computer research also does not come cheap. Both the Lexis and Westlaw systems cost law offices about $2 to $4 a minute, depending on the amount of use. **********In the next several years, annual sales of specialty equipment and software for law firms are expected to triple, to $1 billion, according to James F. Rabenhorst, chairman of the law firm services group at Price Waterhouse. **********At Milbank Tweed, which is considered a front-runner in computerization, every secretary has a terminal, and nearly half of the 240 attorneys have terminals. Davis Polk & Wardwell has a staff of 15 just to service its computer system. **********Small Firms Involved, Too **********But the use of computers is not limited to large firms. Phil J. Shuey, who runs a one-lawyer office in Denver, uses a computer to store standard legal forms and maintain his client timekeeping records. **********Two basic types of computer hardware are used in law offices. One is a terminal connected to computerized law libraries like Lexis and Westlaw so lawyers can do legal research without opening a book. The other is a standard personal computer that uses software designed specifically to perform a variety of legal tasks. **********For Mr. Tufaro, a personal computer solved a type of problem lawyers confront almost every day: how to pinpoint a particular fact or legal principle among reams of documents or thick volumes of court decisions. But computers can do more. They can eliminate much tedious work - the drafting of routine motions, pleadings and other legal documents."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/06/business/no-headline-113248.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1983-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 41, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Headline", "print_headline": "No Headline", "body_text": " **********Nielsen Cable Data **********The A.C.

Israel is convinced that the Lebanese are putty in American hands and that an agreement can be concluded quickly if Mr. Shultz bears down on Beirut. Similarly, the Lebanese are said to be certain that Israel will compromise if Washington tells it firmly to do so. **********Move by Soviet Feared **********Some Israeli officials, however, regard the American operation as an overreaction to relatively minor reverses. They see too much American prestige being attached to resolving the Lebanon situation, and they worry that creating such a big stake for Washington may induce the Soviet Union to react by trying to spoil the success. This Moscow could do by pushing its client, Syria, to refuse to withdraw its troops from Lebanon's Bekaa region. **********The Russians have been rearming Syria at a rapid rate, more than replacing what the Syrians lost to Israeli attacks in the war in Lebanon that began last June, according to officials here. **********Modern Soviet-built weapons, including the T-72 tank, the MIG-25 fighter plane and the long-range SA-5 antiaircraft missile have been introduced, and the number of Soviet military technicians and advisers in Syria has risen to 4,000, up from about 2,500 before the war, according to Defense Minister Moshe Arens. **********Syria has recently redeployed some troops and armor, has called up some crack reserve units and has put standing units and hospitals on alert, officials here say. Some of the redeployment is seasonal, coming after the end of the winter rains, when muddy areas dry out and permit freer movement of tanks, artillery and other heavy weapons. Israel is also taking up new positions, and the Israeli press has carried reports of units being placed on alert. Warning From Moscow **********The military movement has increased tension, with Damascus and Moscow warning against any Israeli attack. Some Israeli officials, who insist that no such attack is planned, believe that the Soviet resupply and the warnings were to be expected from the Russians after their foremost client in the region took a beating. **********One theory holds that the Russians, figuring that Israel would not attack, warned it not to do so, thus enabling Moscow to take credit for preventing something that was unlikely to happen anyway. **********Mr. Shultz's priority is expected to be the faltering Israeli-Lebanese talks on troop withdrawals from Lebanon. The negotiations were going fairly well until last Thursday, officials say, when the Lebanese delegation seemed to back away from several positions already agreed upon. These included details of the size and timing of proposed joint military patrols in southern Lebanon and elements of an accord on an open border with Israel. **********There has been Lebanese resistance all along to the demands by the Begin Government for some Israeli military presence in a southern Lebanese security zone after an Israeli troop pullout. But compromises by both sides in recent weeks had reportedly brought an accord within close reach. Israel had scaled down its demands, and Lebanon appeared to have agreed to the kind of partnership and close cooperation Israeli officials felt was needed to minimize the possibility of Palestinian guerrillas' return to the area. Differences Narrowed **********Both sides have been annoyed by the other's negotiating tactics.  Still, there has been a substantial narrowing of the differences. The Begin Government began by demanding five outposts in southern Lebanon, to be manned by 750 Israeli soldiers and intelligence agents. The idea has been informally dropped, though it remains technically on the table. **********Now, officials say, Israel wants two headquarters for a southern brigade of the Lebanese Army, where Israeli officers would be stationed to coordinate joint patrols of Israeli and Lebanese troops. President Gemayel, who fears that an Israeli presence would be used by Damascus as an excuse not to withdraw the Syrian Army, contradicted his negotiators recently by saying that joint patrols were unacceptable. **********Both sides have apparently agreed that the bulk of the southern brigade would comprise the 1,800 troops of Maj. Saad Haddad's local militia force, which has received Israeli arms and training since the 1975-76 civil war. The problem remains what to do with Major Haddad himself, who is technically a deserter from the Lebanese Army. **********Israel wants him to be the southern commander; Lebanon, which did not want him at all, has reportedly agreed to make him deputy commander. **********Mr. Shultz's mission in the coming days is to bridge the gaps."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/29/business/market-place-margin-debt-s-recent-growth.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1983-07-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 704, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Margin Debt's Recent Growth", "print_headline": "Market Place; Margin Debt's Recent Growth", "body_text": " **********ALTHOUGH the market timing skill of people who buy stocks on credit is a subject of recurring debate, one thing is certain: Lately they have been purchasing equities in record numbers. **********The margin debt of customers at member firms of the New York Stock Exchange rose $1.6 billion last month, to a new high of $17.9 billion. Meanwhile, the head count of customers with margin accounts increased by 30,000 to reach 790,000, also a record. In the three months ended June 30, margin debt expanded by $3.8 billion while the number of margin accounts climbed by 80,000. **********The trend of margin debt usually tracks stock-price movements, and the current bull market has borne this out so far. Rising equity prices also set records last month. The Dow Jones industrial average reached its closing high on June 16 at 1,248.30. **********''The upswing in margin debt during the last several months, from a technical standpoint, has confirmed the market's advance,'' Standard & Poor's Outlook said in mid-June. **********A customer with a margin account is borrowing money from his broker, and the stock is used as collateral for the loan to help pay for the shares. The percentage of cash a person must put up to open a margin account is fixed by the Federal Reserve Board. This margin requirement has remained at 50 percent since 1974. **********Buying on 50 percent margin provides leverage, since it allows a person to invest up to twice as much money. But this strategy is suitable only for people who can afford the risks. The leverage principle works against the customer if stock prices decline. In extreme cases, it can even lead to margin maintenance calls requiring the client to deposit additional cash or securities in the account. **********The pattern of margin account activity can also provide hints as to the possible direction of stock market movements.  ''One textbook example of a market bottom would show cash-account customers buying stock at the same time margin-account customers are selling,'' said Richard McCabe, manager of the market analysis department at Merrill Lynch. ''A glaring exception to this general rule, however, occurred last summer when stock prices reached their lows. Both types of accounts were selling in that period, which meant that only one-half of a market bottom signal was given.'' **********At the end of June 1982, margin debt of customers at Big Board firms - which includes money borrowed to purchase exchange-listed securities and also qualifying issues traded over the counter - totaled $11.54 billion. This debt declined slightly, to $11.47 billion, during July. **********The bull market in stocks began the second week of August. But between the end of July and the end of September, margin debt continued to slip, contracting by $520 million to reach $10.95 billion. Since then the debt has climbed each month, moving in gear with the general pattern of rising stock prices. **********As one tool in its technical analysis, Merrill Lynch constantly monitors activity of its margin-account and cash-account customers.  ''In recent months,'' Mr. McCabe said, ''margin accounts have been moderate net buyers, while cash accounts have been light net sellers.'' **********Deviations in margin debt can sometimes provide a clue to impending changes in the stock market, according to Joseph A. Feshbach, chief technical analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. **********''In the late spring of 1981, when the tone of the market still appeared pretty healthy and the Dow industrials were above 1,000, margin debt started to level off and that flashed a caution signal,'' he said. ''In June 1981, margin debt topped out at $14.87 billion and then dropped all the way to $10.95 billion last September.'' **********Meanwhile, the industrial average turned downward and reached a 27-month closing low last Aug. 12 at 776.92.  As for the argument that margin-account buyers are poor market timers, Mr. Feshbach observed, ''A lot of margin players have made a fortune in this bull market.'' **********Currently, however, in light of the stock market's sharp drop in the last two days, margin buyers are facing an old problem: Is this the time to take profits and run?"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/27/business/zenith-posts-profit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Zenith Posts Profit", "print_headline": "Zenith Posts Profit", "body_text": " **********The Zenith Radio Corporation reported today that it made a profit of $8.9 million in the first quarter, compared with a $2.4 million loss in the period last year. **********Company officials cited cost-reduction programs and increased shipments of cable television products and components as major factors in the improvement.

If the order is not executed within two minutes, it is canceled, and to re-execute the trade a new quote must be obtained. **********On busy days, when the exchanges are swamped with orders, the orders sit.

The Defense Minister's strong support of the country's social and economic development won him the support of the United States last year. But since January, even American officals have come to agree with Salvadoran officers that major changes are needed in the military command structure if El Salvador is to win the three-year-old civil war. **********Both American and Salvadoran officials have criticized the Defense Minister for mismanaging the war and naming inept departmental commanders to lead the country's troops. **********In an interview this week, General Garcia firmly denied that he will resign.

Military sources said he that agonized for weeks over his decision to challenge the Defense Minister's authority and that he views it as his patriotic duty to take decisive action against General Garcia. **********What form his challenge will take is unclear.

FELDSTEIN", "print_headline": "MAN IN THE NEWS; EMBATTLED ECONOMIC ADVISER: MARTIN S. FELDSTEIN", "body_text": " **********Few American economists of his age - 44 last week - could have brought as rich a reputation to the chairmanship of the Council of Economic Advisers as Martin S. Feldstein did last year, and few of his predecessors have brought more criticism from his employers in the White House.  The sniping took on an unusually nasty edge Wednesday, generating widespread speculation that Mr. Feldstein would have to resign. The President's spokesman, Larry Speakes, joked about Mr. Feldstein's limited role in policy making and even mocked the pronunciation of the man's name, alternating between ''Feld-STINE,'' which the economist prefers, and ''Feld- STEEN,'' which many members of the White House staff tend to use. **********It is differences over tone and style as well as the substance of economic policy that divide Mr. Feldstein from the White House and Donald T. Regan's Treasury Department. All sides agree that Federal budget deficits are a problem, and all allow that taxes might have to be raised to lower the deficits.  Mr. Feldstein, however, has been talking more about Mr. Reagan's cuts in taxes and increases in military spending as components of the deficit than have other Administration officers, and most of the Administration wishes he would not. **********''They know the deficits are their Achilles' heel, but they would prefer that he emphasize recovery,'' said Lawrence A. Kudlow, who was chief economist in the Office of Management and Budget early in the Reagan Administration and is now a consultant here. **********Martin Stuart Feldstein was appointed chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in August 1982 following the resignation of Murray L. Weidenbaum, who returned to teaching at Washington University in St. Louis. **********At the time, Mr. Feldstein was a professor at Harvard and head of the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass., a private organization into which he had breathed new purpose and energy. **********Alternatives to Keynes **********Mr. Feldstein was at the front of a wave of youthful conservative economists who won wide recognition for alternatives to Keynesian theories. Those theories had governed economic policy-making since adoption of the Employment Act of 1946, but they had fallen into disrepute in the face of the high inflation and recurrent recessions - stagflation - of the 1970's. Mr. Feldstein has emphasized the importance of savings and capital investment as dual pistons of economic growth. **********Initially, he resisted joining the Council of Economic Advisers. With Mr. Reagan's election in 1980, rumors spread that he would be called to head the council. He deflected them by making it known to the new President's staff - even before they approached him - that he was involved in research projects that precluded joining the Administration. A year later, however, the work had been completed and he was ready. **********Mr. Feldstein has never become as close an adviser to the President as most of his predecessors and colleagues. In his concern over the deficits, however, Mr. Feldstein has important allies, notably on Capitol Hill. His views are also consistent with those of the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Paul A. Volcker. And within the Administration, his allies include the budget director, David A. Stockman. **********But Mr. Stockman has kept his views of the deficit within the Administration councils, and Mr. Feldstein has not. And with the Administration likely to campaign on tax cuts - not tax increases - and the recovery's unexpectedly strong recovery and the sharp decline in inflation, Mr. Feldstein's persistent public warnings have become particularly inopportune. **********Why Mr. Feldstein continues to harp on this point baffles other economists. ''There's always been the suspicion that he's playing to Harvard, the Charles River crowd,'' Mr. Kudlow said, ''that he's more interested in protecting his academic integrity than the President's programs.'' **********Mr. Feldstein's manner, too, suggests that he may feel closer to Cambridge than Washington. He has a professor's precision in explicating complicated issues, though he is never patronizing. And through all the furor, he has maintained an air of being bemused that his sober economic analyses should ignite such firestorms. **********His quarters in the Old Executive Office Building beside the White House also convey that he has never fully made himself at home on Pennsylvania Avenue. While elegantly furnished with reproduction antiques, the corner office lacks the framed pictures and other personal effects that imbue an office with the identity of its occupant. **********In similar circumstances, many previous council chairmen have kept their dissent to themselves once they lost debates with the Administration. ''I was very fortunate in the sense that I found myself on the same side as President Ford almost all the time,'' said Alan Greenspan, who was chairman of Council of Economic Advisers under President Ford. **********''But when there were exceptions, I just exempted myself,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''I would not testify on certain bills. And when I was asked questions about them, I would stipulate that the President believes such and such, and when asked what I believed, I said that was not relevant.'' **********''I feel I have my credibility to protect, too,'' said a senior Administration economist who asked not to be identified. ''But no one has forced me to speak out on something I had strong reservations about. When you disagree and you lose, you just have to remain silent. I don't go out on the speaking circuit.'' **********Military Spending Noted **********Although Mr. Feldstein is now portrayed as a critic of Administration spending and fiscal policy, he has not, in fact, openly criticized the rise in military outlays, and people close to him say he supports the military program. In a speech Wednesday analyzing the deficit and in comments earlier this week, he simply noted the rise in military spending along with other changes in discussing the budget deficits.  Mr. Feldstein, a bespectacled man of five foot nine inches, is married to the former Kathleen Foley, also an economist. Before he came to Washington, they wrote a joint newspaper column on economics topics. **********The Feldsteins have two daughters, Margaret, 13, and Janet, 11. For the duration of Mr. Feldstein's public service, the family has moved from its Belmont, Mass., home near Cambridge to a rented house in the Georgetown section of Washington. **********Mr. and Mrs. Feldstein often attend the theater, ballet and opera. Last month, they saw two productions of the Washington Opera Company, Cos i fan Tutte and Rigoletto."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/16/business/barco-of-california-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-jan-1.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BARCO OF CALIFORNIA (CO) reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 1", "print_headline": "BARCO OF CALIFORNIA (CO) reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 1", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/27/business/venezuela-s-fund-talks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Venezuela's Fund Talks", "print_headline": "Venezuela's Fund Talks", "body_text": " **********Venezuela has put off until 1984 talks with the International Monetary Fund aimed at devising a new economic program, Finance Minister Arturo Sosa said today. **********''We are no longer discussing a 1983 program with the I.M.F. and hope to agree on a one-year program starting early next year,'' Mr. Sosa told a news conference. **********He said, however, that Venezuela still proposes to reschedule up to $18.4 billion of foreign debt this year. **********Venezuela's 13-bank advisory committee has until now stipulated an I.M.F. accord as a condition for rescheduling, but banking sources say some members have softened their position recently."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/27/world/reagan-s-letter-to-latin-peace-group.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 619, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REAGAN'S LETTER TO LATIN PEACE GROUP", "print_headline": "REAGAN'S LETTER TO LATIN PEACE GROUP", "body_text": " **********Following is a letter from President Reagan to the so-called Contadora group, which is made up of Panama, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela and is trying to foster a settlement of the conflicts in Central America: Dear Mr. President, Thank you for the letter which you and the Presidents of Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela have sent to me concerning the meeting held in Cancun on July 17 to review the current situation in Central America. **********I would like to congratulate you on the efforts which the Contadora Four are making to promote dialogue among the countries of Central America. My Government has consistently expressed strong support for the Contadora process. The Cancun Declaration, by articulating the crucial issues which must be treated to reach an effective and enduring resolution of the Central American conflict, is an important contribution to advancing that process. **********Four Points **********I continue to believe that a solution to the crisis in Central America must encompass four basic principles: First, it is essential that democratic institutions be established and strengthened as a means to resolve political differences within the Central American states. Only by insuring free and open participation in the democratic process can the peoples of Central America achieve reconciliation within their societies. **********Second, there must be respect for the principle of nonintervention, including a ban on support for subversive elements that seek to destabilize other countries. **********Third, the conflict in Central America must be removed from the context of an East-West confrontation through such measures as the verifiable withdrawal of all foreign military and security advisers and a certifiable freeze on the acquisition of offensive armaments. **********And finally, the countries of Central America must work among themselves and with their neighbors to achieve and sustain a level of economic growth that will guarantee the basic needs of their people. **********I am pleased that the Cancun Declaration recognizes the importance of these fundamental principles. These issues are inextricably interrelated and must be addressed on a comprehensive, regional basis which treats simultaneously the concerns of all the states affected by the Central American conflict. An attempt to resolve these issues sequentially, or on a piecemeal basis, will not achieve the goal we all share of a lasting peace for all of Central America. Role for O.A.S. **********Equally important is the need to insure that all undertakings assumed by the Central American states be fully reciprocal and subject to comprehensive, fully adequate verification. Clearly, no initiative can bring true peace to Central America if one state is permitted to take unjust advantage of its neighbors through failure to abide by peace conditions which bind the others. The Charter of the Organization of American States makes clear that it should be the purpose of the O.A.S. to either prevent unjust acts committed by one state against another or to provide for common action on the part of the members in the event of difficulties. I believe the O.A.S., as this hemisphere's regional forum, is the appropriate mechanism to insure that those who make commitments comply with them. **********The problems of Central America are complex, and their solution demands untiring efforts. The activities which you and your colleagues in the Contadora group have undertaken are proof of your sincere dedication to the goal of a genuine and lasting peace throughout the region. My own efforts in this regard have been to dispatch my special emmissary to the region and establish a bipartisan commission to examine the problems of Central America and to propose solutions. You have my prayers and those of my countrymen as you continue your work.

Kuwait's alarm is shared to varying degrees by all the other small oil exporters along the Gulf, from Bahrain down through Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to Oman. **********For the first time since the big price explosion in 1974, the conservative, pro-Western rulers of these vulnerable Arab nations are learning that they can no longer count on constantly rising revenue to buy social peace at home. The Nation's Riches **********Kuwait, like the other states, remains wealthy, with huge assets and few people to support. Its population of 1.4 million is sitting on 10 percent of the world's known oil reserves, and the Government has $70 billion to $100 billion invested overseas. **********But, says one Western ambassador, ''Of course any change makes people nervous in a tiny, defenseless country with immense riches that is surrounded by covetous neighbors.'' **********Despite a 40 percent decline in oil revenue over the past year, the Government is under pressure to maintain spending. These pressures are illustrated by the following recent developments: **********- The collapse last summer of Kuwait's unofficial stock market under a $90 billion mountain of bad checks threatens to ruin so many Kuwaitis that the Government has agreed to bail out thousands of small investors - defining ''small'' as anyone whose losses are under $66 million. Some estimates suggest that the Government has already committed about $5 billion to avoid widespread bankruptcies. **********- With the flare-up in the Iraq-Iran war, Kuwait is again being asked to lend money to Iraq. Although Iraq claims Kuwait's oilfields, Kuwait has preferred to help finance Iraq, to the tune of $6 billion so far, rather than risk a victory by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's revolutionary forces, because Iran is committed to the overthrow of the conservative Gulf rulers. **********- The war has also ruined Kuwait's lucrative trade with Iraq and Iran. There are nearly 5,000 idle trucks here, most bought on credit.  ''It's a difficult time,'' acknowledges Hamza Abbas, governor of the central bank. ''But we Kuwaitis will find a way out. We always do.'' **********In economic terms, Kuwait's reaction to falling revenue has been to try to shield the population from the impact by maintaining spending this year at $10.5 billion, roughly unchanged from 1982. ''The assumption is that the oil price will strengthen soon,'' Mr. Abbas says. Changes in Plans **********Expensive plans to relocate the university and beautify the seafront are being ''stretched out,'' not canceled. But a new power station is going ahead. Gasoline prices have just been raised to 50 cents a gallon, from 15, but electricity is heavily subsidized. **********The price of maintaining Government spending will be Kuwait's first sizable budget deficit, probably $2 billion to $3 billion this year.  Like other Gulf states, Kuwait is secretive about oil production and earnings. But the central bank says oil revenue tumbled 40 percent in the third quarter of last year, to $1.7 billion, from $2.5 billion a year earlier. This suggests annual earnings this year of at most $7 billion. **********Low oil prices worldwide are one reason for the fall in revenue.  But more important, daily oil production, which as recently as 1979 was more than 2 million barrels, has fallen to about 700,000 as a result of weak demand. At this level, Kuwait is producing so little natural gas as a byproduct of oil that it was forced to cancel supply contracts with Japan last year and has switched its own gas-fired generating plants to fuel oil. **********Financing the budget deficit seems easy, because Kuwait can draw on the $8 billion to $10 billion annually that it earns in interest and dividends from its investments. But doing so for long is politically unpopular: Much of this money belongs to the Fund for Future Generations, a nest egg that Kuwait is putting aside against the day the wells run dry. The fund is not supposed to be touched before 2000. **********''We can get by like this for a while,'' says Mohammed W. Khouja, economic adviser to the Government-controlled Kuwaiti Real Estate Investment Consortium, ''but not if the price stays weak for two or three years. Then it will be felt.'' Spreading the Wealth **********Western diplomats and bankers here believe Kuwait has done a better job than many other oil exporters in distributing its wealth. Less Government spending could weaken the social cohesion that wealth has created in Kuwait's ethnically diverse society. **********Foreigners attracted by the lure of oil make up more than half the population of Kuwait, with Palestinians accounting for half the foreigners. There is also a sizable contingent of Shiite Moslems from Iran who might accede to the revolutionary rhetoric next door if times become difficult. **********Thus, the aid that Kuwait gives Iraq is also intended to buy peace at home. While Iran is confined to its own borders, Kuwaitis feel they do not have much to fear. But if Iran succeeds in its drives toward Basra, which commands the road to Kuwait, Teheran would be in a position to influence domestic Kuwaiti politics."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/15/business/company-reports-amsouth-bancorp-n.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 22, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "** Company Reports ** AMSOUTH BANCORP (N)", "print_headline": "** Company Reports ** AMSOUTH BANCORP (N)", "body_text": " **********Qtr to March 31 1983 1982 Op earn 8,194,000 7,131,000 Per share 1.09 .95 Net inc 8,220,000 7,143,000 Per share 1.09 .95"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/11/business/advertising-redbook-rejuggles-its-image.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1983-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 482, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Redbook Rejuggles Its Image", "print_headline": "Advertising; Redbook Rejuggles Its Image", "body_text": " **********APRODUCT'S marketing position is where it lives. If advertising t ells consumers an item is a kitchen cleanser, they won't think to u se it in the bathroom.

But that has become a rather crowded neighborhood, taking in such popular publications as Cosmopolitan and Self. Thus, when advertisers interested in that specific age group had to trim their magazine schedules because of a worsening economy, Redbook started to find itself running fourth in a field of three. **********The solution, arrived at by Alan M. Waxenberg, the new publisher installed by Hearst Magazines, the new owner, and Richard Sarno, associate publisher and advertising director, was to find a less crowded readership neighborhood that would still appeal to a large block of advertisers. **********They found their answer in the syndicated audience-research data - the 25- to 44-year-old group of women who make up 46 percent of Redbook's total audience of 13.2 million. It is an age group of women that turns to Redbook more than any other major publication, and they snuggle down nicely between the younger audience of Hearst's Cosmopolitan and the older audience of its Good Housekeeping. **********A one-time ad in all three magazines, Mr. Waxenberg said, would deliver 40 percent of the nation's 18-to-49 women, and a 12-time schedule would hit 90 percent. **********The next step for Redbook, of course, is to make advertisers and their agencies realize how important their 25- to 44-year-old readers are as a group of consumers. **********As Mr. Sarno pointed out with flip charts, they are the baby boom that is now working its way through the nation's demographic profile as the biggest ''population bubble.'' It is a population segment that will grow 27 percent by 1990, and that portion of American womanhood that Gilbert Maurer, president of Hearst Magazines, lovingly characterized as ''the pig in the python.'' **********The process of highlighting the group's life styles and buying habits begins on Monday via a $1 million advertising campaign that springs from the hands of Ron Rosenfeld and Len Sirowitz, co-chairmen of Rosenfeld, Sirowitz & Lawson. **********The reasons for selecting Valentine's Day for the debut will be readily apparent. The ad campaign will picture the group as jugglers, women who juggle three lives as wife, mother and worker. But even more important to advertisers will be the advertising theme line, ''At the Red Hot Heart of the Market.'' **********Do you get the anatomical drift?

The tower is 16 feet off the perpendicular, giving some visitors vertigo as they walk up the 293 spiral stairs of the campanile, or bell tower. **********Scientists observing the tower's movements said the increase in its lean last year was five one-hundredths of an inch, compared with three one-hundredths of an inch in 1981, which was the smallest increase in tilt in 15 years. **********Mr. Toniolo said the angle of slant might be affected by water lying 50 yards underground beneath the tower. Scientists have noted that the tower tilts faster when the water pressure below is weak and remains steady when pressure is high. Movement 'A Mystery' **********''Last year it rained less than the previous year,'' Mr. Toniolo said, ''and that may be the answer.'' But he said that no one was sure and that the movement of the tower was ''simply a mystery.'' **********In February, the Italian Parliament approved $10.5 million for a four-year project to stabilize the 12th-century structure, including an electric pump to maintain the pressure of water in the underground pools. **********Money will also be spent to reimburse the city for entrance fees that it will lose when the tower is closed to the public while work is under way. **********Mr. Toniolo said, however, that he and other experts feared the effort would fail.  ''The last major intervention in 1934 caused a very large increase in the lean,'' he said. ''Nobody can say what will happen this time.'' **********In 1934, some 900 tons of concrete were pumped into holes dug under the low side of the tower in an effort to stop the increasing lean.  Construction of the tower in this Italian commercial center 150 miles northwest of Rome began in 1173, and the monument had already started to lean after 35 feet had been completed. **********The last three stories and a belfry were added in 1350, when the tower was already 10 feet off the perpendicular.

Local officials and Assamese activists say hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants have crossed into India here. **********The issue was at the center of the agitation during elections in Assam in February when more than 3,000 people died in ethnic and religious rioting. Violent incidents and bomb explosions continue to be reported. Expulsion of Aliens Demanded **********The violence occurred after a student-led protest movement, demanding the expulsion of illegal aliens, tried to block or disrupt the elections. Fighting erupted between the Assamese nationalists and tribal groups, who are mainly Hindu, and Bengali-speaking Moslems, some but not all from Bangladesh. **********''It is impossible to patrol the border at some places,'' an Indian border security official said. He said the problems resulted from a British civil servant's hasty demarcation of the frontier during the 1947 partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan. **********In the absence of any visible boundaries, the location of the frontier is often left to the imagination. The short pillars are frequently obscured by shrubs, hillocks, thick jungle, streams and rice fields. They zigzag in bewildering fashion across the countryside, and many patches of Indian or Bangladesh territory are surrounded on three sides by land of the other nation. **********Border officials said many residents of the frontier areas were poor farmers who often slipped across the border to visit relatives or cut bamboo for fuel and construction work or even illegally harvested crops on the other side and carried the produce home. Incidents Are Frequent **********Incidents are frequent. An Indian official said 24 Bangladeshis had been killed in the last six months while trying to cross illegally into the Garo Hills district in western Meghalaya. **********Although Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan, has existed as a nation for 12 years, the word ''Pak'' - short for Pakistan - is still carved on scores of boundary pillars. East Pakistan became Bangladesh in 1971 after a civil war in which many thousands were killed.  Bangladeshis, though Moslem, had fought to preserve their ethnic and linguistic separateness as Bengalis. **********An Indian official said 30,000 illegal migrants had moved into this border district since 1971. He said the total population of the district was 400,000. **********The Bangladesh nationals are difficult to identify, the official said, because they look like the Bengali-speaking Moslem settlers who came much earlier and dress and talk like them. **********''Often they slip into the home of a relative or a friend who has lived here for years and begin by working in their fields,'' he said. He said that after some years they would travel farther into Assam and settle along the Brahmaputra River where earlier immigrants live in squatter colonies. Town Is 'Transit Point' **********''If you suspect someone and ask him when he came,'' the official said, ''he'll say that he was born in India, had come here some years ago from another part of Assam and produce a score of witnesses to support him.'' He said the Government was helpless in such cases unless police informers in the squatter colonies gave specific information. **********Tek Chand Aggarwalla, a prosperous Hindu businessman whose family has lived at Mankachar, on the Assam-B@angladesh border, for 100 years, said the town was frequently used as a ''transit point'' by Bangladeshis who travel farther up the valley. **********The anti-immigration protesters fear that the Assamese, who are predominantly Hindu and have their own language, will be swamped by Moslem immigrants and other Bengali speakers. **********Nari Rustomji, who has held several top administrative posts in northeast India, said, ''The root of discontent on the frontiers is clearly the apprehension of cultural annihilation.'' **********In calling for an election boycott, the Assamese movement said local politicians had placed many illegal immigrants on voter rolls over the years. The Assamese nationalists are particularly critical of the ruling Congress Party, which, they say, sought to create ''vote banks'' that could be relied upon to support it in elections.  In turn, the nationalists say, the migrants were assured they would not be troubled or investigated. **********The situation is reported to be still tense in parts of the state, and intelligence sources said it would take at least three or four months for the region to return to normal. It is estimated that 280,000 people are homeless and surviving on Government doles. **********Meanwhile, the Assamese students announced that they were suspending the agitation. They said they would organize rehabilitation work and food distribution and repair damaged homes, roads and bridges. **********Some said they had lost control of the agitation during the elections when hard-liners committed to violence reportedly took part in the bloodbath. **********An intelligence official gave support to that view by saying in an interview that about 60 people had been arrested in connection with the worst massacre surrounding the election violence in February. He also said that that massacre, at Nellie, may have been organized by members of Assamese tribes who were former members of the army."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/17/world/around-the-world-iraq-says-it-beat-back-a-new-iranian-thrust.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iraq Says It Beat Back A New Iranian Thrust", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Iraq Says It Beat Back A New Iranian Thrust", "body_text": " **********Iraq said today that its troops had repulsed a new Iranian attack along the border east of the Iraqi town of Amara. **********The Baghdad radio did not say when the Iranian attack took place.

As a result, he said, even those growers who were aware of the freezing weather approaching were reluctant to pick their oranges on Friday or Saturday. **********Now Mr. Miller and his colleagues are rounding up every worker they can find to try to get the fruit picked before the temperature returns to its normal, 60-degree winter average, when the frozen oranges would begin to rot on the trees. They say it may still be possible to save most of the crop and that other states and other countries might be able to take up the slack if shortages do develop. **********Meanwhile, there are predictions of shortages and price increases, although their extent and timing are not at all clear. **********''People are comparing this year's damage to 1981, but it's just too early to tell,'' said Ernest Neff, a spokesman for Florida Citrus Mutual, a growers' cooperative. The most destructive Florida freeze in recent years occurred in January 1981, when about one-seventh of the state's orange crop, then expected to fill 207 million 100-pound boxes, was destroyed. **********The result in that year was a serious shortage of oranges and a swift increase in prices. In the first six months of 1981, the wholesale price of 12 six-ounce cans of frozen orange juice concentrate rose to $4.45, from $3. Since then, the price has gradually declined to $3.95. **********''It's safe to say prices will go up, but nobody can say at this point how much, or when, they will rise,'' Mr. Miller said. Others say such talk can turn to self-fulfilling prophecy with prices increasing all along the chain that includes the grower, processor, distributor and retailer, even though the extent of the crop damage may not justify it. **********Indeed, Earl Wells, a spokesman for Florida Citrus Mutual, said he did not expect the price of processed orange juice to rise much because the domestic orange crop can be supplemented by increased imports from Brazil. Brazil, which has become a major exporter of orange juice concentrate in recent years, sold 70 million gallons of it to United States marketers last year. **********Roughly 90 percent of Florida's orange crop is made into concentrate or other processed products. So consumers will see the effects of this freeze, if indeed there are any, in higher prices for frozen juice concentrates and the ready-to-drink products. Oranges for eating and squeezing into fresh juice also come from California and Texas. **********Tropicana, a unit of Beatrice Foods Inc., and Minute Maid, a division of the Coca-Cola Company, are the nation's leading producers of the ready- to-drink products. These, and other fruit processors, operate plants throughout central Florida, the area where most of the state's orange groves are situated and where temperatures sank below 28 degrees over the weekend. **********But while consumers and the growers may be understandably nervous about all this, commodities traders will no doubt see an opportunity. On the the New York Cotton Exchange, where contracts for frozen orange juice concentrate are traded, prices rose rapidly yesterday. Spot prices for the contracts for delivery this month rose 5 cents a pound, the daily limit, to close at $1.2925 a pound. **********Seth Diamond, a commodities analyst for Shearson/American Express, said one reason the price of orange juice contracts rose rapidly yesterday was that traders were not sure that the destroyed Florida oranges could be entirely replaced by Brazilian imports. ''Brazil has the capability, but they also have commitments to sell to other countries,'' he said. **********Temperatures Still Cool **********Yesterday, temperatures throughout Florida ranged in the 40's, still far below normal and cool enough to preserve most of the fruit for picking. But growers ''are scurrying like mad to harvest,'' Mr. Neff said. A spell of more normal Florida weather ''would mean trouble,'' he added. **********One problem for some orange growers, experts said, is finding enough workers for the speeded-up harvest. Ronald Billella, director of the Florida Division of Labor, Employment and Training, said his agency began a statewide effort yesterday to identify the growers that needed additional workers and to recruit those workers. **********Meanwhile, most of the state's orange juice processing plants have geared up rapidly to handle the increased volume. ''After a freeze, they run seven days a week, 24 hours a day,'' said Warren Savant, an official of the Florida Citrus Processors Association, a trade group. **********Another impact of the freeze could be lower profits for the orange juice processing companies. The largest are Minute Maid, Tropicana, Orange- Co. and American Agronomics. **********''None of the four should be seriously hurt, but they may find profit margins narrowed a bit because they can't pass through all of a price increase'' on the oranges they buy, said David Liebowitz of the American Securities Corporation. **********And while Florida's orange crop is far and away its biggest, it is not the only agricultural product that has been hurt by the freeze. The state's strawberry crop, which in recent years has produced more than $25 million in annual sales, may have been totally destroyed. **********A spokesman for the Florida Strawberry Growers Association said yesterday that ''at this point, everyone we've talked to said damage was 100 percent.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/21/world/allies-said-to-approve-plan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 78, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Allies Said to Approve Plan", "print_headline": "Allies Said to Approve Plan", "body_text": " **********A NATO committee has approved new American proposals for the medium- range missile talks with the Soviet Union in Geneva, Bonn Government sources said today. **********The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Special Consultative Group took the action at a secret meeting Monday night in Brussels, according to the Bonn sources.

Since ground control radar can reach only about 200 miles, a pilot will give a false position to the control tower from outside its tracking range, indicating that the plane is closer or better positioned for landing than it is. **********Pilots Fond of Jumping Line **********Sometimes the control tower will then give that pilot's plane priority for landing when other planes are ahead of him. Pilots call this ''jumping the line.'' **********If it works, the ploy can save fuel and shave several minutes off a flight that otherwise might have been late. **********Until recently, Korean Air Lines pilots had a reputation for being particularly fond of jumping the line.  ''As you can imagine, they didn't win the love of their peers for that,'' one pilot said. ''But the Koreans have reformed on that score in the last couple of years.'' **********South Korea imports nearly all its fuel and the airline has long struggled to break even, so Korean pilots are also known as tenacious fuel savers. **********There has been speculation that the pilot of the plane that was shot down on Sept. 1 near the Soviet island of Sakhalin flew over Soviet airspace to take a more direct route from Anchorage to Seoul to conserve fuel. But foreign pilots say it is all but inconceivable the pilot would have flown over Soviet territory intentionally.   No Evidence of Pilot Error **********There are no solid clues to why the plane was so far off course and no evidence that pilot error was to blame. **********''As individuals, some of the Koreans are tough, hard-edged characters,'' one longtime American pilot said. ''That's the reason they have had a reputation with some people for being kind of macho pilots, guys with more guts than brains. But to suggest that the Korean pilots take risks with passengers' lives is unfair and untrue.'' **********Indeed, the safety record of Korean Air Lines has been excellent. In 1978, a Soviet jet shot at another Korean airliner, killing two passengers and forcing the aircraft to land on a frozen lake near the Russian city of Murmansk. **********Crashes are rare, however. The most recent one was in November 1980 when a Korean Air Lines Boeing 747 landed short of the runway at Kimpo International Airport in Seoul. A fire broke out and 16 people were killed, including the pilot. **********Growth Since 1969 **********Extraordinary growth has been Korean Air Lines' hallmark since the Government, in 1969, decided that it should be placed in private hands and chose the Hanjin Group to do the job. **********Hanjin, a diversified transportation company, is headed by two brothers, Cho Choong Hoon and Cho Choong Kun, and their hard-driving notion of corporate management is characteristic of many of South Korea's industrialists. **********The elder brother, Choong Hoon, or Harry as he is known to friends and colleagues, is 63 years old. He received a big boost for his fledgling operation from the Korean War, hauling drinking water by truck to United States troops. The company also did contract hauling for the United States forces in Vietnam. Hanjin trucks, it is said, would deliver ammunition to areas where other haulers were reluctant to go.   130 International Flights a Week **********When Hanjin took over in 1969, the revenues of Korean Air Lines were $6.8 million and its work force was about 500. Except for a few flights to Japan, it was a domestic airline and its fleet consisted of one jet and seven smaller propellor planes. **********In 1982, Korean Air Lines revenues reached $1.1 billion at recent exchange rates, nearly 180 times the 1969 level. The payroll had about 10,000 workers, 20 times the number in 1969. As of last December, it had 41 aircraft in its fleet including 14 Boeing 747's and eight A-300's, the so-called European airbus. **********Today, among its 130 international flights a week, K.A.L. flies to New York, Los Angeles, Honolulu, Paris and Zurich, as well as the Philippines, Malaysia, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong. It also flies regularly to the Middle East, where Korea's construction companies are engaged in several large projects. **********Yet in the pursuit of growth, the company has piled up huge debts and priced its fares so cheaply that profits are scant. At the end of 1982, the company's debt burden was $1.1 billion.   Can Charge Any Fare It Likes **********Last year, Korean Air Lines posted a profit of $6 million. But that followed two losing years in which the cumulative losses were $47.8 million. **********However, K.A.L. has sacrificed profitability by pricing its fares cheaply to increase its share of the market. For example, many of the passengers on the flight from New York to Seoul were headed for Japan. Many travelers fly the extra distance to Seoul and then back to Tokyo because it is so cheap. **********A Tokyo travel agent said that with various discounts offered by K.A.L., a one-way coach fare New York-Seoul- Tokyo could be as cheap as $938. The regular Japan Air Lines fare from New York to Tokyo is about twice that price. **********Under a Korea-United States agreement, Korean Air Lines can charge any fare it likes for its trans-Pacific runs. Its two United States rivals, Pan American World Airways and Northwest Orient Airlines, generally match those fares. **********Competitors complain that K.A.L. offers rebates to travel agents, which they call a shady practice and do not match. **********In an inteview with a trade magazine last year, Cho Choong Kun called the accusations ''invalid.'' ''Maybe some salesman who wants to make his quota will underbid,'' he said. ''But we have to make money and we aren't going to give away seats for nothing. There is a lot of talk against us by others who have dirt on their pants yet criticize us for not being clean.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/04/world/bush-hopeful-on-arms-talks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 184, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSH HOPEFUL ON ARMS TALKS", "print_headline": "BUSH HOPEFUL ON ARMS TALKS", "body_text": " **********Vice President Bush said today that a breakthrough was possible this summer in the Geneva nuclear arms talks with the Soviet Union, according to Danish officials. **********Mr. Bush's assessment of the American-Soviet negotiations came in talks with Prime Minister Poul Schluter in Copenhagen. **********''The Vice President assured us the United States is working energetically for a result in the negotiations, and it is not unlikely the results will come at the end of the summer,'' Mr.  Schluter said after two hours of talks with Mr. Bush. **********In a speech tonight at an official dinner given by the Danish Government, Mr. Bush referred to dissent within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on the issue of deploying 572 new cruise and Pershing 2 missiles in Western Europe later this year. **********''Although our common commitment is being tested today,'' Mr. Bush said, ''I am confident this test will only strengthen our commitment to the alliance.'' **********Mr. Bush flew to Copenhagen from Helsinki, Finland, early today on the sixth leg of a European tour."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/26/business/flexi-van-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 86, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FLEXI-VAN CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "FLEXI-VAN CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/19/business/reporter-s-notebook-the-brazilians.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Kilborn", "pub_date": "1983-11-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1338, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: THE BRAZILIANS", "print_headline": "REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: THE BRAZILIANS", "body_text": " **********Like any country, Brazil has its own ways of doing business.

One week a month, she said, she leaves her child with her parents and comes to Rio with her sister. **********They stay in an inexpensive hotel and spend their afternoons on the beach.

Most of the patrons of the boites are women. **********Ivana says her ''honest life'' is in Salvador and her other life, of prostitution, is in Rio. She said she is in the process of getting divorced from a man who has fled Brazil. She said that she used to be a typist but that with a recession throughout Brazil, she could not find work. So to support her child she comes to Rio.

There are no unemployment benefits. Employees with regular jobs and their employers, however, contribute monthly to a security fund that the worker can cash in when he leaves the job. **********In various ways, the Government attempts to help the most impoverished of the population, the more than 20 million people who live in the drought-plagued northeastern region of the country. **********''We have two or three doctors in small cities there now,'' said Clovis Cavalcanti, a social economist at the Joaquim Nabuco Foundation in Recife, the capital of the northeastern state of Pernambuco. **********''But they can only deal with simple cases - a broken leg, a treatable disease.

Some Coca-Cola comes in cans, but much comes in thick returnable bottles with pry-off caps. The Volkswagen Beetle, still made in Brazil, is the nation's second most popular car, after General Motors' Chevette. Kolynos is a leading tooth paste.  The most prominent name in home appliances is Philco. The economy is dominated by foreign labels of products made in Brazil. **********Multinational companies account for 31 percent of the sales of the country's 500 biggest companies, and most of the foreign companies are American. The Japanese are there, with motorcycles and some consumer electronics goods, all of which are made in Brazil - there are virtually no imported consumer goods. The Japanese are a relatively small presence among foreign-owned companies in Brazil, but they are the fastest growing. **********Until a couple of years ago, the foreign companies reinvested more of their profits in Brazil than they sent home, but the flow has been reversed. **********The head of the General Motors plant near Sao Paulo, Clifford J.

Middle-aged women trail customers out the door, asking for cigarettes while trying to caress the watches off their arms.  The shoeshine boys who work the Atlantic Avenue boulevard of Copacabana approach passing men saying, ''Shine mister, shine?'' When a man rejects the offer, the boys persist. Then they say, ''Look, mister, look!'' By a well-rehearsed sleight of hand, the boy has poured a discoloring slime on the toes of the quarry's shoes. **********The police of the state of Rio de Janeiro report that citizens with no official gun-toting function have nevertheless registered 1 million firearms, doubling the number of a year ago. The police assume that most have been bought by people who want to protect something, not take something. **********People still have an edge on machines in Brazil. Even a relatively well-paid automobile worker gets only $4 a hour. The minimum wage works out to less than 50 cents an hour, and that covers about a fifth of the working population. **********Probably half the office buildings in Rio, Sao Paulo, Brasilia and provincial cities like Recife and Campinas have automatic elevators. But the elevators come with a seat, because the buildings still use people to push the buttons. **********Many office buildings in the major cities have an armed guard on each floor, as well as a receptionist, someone to escort visitors and someone to serve coffee. **********The Bank of Brazil has imposed restraints on the economy to conserve dollars and to narrow the international payments deficit. Business is affected in numerous ways. The problems of Peter Landsberg are an example. **********Mr. Landsberg was chairman of Brazil's biggest privately owned company, Shell Oil of Brazil, until he retired two years ago, at 60. He then offered to buy the country's biggest shipbuilder, a Dutch-owned company, Verolme Estaleiros, of which he is now president. **********The parent company is bankrupt, he said, and a court in the Netherlands has ordered the assets sold. Mr. Landsberg has settled on a price of about $62 million, which he said is about a third of the real value. **********''The only problem I have is getting the money out to the creditors,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/12/world/tide-of-change-laps-at-the-thames-s-south-bank.html": {"writer_name": "Jon Nordheimer", "pub_date": "1983-10-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1246, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TIDE OF CHANGE LAPS AT THE THAMES'S SOUTH BANK", "print_headline": "TIDE OF CHANGE LAPS AT THE THAMES'S SOUTH BANK", "body_text": " **********''The English suffer from a particularly disabling disease,'' Cedric Price said the other day, letting his architect's mind frame each word into a construction that he admired as it took shape. ''Once something has lost its purpose we immediately romanticize it. That's the trouble with the Thames.'' **********Price's reputation as an iconoclast precedes his counsel but these are clearly impudent words to the English. As the Seine is to Paris, the River Thames - Holy Father Thames - is generally regarded as part of London's fabric, and to suggest that it serves no purpose falls on some ears as heresy. **********The evidence, however, is abundant, Mr. Price says.  All one needs to do, he says, is look at the condition of the southern side of the river as the Thames wiggles through London. While the northern bank cradles the great monuments and architectural delights of the capital, he points out, the southern bank and its environs are regarded as a virtual wasteland clotted with undistinguished office buildings and urban patchworks of commerce and decay. **********After a six-month study, Mr. Price will make recommendations to the Greater London Council this month on ways to rejuvenate a large section of the drab South Bank.   'Just a Patch of Water' **********''Unlike the Seine in Paris,'' Mr. Price observed in an interview, ''the Thames has never really been treated as a cultural part of the city. Actually, at the moment it's just a patch of water that's not used.'' **********A tourist's heart may leap at the first sight of the Thames as it cuts through the heart of London because of the spectacle of massed totems such as Parliament, Whitehall, St. Paul's Cathedral and the Tower of London that rise majestically near it, and the 15 small bridges inside the city that cross the waterway bearing storybook names and images: Westminister, Waterloo, Blackfriars, London Bridge and Tower Bridge. **********But nearly everything worth the price of a snapshot to take back home to Peoria or Hamburg sits on the northern bank. The South Bank is a pastiche of gray concrete buildings that in the view of many Londoners has become a towering monument to failed postwar planning. **********If one draws a circle with a one-mile radius on a map of London, using Parliament as the center, the northern semicircle will encompass some of the loveliest and most expensive real estate in the world: Mayfair, Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, museums, stately government offices and the West End theatrical district. The southern hemisphere will yield, beyond a few structures of merit encrusting the riverbank, a dreary wasteland of aging buildings and sagging spirits.   Greenery Is Meager **********Only a few restaurants overlook the Thames from either side of the river; it is difficult to find an attractive pub along its banks. Very few Londoners or tourists try to stroll along the South Bank, and much of it is walled off to pedestrian traffic by a hodgepodge of buildings, busy roads and commercial structures. Trees occasionally pop out of the concrete. Grass or other greenery are meager dots on the map. **********For centuries the River Thames had two main functions and neither had much to do with esthetics. **********From London's earliest days it served as a sewer and as a port. Generally, the stench was blown to the south and east, away from the seats of power and royalty on the northern bank, though a change in wind direction could introduce a pungent democracy to some of the best addresses. During the 1860's the river was so pervasively foul that Parliament was closed during wind shifts in a period that came to be known as the Great Stink. Modern sewer lines and the banking of the river to cover malodorous mudflats did much to eliminate the problem but by that time the south side of London was for those who did not have the good sense or the resources to live elsewhere. **********Historically, this attitude was established by the practice of putting unsightly or objectionable services necessary to the life of a capital - warehouses, power plants, breweries, brothels, actors and playwrights - on the far side of the river. It is for this reason that London's best beer and Shakespeare's plays were both brewed near the Southwark waterfront.   Dockyards Fall Into Disuse **********German bombers and the containerization of shipping put an end to the usefullness of the London dockyards by the mid-20th century, and failing to find a new purpose, the South Bank slumped into prolonged decay.  An area on the South Bank formed by a bend of the Thames within the shadow of the Big Ben tower was cleared for the 1951 Festival of Britain, a renewal project that created the nucleus of a permanent cultural center that later added the National Theater and the Hayward Gallery. Thousands stream every evening into these buildings, which are more renowned for the excellence of the performances staged inside than for the quality of their exteriors. Yet during the rest of the day the cultural oasis is a urban desert, devoid of life and movement save for tens of thousands of commuters streaming across the bridges on foot to and from Waterloo Station. **********''It's a pity the area got frozen into such lumpy buildings,'' Sir Hugh Casson, president of the Royal Academy, who served as architectural director of the Festival of Britain, said in an interview. ''The Hayward Gallery should have a marvelous river view but it's a blind building with no windows.'' **********''Buildings always look best with their toes in the water, but the ones on the South Bank are set back so far, in fact, it's difficult to even see the river,'' he said ''They also have a leaden municipal feel about them, gray and heavy, done in a period when it was fashionable to be heavy.'' **********Lady Wynne-Jones, head of the South Bank Committee, a conservation group that seeks to protect the Thames from ill-considered projects, is sharply critical of the elephantine designs that wall off the riverfront.   Architects Called a Menace **********''What the German Luftwaffe didn't do British greed has finished,'' she said. ''In Christopher Wren's time architects were artists. Now they are businessmen and no profession is more of a menace to London.'' She and others campaigned unsuccessfully for a bill in Parliament that would have established a six-mile zone where the Thames flows through the heart of London to safeguard it against haphazard development. **********At present, 17 independent London boroughs share responsibility for what goes up along the riverfront with several public authorities. While there is no master plan for the Thames, the Government can intervene in the public interest through its Department of Environment if a controversy arises. But the laissez-faire mood of the present Convervative Government, Lady Wynne-Jones said, has left unopposed a plan by a Kuwaiti-owned corporation to build a half-mile-long wall of Dallas-style mirror glass office buildings on the riverbank opposite the Tower of London. **********There is a trend under way to build new housing in the abandoned dockyards on the east side of the city, although there is political opposition to ''elitist'' investors who want to develop an upper-middle-class market there. **********But the South Bank can claim one asset not available on the other side.

''It didn't upset my breakfast at all,'' he said. **********He beamed as he announced that ''our objectives have been achieved and as soon as the logistics permit, American personnel will be leaving.'' **********Mr. Reagan appeared in the briefing room nine days after first announcing the operation in which 18 Americans, 20 Grenadians and about 50 Cubans have been killed. In responding to questions, he dismissed the General Assembly condemnation of the Grenada invasion as no surprise, saying the majority of the nations ''have not agreed with us on just about everything that's come before them where we're involved.''  'You Shouldn't Either' **********Asked about Nicaraugua's assertion that the Administration might be planning an invasion there, the President said, ''I haven't believed anything they've been saying since they got in charge, and you shouldn't either.'' **********He was then asked whether the United States might have lost ''moral high ground'' by invading Grenada. ''Well, for heaven sakes,'' he responded, frowning and expressing exasperation with ''anyone who would link Afghanistan to this operation.'' **********He denounced the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, accusing the Russians of ''every vicious form of warfare, including chemical warfare, the killing of women and children.'' **********''Incidentally, I know your frequent use of the word invasion'' he said, referring to Grenada. ''This was a rescue mission.'' While objecting to the word invasion, Mr. Reagan himself used that term on the morning the operation was announced. **********When asked whether he would take similar military action in other countries, the President said he could not foresee the same combination arising of endangered Americans and concerned neighboring governments. ''If all the conditions were the same,'' he added, ''I don't see why our reason would be any different, but I don't foresee any similar situation.''  He Praises U.S. Troops **********The President praised the 6,000 troops involved in the operation and hailed the dead and wounded as ''heroes of freedom,'' saying they had put down a ''potential threat to all the people of the Caribbean.'' **********''After viewing the massive hoard of Soviet weapons found on that island, who knows what evil the liberation of Grenada achieved for us,'' the President said, then immediately corrected himself, ''or averted in the years ahead.'' **********The White House took care to denounce the General Assembly vote of 108 to 9 that included many of the United States' traditional allies in the majority. The chief White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, pointedly announced the breakfast - ''one poached egg, strawberries, bananas and coffee'' - that the President said was not disturbed by the vote. **********Mr. Speakes also read a statement contending that the vote was actually a comment on the state of affairs at the United Nations ''We find it sad,'' he said, ''that the U.N. sees fit to deplore actions'' taken to ''save innocent lives and protect human rights, in full accord with the principles of the U.N. Charter.''  Differences in Afghanistan **********In pointing out the differences between the operations in Grenada and Afghanistan, Mr. Reagan contended that the Russians had installed their choice as of head of state, ''murdered'' the American Ambassador and used tactics in fighting Afghan rebels that have led Russian soldiers to desert. ''They're still there after a long period of time,'' the President said, ''longer than I've been in this office.'' **********The Grenada operation, he said, was at the invitation of neighboring governments and involved the evacuation of American students. ''It was a successful rescue,'' he said, adding that ''the Grenadians that have been liberated are down there delighted with and giving every evidence of appreciation and gratitude to our men.'' **********Mr. Speakes was again asked for some of the captured documents the Administration has said support its charge that a Soviet-Cuban bastion was in the works on Grenada. He replied that the evidence would be convincing ''when and if'' the documents are released.  Asked whether they might not be released, Mr. Speakes said that the documents were under review and that at least some would be released.

A young woman dressed in a school uniform quickly purchased onions in the square so she could get home and persuade her mother to let her go to the dance. **********No one was sure if the leftist insurgents who move freely in the town of 16,000 would attend, but no one seemed to mind the possibility that they might. **********In most of El Salvador, people fear the constant battles between Government troops and the leftist insurgents. In La Palma, a former resort in the high piny country of northern Chalatenango province, the residents have not worried, for the military has abandoned their town. Some Support for Rebels **********An American military adviser said the guerrillas ''draw a lot of their strength'' from Chalatenango, perhaps one of the few places where the opposition has gained tacit support. **********The support is not direct, and, whenever it wanted, the army could probably retake the town, which is known for its artisan cooperatives. But, unlike other places in El Salvador, where people seem to maintain a studied apathy and just want to be left alone, the people in La Palma acknowledge some moral support for, or at least a more tolerant attitude toward, the guerrillas. **********No one indicates a willingness to take up arms against the Government. However, a 26-year-old farmer said that, ''inside their hearts,'' 75 percent of the people support the cause of the left. **********When asked why, he answered: ''When a soldier comes to town he comes up to you, and he ...'' and here the young man approached the reporter making the rat-a-tat-tat noise of a gun. When the guerrillas come to town, he said, they ask ''What do you think?'' **********''The truth is,'' said a teacher. ''the people in La Palma are different. We have learned to adjust to our situation.'' ''At times we think they are right,'' said a young woman, ''but it is only the violence that makes us think like that.'' In December and January, the guerrillas and the army took turns capturing and recapturing La Palma. But the army has not been back in four months because the province is not considered economically important. Meanwhile, the guerrillas use it as a base to stock up on supplies before returning to camps in the nearby mountains. They control about two-thirds of the province. **********At a spot along the winding road up to La Palma, which is only seven miles from the Honduran border, a banner strung across two high pines calls on the youth of Chalatenango to join the left. **********The number of young men in the town indicates that while the leftists have some moral support, they have not been very successful in gaining recruits. Most young men interviewed said they were more interested in staying out of the fighting and waiting to see who won or in pursuing their studies. **********A local teacher estimates that 500 ''important'' people, such as the woman who owned the largest pharmacy in town, moved away because of the battles in December and January. **********And when the town tried to have two dances in the same week, it found that the people could not afford both.  The first dance was planned for a Wednesday night to present candidates for the queen of the graduating class. A committee selected three candidates, but their families did not want their daughters to participate. ''They could not afford the gowns,'' the director of the school said. **********Fearing that the dance would cost more than it would earn, the director canceled it in favor of another that was planned for Saturday to celebrate the high school graduation. **********On Wednesday night a truck full of young men had rolled into town only to learn there would be no dance. But on Saturday everything went as planned, sort of. **********At 7:30 that night, the coordinator of the dance, a teacher at the school, was busy directing three boys to write out tickets for beer, sandwiches and soft drinks. Already, nearly 100 young men and women had gathered behind the barbed wire set up at one end of the school's courtyard. **********A seven-member band from San Salvador, Espiritu Libre, a group that has also played in Houston, Dallas, Honduras and Guatemala, started up at 8:30. The courtyard filled with young women wearing pumps and dresses and men with their shirts neatly tucked in, and all danced to the sounds of Stevie Wonder and some Espiritu Libre originals such as ''Don't Stop.'' **********Many of the guerrillas who make this their base were 30 miles to the south outside the town of Suchitoto, battling Government troops, and so not many were around to attend the dance. The few rebels walking around La Palma never showed up. Maybe, a teacher suggested, the dance ''was not their thing.'' **********Some young men and women stayed outside and peered through the barbed wire to watch the dancing. No one, however, wanted to admit not being able to afford the price of admission: $2.60 for men, $1.60 for women. **********''I can't dance,'' one man said.  ''I'm going to watch now and go in later,'' said another.  The dance, actually, was just getting started around 9:40 when, after the band had finished a song with the lyrics ''everybody needs a little time away,'' something happened that often does in La Palma and most of El Salvador: The power went out. There was a chorus of groans, then the couples waited for a while.

No Fear of Partition **********Mr. Salem also said he had no fear that either Israel or Syria had plans for any permanent partition of his country.  ''I am confident that we will break the stalemate and then we will have progress and phases that will show encouragement and then we can regain a momentum that I think we have lost in the past two months,'' Mr. Salem said. **********While acknowledging Israel and Syria both had ''some gains'' from being in Lebanon, Mr. Salem said, ''I do not believe that there is any serious plan on the part of either Israel or Syria to partition Lebanon or to annex any part of Lebanon.'' He made his comments on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation.'' **********Administration officials said while they were serious about seeking a new approach, they had no reason to be optimistic about an early breakthrough in the situation. One senior official said the Syrians seemed ''dug in'' in rejecting a pullout. But he said it was necessary ''not to appear as if we've given up hope. ''We have to keep the effort alive and most importantly maintain the morale of the Lebanese Government, so they don't cave in to Syrian pressure,'' the official said. **********United States officials agreed with Mr. Salem that neither Israel nor Syria wanted to divide up Lebanon permanently, but they said they could not predict when there would be a troop withdrawal. **********The lack of American optimism is due, in part, to the frustrations that Secretary of State George P. Shultz felt in his visit to Syria this month. **********Last May Mr. Shultz worked out an agreement by which Israel would pull its troops out of Lebanon in return for certain security and political concessions from Lebanon. The Israelis are not obliged to pull all of their forces out of Lebanon, however, until Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization agree to do the same. **********Mr. Shultz was told by President Hafez al-Assad of Syria in May and again this month that Syria was so opposed to the Israeli-Lebanese agreement that it would not pull its troops out, since that would seem to be giving status to the Israeli-Lebanese accord and allow Israel to be rewarded for its invasion of Lebanon last summer. **********United States and Lebanese officials said they expected Mr.  Gemayel, in his talks with President Reagan and Mr. Shultz, to agree on an approach that makes as little mention as possible of the Israeli-Lebanese accord. The thrust of the American thinking, which seemed to be shared by Mr. Salem today, is that Lebanon should officially inform Syria that Israel is prepared to leave, and that Lebanon wants Syria to do the same. **********Lebanon should assure Syria that it is willing to negotiate an accord to take account of any Syrian security concerns and that asserts that Lebanon remains a member of the Arab League and has no intention of allowing its territory to be used by Israel or the United States, Administration officials said. **********At the same time, the United States, through ''working groups'' set up during Mr. Shultz's most recent visit to Damascus, should discuss overall problems in Syrian-American relations and give assurances to Syria that Lebanon's independence was not being impaired, the officials said. **********Mr. Salem said Lebanon and the United States ''are trying to find a new approach to discuss with President Assad the withdrawal of all the foreign forces from Lebanon without necessarily applying it to the agreement.'' **********The Lebanese Foreign Minister held a preliminary session on Saturday with Mr. Shultz at the State Department, and follow-up meetings will be held on Monday and Tuesday bofore Mr. Gemayel's arrival. Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel is scheduled to arrive in Washington on July 26 for talks with President Reagan and United States officials. Golan Heights Issue **********A major problem, Administration officials said, is that the United States has little leverage on Syria. They said the Syrians would be interested, for instance, in any promises the United States could make about Syria's regaining the Golan Heights from Israel. But since the Israelis in effect annexed the Golan Heights in 1981 United States officials see no point in introducing the issue into the discussions about Lebanon. **********Mr. Salem said he believed Syria was using ''its tactical position'' in keeping its 45,000 troops in eastern Lebanon ''to negotiate, particularly with the United States right now, to regain some land it has lost to Israel.'' **********''The Syrians have major concerns that only the United States can address,'' the Lebanese Foreign Minister said. ''Their concern is whatever relates to Israel, they can only discuss with the United States. For example, the prospect of war and peace between Syria and Israel, the status of the Golan Heights and all the other problems relating to Israel or to the solution of the Middle East problem, the question of the Palestinians.'' **********The Israelis have said that in the absence of a Syrian agreement to withdraw their troops, they will redeploy and withdraw some of the 15,000 Israeli forces in Lebanon. Mr. Salem said that Lebanon would not negotiate with Israel on a partial withdrawal, but that if Israel does pull some of its troops out, the Lebanese Army would move in to fill the vacuum, and that it would receive logistical support from the United States, British, French and Italian forces in the Beirut area. **********United States officials said they expected a major part of Mr.  Gemayel's talks in Washington to concern additional steps to strengthen and enlarge the Lebanese Army. Mr. Salem said Lebanon had in the past three months increased its army from 20,000 to 32,000 and that it would soon be 60,000. **********''If necessary,'' he said, ''we will go over 100,000.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/20/business/at-t-leads-broad-market-drop.html": {"writer_name": "Alexander Hammer", "pub_date": "1983-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 462, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A.T.& T.

The yield on the Intermountain Power Agency's $424.5 million of A1-rated term bonds due in 2022, the largest part of a $600 million financing, was raised to 11 percent from the 10.93 percent proposed earlier in the week by underwriters led by Salomon Brothers. **********Similarly, the yield on a $450 million issue of 30-year, Aaa-rated bonds of the Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico was raised to 10 percent from the initially proposed 9.85 percent by underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. **********Also yesterday, J.J.

Crandall, American's president, violated the antitrust laws by proposing a scheme under which each of the airlines, then engaged in a fierce price war, would raise certain fares 20 percent. The department asked that Mr. Crandall be barred from the airline business for two years. **********American Airlines, which was also charged, said in a statement that the complaint was based on a ''novel'' theory of law and that it and its president would vigorously defend the suit. **********Telephone Call Described **********According to the Government, Mr. Crandall made an overture to Howard D. Putnam, Braniff's chairman, by telephone on Feb. 1, 1982, and was promptly rejected. **********''I have a suggestion for you,'' the complaint quotes Mr. Crandall as having told Mr. Putnam. ''Raise your goddamn fares 20 percent.  I'll raise mine the next morning.'' This came, the complaint said, after a heated exchange between the two men about the drastic farecutting and the two airlines' route overlapping. **********Mr. Putnam is said to have responded, ''We can't talk about pricing.'' Mr. Crandall, according to the Government, then said: ''Oh, (expletive), Howard. We can talk about any goddamn thing we want to talk about.'' **********The Justice Department would not disclose how it learned of the phone call. In quoting the conversation, it said Mr. Crandall ''uttered the following words or words to the following effect.'' American Airlines, in its statement, said they were recorded by Mr.  Putnam. **********American declared that the complaint was based ''on one isolated incident'' and resulted in no harm to any airline or to the public.  It said its board of directors had expressed ''full confidence'' in Mr. Crandall. **********The basis of the complaint, American said, is ''a few words spoken'' by Mr. Crandall during the telephone conversation with Mr.  Putnam that it said took place in late January or early February. It occurred a few months after Braniff had initiated ''below cost'' fares, American said, and as a result both lines were suffering ''staggering'' losses. Last spring, a few weeks after the phone conversation, Braniff quit flying and filed for court protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy laws. **********American said Mr. Crandall had called Braniff to discuss what he thought was a misleading Braniff advertisement and that Mr. Putnam returned the call after secretly arranging to record the conversation. **********''After a discussion of the ad, Putnam complained about the competition resulting from American's initiation of service over routes which Braniff served,'' American said. ''The discussion next turned to the disastrous financial results both airlines were experiencing. At this point, according to the Government, Mr.  Crandall stated that Braniff's below-cost fares were the problem and that Braniff should raise its prices - an observation which has been made publicly by many leaders and analysts in the industry.'' **********American added, ''The Government admits that there was no further discussion of prices, that there was no agreement regarding prices and that nothing happened as a result of the conversation.'' **********The Justice Department is not accusing Mr. Crandall and American of price-fixing, which is prohibited by Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, because of what Mark Sheehan, a Justice Department spokesman, said was the ''unilateral'' nature of the attempt. Rather, the charge is that there was an effort at illegal monopolization since the airlines together could have exercised monopoly power over certain routes. **********Mr. Sheehan said the case was civil, not criminal, because ''only in the most extraordinary and unusual circumstances'' had criminal cases been brought under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, which bars monopolization. If criminal penalties had been sought, Mr. Sheehan said, Mr. Crandall upon conviction would have faced up to three years in prison and a $100,000 fine while American would have faced a $1 million fine. **********American contended that the Government had formulated ''a novel and unsound theory of law - unprecedented in the history of antitrust laws - which reflects a lack of understanding of the vigorous competition in the airline industry.'' Both companies, American said, faced actual and potential competition throughout their systems and thus did not have the monopoly power necessary to raise fares above competitive levels. **********William F. Baxter, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said that when an agreement to fix prices would result in unlawful monopolization by two or more dominant companies, it is illegal even to make such an attempt. **********The complaint noted that capacity at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, which served as a hub for both airlines, was limited at the time of the executives' conversation because of special regulations growing out of the air traffic controllers' strike. The limited availability of landing ''slots,'' the complaint said, acted as a significant barrier to competition."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/16/world/house-panel-voices-discord-on-namibia.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Weinraub", "pub_date": "1983-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 671, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HOUSE PANEL VOICES DISCORD ON NAMIBIA", "print_headline": "HOUSE PANEL VOICES DISCORD ON NAMIBIA", "body_text": " **********The State Department official in charge of African policy met some strong Congressional criticism today while defending Reagan Administration policy on southern Africa. **********The official, Chester A.

Watt, attending his first offshore lease sale, donned a scarlet jacket - an auctioneer's traditional garb - and announced the high bids at the end of the bidding. **********''Today, we've allowed industry to explore and evaluate and inventory 40 million acres of offshore territory,'' Mr. Watt said at a news conference. **********Industry Vs. Bureaucracy **********''We felt the expertise of industry was better than the expertise of the bureaucracy in Washington,'' he said. ''We have demonstrated that the marketplace is the right place for decisions to be made regarding allocation of natural resources.'' **********The record response was in large part a result of a change in procedure for offshore oil exploration leases. In the past, bidding was limited to a specific number of tracts, typically 75 to 175, selected by Interior Department officials from nominations by the oil companies. Under new rules, first used to lease tracts off the Middle Atlantic coast last month, companies may bid on any unleased tracts in designated areas, without limits. **********The oil industry had become reluctant to bid at recent semiannual sales because of the worldwide oversupply of oil and stiff competition for the relatively few tracts offered. Promising Tracts Sought **********But today's auction attracted considerable interest, despite the oversupply, because many oil companies believed that the most promising tracts still left in the area would be auctioned today. Any future auction, some said, will involve only tracts not as likely to yield oil and gas. **********The former auction record for offshore Gulf leases was $2.7 billion, set in 1980 on 147 tracts. Today's sale offered 656 tracts.  Today's auction was part of the Government's accelerated leasing program, intended to make more American drilling acreage available to reduce reliance on foreign oil. **********The top bid today was $92.3 million offered for a tract in the Ship Shoal area about 75 miles south of Louisiana's Terrebonne Parish. It came from a consortium of Mobil Oil, Exploration and Producing, Southeast Inc., the Kerr-McGee Corporation and the Sohio Petroleum Company. **********The second highest bid was $75.1 million from a group led by the Kerr-McGee Corporation.  A total of 78 companies, bidding separately and in combinations, offered 1,015 bids on 656 tracts, second only to the 1,045 bids received on 651 Gulf tracts in 1970. Those 651 tracts, however, covered far less acreage. **********The 39.8 million acres offered today are from 2 to 200 miles off Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Deep-water leases, for tracts in 2,800 feet of water or more, are for 10 years. Shallow-water leases are for five years. **********In addition to the lease payments, the Government receives royalties on any oil and natural gas that is produced from the tracts. **********The Interior Department has the right to reject any bids that it feels are not up to the potential of the tracts.  Lease winners are expected to complete seismic work on their most promising areas in one year, but drilling is not expected to produce oil or gas for four or five years. **********James R. Lesch, chairman and chief executive officer of the Hughes Tool Company, said the sale came at a time when the number of oil rigs actively drilling has dropped to about 1,800 from the 1981 high of 4,500. He noted that 150,000 people in the oil industry are out of work."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/03/world/us-and-lebanon-move-to-bolster-relations.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwerztman", "pub_date": "1983-12-03", "snippet": "Secretary of State George P.

He said the new committees emphasized ''the strong working partnership that has been forged here.'' **********Mr. Shultz held out no new prospect, however, for an early agreement by Syria on the withdrawal of foreign forces. But, he said, ''speaking at least on my own part, I have a renewed sense of confidence that we are going to succeed in Lebanon.'' **********It was unclear what led him to speak optimistically. But other officials suggested it was important for the United States to enhance the morale of the Lebanese Government, which faces strong internal opposition as well as continuing pressure from Syria.  'Some Very Important Things' **********Mr. Gemayel, who spoke briefly, said he hoped ''we'll be able to accomplish some very important things within a few weeks,'' but he was not specific as to what. **********In announcing the formation of the new economic and military committees, Mr. Shultz did not say what they would accomplish. But a White House official said the economic committee would serve as the basis for discussing what foreign aid and investment were needed in Lebanon and would discuss where to seek the funds. The military committee would deal primarily with Lebanon's growing military aid requests and would discuss what kind of equipment could best be used by the Lebanese Army. **********By setting up formal committees, the Administration was signaling its continuing commitment to the survival of the Lebanese Government. **********The United States set up a political-military committee with Israel during the visit here of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, but the two sets of committees are quite different. The Israeli-American group is primarily a coordinating body to plan military strategy and exercises, while the Lebanese-American groups are meant to carry out Lebanon's aid requests.  Lifting of Siege **********What seemed to emerge from the statements on Thursday and today was that at American urging, the emphasis was now being placed on trying to accomplish concrete but limited goals in Lebanon aimed at broadening the political base of the Lebanese Government and widening its army's control over the countryside. One of the first planned measures was the lifting of the Druse siege of a Christian village in the Shuf Mountains. **********Foreign Minister Elie Salem indicated that the Lebanese Government was still looking for ways to replace the May 17 agreement worked out by Mr. Shultz between Israel and Lebanon on the terms for Israeli withdrawal. The Syrians have said they will not agree to pull out their forces from Lebanon until that accord is abrogated. **********But the United States and Israel have told the Lebanese that they stand by the accord and will not agree to cancel it because of Syrian pressure. **********The Americans told the Lebanese that as a result of their talks with Mr. Shamir and other Israeli officials they were convinced Israel would be willing to cooperate with Mr. Gemayel if the Lebanese followed a more active policy. **********Specifically, the Lebanese were urged to discuss with the Israelis the possibility of sending Lebanese Army units into areas in southern Lebanon controlled by Israel. If the Israelis became convinced that the Lebanese could effectively protect the northern borders of Israel, they might work out with Lebanon some partial withdrawals, even in advance of some Syrian decision to do so.  Talks With Israel Rejected **********But Mr. Salem seemed to reject the idea of talking to the Israelis about extending Lebanese control to southern Lebanon. **********''Such innocent questions are asked from time to time,'' he said. But he said Lebanon could not risk antagonizing other Arab nations by talking to the Israelis. The Lebanese, however, have held talks with the Israelis in the past on the terms for the withdrawal agreement and on other subjects. **********The United States officials told Mr. Gemayel, a White House aide said, that it was important for him to act ''presidential,'' to be assertive and to take into account the needs of his country's Shiites, who make up the most disadvantaged group in Lebanon and who as a result are the most hostile to the Lebanese Government."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/07/business/us-rebuffs-aid-plan-from-the-third-world.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1983-06-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 448, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. REBUFFS AID PLAN FROM THE THIRD WORLD", "print_headline": "U.S. REBUFFS AID PLAN FROM THE THIRD WORLD", "body_text": " **********The leader of the American delegation to a major trade conference said today that industrial nations were unlikely to approve the requests put forth by the developing nations. **********The requests, presented at the opening session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, include steps to stabilize commodity prices and to increase aid for developing nations. **********The aim is to inject an $70 billion into the third world during 1984 and 1985 to finance an increase in economic growth to 5 percent a year.

Weiss, every corporate mishap is a new opportunity. **********Take the mess over the Washington Public Power Supply System. For bondholders, last July's $2.25 billion default has been an unmitigated horror, in which the paper they were holding dropped to a fraction of its former value. **********But for Mr. Weiss and others in the small circle of lawyers who specialize in securities class actions and shareholder derivative suits, the Washington Power debacle was a fertile area for litigation even before the default. **********''We recognized the enormity of the problem a long time ago,'' said Mr. Weiss, whose law firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie & Lerach, has joined with others to bring a bondholders' class action against the supply system. **********''Cases like this are a long-term effort and require significant resources to put together,'' he said. ''Since your fees are strictly contingent on recovering something, it took a major investment by several firms to put together a case.'' **********The action filed by the Weiss group parallels a suit later brought by Chemical Bank in its capacity as trustee for the system's bondholders, seeking to recover money for those who held bonds at the time of the default.  Mr. Weiss' class action, however, covers those who sold their bonds before the default as well as those who held on to them. **********''We are suing on behalf of all the people who bought bonds all the way back into the 70's, when there was not full disclosure of the system's problems,'' said Mr. Weiss. ''Many of the current bondholders are speculators who bought at a discount after the problems developed. I don't think they have the same kind of claim to damages as people who invested before they knew of any problems.'' **********Lawyers for some of the power system defendants objected to the class action because it would duplicate Chemical's efforts, but last week a Federal judge in Seattle rejected those arguments. **********''I want the case for bondholders prosecuted by the best lawyers on the street,'' said United States District Judge Richard Bilby. He pointed out that while Chemical ''will get paid, win, loss or draw,'' if Mr. Weiss and his colleagues lose their case, they will get ''a big zero. It will not have cost the public anything.'' **********A Private Watchdog **********Mr. Weiss, who may be the nation's leading lawyer in the field of shareholder class actions, sees his work as a much-needed complement to the Securities and Exchange Commission's Enforcement Division. He considers himself an enforcer, one whose successes help deter corporate misbehavior - and compensate those who suffer from such misbehavior. **********''I've always been a believer that it's only private enforcement that brings about real change,'' said Mr. Weiss, a deliberate, solidly built 48- year old. ''Accountants have been given the vital role in protecting the user of public companies' financial statements, and I'm sorry to say that they haven't been terribly good at carrying out that role. It is the advent of class actions, and not what the accountants do in their auditing, that has caused the enormous changes that have taken place.'' **********Corporate Ambulance-Chasing? **********Although Mr. Weiss sees his calling as a noble one, there are those who think stockholder class actions are just a form of ambulance-chasing. **********''Mel Weiss is exceptionally good, but there are some problems with the whole shareholder class action and derivative action field, '' said Dennis Block, a New York lawyer who often defends large corporations against shareholder suits. **********''There's a lot of frivolous litigation, and the cost of defending can be so enormous that even if there is no merit to the charges, the defendants almost have to settle. The system breeds a lot of nuisance settlements.'' **********Indeed, there is a kind of bounty- hunting aspect to the whole plaintiff's class action bar. Cases are handled on a contingency basis, and plaintiffs' lawyers are usually awarded 20 percent to 25 percent of the judgment or settlement, based on the judge's perception of the amount and quality of the work they put in and the risk they took in accepting the case. **********''Plaintiffs' class action lawyers are investing in a piece of litigation,'' Mr. Weiss said. ''It usually takes three and a half to four years to get back any compensation for the time and money you've put in. And then, of course, you are always running the risk that you will lose and get no return at all.'' **********If Milberg Weiss has been bullish on litigation in recent years, the investment strategy has paid off. **********Firm Has 29 Lawyers **********Together with allied firms, Milberg Weiss's 29 lawyers - 19 in the New York office at Penn Plaza and 10 more in California - have won a $40 million settlement in a case involving the Itel Corporation; $40 million in a case involving elderly people who lost their life savings in the bankruptcy of a United Methodist Church-sponsored retirement home that had sold them prepaid life-care contracts; $50 million in a case involving U.S. Financial Inc.; $15 million in a case against Arthur Andersen & Co., the accounting firm, and the directors of Viatron Computer Systems Inc., and more than $2 million in a case involving the Franklin National Bank. **********The firm has had its failures, though. Last year, it went to court with a class action on behalf of Jeep owners - not those who had been injured by an alleged defect that might cause the vehicle to roll over, but those whose only harm was a possible economic loss due to the possible defect's effect on the Jeeps' value. The case was thrown out. **********The firm's current docket of cases is ambitious. In addition to the Washington Power case, it is now either lead counsel or co-lead counsel in class actions involving AM International, Wickes Companies, Nucorp Energy, Lionel, Pepsico, Warner Communications, Seafirst National Bank and Merrill Lynch & Company. **********Uncertain Cash Flow **********All but about 20 percent of Milberg Weiss's work is on a contingency basis, which leaves the firm in an uncertain cash-flow position. Because of the financial uncertainties, firms that specialize in contingency-fee work have traditionally remained small. **********''It would be very dangerous to get too big from a financial point of view, since we depend on a relatively small number of cases per lawyers,'' Mr. Weiss said. ''If there's any delay, we can end up with no cash flow, which has happened within the last six months, and is very frightening, since it means that we have to draw on our own resources. In the Itel case, someone filed what we say was a frivolous appeal, which got settled. If it had gone on, it might have tied us up for years. But I don't want to give anybody any ideas.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/24/business/company-news-scott-paper-to-sell-unit-to-general-felt.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 305, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Scott Paper to Sell Unit to General Felt", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Scott Paper to Sell Unit to General Felt", "body_text": " **********The Scott Paper Company said yesterday that it had agreed in principle to sell its foam division to General Felt Industries.

Block, citing extensive drought damage to this year's corn and sorghum crops, expressed further doubts today that there would be another payment-in- kind program next year for corn and other feed grains. **********Appearing briefly on a United States Chamber of Commerce television program, Mr. Block indicated that the 1983 crops of corn and other feed grains would not be large enough to provide excess grain for farmers who reduce their planted acreage next year. **********The drought, however, has had little effect on this year's wheat crop and Mr. Block has already announced a 1984 acreage reduction program for wheat that will include a payment-in- kind option. But department policy makers do not expect payment-in- kind programs on next year's cotton or rice crops, William Lesher, the department's chief economist, said. **********Large Carry-Over Cited **********The Agriculture Secretary noted that, despite a 1983 corn crop that is expected to be at least 38 percent smaller than the 1982 record production of 8.8 billion bushels, there was a large carry-over from last year and there would be no shortage of grain after the harvest ends in October. **********''But the drought is making it more unlikely,'' he said, ''that we will have enough to offer feed grain growers a payment-in-kind program on the 1984 crop.'' Mr. Block expressed similar doubts last week after a tour of the major corn-producing areas of the Middle West. **********A final decision on the question will be made after the August corn and sorghum estimate is disclosed on Sept. 12, an Agriculture Department spokesman said. **********Plan's Two Objectives **********The payment-in-kind plan, offered for the first time this spring to farmers who grow wheat, corn and sorghum, cotton or rice, had two objectives: a transfer from Government ownership to individual farmers of the record surpluses of these crops the Agriculture Department was storing under earlier price-support loan and subsidy programs, and a major reduction of acreage planted in these crops. **********The plan was accepted by most of the farmers growing these basic crops. They agreed to leave idle this spring nearly 83 million acres, a total area half the size of Texas. The largest portion of this total, 21.3 million acres, came from corn farmers, who planted a total of only 52.5 million acres, the smallest area seeded in corn since 1965. **********Even so, in early July the department was expecting a 1983 corn crop of at least 6.3 billion bushels. Since then the rains have stopped and record high temperatures have seared the developing corn plants. **********Sharp Cut in Surplus **********In its Aug. 11 crop estimate, the department reduced its corn production forecast to 5.24 billion bushels. With exports and use of corn by United States livestock raisers expected to exceed 7 billion bushels in the coming 12 months, a 1983 crop of 5.24 billion bushels would mean a sharp reduction in the surplus now on hand. **********The 1984 wheat acreage reduction program that Mr. Block announced earlier this month would require farmers who wanted to be eligible for price-support aid to leave idle 30 percent more wheat land than they planted this year. **********If they agree to leave idle another 10 to 20 percent of their normal wheat acreage, they will be given in-kind payments of wheat from Government-controlled stocks, receiving 75 percent of the past average yields on those acres."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/22/business/german-car-output-up.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 32, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "German Car Output Up", "print_headline": "German Car Output Up", "body_text": " **********West German auto assembly lines produced 351,800 passenger cars and station wagons in November, up 14 percent from 309,202 in November 1982, the Auto Industry Association said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/17/business/advertising-century-21-switches-to-mccann.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1983-06-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 532, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Century 21 Switches to McCann", "print_headline": "Advertising; Century 21 Switches to McCann", "body_text": " **********Erickson in the same city. **********The international group of franchised real estate brokers, with 6,500 offices and 75,000 employees in the United States alone, is spending $22 million on national advertising this year in this country and expects to go to $25 million next year.

Investors, bond traders and Government officials decided - at least for the time being - that plummetting oil prices meant better times ahead. And they became even more enthusiastic over news that the nation's leading indicators had climbed 3.6 percent in January, the largest monthly gain since July 1950. An 8.9 percent rise in construction spending during the month - the biggest since March 1946 - and a 9.9 percent increase in single-family home sales seemed proof positive that the recession was over. **********The stock market marched higher. The Dow Jones Industrial average set records almost every day on the strength of high-tech, bluechip, retail-store and rebounding oil stocks. It finally closed Friday at 1,140.96, up 20.02 points on the week. Even gold stocks recovered from the losses they suffered after bullion fell $100 an ounce on fears that slumping oil revenues would force Arab nations to sell their gold. Though the soaring economic barometers were warmly welcomed, falling oil prices still carried the day. Said one Wall Street analyst of oil's decline: ''It's the most important economic event of the year.'' **********The bond market agreed. Prices remained firm on the belief that lower oil prices equaled lower interest rates which equaled lower inflation - possibly as low as 2 percent this year. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker gave the market an extra push when he said that further rate declines were in the offing. Sam Nakagama, in his economic letter, declared that a powerful bond market rally - one that could push Treasury bond yields down to 8 percent from their current levels of 10.5 percent by year's end - was ''now getting under way.'' **********Even Martin Feldstein was optimist, proclaiming that the Reagan recovery had arrived. The President's chief economic adviser and resident bear saw signs that economic growth this year would exceed the 3.1 percent rate he forecast only a month ago. But he couldn't help noting that those big Federal deficits seemed destined to rise further as lower oil prices reduced the Government's take from the windfall profits tax. **********The Commerce Department was less reserved. It said that the economy would grow at a real annual rate of at least 4 percent in the current quarter - up from the earlier White House estimate of 1 percent - and 5 percent from the final three months of 1982 to the fourth quarter of this year. **********There was barely a whimper from OPEC in all this. The cartel still hasn't officially announced a price cut, and it feverishly tried to bring together its troops in meetings in Paris and London in hopes of staving off a price war - one that some analysts said could bring oil prices down to $20 a barrel. Much to its own chagrin, OPEC even sought Britain's help in holding the line on prices. With weaker oil prices pushing the pound down five cents, to a record low of $1.50, Britain was not turning a deaf ear to its Middle East counterparts. **********Brazil took comfort in the I.M.F. The lending agency finally approved a $5.5 billion loan to help rescue the world's largest and most troubled borrower. The U.S. chipped in another $400 million for good measure. Brazil is looking to falling interest rates and declining oil prices for additional relief. And it will no doubt get both. A. Gary Shilling & Company, the economic consultants, said that plunging oil prices would save Brazil $2.6 billion. And the Argus Research Corporation estimated that Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and South Korea - the Big Four - would save $8 billion in interest costs as rates on their floating rate loans fall to 11 percent this year from 17 percent in 1982. **********American steelmakers will find their savings in a contract settlement with the United Steelworkers. The workers accepted a 9 percent wage reduction - they rejected an 18 percent cut last November - in return for a pledge from the companies to invest money from these concessions in steel operations rather than in oil and savings banks and the other businesses that Big Steel seems to find more attractive. The accord will certainly help the industry, but not enough to bring costs below those in Japan. **********Norfolk Southern's attention was also on investments - and Santa Fe Industries. It bought 5.01 percent of the railroad's stock for ''investment purposes.'' But some believe that, given the I.C.C.'s penchant for big rail mergers, the $100 million transaction could lead to the nation's first singly owned transcontinental system.  Norfolk Southern knows about big deals. It was created through a combination of the Norfolk and Western and the Southern Railway and holds a chunk of Piedmont Aviation. **********Security Pacific spent $400 million to gain a stronger foothold in the commercial credit business. It agreed to acquire two finance subsidiaries from Walter E. Heller. With one of those units facing a $1.3 billion antitrust suit, Heller decided - and the stock market concurred - that it might be best to quit now. **********Federal Banking regulators also know when enough is enough. The Depository Institutions Deregulation Committee postponed new banking deregulation until June 28 so that financial institutions could catch up with rapid-fire moves to ease curbs on savings and checking accounts - and to prepare for those that lie ahead. **********A.T.&.T. isn't wasting any time returning to the well. After completing a $1 billion stock offering - the largest in U.S. history - only three months ago, Bell Telephone is coming to market for another billion dollars. It plans to use part of the proceeds to spruce up the balance sheets of its 22 local operating units, which have been under a cloud ever since Ma Bell's antitrust settlement with the Government. The Supreme Court removed some of that uncertainty when, in only four words, it approved a settlement that was eight years in the making. **********Braniff and PSA also got a quick ruling, but their's was unfavorable. A Federal court rejected an agreement that would have allowed PSA to set up a low-cost division using Braniff employees and equipment. The court said the plan required bankrupt Braniff to go through normal reorganization proceedings.

He said the Nicaraguan decision to enter into international talks was aimed at ending ''the excuses used against Nicaragua'' and would ''permit concrete steps'' by those interested in peace in the region. **********A Reversal of Position **********The decision appeared to be a reversal of the Government's previous position and also a response to the call for diplomatic moves made by four regional Presidents in Mexico last weekend. **********The four countries of the so-called Contadora Group - Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela - have attempted to mediate in Central America since January. But no significant progress has been made because Nicaragua, supported by Mexico and Colombia, had said it favored direct talks with Honduras to reduce tensions along their common border, while the United States and Honduras insisted on a broader framework and the inclusion of other nations in the region. **********Today Mr. Ortega called for immediate international talks on a nonaggression pact between Nicaragua and Honduras, a freeze of all arms shipments to El Salvador and an end to the use of foreign territories to attack countries with internal conflicts. U.S. Concerns Addressed **********While this would cover United States backing for the Salvadoran Government and the anti-Sandinista rebels based in Honduras, it also addresses, more emphatically than before, Washington's concerns over Cuban arms supplies to Nicaragua and Nicaraguan arms shipments to the insurgents in El Salvador. It also, more emphatically than before, addresses Washington's concerns. **********(In Washington, a White House spokesman, Larry M. Speakes, said there would be no comment until the Administration had read the full text of Mr. Ortega's address.) **********Some diplomats saw Mr. Ortega's call today for ''an absolute end to all arms supplies by any country to the parties in El Salvador'' as a first tacit recognition that Nicaragua has been involved in supplying the guerrillas there. Emphasis on Congress **********The apparent reversal of Nicaragua's attitude toward talks comes a day after the disclosure that the Reagan Administration is planning two large military exercises in Central America and is considering the possibility of a military quarantine around Nicaragua.  It also precedes this week's debate in Congress on Central American issues, including a proposal to cut off covert aid to rebels in Nicaragua. **********In recent interviews, senior Nicaraguan officials have said they believe that Washington is preparing a military intervention to overthrow them and that only United States public opinion and Congress can prevent this. **********Besides being less aggressive in tone against the United States than most official addresses here, Mr. Ortega's speech contained several conciliatory gestures aimed not only abroad but also at home. Contacts between the United States Embassy and the Nicaraguan Government have recently improved after a period of virtual standstill. At home the Government has stepped up land distribution and is discussing a general salary raise. **********Speaking in the historic city of Leon, 60 miles west of the capital, Mr. Ortega said the Government would cancel all debts of peasants serving as reservists or in the militia and of members of militarized cooperative farms in charge of their own defense. He said that the debts of other farmers would be partly pardoned and that unjustified invasions of farmland would have to stop. **********He repeated the Government's pledge to hold general elections in 1985, but contrary to wide expectations here gave no date.  Aware of these expectations, the Government has been prodding the Council of State to hurry its present debate on laws governing political parties and electoral proceedings. In an apparent gesture to show that it is serious about elections, the Government has sent several commissions to Europe and to other countries in Latin America to study electoral systems there. **********Citing achievements of the revolution, Mr. Ortega said that more than a million young people and adults were enrolled in more than 2,600 new study centers and more than 1,200 new schools and that important improvements had been made in the country's health care.  But he also criticized health workers for their ''bad service'' and said that shortages of medicine were serious. Warns of More Fighting **********Yet a growing feeling here that war may be coming could also be sensed in today's official ceremonies. Already the conflict with rebels along the northern and southern borders has caused the death of 600 people in Nicaragua this year and losses of $70 million, Mr.  Ortega said. **********He told the crowd to prepare for more fighting. The civilian militia is being reorganized into a more professional fighting force and last Friday the Government announced that national military conscription would soon go into effect. **********The mood here is most felt in the slogan painted everywhere and chanted today by the crowd, ''Arms to the people'' - a reference to the official warning that everyone will be armed to fight in case of an invasion. **********Mr. Ortega declared today that while Nicaragua had no expansionist ambitions, ''our revolution is irreversible.'' ---- Sandinistas Accused **********WASHINGTON, July 19 (AP) - The United States delegate to the United Nations, Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, told an anti-Sandinista group today that there was no truth to the doctrine of Leonid I.

Many of the protests were marked by rock- and bottle-throwing episodes and the use of water cannons and tear gas. The police had been deployed in force in an effort to discourage the protests, which were called to counter Government May Day parades. **********The largest demonstrations were in Gdansk, where crowds estimated at 20,000 or more battled the police as they tried to march to the home of Lech Walesa, the founder of Solidarity, and in Warsaw, where crowds of more than 10,000 rallied only a few blocks from the Government's parade. **********Walesa Did Not Participate **********Mr. Walesa himself did not participate in the demonstrations, returning home after going to church this morning. But his apartment, in a sprawling gray housing project, became a focus of the day's activities in Gdansk. **********The protests had been called by Solidarity's underground leadership committee. The committee is made up of a handful of key activists who escaped the general roundup of Solidarity supporters when martial law was imposed on Dec. 13, 1981. **********The state television reported tonight that there had been disturbances in 20 localities and showed film of demonstrators hurling rocks and bottles at the police in the steel-mill city of Nowa Huta. In the industrial Silesian city of Wroclaw, the police used water cannons, armored vehicles and barrages of tear gas grenades to break up a march of several thousand people. Clashes were also reported in Cracow, Szczecin, Gdynia and other cities. Setback to Government **********The large turnout nationwide was seen as a setback to the Government, which had sought to portray May Day as a showdown that would prove that Solidarity was no longer a viable organization. **********Today's demonstrations were the largest since widespread rallies last Aug. 31 marking the anniversary of the founding of Solidarity in 1980.  In the past, the Government has warned that continued outbreaks of demonstrations could endanger the planned visit of Pope John Paul II in June. **********''I am very happy,'' Mr. Walesa said of the demonstrations in a telephone interview this evening from his home in Gdansk.  ''Physically, we did not have much chance, but it is a great gain.'' **********Mr. Walesa, who was released in November from 11 months of internment, announced last month that he had met secretly with the fugitive Solidarity committee members and had agreed with them on a joint strategy for today's demonstrations. **********As the day began, Poland's military leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, delivered a speech to Communist Party followers in which he said that those who wanted to ''sow chaos'' were now ''only a miserable margin without any chance for success.'' **********In his speech, General Jaruzelski said, ''If in the coming days and months there are no disturbances and peace is consolidated, there will be a real possibility for lifting martial law and adopting follow-up actions.'' Letter From Bishop Read **********In St. Bridget's church in Gdansk, the parish of the workers of the Lenin shipyard, worshipers heard a letter read from Bishop Lech Kaczmarek criticizing what he termed human rights violations in Poland. ''No man can be transformed into a beast of burden,'' the letter said. **********The Government had mounted an extensive campaign over the past few weeks to discourage participation in the Solidarity rallies, including an unprecedented request to the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy from a member of the Communist Party Politburo to cancel Sunday morning masses. **********The crowd leaving the church moved toward the monument of three crosses erected by Solidarity near the shipyards' gate to honor workers killed protesting food price increases in 1970. There they merged with other demonstrators, some of whom had apparently split off from the official celebration. **********The police, swinging truncheons, charged into the crowd three times, trying to break it up, according to reports from Western correspondents on the scene. Part of the crowd was chased through the narrow streets of the town's old district amid barrages of tear gas.  Other parts of the crowd re-formed and tried to march north toward Mr. Walesa's home, according to reports reaching Warsaw, and there were clashes, with stones hurled at the police along the way. Police Use Water Cannon **********At the housing project itself, a crowd gathered in front of Mr.  Walesa's building, cheering when he appeared on a balcony. The police used a water cannon to drive them away. **********In Warsaw, where red banners were hung for the official commemoration of the workers' holiday, the police and armored vehicles surrounded the Old Town district early this morning. **********Leaflets had called for demonstrators to gather at Castle Square on the edge of the district, to go to 10 A.M. masses in the nearby Roman Catholic churches and then to hold an independent May Day demonstration. **********The 4,000-seat Gothic cathedral of St. John the Baptist was jammed, its wooden pulpit draped with a Solidarity banner, and thousands more packed the narrow, cobblestoned street in front and spilled out into the spacious Old Town square. Solidarity Flags Hung **********Red and white Solidarity flags were also hung from the buildings, along with red bunting for the official celebrations. The crowd chanted the names of jailed or fugitive Solidarity leaders and of Mr.  Walesa. They looked nervously at the gray-uniformed policemen with helmets and shields, who sealed off the streets in the area. **********After nearly an hour the police ordered the crowd to disperse.  When it did not move, water cannons opened up from both ends of the narrow street, sending jets of blue-dyed water cascading through the crowd. Then the police charged, wielding their riot sticks. **********But the demonstrations continued until midday, with the crowd being broken up, re-forming and being broken up again.  An NBC News televsion crew was detained by authorities for two hours and all of their videotapes of the protests in Old Town confiscated. Other photographers were turned away from the area or had their equipment seized. (The Associated Press reported that a reporter and a translator for the news agency were detained by the police in Gdansk, but were later released.) **********The Government's parade in Warsaw, which lasted four and a half hours, passed within a few blocks of the Solidarity demonstration.  Although the Government and Communist Party had been putting pressure on factories and schools to insure a large turnout, the procession of factory delegations, old soldiers, nurses in uniform and Communist Party functionaries appeared listless, and there was none of the usual chanting of Communist slogans. There were few spectators. **********---- Reagan Supports Solidarity **********WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) -President Reagan said in a statement today that the United States would continue to support the efforts of the Polish people and the outlawed Solidarity movement to restore human rights in Poland. **********Mr. Reagan, in a message read to a rally in support of Solidarity in Washington, repeated an offer to help Poland solve its economic problems if the Government took meaningful liberalization measures.  The message was read by a State Department official at the rally in Lafayette Park, next to the White House. **********''We want the Polish people to know that the future of Poland and free trade unions is a matter of deep concern not only to the Administration but to the American people,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''We pledge our solidarity with them and our vigilance for the restoration of human rights in that country. **********''We salute the courage of the Poles who daily face intimidation and harassment,'' the statement said. ''Their heroic resistance to their Government's attempts to suppress Solidarity serves as an inspiring display of the indomitable desire for freedom in the hearts of men and women everywhere.'' **********---- Pope Defends Workers' Rights **********ROME, May 1 (Reuters) - Pope John Paul II spoke out strongly today in defense of workers' rights and called for ''solidarity, fraternity and liberty'' in his weekly noon blessing to an estimated 50,000 people in St. Peter's Square.

The Syrian Alawites are a minority but control Syria, and that is another source of friction. **********The factional strife is further complicated by groups in Tripoli that look favorably on Moslem fundamentalists and are believed to have ties with the fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood, a major foe of the Assad Government. **********In addition, there are elements in Tripoli favoring the pro-Iraqi Baath Party, a direct enemy of the Syrian Baath Party headed by Mr.  Assad. These and other splinter groups provide the ingredients for the volatile situation in Tripoli. **********Syria still controls Tripoli and is estimated to have as many as 30,000 soldiers in the area. The clashes have been primarily between two Moslem groups - the pro-Syrian Arab Democratic Party and an anti-Syrian group called Popular Resistance. **********Casualty reports vary and are unverifiable. Forty people were said to have been killed in the latest exchanges and many more wounded.  Local hospitals have appealed for essential medical supplies. **********The exchanges have forced many civilians into basement shelters and caused the closing of bakeries and food stores.  A local Sunni Moslem leader, Rashid Karami, a former Lebanese Prime Minister, left today for Damascus to ask President Assad to intervene to end the violence. **********Today the coastal road to Tripoli, about 50 miles north of Beirut, was cut more than 20 miles from the entrance to the port.  There are also armed Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas in the area, but it was not known if any were involved in the fighting. **********The rightist Phalangist Christian radio station here reported that the P.L.O. leader, Yasir Arafat, who has been at odds with President Assad, had said in Sana, Yemen, that Syrian soldiers were attacking Palestinian refugees in a camp near Tripoli. A Call to Damascus **********Prime Minister Shafik al-Wazzan telephoned his Syrian counterpart, Abdel-Raouf al-Kassem, on Monday to ask for ''some Syrian security measures to help end the tragic situation in Tripoli.'' **********''It boils down to the fact that the people of Tripoli don't want the Syrians there anymore,'' a senior political analyst said here tonight. **********Lebanese state television today quoted a commander of a Sunni Moslem militia, Farouk Mokaddam, as saying that the latest round of fighting was ''a blood bath, a massacre committed piecemeal.'' **********Another local leader, Mohammed Ali Dannawi, has urged Syria to remove its forces from the center of the city to the outskirts.  ''What's the purpose of keeping the Syrian forces inside the city?'' he asked. ''If the purpose is for insuring security, security could not be any worse.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/04/business/amrep-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-jan-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 87, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMREP CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 31", "print_headline": "AMREP CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/17/business/advertising-cable-tv-recruiting-marketers.html": {"writer_name": "Sandra Salmans", "pub_date": "1983-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 633, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Cable TV Recruiting Marketers", "print_headline": "Advertising; Cable TV Recruiting Marketers", "body_text": " **********IT isn't only the personal computer companies that are raiding the packaged goods manufacturers for marketing and advertising executives. The cable systems and programmers are also signing up promoters of soap and soda pop. **********Alumni of Pepsico (whose beverage unit's president, John Sculley, recently became president and chief executive officer of Apple Computer), Standard Brands - now Nabisco Brands - and a number of advertising agencies are popping up at Showtime and its parent, Viacom International, at the Warner Amex Satellite Entertainment Corporation, at Group W Cable and at other system operators and cable services. **********''Packaged goods people are going into cable as it's market-driven,'' said Gary Knisely of Johnson, Smith & Kniseley, an executive recruiter who has placed a number of packaged goods marketers in cable. **********''I frankly don't see any difference between selling this and selling Heinz pickles,'' said Charles Townsend, vice president of marketing and programming for Denver-based United Cable. Mr. Townsend, who left Pepsico's new-product development group two years ago to go into cable, has also worked at Heinz and Philip Morris, which recently contributed James Morgan to Atari. **********The reason that cable has been recruiting long-time marketers, experts say, is that the industry's growth curve and optimistic projections have flattened. **********''As an industry matures and its growth slows, companies find that whatever they're selling is not too dissimilar, or that the differences are not understood by consumers,'' said Robert Catlin, who became senior vice president of marketing and creative services for Showtime last year. Mr. Catlin, a long-time marketing and advertising agency executive who previously worked at Benton & Bowles and N.W. Ayer, likens cable to the airlines, which were among his accounts. **********In both cable and packaged goods, marketing people say, the task is to discern the needs of, and communicate with, the consumer. But Mr. Catlin, for one, distinguishes between the marketing needs of the cable systems and those of the services. Like the airlines and car rental companies, he said, the system operators deal directly with the public. ''Some people coming in from packaged goods marketing have to learn that,'' he said. **********However, the Pepsico alumni find that their soft-drink experience prepared them for marketing cable systems. For one thing, they say, the cable systems, with their scores of franchise operators across the country, are like Pepsico and its network of bottlers. At Pepsico, ''we had to complement their efforts,'' said Stephen Ste. Marie, who also worked at Standard Brands and is now vice president, marketing, at Viacom's cable division. In both cases, he added, ''the ultimate beneficiary is the subscriber; if we don't keep that in mind, we will have very little chance to grow the way we like.'' **********To grow, said Mr. Townsend, cable operators have to answer two key questions: Why do only half the homes in cable areas subscribe, and why do only one-third add pay tiers? **********''Packaged goods training is perfect for figuring out why half the families don't buy cable,'' he added. His conclusion is that the holdouts are light television viewers, who do not realize that cable offers news, sports and health features as well as movies and specials. He is going to woo those viewers with four vignette-style commercials, to be test-marketed this month in markets served by United Cable. ''I suspect it will work,'' he said. **********For the marketers, one unfamiliar problem is the acute shortage of cable data, compared with the masses of information compiled by packaged goods companies. Thus, another talent of the packaged goods marketers, on which cable is drawing, is their expertise in spending money. **********Until two years ago, according to Mr. Townsend, all system operators had probably spent, cumulatively, less than $100,000 on market research. Now, he estimates, ''we're doing $1 million a year.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/15/business/tacoma-boatbuilding-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 63, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TACOMA BOATBUILDING CO reports earnings for QTr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "TACOMA BOATBUILDING CO reports earnings for QTr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/17/business/international-harvester-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-jan-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 63, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER CO reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 31", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER CO reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/12/world/around-the-world-persian-gulf-spill-is-called-catastrophic.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 157, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Persian Gulf Spill Is Called Catastrophic", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Persian Gulf Spill Is Called Catastrophic", "body_text": " **********The oil spill in the Persian Gulf has caused ''catastrophic pollution'' that threatens to cause lasting damage to fresh water supplies and marine life, a World Wildlife Fund report said today. **********It estimated that oil had spilled at a rate of 1,200 barrels a day from three wells in the Nowruz field off Iran since last March and said that efforts to cap them had been thwarted by the Iranian-Iraqi war. **********The scientists have not been able to make a detailed examination of the environmental damage, the report said, but they have spotted about 50 dead sea cows on eastern gulf beaches, believed to represent almost the entire gulf population of the marine mammal. **********The report said the scientists had also recorded unusually high numbers of dead marine turtles, dolphins, fish, sea snakes and birds on the beaches, presumed to be victims of the spill."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/07/business/car-sales-up-in-japan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 25, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Car Sales Up in Japan", "print_headline": "Car Sales Up in Japan", "body_text": " **********Japan's domestic sales of passenger cars, trucks and buses rose one-tenth of 1 percent in March, to a record 530,378 units."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/16/business/economic-scene-poor-opec-lucky-world.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Silk", "pub_date": "1983-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 922, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; Poor OPEC ...  Lucky World", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; Poor OPEC ...  Lucky World", "body_text": " **********THE Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is very much chastened. It has cut prices for the first time in its history, lowered the ceiling for oil production by its members and proclaimed its ''belief and confidence that OPEC remains the major force for oil market stability, beneficial to both consumers and producers.'' **********The tender solicitude for consumers demonstrated by the group after its meetings in London was also a historic first. After having run the price of crude oil up to a peak some 20 times higher than its pre-1973 level, OPEC members said they would now like to get together with oil consumers to stabilize prices. They also expressed their solicitude for non-OPEC oil producers such as Mexico, Britain and Norway, which they would like to join their club so that they too could have quotas set on how much oil they could produce. But, like Groucho Marx, the non-OPEC oil countries fail to see why they should join any club that would have them. **********OPEC's newly discovered concern for the welfare of other countries, whether oil consumers or non-OPEC oil producers, is accompanied by a concern for its own weaker members, such as Nigeria, Indonesia and Algeria, which are in deep financial straits. They got into trouble by acting in accordance with Parkinson's second law, which states that outgo rises to meet income. Indeed, OPEC as a whole is suffering from this Parkinsonian disease. **********The huge rise in oil earnings during the 1970's was matched by a rising outflow of money to pay for development and consumer goods.  Now that oil earnings have slumped, several OPEC countries are unable to pay their bills, just like the poor oil-importing countries of the third world. **********OPEC, never a generous contributor to third world countries, was asked in London to become a Salvation Army for its own ailing members. It responded cautiously by allowing the weaker countries to expand their output within the overall ceiling of 17.5 million barrels a day. **********For instance, Nigeria, whose production had fallen to 800,000 barrels a day in February, was given a quota of 1.3 million and allowed to reduce its price differential to $1. Similarly, Algeria, Libya, Indonesia, Ecuador, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq all got quotas higher than their recent production levels.  Iran, refusing to accept a price cut, although it has sold oil below official prices in the past, said it would accept a quota of 2.4 million barrels a day. **********Saudi Arabia alone received no quota. It has been cast in the role of ''swing'' producer - the flywheel to balance supply and demand in the market within the overall limit. **********But it remains doubtful whether that ceiling is low enough to sustain the new $29-a-barrel benchmark price of OPEC oil. The ceiling is 3.4 million barrels a day higher than actual production last month. In fact, it is more than a million barrels a day higher than OPEC pumped in April 1982, before the world recession reached its lower depths. **********Furthermore, OPEC members may lack the will to abide by the quotas. If they do not, OPEC does not have a means of enforcement. Should the world market remain soft and some members exceed their quotas, Saudi Arabia would be unable to lower output enough to absorb the difference and stabilize oil prices. **********Saudi Arabia has recently been producing only 3.8 million barrels a day, far below its 10 million level of three years ago. Obviously, the kingdom cannot produce negative barrels of oil, and eliminating its entire current output might still not balance the market.  Realistically, the kingdom could not be expected to cut production to less than 2 million barrels a day, just 1.8 million barrels less than its recent rate of production. Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the Saudi oil minister, has put the ''practical'' minimum much higher: 4.7 million. **********OPEC must now pray for what it once disdained to consider: the health of the world economy. Revival of world demand is essential to its future. **********With the United States leading the way, world economic recovery could get under way this year. But the rest of the world is lagging well behind the United States, and it probably will take several months at least before demand revives enough to prevent further erosion of oil prices, especially with hard-pressed non-OPEC producers striving to retain or increase their market shares. **********Oil buyers, not yet convinced that OPEC has set a price that will hold, are still declining to make long-term commitments. And, just as businesses, homeowners and car drivers ''topped off'' their tanks when oil prices were rising and supplies were tight, now, with declining prices and an oil glut, consumers are holding down inventories, depressing the demand for oil. No one knows how long the drawing on inventories can go on. **********OPEC's ill wind will blow much good for the United States and the world economy. Lower oil bills for both the developed and developing oil-importing countries, which greatly outnumber the oil producers, will mean: lower balance of payments deficits; lower inflation and inflationary expectations; lower interest rates and an improved ability of debtor countries to service their debts; a shift of payments from oil to consumption of durable goods, housing, productivity-increasing investment in new plant and equipment. All this should help restore equilibrium and growth to the world economy, whatever the pains to OPEC."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/05/business/bank-rule-changes-proposed-in-france.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1983-05-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 624, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANK-RULE CHANGES PROPOSED IN FRANCE", "print_headline": "BANK-RULE CHANGES PROPOSED IN FRANCE", "body_text": " **********Two job-support proposals floated in recent days by France's Socialist Government are being viewed by bankers here as thinly disguised measures to bring the country's remaining private banks, most of which are foreign owned, under state control. **********The measures, one a confidential proposal to the French Bankers Association and the other a publicly proposed change to the country's bankruptcy laws, are designed to protect jobs by guaranteeing credit to financially troubled companies. The first would make it difficult for France's private banks to cut off credit to ailing companies while the bankruptcy proposal would prevent all French banks, whether nationalized or private, from foreclosing on loans to businesses. **********The proposed new measures, foreign bankers here say, thus fit into the Socialists' declared aim of extending political control over the supply of credit within the economy. That was their major justification for nationalizing most privately owned French banks, when they came to power, along with 11 of the country's biggest industrial groups. **********Tie to Lending Pools **********Sources here say that the proposal put before the French Bankers Association would lock the country's private banks into unattractive loan agreements by preventing them from leaving the multibank lending pools that are formed to meet corporate credit needs in this country. **********The proposal, backed by the French Finance Ministry, would permit banks to withdraw from a lending pool only if 75 percent of the other pool members agreed. But in practice, these sources say, foreign and privately owned French banks would not be permitted to withdraw because a majority of the banks in every such pool are now statecontrolled. **********Sources at the association say the Finance Ministry has made clear that it would prefer the banks to adopt the code on a voluntary basis rather than see it imposed by the Government. Foreign Banks' Opposition **********However, the approximately 130 members of the Foreign Bankers Association here have strongly protested the plan. Arguing that it would amount to de facto nationalization, they have warned that they will formally oppose the proposal if it is brought to a vote inside the association. No vote has been called so far, although the proposal remains on the table. **********American and other foreign diplomats here are closely watching the maneuvering over the proposed new rules, and say that any attempt to curtail foreign banks' freedom in France could lead to reprisals against French banks operating abroad. But as yet no formal protests have been registered with the French authorities, these sources say. **********Meanwhile, French banks have acted in unison in opposing a recent proposal by the French Justice Minister, Robert Badinter, to reform the country's bankruptcy laws. **********A key provision of Mr. Badinter's proposal would automatically cancel any guarantees or collateral given a lender by a borrowing company. Bankers argue that the proposal, like the planned changes in bank pool rules, renders the whole concept of risk assessment meaningless and would turn all French banks, whether private or state-owned, into machines for financing companies the Government wants to keep alive. **********''After abolishing the death penalty for murderers, Badinter now wants to abolish the death penalty for companies,'' said one senior American banker here. **********The proposed new bankruptcy law is also arousing opposition from the very French industrialists it is intended to help keep in business, bankers say. This is because banks provide only about onethird of the total credit extended to business in France, with the remaining two-thirds coming from other concerns in the form of supplier credits. But guarantees or collateral given companies providing goods on credit could also be invalidated if the new law comes into force."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/08/business/canada-textron-in-helicopter-pact.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Canada, Textron In Helicopter Pact", "print_headline": "Canada, Textron In Helicopter Pact", "body_text": " **********Under an agreement by the Canadian Government, the Quebec government and Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc., a total of $514.1 million will be invested to build a new model light twin-engine helicopter line at an assembly facility in Mirabel, Quebec. **********The Canadian Government will contribute $165.2 million of the investment, the Quebec government $110.2 million, and Bell Helicopter the balance."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/17/business/ashland-coal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 38, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ashland Coal", "print_headline": "Ashland Coal", "body_text": " **********Svenska Kolkonsortium, a group of Swedish municipal and public-sector energy users, said it is negotiating with Ashland Coal, a unit of Ashland Oil Inc., to buy a share in a West Virginia coal mine."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/02/business/tennessee-national-gas-lines-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TENNESSEE NATIONAL GAS LINES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "TENNESSEE NATIONAL GAS LINES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/15/world/sniper-in-lebanon-kills-us-marine.html": {"writer_name": "Ihsan Hijazi", "pub_date": "1983-10-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 841, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SNIPER IN LEBANON KILLS U.S. MARINE", "print_headline": "SNIPER IN LEBANON KILLS U.S. MARINE", "body_text": " **********One United States marine was killed and another wounded today when Marine positions at Beirut International Airport came under sniper fire from neighboring Shiite Moslem quarters, a Marine spokesman said. **********The spokesman, Maj.

The wounded man was hit in both legs. **********Another spokesman, Warrant Officer Charles Rowe, said the sniper fire was part of a series of attacks in the last few days apparently aimed at provoking the Marines to retaliate. **********The violence erupted hours after two Lebanese Moslem groups, the Shiite paramilitary organization called Amal and the mainly Druse Progressive Socialist Party, announced that they were suspending their membership in a committee of Lebanese factions that has been overseeing the 18-day-old cease-fire in the Beirut area.   Lebanese Come Under Fire **********Lebanese Army positions in Burj al Brajneh also came under fire, a military spokesman said. Lebanese soldiers at the same time exchanged rocket and artillery fire with anti-Government militiamen at Araya, a hilltop village a few miles east of here along the main Beirut-Damascus highway. There were no immediate reports of casualties. **********Today's American casualties raised to 5 the number of marines killed and 43 the number wounded since the current wave of violence began at the end of August.

The force, consisting of 5,400 members, also includes French, Italian and British troops. In addition to the sniper fire from nearby buildings, the Americans have come under artillery fire from the hills overlooking their positions. **********In announcing Thursday night that Amal was taking its representative out of the cease-fire committee, the group's president, Nabih Berri, said the action was in protest against measures that undermined the status of the truce. He did not elaborate. **********But Shiite sources said Amal objected to arrest warrants issued for Shiite soldiers and officers for having failed to report to duty. An army spokesman, however, denied such warrants had been served.   Some Refused to Fight **********Several hundred Shiite and Druse servicemen had declared themselves ''conscientious objectors'' and refused to fight against their co-religionists when Lebanese Moslem militiamen battled with the Christian-commanded Lebanese Army last month. **********The Progressive Socialist Party, led by Walid Jumblat, declared its support for Amal and suspended its own membership in the secutity committee until further notice. **********Both factions reiterated their adherence to the cease-fire. But their temporary withdrawal evoked concern about the effectiveness of the committee, which also includes delegates from the Lebanese Army and the Lebanese Front, a Christian group. **********The move appeared to dim hopes for early progress in the proposed national reconciliation conference of representatives of the Lebanese Government and the nation's warring factions. An agenda for the conference, which has been scheduled for next Thursday, was agreed upon at preparatory talks held here on Thursday. Attacks on U.S. Base **********Before the cease-fire was agreed upon on Sept. 26, the United States base at Beirut airport came under frequent bombardment from positions held by anti-Government forces in the hills east of the runways. **********Thursday night a marine was slightly wounded in the left leg while on guard duty outside the consular section of the new building housing the United States Embassy in mainly Moslem West Beirut. The wounds were caused by a grenade thrown from a speeding car. **********A Marine spokesman said that a hand grenade was thrown on an airport runway the night before but that no one was hurt. Five days ago two marines were slightly wounded by sniper fire from nearby areas. **********Describing today's incident, Major Jordan said a company of marines on the northeastern perimeter of the airport came under fire from small arms and rocket-propelled grenades in the morning. **********The two marines were hit while driving separate jeeps. One, identified as Sgt. Allen Soifert, 25 years old, of Nashua, N.H., was shot in the chest. He reportedly died while being flown by helicopter to a hospital aboard the amphibious assault ship Iwo Jima, lying off Beirut. The other marine, who was not immediately identified, was also taken to the shipboard hospital. **********While the casualties were being evacuated from the Marine base at the airport, gunmen fired at the landing pad. **********Reagan Offers Condolences **********WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 (UPI) - President Reagan today telephoned the parents of Sgt. Allen Soifert, the marine killed in Lebanon, to ''express his regrets,'' a Presidential spokesman reported. **********He said the President spent three minutes on the telephone with Abraham and Joan Romer of Nashua, N.H.

The President blamed Moscow ''for blocking the dramatic reductions the world wants,'' but promised he ''will never walk away from the negotiating table.''  Profuse Praise From Reagan **********Mr. Reagan's speech was a blend of considerable praise for Japan's human virtues and economic canniness, leavened with polite urgings to ease trade restrictions and shoulder more of the ''shared burden'' of military defense. **********The President, in both his address and in another day's round of picturesque visiting, praised Japan profusely. ''Japanese-American friendship is forever,'' he said at the start of a day that included a visit to the Hirai High School, lunch with Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone at his country retreat 70 miles outside Tokyo and a farewell visit to Emperor Hirohito. The days have been long and Mr. Reagan shows some weariness, but his aides say he is ready for the next stop, South Korea. **********''To all those who lack faith in the human spirit,'' he told Parliament, ''I have just three words of advice: Come to Japan.'' **********He used praise of Japan as a device for denigrating the Soviet Union. ''Come to a country whose economic production will soon surpass the Soviet Union's, making Japan's economy the second largest in the entire world,'' he said. **********Mr. Reagan also used his praise of Japan to strike back at Congressional critics in Washington now trying to enact higher taxes to help close record budget deficits. ''They would ignore the lessons of Japan,'' he said, noting that this nation's tax rates are ''dramatically lower'' than those of other industrial nations. **********Mr. Nakasone, in issuing a friendly summary of his talks with the President, cited the need for the United States to lower interest rates. But he did not mention the budget deficit as an aggravating factor. **********The Prime Minister and the President summarized their talks in statements Thursday that sketched plans to continue with existing accords for dealing with such difficult problems as trade restrictions and the undervalued status of the yen. As expected, the two leaders joined in setting up new consultative groups on the issues of the yen- dollar exchange rate and the easing of restrictions on purchases of stocks and bonds by nationals of each country in the other. **********Differences Acknowledged **********The statements, studded with stark denunciations of terrorist activities in the world, were amicable expressions of well-known economic differences and existing attempts at improvement. Mr. Nakasone, for example, singled out Japan's problems with the growing tendency of American states to tax local Japanese companies on their global assets. Mr. Reagan once again warned about Japanese trade barriers and the political pressures they create for him back home. **********''I have vigorously opposed quick fixes of protectionism in America,'' the President told Parliament this morning. ''We need your help in demonstrating free trade to address concerns of my own people,'' he said, telling Japan that Americans ''believe your markets are less open than ours.'' **********''If we each give a little we can all gain a lot,'' he said. **********Mr. Reagan's overall theme was that whatever the differences with Japan, they are being subjected to decent compromise and are minor in the face of a common enemy, the Soviet Union. **********''The real quarrel is not with us,'' he said. ''It is with those who would impose regimentation over freedom; drudgery over dynamic initiative; a future of despair over the certainty of betterment, and the forced feeding of a military Goliath over a personal stake in the products and progress of tomorrow.'' **********President Reagan told the Japanese that they were at the heart of ''the most exciting region of economic growth in the world today.'' **********''I welcome this new Pacific tide,'' he said. ''Let it roll peacefully on.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/29/business/business-digest-tuesday-november-29-1983.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 605, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1983", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1983", "body_text": " **********Companies General Public Utilities announced management changes meant to blunt criticism of its handling of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident.

Poland joined the Soviet Union in voting against it. Four nations - China, Nicaragua, Zimbabwe and Guyana - abstained, thus weakening the United States' attempt to demonstrate that most of the world condemned the Soviet deed. **********In Washington, Senate Democratic and Republican leaders introduced a resolution in Congress ''condemning the brutal behavior'' of the Soviet Union for the destruction of the South Korean plane, but many liberals and conservatives in both houses pressed for something stronger than words. (Page A10.) Humiliation Avoided in U.N. **********The result of the voting in the United Nations Security Council spared the United States what had threatened to become a political humiliation. As late as this morning, there were only eight certain votes for the resolution. Had that total gone unchanged, the document would have failed and the negative Soviet vote would not have counted as a veto. **********But a ninth Council member, Malta, was persuaded to abandon its reservations and join the majority, providing the critical vote. **********Malta's delegate, Victor J. Gauci, said much the same thing as several of those who abstained - that the circumstances surrounding the airliner's destruction ''have been clouded with too much uncertainty.'' **********Even so, he voted along with the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Jordan, Zaire and Togo. **********The crucial section in the resolution ''deeply deplores the destruction of the Korean airliner and the tragic loss of life.'' In an effort to gain the maximum number of third-world votes, the resolution only once referred to the Soviet Union and avoided condemning it. **********The direct reference was in the preamble, the section setting out the facts of an issue, which noted that the South Korean plane ''was shot down by Soviet military aircraft.'' **********Today's was the 115th Soviet veto compared to 36 by the United States. The United States has been casting more vetoes than the Soviet Union in recent years, largely because the membership of new African and Asian nations has often deprived the United States and its allies of a majority. **********Since the end of 1979, the United States has exercised its veto 15 times, mostly over issues affecting Israel and South Africa, while the Soviet Union has cast only three. The previous Soviet veto, in January 1980, stopped a resolution to impose economic sanctions against Iran, which was then holding American hostages. **********Today the American and Soviet delegates engaged in harsh exchanges. Jeane J. Kirkpatrick of the United States said the Soviet Union ''has demonstrated an attitude that is contemptuous of the truth and callous toward human life.'' **********She said that the Russians had committed ''a deeply shocking act'' and, ''instead of admitting error, insisted no error was made.'' Indeed, the Soviet Government has ''emphazised it would have done the same thing over again,'' she said.   Russian Affirms Spying Charge **********Oleg A. Troyanovsky of the Soviet Union said the airliner, with 269 civilians on board, had been engaged in a spy mission. ''No doubt remains,'' he said. **********He accused the United States of staging a ''propaganda spectacle'' in the Council and said that ''ruling circles in the United States make use of this tragic event to heat up an already dangerous'' world situation. **********While the Soviet Union pursues peaceful initiatives, Mr. Troyanovsky said, ''the United States intends to continue to heighten its confrontation with the Soviet Union.'' **********Several of the four abstaining nations said they were concerned over the safety of civil aviation and would welcome the investigation called for by the resolution. But they said either that the text was one-sided or that too many questions over the episode remained unanswered. **********Ling Qing of China said he was abstaining ''in view of the serious dispute over certain aspects of this incident.'' Asian diplomats said China had also held off because the resolution favored South Korea, and China is allied with North Korea. **********Noel G. Sinclair of Guyana, another abstainer, said the sponsors of the resolution - the United States, Britain, France, South Korea, Japan, Canada and Australia - had breached the Council's practice by not negotiating the text with other members. **********Mr. Sinclair also observed that ''what was being advanced as hard evidence is now being revised.''

Last week, when corporations were lucky to earn 8 1/2 percent on short-term deposits, many consumers were earning 11 percent or more. **********The bonanza, however, is unlikely to continue. In California, where competition for consumer accounts is especially keen, interest rates offered on the new ''money market'' accounts have dropped substantially. The Bank of America, which competed aggressively for the new accounts, offering 11 1/4 percent plus bonuses ranging from $25 to $100, had cut that to only 10 percent last week, with no bonuses. **********In New York, Chase Manhattan Bank has been setting the pace, offering 11 percent. But, according to Carl D. Gustavson, senior vice president, this week Chase will lower the rate to 10.1 percent. **********Bankers predict that rates on money-market accounts will drop to slightly above the yield on money market mutual funds, which stood at 8.3 percent last week. **********''Logic says that shortly rates will trend down to approximately the real market value of the funds, and that would be somewhere near eight percent,'' said William J. Heron, senior vice president of Citibank. But Not for Borrowers The interest rates individuals must pay on loans, meanwhile, are higher than ever above what banks pay for funds. Automobile companies and at least one airline have had to steeply undercut the banks at their own game in order to stimulate badly-needed sales. The auto makers have been offering 11.9 percent loans on new-car loans, while the banks have been asking as much as 18 percent. **********If banks keep consumer loan rates far higher than their cost of funds, more companies, as well as nonbank competitors, can be expected to enter the market. **********The question is how long the banks can maintain high rates without losing their customary markets. Not long, perhaps. Citibank is expected to announce this week that it will reduce the rate it charges for four-year loans on new cars to 16 percent, from 18 percent. Other banks are expected to follow. Platinum Stands Out **********Unlike most commodities, platinum is in a bull market. From a low of $238 an ounce last June, the price reached $485 last week, with most of that coming in January. Many speculators say this is only the beginning. **********Donna Fried, a technical analyst with the brokerage firm of Sal Calcaterra, predicted that once platinum passes the $490 mark, it will climb rapidly to $520 an ounce, with $640 the next resistance level. **********At Sinclair Global Brokerage Corporation, Robert Farley forecast that ''all precious metals will be traded up.'' He said he is bullish about the platinum group because of its importance to military contractors. The group includes paladium, rhodium, iridium, ruthenium and osmium. **********A factor behind the price rise has been a perception that the Soviet Union, a leading producer, has been holding platinum-group metals from the market. Another reason, analysts say, is the growing belief that the world economy has begun to recover, increasing industrial demand. Still another bullish factor is platinum's price in relation to gold. In a rising market, the price of platinum usually exceeds that of gold. With gold approaching $500 an ounce, platinum is selling at a substantial discount, even after its recent rise. Calmer Nerves About Oil **********Bankers, at first shaken by the prospect of plummeting oil prices, have regained their composure. While a decline could worsen the financial problems of some oil producers, it would also mean a drop in world prices overall, they said. This, in turn, could lead to a faster economic recovery and make it easier for all debtor countries to meet their financial obligations. **********Interest rates, the bankers say, would decline too, reducing the debt-servicing costs of all borrowers.  The critical question, bankers say, is whether the price will drop below $25 a barrel, the level at which most big banks based their loans to the oil industry. Richard O'Brien, an economist with the American Express International Banking Corporation, contends that at $25, demand would increase to push the price up again.  Robert A.

''My country believes that the Arabs are wrong. **********''I'm saying that both sides are wrong. If both sides cling to their extreme views, you can't have peace in the Middle East.''  Kirkpatrick Urges Toughness **********The visitors were guests of Stephen J. Solarz, the Brooklyn Democratic Congressman who is serving as a member of the United States Mission to the United Nations during the current session of the General Assembly. **********The visitors from Mr. Solarz's congressional district had no moments of confrontation in their meeting with the United States representative, Jeane J. Kirkpatrick. She argued that the United States needs to be tough in defense of its values. **********The Brooklyn visitors also saw representatives from Israel and Pakistan. They asked a lot of questions, the majority of which suggested a feeling among Mr. Solarz's constituents that the United Nations was one-sided and unfair. **********''There's absolutely no doubt,'' Mr. Solarz said of his constituents, ''that virtually everybody who came today saw the U.N. as a place where duplicity and double standards are the rule rather than the exception.''  Fairness and Justice **********Among the questions asked by today's visitors were these: Do United Nations diplomats really listen to the arguments made by opposing delegates? Should the United Nations be helping Yasir Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization evacuate its forces from the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, where they have been besieged by guerrillas opposed to Mr. Arafat? And doesn't the United Nations ''debase itself'' by turning into a debating society that pays little attention to fairness and justice? **********At the same time, the visitors from Brooklyn gave a vote of confidence to the United Nations itself. Asked by Mr. Solarz to vote on whether the United States should take part or withdraw, the sentiment in favor of participation was unanimous. **********Still, through their questions, the guests repeatedly brought up the problem of Israel at the United Nations and the tendency of the majority of the countries at the world body to voice anti-American views. On these matters they encountered different explanations and arguments from different diplomats. **********Mrs. Kirkpatrick said that the ''scapegoating of Israel'' had come about, at least in part, because of the ''condescension and indifference'' of member countries who did not try to stop it from happening.   Breaking Bad Habits **********''Countries failed to make clear early on, in the beginning of this pattern, that we take it very seriously,'' Mrs. Kirkpatrick said. ''It's harder to break bad habits and bad practices once they're entrenched than to prevent them from becoming entrenched.'' **********Aryeh Levin of the Israeli Mission said the United Nations, in attacking his country, demonstrated a ''despicable double standard.'' He voiced the fear that in time, the constant polemic attacks on Israel could result in the ''delegitimization'' of the country. **********When the Brooklyn visitors spoke to the representatives of Botswana and Pakistan, they heard about some of the animosity and frustration felt toward the United States by representatives of the third world. **********Mr. Legwaila of Botswana said that, in essence, Africans were ill disposed toward Communism. **********''You have to work very hard to turn an African into a Communist,'' he said. But he said feelings of frustration had been generated by the failure of the West to bring about any change in the apartheid system of racial separation in South Africa or to achieve independence for the disputed territory of South- West Africa, also known as Namibia.   Looking for AK-47's **********''Those failures have got people so frustrated that they go to Moscow looking for AK-47's,'' Mr. Legwaila said, referring to a Soviet rifle commonly used by guerrilla groups in southern Africa.  Riaz Mohammed Khan of the Pakistani Mission said the third world as a whole was not one-sided in its treatment of the superpowers. He pointed out, for example, that third world countries had criticized the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. **********''It's a matter of perception,'' Mr. Khan said. **********Later in the corridor, one of the visitors, Bertha S. Goldstein, a retired schoolteacher, told Mr. Khan, ''You have a very shallow view, my friend.'' **********''The Palestinians have been played a dirty deal - listen to me - by their Arab brothers,'' she said. ''They have been left to rot in those refugee camps.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/23/world/liberian-official-is-dismissed-for-setting-conditions-on-job.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Liberian Official Is Dismissed For Setting Conditions on Job", "print_headline": "Liberian Official Is Dismissed For Setting Conditions on Job", "body_text": " **********The newly appointed secretary general of Liberia's ruling People's Redemption Council has been relieved of the job and dismissed from the army for setting conditions on his appointment, the Monrovia radio reported today. **********Brig.

But on gray market goods - trademarked goods purchased abroad, imported into this country, and sold, usually without a warranty, for a lower price than those made for the United States market - the law is much less clear. **********The gray market in cameras, watches, perfumes and electronic goods has been growing rapidly for the last few years, as more and more discount stores scour the globe for odd lots of brand- name items they can offer at cut rates. **********While this produces bargain prices for buyers, it also produces trouble for the authorized United States distributors, not only because of the loss of sales, but also because of the loss of good will for their brand when something goes wrong with the camera or watch and the buyer asks for free repairs. **********Those who are fighting gray market imports have found themselves in a legal quagmire, as is apparent from the continuing battle over the importing of Japanese-made Mamiya cameras. **********The owner of the Mamiya trademark in this country has for some years been the Bell & Howell: Mamiya Company, which gets its cameras from Japan's Mamiya Camera Company by way of Mamiya's worldwide distributor, J. Osawa & Company. Bell & Howell: Mamiya - now known as Osawa - is the exclusive authorized distributor of Mamiya cameras in the United States. **********The same cameras, however, have also been imported into this country by the Masel Supply Company, which buys them from an international dealer in Hong Kong, who in turn has gotten them, perfectly lawfully, from Osawa. Last year, Bell & Howell: Mamiya won a court ruling blocking Masel's imports on the ground that the imports caused ''a substantial likelihood of confusion.'' **********''The business of selling Mamiya goods in the United States is the plaintiff's business,'' said United States District Judge Edward Neaher. ''It is plaintiff that defines the warranty and provides the repair services for the cameras it sells. It is plaintiff's warranty and assurances of quality that are signified by the Mamiya marks in this country.'' **********That victory was short-lived, though. Last month, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, overturned that ruling. ''There would appear to be little confusion, if any, as to the origin of the goods and no significant likelihood of damage to Bell & Howell: Mamiya's reputation since thus far it has not been shown that Masel's goods, which have a common origin of manufacture with Bell & Howell: Mamiya's goods, are inferior to those sold by Bell & Howell: Mamiya and are injuring Bell & Howell: Mamiya's reputation,'' the appeals court said. **********''Further, it does not appear that the lack of warranties accompanying Mamiya cameras sold by Masel amounts to irreparable injury, since the consumer can be made aware by, among other things, labels on the camera boxes or notices in advertisements as to whether the cameras are sold with or without warranties.'' **********Bell & Howell: Mamiya has asked for a rehearing. ''Confusion isn't the only issue,'' said John Kidd, a lawyer for Bell & Howell: Mamiya. ''You worry about what this is doing to the good will of your name. You don't want people deciding Mamiya is a bum brand because of problems they've had with cameras you didn't sell them.'' **********In other cases, though, the decisions have gone against gray market sales. ''The courts are not giving consistent answers,'' said Nick Allard, a Washington lawyer who is following the issue. ''It's an extremely uncertain area right now.'' The courts are not the only forum in which the gray market question has arisen, though. The Treasury Department is the object of intense lobbying by those who want it to adopt a new policy for Customs Service handling of gray market imports. **********The question of which gray market imports should be excluded revolves around the identity of the American trademark owner. If the owner of the United States trademark has bought the distribution rights from an unrelated foreign manufacturer, the law allows the American company to get an exclusion order from the Customs Service, forbidding any gray market goods to be brought into the country. **********According to Mr. Kidd, Bell & Howell: Mamiya has the only such exclusion order from the Customs Service. Lawyers for Masel, however, say the exclusion order should not have been issued, since Bell & Howell: Mamiya is closely connected with Japan's Mamiya and Osawa, and American subsidiaries of foreign manufacturers are not covered by the law. **********''Bell & Howell: Mamiya, Osawa and Mamiya are financially interlocked,'' said Nathan Lewin, the Washington lawyer who represents Masel. ''They are essentially the same company, and they shouldn't be able to get Customs Service protection. The law was designed to protect an independent American trademark owner who has invested money in promoting a brand, and becomes identified with that brand in this country, so that the value of the rights he bought would be undercut if someone else began selling the same goods in the United States. It's not supposed to cover the American subsidiary of a foreign manufacturer.'' **********Mr. Lewin says that, if the lower court's decision in the Mamiya case had been upheld, or if the Customs Service routinely issues exclusion orders in cases such as the Mamiya case, any foreign manufacturer would be able to set up an American subsidiary that would be able to keep out unauthorized goods and set unduly high prices."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/17/business/advertising-dexatrim-magazine-campaign.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1983-03-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 737, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Dexatrim Magazine Campaign", "print_headline": "Advertising; Dexatrim Magazine Campaign", "body_text": " **********UNTIL now, Compton Communications' advertising for Dexatrim, a weight-reduction aid, has been built on testimonials from users. The approach has been successful, helping the Thompson Medical Company product push to the top of its class and to double sales of the class in three years. Now a second prong is being added to the attack - the recommendation of pharmacists. **********Unlike the testimonial effort, which began in earnest on TV in 1979, the survey of pharmacists will run only in magazines. It will feature a smiling man in high-necked white coat holding up a box of Extra Strength Dexatrim that promises ''Lose Weight Fast,'' over the headline ''More Pharmacists Recommend Dexatrim to Help You Lose Weight.'' **********It should not have been too difficult for Thompson to line up support from the nation's pharmacists, since it has great strength among the drug chains. Since its start about 30 years ago, most of the company's marketing activity has been at the retail, rather than the consumer, level, with all sorts of trade deals that include merchandising allowances. Thompson brands are also known at retail for high profits per unit, or, as the trade calls it, ''high ringup.'' **********But according to Donald E. Lepone, Thompson's vice presidentmarketing, who was visiting the other day with Thomas P.  Lom, Compton's senior vice president-management supervisor, the contented and communicative users of Dexatrim all but forced the company into starting a consumer-advertising program. **********''When you get a letter from a consumer that says something like, 'Hey, your product has changed my life,' '' Mr. Lepone said, then you begin thinking that you ought to be telling people about the response. **********That was Compton's response, too, when it was invited to take over the assignment early in 1979 from Ted Bates & Company.  ''Compton is probably the leading real-people agency in the country,'' Mr. Lepone said, referring to the genre of advertising that it frequently creates for such clients as Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson. Indeed, its first TV spots for Dexatrim featured still photos of users and their voice-over comments. **********The ingredient that makes Dexatrim and its major competitors work as an appetite suppressant is the drug phenylpropanolamine, or PPA, which Mr. Lepone describes as ''the first truly effective drug available for weight loss without a prescription.'' **********Despite Thompson's enthusiasm for PPA, however, the United States Food and Drug Administration has not yet finished its own assessment of the drug. Although an agency panel cleared the drug for over-thecounter sale in 1979, it called last year for more research into PPA's possible link to high blood pressure. **********And Dr. William Gilbertson, director of the F.D.A.'s division of over-the-counter drugs, stressed recently that even though PPA had been declared safe by two panels, it was still under review by the agency. **********When the first panel cleared PPA in 1979, Thompson Medical was in a very good position to move. It was already firmly entrenched at retail, where it had installed racks, each identified as an ''Appetite Control Center,'' that displayed Dexatrim above competitive products. In addition it had strong co-op and point-of-sale advertising programs in place. **********Another help to sales came when Dexatrim, which was originally sold only in tablet form, took advantage of years of advertising for the Menley & James Contac cold remedy and introduced a timed-release capsule. But in 1980, Menley & James, a SmithKline subsidiary, capitalized on its own expertise and brought out Dietac, a similar product. Spending about $10 million for advertising that starred Bill Bixby, it quickly moved into second place in the category behind Dexatrim, which was spending only about $7 million or $8 million.  That sort of extravagance has ended. **********''They helped stimulate the category,'' said Mr. Lepone, whose own product has been stretched into line extensions - Extra Strength, Extra Strength Caffeine Free and Extra Strength Plus Vitamins. **********Meanwhile, the category, an estimated 90 percent of which is made up of PPA-based products, went from about $80 million in annual retail sales in 1978 to between $200 million and $250 million now. **********And in that same period, Dexatrim's wholesale sales and earnings more than tripled, from $30 million, and $2.7 million, to $91 million and $11.9 million.

He said he was referring to the presence of American troops in Lebanon and Grenada and to United States involvement in conflicts in Nicaragua and El Salvador.   Withdrawal of Marines Urged **********Mr. Cranston, who made his remarks at a forum for female state legislators in Coronado, Calif., said the marines should be withdrawn from Lebanon. He said that there was a ''U.S.-Soviet equation'' in the Middle East and that the United States bombing of Syrian positions posed a potential for conflict between the two countries because of the presence of Soviet advisers in Syria. **********Another of the candidates, Senator John Glenn of Ohio, said the United States ''should exercise the utmost caution and measure our response to this extremely dangerous situation very carefully.'' **********He added that he did not favor withdrawing the marines ''at this time or under these circumstances.'' **********''For nearly a year,'' Mr. Glenn said, ''I have warned against allowing the situation in Lebanon to deteriorate into a direct Syrian-American confrontation. I have called for clearly defining our mission. If the Administration considers a large and protracted battle with the Syrians in Lebanon an option, let them present their plan to the Congress and the American people. **********''If an American war in Lebanon is not the Administration's intention,'' he went on in a statement issued in Washington, ''then let's stop stumbling toward it.''  Hart Fears More Fighting **********Senator Gary Hart of Colorado said, ''It's almost inevitable that there will be an escalation of the conflict the longer we remain on Lebanese soil.'' **********''Our role in that country cannot and must not be a military role,'' said Mr. Hart, whose comments also came at the meeting in Coronado, Calif. ''It should be diplomatic and political. I'm deeply concerned that the Administration will increase the level of hostilities, particularly with the Syrians. I don't think its healthy.'' **********He also said the marines should be removed from Lebanon, adding, ''There are those in the Administration who invite conflict.''  Jackson Wants Marines Out **********The Rev. Jesse Jackson said the American presence ''is not neutral enough to be a peacekeeping factor.'' **********In an appearance on the NBC News program ''Meet The Press,'' he called for a United Nations force or a nonaligned force to replace the marines. ''We should not withdraw unilaterally,'' he said, ''but it is very clear, to me, that our presence there can only serve no good end.'' **********''This apparent escalation of tensions in the Middle East, a kind of declaration of war, is unwarranted,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''It is provocative. It adds to the further destabilization of the region. **********''I do not feel that it's justified, nor do I feel that we have the whole story,'' he went on.

Shultz promised Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone of Japan today that the United States would never negotiate an agreement with the Soviet Union on reducing medium-range missiles in Europe at the expense of the security of Japan and other non-European countries. **********John Hughes, Mr. Shultz's spokesman, said Japan's concerns over a compromise developing at the Geneva arms control talks that might lead to a shift in Soviet missile strength from Europe to Asia played a major part in the talks that Mr. Shultz held with Mr. Nakasone and with Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe. **********Japanese officials, alarmed at reports that some West European leaders are seeking an interim solution that would lead to a reduction, but not a dismantling, of all Soviet SS-20 missiles, have become increasingly outspoken against any accord that would permit Moscow to redeploy SS-20's in Soviet Asia. **********Mr. Hughes said that Mr. Shultz ''made the point that the United States would never agree to something that might appear good for Europe but was bad for the rest of the world.'' **********Strong Support for 'Zero Option' **********''The United States approached arms control on an international basis, with its global responsibilities in mind,'' Mr. Shultz told Mr. Nakasone, according to Mr. Hughes. **********Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said after Mr. Nakasone's hourlong meeting with Mr. Shultz that the Prime Minister thanked the United States for its understanding of Japan's concern and that he was very pleased and satisfied. **********Mr. Nakasone told Mr. Shultz, the Japanese officials said, that he strongly supported the ''zero-zero option'' first proposed by President Reagan in November 1981. **********Under that approach, which is officially endorsed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the United States has offered to forego the deployment of 572 new medium-range missiles in Europe, due to begin late this year, if the Soviet Union agrees to dismantle all of its approximately 340 SS-20's and some 260 older SS-4's and SS-5's. **********The SS-20, each of which has three warheads, is a mobile missile, meaning it can be moved easily from place to place. Of the 340 SS-20's, about 250 are in European parts of the Soviet Union and 90 in the Asian regions. The Japanese have backed the ''zero option'' because if it were agreed to by Moscow, it would mean the elimination of the 90 SS-20's in Asia as well as the larger numbers in Europe. Upset by Nitze Approach **********Mr. Hughes said that Mr. Shultz assured Mr. Nakasone and Mr. Abe that the United States stood by the zero approach and would not agree to anything that would lead to an increase in Soviet missile strength in Asia. **********One Foreign Ministry official said Japan was upset at reports that Paul H. Nitze, the chief American negotiator at the talks on mediumrange missiles in Geneva, had informally worked out an understanding last summer by which the Soviet Union would reduce to 75 its missiles in Europe and freeze the number in Asia, thereby seeming to allow the Russians to have a more powerful force in Asia than in Europe. **********The strong support by Japan for the zero option has complicated the arms control picture, because Vice President Bush is in West Europe to listen to West European leaders who are urging Washington to move away from the zero approach to one that would lead to some American missiles being deployed and the Soviet level in Europe sharply reduced. **********The Japanese, who will not allow any nuclear weapons on their soil, now appear at odds with the Europeans.  But Mr. Hughes was careful to state that Mr. Shultz did not promise not to reach a compromise, only not to secure an accord that would worsen the security situation in Asia."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/06/business/technology-touch-screen-views-mixed.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1983-10-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1024, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Technology; Touch Screen: Views Mixed", "print_headline": "Technology; Touch Screen: Views Mixed", "body_text": " **********WHEN Hewlett-Packard introduced the first personal computer with a touch screen two weeks ago, it was a major vote of approval for a technology that had been around for more than a decade without much success. **********''I had a companywide celebration last Friday,'' said Arthur B. Carroll, chief executive of Carroll Touch Technology in Champaign, Ill., a manufacturer of touch screens and a pioneer in the field. ''I struggled for 10 years to get the stamp of approval on touch technology and they just did it.'' **********Mr. Carroll said Hewlett-Packard's decision had already sparked interest in touch technology from other computer makers and would bring growth to the touch screen business, which, he said, has less than $10 million a year in sales. **********But others say the outlook is still touch and go. The same drawbacks that have hurt touch screens in the past might doom Hewlett-Packard's screen to being merely the gimmick of a company that wanted to distinguish its product in a crowded market. **********Touch screens allow the user to perform tasks by touching words, boxes or pictures on the screen, rather than having to type commands. On the HP 150, for instance, changing the shading of a wedge in a pie chart entails pointing to the bar and pointing to a box containing the desired new shading. **********Hewlett-Packard made its screen touch-sensitive by lining its edge with tiny infrared light emitters and detectors, so that the front of the screen is crossed by an invisible grid of beams. The computer can determine the position of the finger on the screen by seeing which horizontal and vertical light beams are blocked. **********Other techniques are used by other companies. One is to coat the screen with a transparent membrane that contains wires or conductive coating, so that pressing the screen completes a circuit at a particular point. Another is to measure the time it takes sound signals to travel from the edge of the screen to the finger and back. **********Pointing can be a more natural way of using a computer than typing commands. ''Although it may not be polite, we've all had a lot of practice pointing,'' said Jimmy Sutton, a Hewlett-Packard software engineer. **********But those who are doing word processing or financial calculations on a spreadsheet have to type the text or numbers anyway and might find it bothersome to leave the keyboard to touch the screen occasionally. That is especially true as they gain experience. A novice using the Visicalc spreadsheet program might find it easier to touch a box on the screen labeled ''exit'' than to type ''/SQ.'' But once someone learns the command it is easier to stay on the keyboard. **********''Frequent users would rather type six or eight characters, even, than reach up and touch the screen and come down again,'' said Ben Shneiderman, head of the Human/Computer Interaction Laboratory at the University of Maryland. **********There are other drawbacks as well. The pointing hand obscures the text, and the finger is too bulky to pinpoint single letters. The Federal Aviation Administration, which tested touch screens for use by air traffic controllers, found yet two more problems: weary arms and dirty screens. **********''Your arm gets pretty tired; after a couple of hours of use, the guys who were testing it complained,'' said Gerard Spanier of the agency's Technical Center in Atlantic City. Also, he said, finger oil ruined the delicate films the F.A.A. put on its screens to prevent glare. **********Touch screens have plenty of competition. Apple's Lisa uses a mouse, a handheld device that slides along a desk. As the mouse moves, the cursor on the screen moves accordingly. A user can point to much smaller objects with a mouse than with a finger, the screen is not obscured, and the arms do not get as tired. But the mouse has its own drawbacks, not the least of which is that a clear space is needed next to the computer. Using a mouse also requires leaving the keyboard, and also might require taking one's eyes off the screen. **********Another approach is the touch tablet, in which the user slides a finger or points to particular spots on a separate pad. This allows some of the advantages of both the touch screen and the mouse. The Gavilan portable computer uses such a pad. Koala Technologies and the newcomer, Chalk Board Inc., make touch tablets geared toward home computer use by children. **********''In the short term, you're more likely to see those appear than you are a touch screen,'' said Robert R. Highfill, marketing and sales manager for Elographics Inc. of Oak Ridge, Tenn., which makes both touch screens and touch pads. **********Touch screens are finding uses where the computer is used for short durations by novices, such as the computerized public information displays at Walt Disney's Epcot Center. They might also be useful for education, especially for young children. Control Data's Plato computerized education system was a pioneer in touch screen use. **********Touch screens can also allow someone in a high stress situation to go through a sequence of actions quickly without taking his eyes off the screen.

Today the company, armed with a host of new products and an expanded research and development budget, is fighting hard to regain its corporate confidence - and its American market share. **********It will not be a battle easily won. Sony reported that profits in the first half ended April 30 plunged 66 percent from a year earlier, to $45 million. The drop was due mostly to severe price-cutting and sagging sales overseas, particularly in the United States, which accounts for more than 25 percent of Sony's total revenues. The disappointing showing followed an even steeper decline in net income in the last quarter of 1982. **********While Sony predicts that earnings will improve in the second half of this year, profit for 1983 will be well below that of a year earlier. As one Sony executive acknowledged: ''The damage has never been this severe'' - a comment reflected in a company proposal to freeze managers' wages and suspend customary bonuses to senior executives. **********Yet, on the record, most Sony officials maintain that the recent troubles are cyclical and that the company is well on its way to recovering its former vigor. ''Sony will come off the bottom,'' asserted Kimio Okura, a managing director at the company's headquarters here. ''We are not so anxious about the future of our operations.'' **********That there are any doubts at all has particular significance for a company long regarded as the consummate innovator in consumer electronics. Sony - perhaps more than any other company - has been responsible for transforming the American view of ''made in Japan'' from the code phrase for shoddy merchandise that it was in the 50's to the seal of distinction that it is today. **********It was also a symbol - to Americans in particular - of the strengths of Japanese industry: Its ability to make high-quality, ingenious, affordable products, and, by inference, the weaknesses of many companies in the United States, which in recent years have been unable to do the same. Besides the Betamax, its sales mainstay, Sony is probably best known for its Walkman portable radio and its Trinitron color television set. **********DESPITE Sony's heritage, however, some analysts maintain that its present difficulties have done permanent damage to its future competitiveness, especially in the United States. Ominous signs are already apparent. Sony's overall American market share in video cassette recorders has fallen to 13 percent in 1982 from 14.2 percent a year earlier; in 1978 it commanded 27.5 percent of the then-embryonic business. **********Meanwhile, worldwide sales of Beta recorders by all makers - led by Sony - have also declined. Beta machines, which accounted for almost 62 percent of Japanese video cassette production six years ago, now represent just 28 percent of total video cassette sales. At present, Betamax recorders account for a sizable 42 percent of Sony's sales. **********Sony's slump comes at a time when sales of video cassette recorders in general are rebounding strongly. According to the Electronic Industries Association, a trade group, sales in the United States are expected to reach a record 4 million - nearly a 100 percent increase over last year's figure. **********How much of this expanding American market Sony will garner, however, is much in question, especially in light of increasingly fierce competition from powerhouse companies, such as Matsushita, and a move in consumer interest toward lower-priced video cassettes. Most analysts agree that new business will come mostly outside Japan from sales of less expensive models. (Sales of audio products in Japan fell about 35 percent last year, to $4.4 billion.) **********Sony, which makes mainly higher priced models, so far has not been able to increase sales volume enough to make up for the lower prices it has set for its Betamax line. This year, for example, the company reduced some prices as much as 40 percent. **********The move has prompted some to wonder whether Sony is still a growth company. ''It's over for Sony,'' declared one analyst at a large Japanese securities firm. ''The company's best days are behind it.'' **********Such a comment would have been nearly unthinkable just a few years ago. The technological leader, Sony was able to command a premium for its wares in the marketplace and refrain from price-cutting, allowing it to keep its profit margins up. While those days may be over, Sony's initial position had won it an enduring following not only among foreign investors, who hold 43 percent of the company's stock, but also among the American buying public. **********To help regain its former stature, Sony, which does 70 percent of its business outside Japan, has a diverse product assortment to offer consumers over the next few years. This includes a modified video cassette recorder with improved sound quality and a camera that can record up to three hours of home movies. **********But the fast pace of technological development, especially in Japan, is diminishing the value of Sony's traditional strength: being first. Although Sony may still be the innovator of the industry, giant Matsushita Electric, considered the I.B.M. of con sumer electronics, appears to have the muscle to dominate any sector it enters. **********So it went with the Betamax. Sony was first to offer a video cassette recorder for home use, in 1975, but Matsushita was soon in the game with its less expensive - and incompatible - VHS format. Matsushita and Japan Victor, of which it owns 52 percent, easily made rapid gains in the market. **********One reason was that the two companies, unlike name-proud Sony, had no qualms about offering their equipment for relabeling and resale by numerous American and European companies, a route that also spared the two VHS producers from marketing, distribution and inventory costs. **********Today, Matsushita, which now controls 17.5 percent of the United States video cassette market, supplies recorders sold under such American brands as General Electric, Magnavox, GTE-Sylvania, J.C. Penney and Curtis Mathes. And VHS systems by all makers hold 70 percent of the market. By contrast, Sony - which supplies equipment to only one American company, Zenith - has seen its share rapidly plunge. (The RCA Corporation is now the biggest presence in the American market, with 22 percent.) **********In addition, the VHS manufacturers kept updating their equipment - with longer playing time, for example. Sony was slow to react as demand for its Betamax slackened. In fact, it kept production going at full speed for almost a year after its competitor had throttled production back to recession levels, in the expectation that its premium product would just naturally regain its market dominance. **********''Unfortunately for Sony, the gamble did not pay off,'' said Darrel E. Whitten, an analyst for Prudential Bache Securities Inc., Tokyo. **********Sony was forced to that conclusion itself last fall, after a disastrous fourth quarter, ended Oct. 31, saw net income dip 85 percent, to $10 million from $66 million in the 1981 period. Revenues also declined, to $1.1 billion last year from $1.2 billion in the previous year. **********The company applied the knife, slashing production of video cassette recorders in November and December to half its capacity, 100,000 units a month. Inventory was shrunk 25 percent, to $1.1 billion. ''That is a very proper level of inventories, about three months worth of sales,'' Mr. Okura said. ''The adjustment is complete.'' **********That Sony did not make this adjustment sooner may reflect corporate thinking that has been lulled by success. **********''Sony is still definitely a growth company,'' insisted Mark Hassenberg, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York. But Mr. Hassenberg believes that it will take some time for Sony's roster of new products to offset the declining profitability of the video cassette recorder business. **********Sony, however, has not given up the fight yet. It still hopes to regain the lead in video cassettes by leapfrogging into the next generation of technology. The device of the future will use eight-millimeter tape rather than the current half-inch width. This is by agreement among more than 100 companies that met last March in an effort to avoid the confusion of formats that developed in the half-inch market. **********Once again, Sony was the front-runner in developing the eight-millimeter device. And industry analysts expect Sony to be the first to market an eight-millimeter video camera and recorder - which they expect eventually to replace the present recorders - possibly as early as 1985. **********Sony may have sacrificed some of its edge in waiting for the standards. But the alternative is one it can no longer consider: Without agreed-on standards, Matsushita once again could effectively set them itself, owing to its heft in the marketplace. In 1982, Matsushita's worldwide sales were $14 billion. **********''The problem with Sony has been Matsushita,'' Michael Connors, an analyst for Jardine Fleming Investment Services Inc., said flatly. **********Sony will try to keep up sales with two new video products, Betamovie and Beta Hi-Fi. The Betamovie is a camera unit, weighing five-and- a-half pounds, that can record more than three hours of home movies, which then may be played back on a Betamax set. Betamovie, which uses conventional half-inch tape, is just coming on the market in Japan and will be introduced in the United States and Europe in the fall. In America, the unit will cost $1,500. Sony says it already has back orders for 30,000 Betamovie sets in Japan. ''We can't keep up with demand,'' Mr. Okura said. **********BUT analysts believe that Betamovie is essentially an interim product, before the eight-millimeter camera and recorder, and given its high price and bulkiness one that will probably have a limited market. **********Beta Hi-Fi, also introduced in the past few months, is a video cassette recorder with improved sound quality selling for $1,500 a set. Matsushita and Victor are expected to respond soon with VHS versions of recorders with enhanced audio performance. **********At the same, Sony has yet another product up its sleeve: the compact audio disk. The 4.7-inch silvery disks are said to produce sound of unusual clarity. The disks employ beams of light, instead of conventional needles, to replay recorded music. Sony developed the product jointly with N.V. Philips of the Netherlands, it was introduced in Japan last October, and sales are running ahead of the early expectations. **********Sony is bringing its compact disk player to market in the United States this summer, with its CDP 101 model priced at $900. The disks will cost about $15 apiece, considerably more than records. Hindering the popularity of the compact disk players at the start will be the shortage of recorded disks. Today, there are 530 titles available and, Sony officials say, there will be 1,000 by the end of this year. To increase the number of titles, CBS/Sony, a joint venture of the two companies, plans to begin manufacturing disks next year at a plant in Terre Haute, Ind. **********Most analysts say that the long- range potential for the disks is huge, since they will probably replace conventional records. Still, there are several Japanese companies that now have disk players of their own. Just how the market will be carved up remains to be seen, analysts stress. **********The same caveat applies to other fields in which Sony has been an innovator. In August 1981, for example, Sony created a stir by announcing an electronic still camera, called Movica, that uses no photographic film. Last April, 20 companies, including Sony, agreed on specifications for the magnetic disk to be used in such electronic cameras. Most analysts agree that this will be a sizable market. But how well Sony will fare against such companies as Canon and Eastman Kodak is uncertain. **********At Sony's Tokyo headquarters, 1983 is a year of ''correction and investment'' that will lay the groundwork for future growth, according to executives there. Despite the profit drop, research and development spending will increase 20 percent this year. Sony's research and development budget, at 8.5 percent of sales, is twice the industry average. ''We're operating this company on a long- term basis,'' said Sumio Sano, a general manager in the executive office. **********For the short term, things have brightened somewhat. The American economic recovery came through with an increase in demand, And in response, Sony has kicked production back up to 250,000 video cassette recorders a month from 150,000 the year before. Sony production this year should reach nearly 2.3 million units, up from 1.9 million in 1982 - although that is not enough to offset Sony's share of a market that is increasing at a much faster pace. **********In any case, Sony's second half will be better than the first half of fiscal 1983 because the inventory correction has been completed. Still, Prudential- Bache estimates that for 1983 Sony's net income worldwide will be off 40 percent, to $115 million, at recent exchange rates. Sony officials see a decline of 35 percent. Whatever the outcome, Sony probably will not be able to surpass its record profit of $289 million, reached in the year ended Oct. 31, 1980, until 1985. **********Some analysts say this may well be a good time to buy Sony's stock, for those investors with patience. They recall that in the late 70's, before the company introduced the Walkman, industry watchers also said that Sony's management had become ingrained and questioned the appeal of its new products. The stock closed Friday at $13.25, unchanged from Thursday's close. During the past year, it has traded in a range from $11 to $17.25. **********''Buy on the weakness would be our recommendation for long-term accounts,'' said Takeshi Tanikawa, general manager of institutional research at the Daiwa Securities Company here. **********But many believe it is time to rethink Sony's image. ''Sony will be in there as a solid competitor in the future,'' said Mr. Whitten of Prudential-Bache. ''But the conventional view of Sony was that it was a high- growth company, and that will change.'' **********AT A GLANCE Sony    All dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data Three months ended April 3019831982 Revenues$1,082,000$1,123,000Net income21,00047,000Earnings per share$0.09$0.20 Year ended Oct. 3119821981 Revenues$4,578,000$4,863,000Net income186,000307,000Earnings per share$0.81$1.34 Main Lines of Business Contribution to 1982 revenues Videotape recorders 27%Television sets 24%Audio equipment 23%Other 11% Total assets, Oct. 31, 1982 $5,042,000Current assets *3,472,000Current liabilities *2,678,000Long-term debt *231,000Stock price, August 12, 1983Y.S.E. consolidated close 13 1/4Stock price, 52-week range 11-17 1/4Employees, Oct. 31, 1982 43,126Headquarters Tokyo"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/05/business/advertising-new-york-magazine-appoints-publisher.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1983-10-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New York Magazine Appoints Publisher", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; New York Magazine Appoints Publisher", "body_text": " **********New York magazine has named Martin Singerman, 56 years old, publisher.

And given the history of U.S. assistance to the Israelis, it is only fair that they be called upon to assist our Marines. **********The St. Louis Post-Dispatch **********Sending in the Marines was a gamble that could only pay off in the original terms of helping to establish a peaceful Lebanon, if indeed that is possible.

And in the course, Lebanon would be even more grievously bloodied than it already has been.

Bee **********The tragic death of more than 200 U.S. Marines and French soldiers emphasize anew the need for the White House to spell out clearly to Congress and the American people just why the Marines are remaining in a dangerous, exposed defensive posture that will inevitably cost more lives. **********The Anniston (Ala.) Star **********Should the Marines remain in Beirut? Only if the situation allows the international force to perform its original function. The Lebanese factions are scheduled to meet in Geneva this week to try for some sort of national reconciliation. If this process begins and seems to hold some hope for peace and unity the Marines should remain and help. If, however, the meeting doesn't take place, or fails in its purpose, the Marines should come home. They can make no contribution during continued civil war in Lebanon. **********The Greensboro (N.C.) Daily News **********If the President does not change course he risks a Vietnam-style commitment. Instead of using the Marines to help carry out his Middle Eastern policy, he may begin to shape his Middle Eastern policy around the Marines. The President can avoid that tragic state by extricating the Marines from Lebanese soil as quickly as it can honorably be done."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/26/business/company-reports-kinark-corp-a.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 26, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "** Company Reports ** KINARK CORP (A)", "print_headline": "** Company Reports ** KINARK CORP (A)", "body_text": " **********Qtr to March 31 1983 1982 Sales 5,458,000 7,506,000 Net inc 108,000 b155,000 Share earns .03  b-Net loss including income of $21,000 from discontinued operations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/11/business/dome-mines.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 76, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dome Mines", "print_headline": "Dome Mines", "body_text": " **********Dome Mines Ltd. sold its 10.1 percent stake in Denison Mines Ltd. on the Toronto Stock Exchange and will receive about $54.5 million from the sale, a company official said. **********He said Dome would use the money to reduce its debt.

Severe Setback for Socialists **********The opposition Social Democrats, who had accused Mr. Kohl of seeking a mandate to station American medium-range missiles in West Germany, suffered what is regarded as their most humiliating setback since 1961, winning only 38.2 percent of the vote for 193 seats. **********The four-year-old Green Party, which favors withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and opposes deployment of any new American missiles in West Germany, won representation in Parliament for the first time, with 5.6 percent of the vote, just above the 5 percent requirement. It will have 27 seats in the house. **********Under the country's proportional representation system, the razorthin success of the Greens prevented the Christian Democrats from winning an absolute majority in Parliament. But, led by the affable Mr. Kohl, the Christian Democrats fell only narrowly short of Konrad Adenauer's majority landslide in 1957, which has never been matched. Parliament's Size Increased **********As a result of the shape of Sunday's vote and the distribution of so-called first and second ballots, the size of the lower house was increased from an originally projected 496 members to 498. It is not unusual for the chamber's size to change this way in the course of an election. **********''Honest politics is persuasive politics,'' said the 52-year-old Mr. Kohl, beaming as his supporters surged around him in the Christian Democrats' Bonn headquarters. ''I can say that our citizens are a lot more clever than many of our politicians.'' **********Later, on national television, Mr. Kohl explained the sweep in these terms: ''The people of our country have put their hopes in the coalition of the middle, that we can turn the economy around. **********''The second thing is that we have a believable politics,'' said the Chancellor, who took office five months ago as a result of a parliamentary switch of allegiances. ''We have only promised what we can deliver. We have spoken the bitter truth.'' **********Hans-Jochen Vogel, the 57-year-old Social Democratic leader, conceded the loss, a harsh reversal for a party that until last fall had governed West Germany for 13 years in coalition with the Free Democrats. **********''This is a defeat,'' said the urbane Mr. Vogel amid the gloom at his party's headquarters. ''As our candidate I am in great measure responsible for this defeat.'' He said that ''massive help'' from West German industrialists had contributed to the Christian Democrats' triumph, as had popular belief that the economy was on the upswing. Coalition to Continue **********For Mr. Kohl the continuation of the coalition with the Free Democrats has considerable advantage. A Christian Democratic majority in Parliament would have made it virtually inevitable that Franz Josef Strauss, the ambitious right-wing Bavarian, would be given the key portfolio of foreign affairs. **********Even so, Mr. Strauss, bolstered by an impressive 60 percent of the popular vote in Bavaria, appeared likely to demand concessions at the expense of the Free Democrats led by Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the Foreign Minister. **********Asked by a reporter in Munich if he was coming to Bonn as a Cabinet minister, Mr. Strauss remarked jokingly: ''I am flying to Bonn tomorrow.'' But neither he nor Mr. Kohl allowed himself to be drawn into discussions about what promise to be difficult Cabinetbuilding talks in the days ahead. **********Though the issue of stationing a new generation of medium-range missiles played an important role in the campaign, opinion polls and other indicators suggested that the sharp swing to the Christian Democrats had grown largely out of a conviction that the conservative coalition could stimulate business confidence and economic growth. Unemployment at Record Level **********Both the Christian Democrats and the Free Democrats told voters that a return of the Social Democrats to power, most likely in coalition with the Greens, would cause panic among industrialists and lead to a big increase in unemployment, which now stands at a record 2.5 million. Peter Glotz, the Social Democrats' party secretary, charged angrily Sunday night that businessmen had put pressure on their employees to vote for the coalition. **********The extent of the Christian Democrats' victory was suggested by returns from the the industrial heartland of the Ruhr, where Mr.  Kohl's party outpolled the Social Democrats, usually the strongest party there. The Infas polling organization said that nationwide some two million voters who normally supported the Social Democrats had switched to Mr. Kohl's party. **********The Social Democrats, who dropped 4.7 points from their 42.9 percent of the popular vote in the 1980 elections, were handicapped by Mr. Vogel's relative obscurity at the center stage of national politics. The former Justice Minister was named as his party's candidate for chancellor only last October after Helmut Schmidt's Government was toppled. **********Mr. Schmidt was returned to Parliament Sunday from his Hamburg district with 55.6 percent of the vote. Election Post-Mortems **********In the aftermath of the election defeat, some Social Democrats suggested that their party had too openly flirted with the anti-NATO Greens, by hinting during the campaign that a coalition with them was thinkable. Georg Leber, a former Social Democratic Defense Minister, said Sunday night that Mr. Vogel's campaign had ''fully miscarried'' because he had failed to separate the party from the Greens. **********Despite their reputation as defenders of farmers, forests and rivers, the Greens polled their greatest number of votes among young people in big cities. One analysis indicated that they had drawn about 8 percent of the vote in metropolitan centers and half that in small towns and rural areas. **********As the early returns filtered in Sunday night, it appeared that the Greens would slip below the 5 percent level needed for representation in Parliament, giving the Christian Democrats an absolute majority. Angrily, Otto Schilly, a Green leader, declared to cheers from followers that ''extraparliamentary activity is more important to us than parliamentary activity.'' Drive Against Missiles Planned **********But when computer projections showed the young party stabilizing at above 5 percent, Green spokesmen announced that they would use their platform in Parliament to campaign against the planned stationing of American missiles here starting at the end of this year. **********After having been excluded from a pre-election television debate with major party leaders, the Greens were welcomed Sunday night to participate in a post-election discussion that included Mr. Kohl, Mr. Genscher and Willy Brandt, the Social Democratic party leader. **********Representing the Greens at the roundtable talk, Rainer Trampert, who was elected from Hamburg, said his party had a ''mandate'' to oppose the stationing of the missiles in what he called ''this year of decision.'' **********On the same program, Chancellor Kohl said that his next government would lend its ''trust and European support'' to the United States so that it could come to an agreement in the Geneva arms limitation talks with the Soviet Union that would ''make peace with fewer weapons.'' Shift in U.S. Stance Sought **********Throughout the campaign, the Christian Democrats and the Free Democrats supported, though without vehemence, the necessity to station Pershing 2 and cruise missiles in West Germany if the Geneva talks remain stalemated. The Social Democrats, by contrast, demanded that the Reagan Administration respond to what they called Soviet ''concessions'' at Geneva. **********President Reagan was reported Sunday night to have telephoned Mr.  Kohl and, in an eight-minute conversation, to have congratulated him on his victory. **********After deserting Mr. Schmidt's coalition in September, the Free Democrats fell in popularity to a record low, and throughout the campaign the small swing party fought for its political existence.  Its performance today was its second worst since West Germany held its first national elections in 1949. **********Mr. Genscher's party appeared to have collected votes Sunday from Christian Democrats and others who wanted to prevent Mr. Strauss from becoming Foreign Minister, and others who support its rightist economic policies. **********According to the provisional results, 89.1 per cent of the country's 43.4 million eligible voters over the age of 18 cast ballots - the third highest turnout in the nation's history."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/17/business/norpac-exploration-services-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-nov-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NORPAC EXPLORATION SERVICES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 30", "print_headline": "NORPAC EXPLORATION SERVICES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/19/world/us-beirut-embassy-bombed-33-reported-killed-80-hurt-pro-iran-sect-admits-action.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1983-04-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1210, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "33 REPORTED KILLED, 80 HURT; PRO-IRAN SECT ADMITS ACTION", "print_headline": "U.S. BEIRUT EMBASSY BOMBED; 33 REPORTED KILLED, 80 HURT; PRO-IRAN SECT ADMITS ACTION", "body_text": " **********A bomb exploded in the American Embassy in Beirut today, killing at least 33 people and wounding more than 80 others. **********Both the Lebanese police and American officials said there was evidence suggesting that the explosion may have been caused by a car packed with TNT driven up to the embassy's front door and detonated in an suicide attack. **********A secretive pro-Iranian Moslem group called the Islamic Jihad Organization said it was responsible for the bombing, in a telephone statement to the Beirut office of Agence France-Presse. The same group said it was responsible for the grenade attack against a group of American marines on March 16 in which five men were wounded. **********Precise Cause Still Unconfirmed **********The precise cause of the explosion, as well as final casualty figures, will not be confirmed until rescue workers finish clearing away the ruins of the eight-story embassy. Most of the center part of the horseshoe-shaped structure collapsed from the blast in a grotesque avalanche of concrete chunks, pieces of office furniture and dead bodies. Rooms in the other sections of the seafront embassy were either gutted by fire or torn apart by flying steel and bricks. **********Civil defense workers guarded by a ring of United States marines from the multinational peacekeeping force worked through the night under floodlights to pull away the rubble in search of more bodies and clues to the explosion. Many Casualties Were Lebanese **********Most of those killed or wounded were Lebanese members of the embassy staff, pedestrians on the fashionable Mediterranean esplanade that runs in front of the American mission and Lebanese civilians who were packed into the groundfloor consular office applying for visas to visit the United States. **********However, among the 33 people reported dead by the state-run Beirut radio were two United States Marine guards and some diplomats. Other American diplomatic staff may still be buried under the debris along with an undetermined number of Lebanese, police sources said. **********(In Washington, Administration officials said that so far, there were six Americans known dead and two others missing and presumed dead.) **********The American Ambassador, Robert S. Dillon, was in his eighth floor office when the explosion tore through the embassy at 1:05 P.M., just as many staff members were sitting down for lunch in the cafeteria, which was completely destroyed. The Ambassador managed to escape safely through a back set of stairs, as did almost everyone else who walked out alive. The American envoys, Philip C. Habib and Morris Draper, were at the Presidential Palace in Baabda when the explosion hit. **********Wearing a purple warm-up jacket and a red T-shirt, the American Ambassador explained to reporters outside the gutted embassy how he got out alive, suffering only minor cuts. **********''I was standing in my office with my telephone in one hand and a T-shirt in the other, getting ready to go out for my afternoon jog,'' Mr. Dillon said. ''All of sudden there was an explosion and my office collapsed. I couldn't move. **********''My secretary and deputy Robert Pugh came in and pulled the rubble off of me,'' the Ambassador said. ''We crawled through an open window, around the ledge to the back and then down the stairs.'' **********Asked how a bomb could be placed in the always tightly guarded driveway of the embassy, where only the Ambassador's armor-plated limousine is allowed to enter, Mr. Dillon said he could only speculate that a car packed with explosives crashed through the checkpoint at the end of the driveway and into the entrance. Unlike other American embassies in dangerous locations, the Beirut mission is not guarded by any substantial outer wall. Visitors just walk past a Lebanese Army checkpoint, up the driveway and into the main lobby. **********The explosion shook all of West Beirut, spewing glass and metal in all directions and breaking windows up to a mile away. A Navy medical officer from the United States Navy ship Guadalcanal, which was resting off the Beirut coast about five miles out to sea, said his entire ship ''shuddered'' from the blast tremor. **********All of the cars parked around the embassy were blown apart, with fenders, hubcabs and license plates coming to rest 50 yards away. A tree in front of the American mission was cut in half by a piece of flying metal, while a nearby traffic light was melted by the heat of the explosion. 'A Flash and Fireball' **********''I saw a flash and fireball shoot up into the sky,'' said a United States Navy seaman, Michel Paridom, from Doylestown, Ohio, who was walking toward the embassy when the blast occurred. ''I knew immediately what happened.'' **********The brunt of the blast went straight upward, bringing down the eight stories in the central portion of the building on top of one another like a fallen house of cards. The entryway where the Marine guards have their main sentry post was obliterated by the falling rubble, and the always crowded counselor section next to it was gutted by a ball of fire. **********''I was in the political section,'' said an embassy secretary, Catherine Nylund, wiping away streams of blood from cuts on her cheeks. ''All I know is a bomb went off and things started to fly in every direction.'' **********''One of the men near me - he was new from Washington and I don't know who he was - got hit with a piece of flying metal,'' she continued, with a stunned look in her eyes. ''He had a severe head wound, and I am not sure what happened to him. We started to walk out and saw that some of the floor was just gone. A marine in a flak jacket helped me out the back.'' Relatives of Missing Gather **********Friends and relatives of people believed to be inside the embassy gathered around the building, wrestling with Lebanese Army soldiers who tried to prevent them from getting near the burning structure to search for their loved ones. The more hysterical among them stood about screaming the names of their missing family members, while others leaned against a wall, gripping handkerchiefs or a purse and weeping silently. **********Lebanon's President, Amin Gemayel, came to the smoldering embassy two hours after the blast and walked through the ruins discussing the rescue operation with Col. James Mead of the Marines, the commander of the American peacekeeping unit in Lebanon, who was helping to supervise the cleanup. **********President Gemayel also sent a message to President Reagan saying he was ''deeply grieved by the criminal act perpetrated against'' the American Embassy. **********The Lebanese President, clearly concerned that the bombing might raise an outcry in Congress to pull out the 1,300 United States marines stationed in Beirut, added in his message that ''those responsible for this crime have united in death innocent Lebanese and American citizens and have strengthened the determination of our two countries to continue to work together in restoring unity, freedom and independence to this tortured land.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/30/business/market-placevartanig-g-vartan-fund-s-success-spurs-growth.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 693, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market PlaceVartanig G.

Currently, he is very keen, too, on regional banks and savings and loan associations. **********In a telephone interview yesterday, the 39-year- old Mr. Lynch discussed the strategies behind his giant Boston-based fund, which owns more than 700 stocks. His views are of more than passing interest to investors, thanks to Magellan's record. For the year ended June 30, the fund's total return - market appreciation plus dividends and capital gains reinvested - more than doubled. **********Moreover, its total return for the five years ended June 30 amounted to 582 percent, the best showing among all 530 domestic equity funds monitored by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. Only two mutual funds of any type topped that performance and both stress investments in gold. They were United Services Gold Shares, with a total return of 644 percent, and Strategic Investments, showing a total return of 636 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had a total return of 129 percent over the same time span. **********Magellan's performance record has proved a remarkable spur to its growth, including contributions from Keogh plans and Individual Retirement Accounts. Net assets totaled $230 million last Sept. 30, when the portfolio contained 275 stocks. By March 21 of this year, when Magellan owned 547 issues, assets had swelled to $821 million and, as of the middle of this year, assets reached $1.29 billion. The current total is $1.34 billion. **********Although Magellan is popularly regarded as a growth fund, it actually incorporates several investment philosophies. This, in effect, provides a cushion when particular sectors turn downward, as technology and small-company growth stocks have done since June. **********''Part of the fund represents a growth orientation,'' Mr. Lynch said, ''but other parts reflect cyclical stocks, as well as special situations and companies with undervalued assets.'' **********Heavy inflows of money create problems for the fund, which carries a sales charge of 3 percent. At Magellan the solution is to plow 75 percent of its equity money into 200 stocks and to distribute the remainder in more than 500 issues. **********As for Chrysler, Mr. Lynch said: ''I still think it's a $50 stock within the next 12 to 18 months.'' His original play in Chrysler encompassed the common stock, preferred stock and bonds of the nation's third-largest automobile maker. He has taken long-term profits in the bonds and increased holdings in the common and preferred issues. **********Meanwhile, in other industries, the portfolio manager has added to holdings in the Ethyl Corporation, Monsanto and PPG Industries in chemicals. Earlier this year, the fund raised its stake in foreign stocks and a recent newcomer in chemicals was Montecatini Edison, an Italian company. **********Elsewhere, the fund has built a substantial position in Ryder System. Because of Magellan's own rapid growth, portfolio newcomers and additions to existing positions tend to be the norm. However, it has sold Prime Computer and greatly reduced holdings of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Inco. ''We sold Inco too soon,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''The same goes for Resorts International, where we showed a profit of 30 percent but missed the easy part, which was the next 50 percent.'' **********In terms of broader strategy, the fund has cut back holdings in consumer nondurable stocks recently, while significantly expanding its exposure to regional banks and savings and loan issues. The latter now account for 12.5 percent of the equity portfolio as the largest single category, substantially bigger than, say, the 7.1 percent in office and building equipment. In the latter category, however, the position in International Business Machines has been expanded. **********Banks, both big and small, now account for some 100 issues in the portfolio. Many of Mr. Lynch's favorites here are regional banks, where low earnings multiples are one attraction. Portfolio newcomers among the regionals include Meridian Bancorp, PNC Financial, Ameritrust Corporation, Corestates Financial and First Kentucky National."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/30/business/a-new-polymer-process-at-dupont.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Lueck", "pub_date": "1983-08-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 630, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A NEW POLYMER PROCESS AT DUPONT", "print_headline": "A NEW POLYMER PROCESS AT DUPONT", "body_text": " **********The Du Pont Company said yesterday that it had discovered a new process for manufacturing polymers, the molecular building blocks for plastics, paints and synthetic fibers. It said it expects to use the process in manufacturing new automotive finishes that could be brought to market within two years. **********The company said its polymer process could also be used to improve the quality of plastics, fibers and other products. At the same time, it said the technology would enable its scientists to search for entirely new synthetic substances. **********''It is clearly too early to tell how broad the commercial applications will be, but we are convinced that this is an important scientific advancement,'' said Charles Bottomley, research director for E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company's research and development department. **********Jay Meltzer of Goldman, Sachs agreed that because of the large number of products that Du Pont makes with polymers, a more advanced production technique ''could ultimately be a big plus.'' But he cautioned that the new process was ''going to take many years to roll out.'' **********First Major Change in 20 Years **********Polymers are long strands of molecules that are linked to form synthetic substances. They are sometimes likened by chemists to freight trains in which the cars are changed to produce different payloads. Synthetic polymers were first used in the early 1930's with the commercial introduction of nylon and since then have been used to manufacture a wide range of other products. **********Mr. Bottomley said the new process, which has been under development at Du Pont's laboratories since 1979, ''represents the first important change'' in the way polymers are manufactured in more than 20 years. The company said its process gives it increased control in linking specific molecules, and therefore enables it to produce polymer chains that are at the same time more uniform and more complex than ever before. **********''It means we can pursue complex polymeric structures that heretofore only existed on paper,'' said Richard Quisenberry, a director of research and development at Du Pont. **********He added that ''the odds are long'' that the new process will produce ''an entirely new substance with big commercial potential.'' Instead, he said, Du Pont expects the process to be used to improve the quality of existing products. **********The company said the automotive finishes it hopes to make with the new polymer process would require less solvent - the chemical agent that keeps paint in a liquid form - than finishes now available. **********Reduction of Energy Costs **********Mr. Bottomley said automobile manufacturers would benefit because of a reduction in their energy costs for baking away solvents to dry the car finish. And because solvents become a pollutant when they dissolve into the air, the new auto finishes would lessen environmental problems, he added. **********Du Pont said it has begun construction of a pilot plant to produce the new auto finishes in Philadelphia. It added that the plant would be in operation by the end of this year. **********During the first half of 1983 Du Pont said its polymer products generated sales of $1.65 billion, or 9 percent of its $17.5 billion in total revenues. It said the polymer products contributed operating income of $91 million in the six-month period. **********Du Pont's other major businesses include the production of a wide range of chemicals that do not contain polymers and the oil and natural gas operations it obtained through its acquisition of Conoco Inc. in 1982. Over all, its net income for the first half of the year declined 4.6 percent, to $474 million, or $1.98 a share, from $497 million, or $2.09 a share.

The groups recommended that Panama, Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela, the countries in the Contadora Group, be asked to observe the discussions. . **********The president of the Nicaraguan Episcopal Conference, Bishop Pablo Antonio Vega, also called last week for national discussions ''to seek answers to internal social and economic problems.'' **********Free Election Sought **********In a visit to Nicaragua last Thursday, President Reagan's special envoy for Central America, Richard B. Stone, reportedly urged the Sandinistas to reach an accord with their adversaries.  Under the Social Christian plan, negotiations between the Sandinista Government and the opposition would be aimed at calling a free election for a national assembly in November 1984 ''with the technical assistance of the Contadora countries and/or the Organization of American States.''

He said the Law of Emergency was necessary ''while we confront a dirty, undeclared imperialist war and an imminent invasion.''  Proposals 'Must Be Rejected' **********Eli Altamirano, who heads the Nicaraguan Communist Party, told Nuevo Diario that it was impossible for the Government to reach an agreement with ''enemies of the revolution, some of whom act in the political arena and others who carry weapons in the mercenary army financed by the United States Government.'' **********The third pro-Sandinista political leader quoted in the Nuevo Diario report, Cesar Delgadillo Machado, said the Government ''cannot negotiate with domestic reactionaries who have clandestine links to the counterrevolution, the C.I.A. and the traitors.'' **********''Reconciliation between classes in conflict is never possible,'' he said. **********The Sandinista Government has given no official response to last week's proposals. According to Western diplomats, the proposals coincided with efforts by the Contadora Group to press the Nicaraguan Government to accept some form of dialogue with its adversaries.

But he rejected suggestions that the Sandinistas should negotiate with armed groups that are fighting to bring down the Government.  ''We have nothing to negotiate with mercenaries, who are artificial forces created by the United States,'' Mr. Ortega declared. **********The leader of the Social Christian Party, Agustin Jarquin Anaya, said in an interview that the statements published today in Nuevo Diario were ''extremely radical,'' but that he was encouraged that no such condemnations have been heard directly from Sandinista leaders or from the official Sandinista newspaper, Barricada. **********''We are still hopeful that the Sandinista leadership will try to resolve the political situation within the Contadora framework,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/20/world/begin-is-reported-planning-to-meet-with-reagan-july-27.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Begin Is Reported Planning To Meet With Reagan July 27", "print_headline": "Begin Is Reported Planning To Meet With Reagan July 27", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Menachem Begin told his Cabinet today that he had been invited to a meeting with President Reagan on July 27, the Israeli radio quoted Cabinet sources as saying. **********Mr. Begin, whose talks in Washington are expected to include a possible redeployment of Israeli forces in Lebanon, said he planned Monday to accept the invitation, the radio said.

But over all, the recession continued to exact a heavy toll on earnings. **********Leading the retreat were cyclical industries such as automobiles, energy, steel, chemicals and building products. (The full list appears on page D14.) **********Oil companies - battered by oversupply worldwide and consequent lower prices - were the hardest hit. Of the 24 energy concerns on the list, 22 showed declines in net income from the 1981 quarter, ranging from 3 percent at the Standard Oil Company (Ohio) to 99 percent at the Occidental Petroleum Corporation. **********Chemical producers, especially those with extensive international holdings, also were hurt as the dollar gained strength. Of the 19 companies listed in this category, only 4 managed to increase their earnings. Earnings of the three largest chemical concerns set the mood: Du Pont's net fell 38 percent, Dow Chemical's plunged 81 precent and Union Carbide's 78 percent. **********Many industry experts remain pessimistic about the earnings outlook for the basic cyclical industries. But the communication, electronic and pharmaceutical industries will continue to show strength, the experts predict. **********''I don't believe earnings in the first quarter of 1983 for cyclical companies will show major gains,'' said Stephen Weisglass, president of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. ''However, the quarterto-quarter comparison on technology companies, such as telecommunications, business systems and consumer electronics, will show strong advances,'' he said. **********David Saks, pharmaceutical analyst at A.G. Becker, said, ''the drug industry had a strong fourth quarter, with results at record levels.'' The current quarter, he said, should be another good one for the industry. But he cautioned that two companies would be exceptions: Johnson & Johnson, because it will continue to feel the impact of the Tylenol tragedy, and Upjohn, because of its depressed chemical operations. **********Richard Scott-Ram, vice president and economist at Chemical Bank, said, ''Corporate profits have been recovering since the first quarter of 1982, well before the overall economy started to recover.'' **********He said the industries currently recovering are housing, including appliances, furniture and construction materials; autos, including steel, rubber, and chemicals and plastics, and military-related industries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/04/business/g-w-in-talks-on-sale-of-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 168, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.&W. in Talks On Sale of Unit", "print_headline": "G.&W. in Talks On Sale of Unit", "body_text": " **********Alexander N.

He served as head of Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion's office from 1952 to 1963.  President Navon is scheduled to see Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Tuesday and President Reagan on Wednesday in Washington, then meet with leaders of American Jewish groups, A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, and mayors and other officials in visits to Baltimore, Boston and New York. **********The tour, which is scheduled to last nearly two weeks, comes against the background of a feud within the Labor Party between its present leader, Shimon Peres, who has lost twice to Mr. Begin, and his main rival, former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. **********Consequently Mr. Navon is being looked to by many Laborites as their party's best hope in elections that Israeli political analysts think that Mr. Begin may call sometime this year. Mr. Navon's presidential term ends this spring, and he is reportedly being pressed by some politicians to decide within a month or so to seek the chairmanship of the Labor Party and thus head its list of candidates. Possible Effect of Inquiry **********There are so many imponderables in this that experienced Israeli politicians and journalists are split on what is likely to happen.  Practically the only prediction that gains wide adherence is that Mr. Begin will call new elections if the state commission of inquiry finds that he and other officials were remiss in asking Lebanese Christian Phalangists last September to enter Beirut refugee camps, where the Phalangists killed hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children. **********Aides to the Prime Minister expect him to say, in effect, ''Let the people judge,'' and go to the polls. The commission's findings are expected in February, the same month that President Navon is due to make his plans known. **********After the Beirut killings, Mr. Navon made a public statement condemning the deaths, expressing sorrow to all the families of the victims and calling for a commission of inquiry, which Mr. Begin at first opposed. ''We must not pass on to business as usual,'' Mr.  Navon said. ''We have an obligation to ourselves, to our self-image, as well as to that part of the civilized world to which we feel we belong, to find out quickly and exactly what happened.'' Call for Calm in '81 Campaign **********In the election campaign of 1981, Mr. Navon spoke out for calm and tolerance among Jews of varied ethnic backgrounds, who were clashing at Labor Party rallies. Tension between Sephardim, Jews mostly from the Middle East and North Africa, and Ashkenazim, Jews with European backgrounds, have remained high. Some politicians think that Mr.  Navon's Sephardic origins could help Labor cut into Mr. Begin's substantial support among Sephardic voters. **********Other analysts express doubts, noting that Sephardim have not tended to vote for Sephardic candidates and that Mr. Navon's background would not make him a model for recent Sephardic immigrants. Mr. Navon is regarded as an aristocratic Sephardi; his family has been here for many generations. His father's family, originally from Spain, fled to Turkey and then settled in Jerusalem more than 300 years ago. His mother, born in Morocco, was brought to Jerusalem as a child in 1884. **********He has no real experience in raw political fights, and some Israelis who have known him for many years doubt that he will jump into a fight for the Labor Party leadership. He has indicated in recent conversations that he prefers to wait for a summons from Mr.  Peres and Mr. Rabin; Israeli political reporters are split on whether the two might step aside for Mr. Navon. **********Finally, there is the question of whether a Navon-led Labor slate would have a chance against a Begin-led Likud bloc. A good deal of Mr. Navon's attractiveness has been fostered by his aloofness from the contentious issues facing the country, and even some of his admirers wonder how he will look if he has to choose sides on such matters as Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, further Jewish settlement there and the complex economic problems facing Israel."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/25/business/general-defense-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-jan-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 83, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GENERAL DEFENSE CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 31", "print_headline": "GENERAL DEFENSE CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/28/world/3-die-in-south-african-mine.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 28, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "3 Die in South African Mine", "print_headline": "3 Die in South African Mine", "body_text": " **********A rock slide killed 3 miners, left 2 missing and injured 57 others at the West Driefontein gold mine near Johannesburg today, officials said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/21/business/at-t-s-net-income-rises-10.5.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1983-07-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 406, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A.T.& T.'S NET INCOME RISES 10.5%", "print_headline": "A.T.& T.'S NET INCOME RISES 10.5%", "body_text": " **********The American Telephone and Telegraph Company yesterday reported a 10.5 percent increase in its second-quarter earnings and announced a further cutback of operations at the Western Electric Company, its manufacturing arm. **********A.T.&T. said its net income rose in the three months ended June 30, to $1.93 billion, from $1.75 billion a year earlier. The earnings per share declined, however, to $2.03 from $2.04, because the number of shares increased 11.5 percent. **********The latest quarter's results included a $96.5 million one-time charge against earnings to account for a consolidation of Western Electric's distribution and repair operations. That was more than offset by a restoration of $217 million from a reduction in the Pacific Telephone and Telepraph Company's back tax liability, stemming from a resolution of a long dispute involving the company, the Internal Revenue Service and the State of California. Some Operations to Close **********Not counting those two changes, A.T.&T.'s net income for the quarter would have increased 3.6 percent, to $1.81 billion, and the per share figure would have declined to $1.90. **********Western Electric announced that it would close some distribution and repair operations in seven states during the rest of 1983. The move will eliminate 830 jobs, although the company said some employees might be transferred or retire rather than be laid off. **********The move is part of an effort to improve efficiency and factory utilization to prepare for the breakup of A.T.&T. next Jan. 1. After that, Western Electric will have to become more competitive because the local Bell operating companies will no longer be part of A.T.&T. **********In addition to yesterday's cutback, Western Electric earlier this year announced a series of plant closings that will eventually eliminate 11,000 jobs. Slow Economy Is Reflected **********A.T.&T.'s slow earnings growth reflected the nation's sluggish economy. Revenues grew 8.3 percent, to $17.5 billion, from $16.1 billion. Long-distance calling grew only 2.5 percent although WATS use increased 22.1 percent. The number of telephone lines in use grew by 180,000, in contrast to a decrease of 70,000 lines in the second quarter of 1982. **********''In earnings, as in other aspects of our operations, this is a time of transition for A.T.&T.,'' Charles L. Brown, the chairman, said in a statement. ''Indeed, we have a couple of difficult years ahead of us.

Y et serious research efforts on exotic non-nuclear methods of d efense, such as lasers, have been proceeding steadily, if slowly, f or years. **********Although there is no certainty yet about specific technologies, the aerospace industry is poised to move ahead if Congress ever follows the President's advice. Some of the biggest names in the industry - Lockheed, TRW and Rockwell International - have already won laser defense contracts. **********Any space defense against a missile attack would almost certainly be built around a laser. A highly focused beam of light that could engage its targets at the speed of light, a laser could proceed from one target to another seemingly instantaneously. Particle-beam weapons are the other possibility. These direct highly accelerated and concentrated streams of charged particles, such as electrons, but they have received less research attention because they are slower, less easily concentrated, and are subject to disruption by the earth's magnetic field. **********''The President didn't specify the technology,'' said Edward Teller, an atomic scientist who played a leading role in in the development of the atom and the hydrogen bombs. ''He was talking about a whole new direction: defense rather than retaliation.'' **********A defensive laser weapon in space would destroy attacking missiles in the first few minutes after they were launched. Once it detected their heat trails, identified their purpose and tracked them, it would orient its focusing mirror and aim an intense energy that would melt, burn, or deflect them. But the action would have to be very fast. Each laser weapon would need to engage several hundred missiles in a full-scale attack and it could devote only a few seconds to each, meaning that military personnel would have to delegate decision-making to the weapon's computer. **********Despite the doubts of many notable scientists who are not participating in the work, the researchers say that a limited, startup laser system could be deployed before the end of the century. Such a first-generation system might cost as much as $100 billion, according to a Pentagon estimate. **********Most of the research activity in laser weaponry is both classified and proprietary. Companies that potentially will be leading contractors barely acknowledge their interest, much less their capital investments and lobbying efforts in the laser area. **********But the Department of Defense already has spent about $2 billion explicitly on devising laser weapons. About a third has been directed to space-based laser weapon spending. Much of that fraction has been devoted to three projects - ''the triad'' - administered by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. **********Two of the three projects have been led by the Lockheed Corporation, of Sunnyvale, Calif. These are known as ''Talon Gold,'' an experiment in high-precision tracking and pointing, and ''Lode,'' an attempt to build a large mirror for focusing the light produced by chemical lasers. The third project, ''Alpha,'' involves research into chemical lasers and is being led by TRW Inc. at Redondo Beach, Calif. **********A list of companies involved in laser-related research and development would read like an aerospace industry roll call. But several stand out by virtue of previous laser-related work performed for the Defense Department. In terms of funds already received, the ''top four'' contractors, said Pentagon spokesman Jack Powers, are TRW, Rockwell International, Hughes Aircraft and Lockheed. **********Fred Kittler, an analyst with the First Albany Corporation, notes that Lockheed, TRW, Perkin-Elmer and the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory are known in the trade as the ''gang of four'' because of aggressive lobbying efforts, several years ago, that helped inspire Congressional supporters of ballistic-missile defense. **********Other contractors include Avco, United Technologies, Westinghouse, Itek, Corning, Eastman Kodak, Boeing, Northrop, Ford Aerospace and Martin Marietta. **********A related set of players in laser research, with space weapons as the most likely application, are laboratories - national laboratories such as Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore and university facilities such as the High-Energy Physics Laboratory at Stanford and the Draper Laboratory, which is informally associated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Some receive their funding from non-Pentagon sources, such as the Department of Energy, or from defense budgets other than those explicitly devoted to laser weapons. Also, some can independently contract out work to private companies. **********The Defense Department has requested $526 million - a 22 percent rise - for laser research in the fiscal year 1984, and it now expects to request $591.5 million for the following year. But the executive committee named by Secretary of Defense Caspar W.  Weinberger on April 1 to study the President's call for an enlarged commitment could recommend a major revision of these figures. **********The secretive nature of the work has led some prominent researchers, such as physicist Lowell Wood, head of the special studies group at Lawrence Livermore, to decry the ''muzzling effect of overclassification.'' They say that open discussion of their ideas would aid public involvement and benefit the research, but they must remain silent. However, potential subcontractors, makers of specific devices or subsystems, as well as consultants are at least willing to disclose, albeit in general terms only, what they do for lasers. **********For example, the Ball Corporation's aerospace systems division in Boulder, Colo., makes electro-optical devices that could guide and control space-based lasers. And it produces electromechanical positioning devices that would control the optical controllers. It has designed mirrors for laser application and it makes a military television system that could be used to relay damage-assessment data back to the laser weapon. At W.J. Schafer Associates of McLean, Va., the products are mostly analyses running the gamut of laser options. **********Despite all the efforts, many informed scientists and engineers - such as Richard Garwin, a research fellow at the I.B.M. Research Center, Wolfgang Panofsky, director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, and Kosta Tsipis, director of the Program in Science and Technology for International Security at M.I.T. - say they are convinced that a laser weapon would not only be very expensive and politically destabilizing, but that it simply would not work. It is vulnerable, easily countered and of limited effectiveness. **********For example, the Russians could build rockets with reflective materials or launch them with a spin so that the laser would have to burn a ring, instead of a hole, in its surface, a feat that would require up to 10 times more energy. They could build mirrors in their rocket fields to ''blind'' the laser, or force it to deplete itself on decoys. Even Dr. Teller, one of the science community's foremost advocates of ballistic-missile defense, acknowledges the problem. **********''I'm convinced,'' Dr. Teller said in an interview, ''that to put up a system of laser-equipped satellites to destroy incoming Soviet missiles would take much more money than the Soviets need spend to counter it.'' **********But a more basic objection is what many scientists see as the system's impossible need for perfection. Anything less, they insist, would invite a pre-emptive strike, or surprise attack, by the Soviet Union. **********''It's an all-or-nothing proposition,'' Dr. Panofsky said. The Russians could launch some 10,000 nuclear warheads and even if only a few pierced the shield, it would mean disaster. And each ''kill'' could only be scored through unprecedented accuracy from thousands of miles away. As Dr. Tsipis points out, a laser must hit its target in order to destroy it, unlike conventional and nuclear weapons that merely have to explode nearby. **********But some researchers see value not only in less-than-perfect performance, but even in minimal laser-defense systems. Charles Brau, director of the Free-Electron Laser Program at Los Alamos National Laboratory, says that they could in fact be strategically stabilizing. ''A defense that could shoot down some Soviet missiles,'' he said, ''would insure that some of ours - enough to assure retaliation - would survive. The value of a Soviet pre-emptive strike would be gone. Thus, even if we never get from here to the Holy Grail, there's room for progress in-between.'' **********John Rather, a physicist and vice president of D.E.S.E. Research and Engineering in Arlington, Va., says that a ground-based system would relieve many of the concept's problems, such as reliability. It could cut the needed weight in orbit substantially and eliminate the need for fuel in orbit. ''It would be an important short-cut to optimal capability,'' he says. **********But there are still doubts about the system, whether it is in space or on earth, powered by chemical or free-electron lasers, or some dark-horse alternative (such as X-rays pumped by nuclear explosives, a highly classified option being studied at Lawrence Livermore), and even if effectiveness is achievable. **********Wallace Henderson, vice president for systems integration at the BDM Corporation, a technology consulting company in McLean, Va., talks of the ''opportunity costs'' of building such systems. ''Even under the most optimistic conditions,'' he says, ''they wouldn't be operational until the late 1990's. Such a massive long-term commitment, and the diversion of technical talent, might well eliminate projects that address current shortages and shorter-term payoffs.'' **********Congressional supporters of the concept, such as Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, and Representative Kenneth Kramer, Republican of Colorado, hope for the equivalent of the Manhattan Project, the collaboration that produced the first atomic bomb. But opponents, such as Senator Daniel Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, dismiss it as ''yet another generation of destructive weapons.'' **********Mr. Henderson predicts that the effort will be somewhere inbetween: ''not a 'Manhattan Project,' but increased funding.'' In any case, Dr. Teller and Dr. Rather are strongly urging politicians to specify research and development on a broad range of alternatives and not commit the country, full-speed-ahead, to expedient but inappropriate technologies. **********Whether the research effort will make a difference in the strategic balance, or whether it will comprise a harmless but interesting rationale for maintaining the level of defense spending, remains to be seen. Yet if it turns out that ballistic-missile defense only beclouds arms-control efforts, it is perhaps a cloud with a silver lining. ''Even if we never put a single laser weapon in orbit,'' says Carolyn Meinel, a space-systems consultant based in Tucson, Ariz., ''the significant thing is that the President is talking about a whole new strategy. It's different from 'more nuclear warheads.' '' **********ZAPPING MISSILES IN SPACE WARS **********Laser is an acronym for ''light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.'' It is a method of first inducing ''coherent'' light waves - of identical frequency that move in nearperfect synchronization - and then focusing them into beams millions of times more intense than ordinary light. **********A laser's effectiveness as a weapon - its ability to melt, burn a hole through, or fracture a target from afar - depends on the amount of energy it can deliver and on the ease with which a mirror can focus the beam on a target. **********But some lasers can be more sharply focused than others. Chemical lasers, known as long-wave-length lasers, are in the most advanced state of development but are considered less applicable as weapons than newer laser types, such as free-electron, or short-wavelength, lasers. **********Robert Center, vice president for research at Mathematical Sciences Northwest, a unit of Spectra Physics, stresses the relative ease of building a mirror that would focus a short-wavelength laserbeam to a greater intensity on its target. Long-wavelength lasers would require much larger mirrors in orbit to achieve the same effect; some critics, such as Kosta Tsipis of M.I.T., say such mirrors are beyond present capabilities. **********Another advantage of short-wavelength lasers, says John D.G.  Rather, vice president of D.E.S.E. Research and Engineering, is that they are more energy-efficient. A chemical laser is intrinsically limited to efficiencies of under 5 percent - that is, more than 95 percent of its energy is wasted -and thus requires large amounts of fuel in orbit. A free-electron laser, by contrast, could achieve efficiencies as high as 50 percent. **********But even though researchers say that their knowledge of shortwavelength lasers is still ''primitive'' - primarily, they say, because of limitations in funding - they are optimistic. For one thing, they say progress has been steady. Charles Brau, director of the Free-Electron Laser Program at Los Alamos National Laboratory, reports that a tenfold improvement in efficiency was achieved in the past year. Further, work already done on less-easily applied lasers would not have been wasted. ''The laser itself would only be one small part of the whole system,'' says Dr. Brau. ''Most of the funds would have to be spent on pointing and focusing the beam and on 'battle management' - the coordination of multiple lasers and targets.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/29/world/sandinist-official-calls-reagan-charges-absurd.html": {"writer_name": "Marlise Simons", "pub_date": "1983-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 647, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SANDINIST OFFICIAL CALLS REAGAN CHARGES ABSURD", "print_headline": "SANDINIST OFFICIAL CALLS REAGAN CHARGES ABSURD", "body_text": " **********The Nicaraguan Government, reacting to President Reagan's speech on Central America, said today that it had received an outpouring of international support and asked again for a dialogue with Washington. **********Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto Brockman accused President Reagan of ''working on the fears of the American people'' with ''absurd and deceitful charges against Nicaragua.'' **********Rather than averting a crisis, he said in an interview, the President ''is compounding an already explosive situation.''

Moreover, a cap would begin to reverse the process that in recent years has shifted a much larger part of the nation's tax burden onto middle-and lower-income families. **********Several recent studies have shown this dramatic shift in the distribution of income in this country. The President's personal tax cuts already in place have reduced tax burdens more sharply for those with higher incomes, even when measured in percentage terms. And the interaction of inflation with our progressive tax system has further shifted the income tax burden in this direction. **********Recent sharp increases in the Social Security tax rate (and additional increases soon to occur) are regressive, as are many of the Federal tax increases enacted in 1982 and the recent increase in the gasoline tax. Increases in excise taxes by state and local governments, partly a result of lost Federal aid, are also regressive. Finally, additional increases in excise and energy taxes, and the President's contingent surtax on incomes would overly burden the lower wage earners and move us further away from a tax structure based on ability to pay. **********Moreover, cuts in spending for various social programs that benefit the poor, as well as the sharp growth in personal interest income in recent years caused by policies that create high interest rates, have also caused greater income inequality. **********In my view, the net effect of these tax measures and other changes is very unfair and a $500 cap on the tax cut would at least begin to restore more equity to the system.IT is now generally accepted that the Federal deficit will rise to very high levels in the years ahead u nless new deficit-reducing actions are implemented. Given our need t o reduce interest rates further, these future deficits must be s harply reduced. Otherwise, the large increase in Treasury borrowing t o finance deficits will collide with rising private credit demands, p ushing up interest rates and sparking a new recession. **********The main reason for the bleak budget outlook is that the 1981 tax cuts were too large in view of the enormous military buildup and continued growth in Federal entitlements. And while some spending cuts are desirable, these would be nowhere sufficient to come even close to reducing future deficits to acceptable levels. The expected revenue loss from the 1981 tax cut will have to be reduced, and capping the tax cut will rather painlessly begin that process. **********At the same time, capping the third year of the tax cut will not prevent the recovery from continuing. In fact, it could strengthen it. First, capping would reduce the magnitude of the July tax cut by only about $8 billion; nearly 75 percent of the tax reduction would still occur. This, combined with the military buildup, would provide ample fiscal stimulus for a recovery. **********Second, depending on how the withholding tables are adjusted in July, some or all of the ''increased'' tax liabilities resulting from capping the tax cut would be pushed into the spring of 1984. Last July 1, withholding reductions were limited to incomes below $35,000 - a repeat would mean that virtually all the added revenues from capping would come from smaller refunds or larger payments when 1984 tax returns are filed, and that income flows and purchasing power during the critical second half of this year would be relatively unaffected. **********Finally, the tax cuts on higher incomes will increase savings more than consumer spending. While this may be desirable from a long-term standpoint, the economy is currently suffering from a lack of spending rather than inadequate savings. Thus, scaling back the tax cuts on upper incomes will likely have little adverse effect on consumer spending. **********The net effect on economic activity could in fact be positive if some of the increased revenues associated with capping are used to finance jobs programs or transfer payments aimed at people with a higher propensity to spend. Stimulus from these programs will outweigh the lost spending from scaling back the tax cut. And, to the extent that capping helps reduce expected deficits and eases concerns in financial markets, lower interest rates that may result would further stimulate the recovery."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/16/business/market-place-tax-preparers-and-flat-tax.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1983-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 796, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Tax Preparers And Flat Tax", "print_headline": "Market Place; Tax Preparers And Flat Tax", "body_text": " **********THE flat tax, or a uniform Federal income tax rate for all individuals, is a concept whose time may or may not have arrived.  But it stirs the rhetoric of Congressmen and occasionally receives comment from President Reagan himself. **********While the flat tax remains a matter of debate and conjecture, its discussion in high places can cause a ripple among stocks of publicly owned tax preparation services. **********One day last month, for example, talk of tax reform touched off a drop of 2 1/8 points, to 37 3/4, in H.& R. Block Inc., the largest preparer of Federal income tax returns for individuals. The rationale of the marketplace was that any drastic simplification of income tax laws could hurt Block. **********Economists have also debated simplification of the tax code. In pure form, a flat tax would sweep away deductions and exemptions and, instead, levy a tax on all income at a predetermined rate. **********It is an issue that generates heated argument, depending upon the viewpoint of respective constituents. One basic problem with a pure flat tax, critics have noted, is that it would place an undue burden upon the poor and lower middle class while providing a bonanza for wealthier citizens. **********Despite talk of possible disadvantages of a flat tax, the stocks of both Block and Commerce Clearing House Inc. - another important entity in the tax-preparation field - have hit record prices in the last several months. Yesterday, Block rose 1/2, to 41, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********In the over-the-counter market, Commerce Clearing House fell 3 1/4, to 60 1/2 bid. The stock dropped 3 1/4 last week after reporting 1982 profits that were below Wall Street estimates, and some analysts have lowered their 1983 earnings figures. **********Although dissimilar in their areas of operation, the two companies share certain characteristics. They are cash-rich and carry little long-term debt on their balance sheets, and their return on equity is far superior to that of the average company. Moreover, both are family-controlled businesses. **********Block prepares one out of every 10 tax returns filed in the United States. The company, based in Kansas City, Mo., also operates a temporary help subsidiary, a computer services company and a legal services management subsidiary. **********Its fiscal year ends on April 30 and, because of the seasonal nature of the tax-preparation business, it is the final fiscal quarter that provides the company with profits. Typically, the first three quarters of the fiscal year result in deficits. **********''Although Block's share of the tax preparation market is steadily growing, the percentage of taxpayers seeking professional guidance is declining,'' said Misia Celichowska of the Value Line Investment Survey. ''In fiscal 1981, the number of returns Block prepared fell for the second consecutive year. To help stem this tide, Block plans to limit its price increases for the coming season to 5 percent, compared with 13.5 percent a year earlier.'' **********For the fiscal year ended April 30, 1982, Block earned $3.17 a share. For the current year, Miss Celichowska expects net of $3.25 a share. **********In Kansas City, Jonathan P. Braatz of B.C. Christopher & Company, estimates earnings somewhat higher, at $3.40 a share. As for market timing, he said, a study of the last 15 years shows that the best period in which to sell Block's stock is the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year, while the second and third calendar quarters typically have offered buying opportunities. The principle here is to buy low and sell high. **********Value Line ranks Block and Commerce Clearing House as ''average'' market performers during the next 12 months. ''Investors may be concerned about eventual adoption in the United States of a flat rate income tax,'' said Kenneth C. Bohringer of the investment service.  ''But at present, such a possibility seems unlikely.'' **********Last week, Commerce Clearing House reported 1982 profits of $3.50 a share, up from $3.20 in 1981. Several estimates had called for earnings last year to reach approximately $3.70 a share. **********William Fischer, an analyst for the United States Trust Company, is estimating 1983 net at $4.05 a share, down from $4.35 predicted earlier. **********The Computax unit of Commerce Clearing House calculates Federal and other tax returns by computer from data submitted by professional tax preparers such as accountants and lawyers.

Under the plan, a customer of any bank in the group would be able to use the cash machines of any other participating bank. **********If the program works out as its founders plan, it could pose a significant threat to Citibank's dominance of the automatic teller machine business in the New York area. Citicorp has about 550 ''A.T.M.'s'' in operation, believed to be more than all other banks combined. Manufacturers Hanover has 141 and Chemical about 80. **********Leonard E. Malkin, vice president of Manufacturers Hanover, said the two banks had ''reached agreement in principle.'' William H. Turner, executive vice president of Chemical, estimated that the negotiations would be completed by the end of the year and that the program would go into effect in the first quarter of 1984, if not sooner. **********'Want to Keep It Simple' **********''Our initial intent is to offer cash withdrawals and balance inquiries,'' said Mr. Malkin. ''If the group wants to do more, we'll do more, but at first we want to keep it simple.'' **********The plastic cards held by customers of one bank will be used to gain access to the teller machines of other participating banks. Mr. Malkin said that initially individuals could not use their Mastercards or Visa cards to obtain cash advances from the machines of some of the banks in the system because not all the banks have their teller machines programmed for such services. **********Because it is not clear how many banks initially would participate in the proposed program, it is impossible to determine how many machines would be involved, Mr. Malkin said. Three or four other large banks in the area are taking part in the talks, he added, but declined to identify them. He indicated, however, that they include banks in New Jersey, Connecticut and upstate New York. **********If banks in more than one state do participate, Federal laws that prohibit interstate banking would bar a customer of a bank in one state from making a deposit at an automatic teller machine of a bank in another state. But there are no Federal restrictions on cash withdrawals across state lines. **********Several National Networks **********Shared teller machine networks are common throughout the United States, except in the New York area. There also are several national networks, such as Cirrus System Inc., which is based in Oakbrook, Ill. **********Bruce A. Burchfield, Cirrus' president, said that although 700 banks are hooked up, with 200 more to join by the end of the year, there is only one member in New York State - Manufacturers Hanover - and none in northern New Jersey or Connecticut. Mr. Burchfield said he did not understand why the New York metropolitan area has been slower than other regions in linking its automated teller machines. **********In addition to national groups, there are about 400 regional groups throughout the country, he said. **********Asked whether such linkages might raise antitrust problems, Mr. Burchfield said, ''There's always the possibility of antitrust actions, but if you look at linked A.T.M.'s as delivery systems in which each bank sets its own prices and terms, there should be no problem.'' **********Mr. Malkin said the group being organized for the New York area would probably charge membership fees to each participating bank and fees on a transaction basis. For example, if a Manufacturers Hanover customer used a Chemical machine, Manufacturers Hanover would have to pay a fee to Chemical for that transaction. **********Each bank would decide whether to pass these fees on to its customers. At present, Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical expect to absorb these costs. Elsewhere, according to Mr. Burchfield, most banks absorb the costs but some charge their customers. Many have set fees equivalent to those on traveler's checks, or $1 for every $100 withdrawn. **********Machines Cost $180,000 **********The reason most banks opt to absorb the costs is because it is cheaper than installing hundreds of their own machines. **********Mr. Malkin estimates that in New York each machine costs up to $180,000. Thus, by sharing their machines, other banks in the area might be able to compete more effectively with Citibank without having to spend tens of millions of dollars to install many more machines. **********William J. Heron, senior vice president of Citibank, said yesterday that the proposed system ''would represent a new competitive element.'' But he added, ''Its success will only be a result of effective marketing, and that requires each member of the group to subordinate its own marketing efforts to those of the group. In the past, that has not worked very well.'' **********Installing and operating the machines is more costly than hiring a teller, and the machines pay off only if they generate enough volume by working 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That is why marketing becomes so important, Mr. Heron said. **********Mr. Turner of Chemical said the proposed network would be open to all banks in the area, including Citibank. But at present Citibank cannot link its machines to those of other banks because Citibank's units are not compatible. **********A Citibank spokesman said, however, that it would be easy to adjust its machines to achieve compatibility. Citibank is considering joining or forming a shared network of its own, but no decisions have been made, according to Mr. Heron."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/11/business/playboy-loses-3.3-million.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 135, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Playboy Loses $3.3 Million", "print_headline": "Playboy Loses $3.3 Million", "body_text": " **********Playboy Enterprises Inc. said today that it lost $3.3 million in its fiscal second quarter this year, an improvement over a $13.2 million loss in the same period of 1982.

Since then, major market indicators have scored a creditable, but less heady, gain of 45 percent. **********Investors flocked to high-technology issues, typically found in such industries as data processing, communications and semiconductors, because they offered a faster perceived rate of earnings growth than available in many less glamorous companies. **********By February, however, the high-technology boom had taken on a decidedly speculative tone and brokerage firms soon scrambled to hoist warning flags. ''These issues,'' Merrill Lynch told clients, ''appear to us to be most vulnerable to a market correction, should one develop.'' **********At Shearson/American Express, John D. Connolly, the director of research, called attention to the ''froth'' apparent in the technology group. **********Decrying the scramble for high-technology issues, Raymond F. DeVoe, a strategist for Legg Mason Wood Walker, said that a long-term bull market depended upon ''the growth of controlled euphoria.'' **********Thus, by the end of February, a growing worry on Wall Street was that an unrestrained buying binge in high-technology issues could cause a sharp selloff for the entire market. But, so far in March, the high-technology issues have cooled off a bit and the bull market remains intact. **********''It is a healthy development,'' Mr. Connolly of Shearson/American Express said in an interview last Sunday. ''Strength in the technology group has been ebbing, so that for the last two or three weeks these stocks have ranked as average market performers.'' **********Meanwhile, for investors willing to look ahead six months, say, Mr. Connolly is convinced that high-technology issues ''will do better than the general market.'' ''The dynamics for higher earnings growth are present in selected high-tech stocks,'' he said, ''and that's what common stocks are all about -growth.'' **********Among the firm's current recommendations are such issues as Apple Computer, Digital Equipment, Avantek, California Microwave, Harris Corporation, Tymshare and M/ A-Com, as well as International Business Machines and NCR. **********Several factors, aside from the repeated warnings of investment firms, combined recently to help cool off the heated demand for technology stocks. In some cases, brokerage houses and investment advisers erased issues from their lists of purchase recommendations.  In early March, for example, Shearson/American Express removed Wang Laboratories as a recommendation, partly on the premise that ''the caution flag is out for word processing stocks in general.'' **********In Minneapolis, the Leuthold Group eliminated Advanced Micro Devices, a major semiconductor producer that was the largest holding in its equity model portfolio, citing a price-earnings ratio of 55 and ''the intensity of insider selling.'' **********At Dean Witter Reynolds, only three issues in the firm's list of 30 ''emerging growth stocks,'' replete with technology issues, are recommended currently as ''buys.'' These include Newport Corporation, the leading domestic producer of components for laser research, and Quotron Systems, the leading supplier in the United States for financial quotation display systems. However, the firm carries a ''buy/hold'' rating on a number of other technology stocks, ranging from Cullinet Softwear to the Systems and Computer Technology Corporation. **********''People's perceptions of valuation are undergoing a change,'' said William J. Ritger of Dean Witter. ''In effect, people are saying that it's time to be a little cautious.'' **********Historically, stocks with strong earnings growth have carried a much higher price-earnings multiple than the general market. Dean Witter's 30-stock, emerging growth list shows an average multiple of 26 times estimated earnings for 1983, compared with about 10 times for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. **********Meanwhile, some analysts say that, since high-technology stocks are generally twice as volatile in their price action as the average issue, any forthcoming correction in the market could, temporarily at least, produce correspondingly sharper downdrafts in the hightechnology group. **********One clue to the recent cooling-off period in the technology sector is apparent in the reception of several new issues deemed to be ''hot,'' or eagerly sought after. **********Diasonics, a producer of medical scanning equipment, went public on Feb. 13 at an initial price of 22. The stock rose nearly 5 points in its first day of trading. Yesterday, it gained 3/4, to 22 3/4 bid.  Fortune Systems, which makes a desktop computer system, made its debut on March 7, also at 22.

Although there have been reports the President will replace Mr. Volcker or that most of Mr. Reagan's advisers support replacing Mr. Volcker, the President and his spokesmen have denied them. **********On other matters, Mr. Regan said in a morning meeting with reporters that a bill to delay for at least four years tax withholding on dividend and interest payments would be ''a nightmare of bureaucracy'' and worse than the current law that calls for withholding of 10 percent of dividends and interest payments to most people, effective July 1. He said that the bill, approved last week by the Senate, would result in having the Internal Revenue Service chase individual taxpayers ''more than anyone would want.'' **********Under the proposal to put off withholding until 1987, Mr. Regan said, people will violate its strengthened reporting requirements if they fail to report dividend and interest income, if they make a mistake of $50 or more or if their report disagrees with what banks and corporations report to the revenue service about payments of dividends and interest to individuals. **********When the revenue service finds such a violation, it would notify all the institutions paying the taxpayer dividends or interest to begin withholding at a 20 percent rate 61 days after the notice.

Those require broadcasters to allow airing of ''all responsible viewpoints.'' **********Services Could Start Soon **********Several major communications companies, including CBS and NBC, were awaiting today's authorization action by the commission, and are poised to offer various broadcast teletext services of their own.  Time Inc. has disclosed plans to offer similar services employing cable systems rather than over-the-air broadcasting. **********Using the teletext system, the broadcaster sends the printed material on the ''vertical blanking interval,'' a portion of the television signal that is sometimes seen as a black bar when the picture rolls. Thus, the broadcaster is able to air regular programs and the data at the same time, although only viewers with sets equipped with decoders will be able to pick up the teletext. **********Unlike videotex, normally conveyed over cable or telephone lines from a central computer, teletext is one-way and the viewer may not communicate in question-and-answer exchanges. The teletext viewer merely has access to prepared pages of information sent out over the air from a central transmitter. Any one of the pages may be called up on a TV screen through the touch of a button on a keypad similar to the keys on a push-button telephone. Teletext is expected to be accessible to more people than videotex because any existing television station can broadcast the necessary pages of information.  In addition, some experts say that because teletext is less expensive to receive than videotex, it is likely to eventually be used more widely than videotex as a means of providing news and other timely information to home receivers.

The commission declined to choose, saying it favored ''the open market approach that will allow licensees the freedom of choice necessary to operate teletext services tailored to their own specific situations.''

Same Problems Exist **********Yet today the same political, economic and social problems exist, in some cases worse than before. The United States has sharply increased its military role in the area and involvement by Cuba continues. President Reagan holds fast to the idea that conflict in Central America is a battle between East and West, Communism and democracy. **********With signs of success in its original goals far from apparent, the role of the Contadora group, as it came to be known, has quietly evolved from one of trying to bring peace to the region to that of preventing a broader, international outbreak of war. **********''It is more what you don't see than what you see,'' Mexico's Foreign Minister, Bernardo Sepulveda Amor, said the other day. ''I am certain that if it were not for Contadora you would have seen a much graver situation.''  Achievements Hard to Define **********Indeed the group is credited within the region for having prevented Honduras and Nicaragua from waging war across their common border. But as the Contadora group seeks a ''mandate'' from the United Nations for its peacemaking efforts in Central America, other accomplishments are hard to define. **********The Presidents of the four Contadora countries - Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela - have agreed on the conditions that would have to exist for peace to be attained, but the means to achieve those conditions have thus far eluded them. **********Earlier this month, in what the Contadora group hailed as a significant advance, all five Central American Foreign Ministers - those of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala - agreed on the same document. The contents have not been revealed, but it is believed to state, in very general terms, a commitment to peace, again without any commitment on how to bring it about. **********The Latin American diplomats involved say diplomacy works that way, that merely being able to convene the five Central American countries to discuss their differences is reason for hope. By the same token, one person who often advises Congress on Latin American affairs said that getting the four Contadora group countries together to discuss things is also an achievement.   One Key Disadvantage **********From the beginning, the Contadora group's quest to bring peace to the area has suffered from at least one key disadvantage: it includes virtually no participation from the major forces doing or promoting the actual fighting. **********Neither those fighting the Nicaraguan Government - such as the leaders of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, which has been staging raids in the north of Nicaragua from bases in Honduras, and the Revolutionary Democratic Alliance, which bombed Managua's international airport a few weeks ago - have shown more than passing interest in becoming involved with the efforts of the Contadora group or in following its edicts. **********Nor do the rebels in El Salvador, who for nearly four years have been battling a succession of United States- backed governments there. The leader of El Salvador's opposition Democratic Revolutionary Front said recently that while the Contadora group had ''prevented a major aggression against the Central American region from the United States President, Ronald Reagan,'' its efforts had been modest. **********For its part, the United States, while repeatedly voicing support for the Contadora group's efforts, has shown little enthusiasm for actually following many of the key principles it espouses.   Viewed as Success by U.S. **********The Reagan Administration continues to view as a success, for example, its support for the Honduras-based rebels fighting Nicaragua's Sandinista Government. It has thus far given no indication it would comply with the Contadora group's admonitions about using the territory of one Central American country to attack another."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/06/business/nigeria-denies-oil-price-cut.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 123, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nigeria Denies Oil-Price Cut", "print_headline": "Nigeria Denies Oil-Price Cut", "body_text": " **********Nigeria has no intention of cutting oil prices but may have to trim its output this month to stay within its agreed production ceiling, according to an official source. **********Asked about rumors that the country had cut its $30-a-barrel price for its benchmark crude, a senior Nigerian official said they were ''nonsense.'' **********The official, speaking Friday, said that production during May was around 1.6 million barrels a day, up from April's average of 1.17 million. **********That May level would mean that production would have to drop in June for Nigeria to stay within its Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries quota of 1.335 million barrels a day, which Nigeria considers to be on a quarterly basis."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/20/business/baybanks-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 43, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BAYBANKS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "BAYBANKS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/17/business/new-issues-widening.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 408, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW ISSUES WIDENING", "print_headline": "NEW ISSUES WIDENING", "body_text": " **********This week's financings in the Treasury market are not expected to be much of a burden, but the increased size of every new issue is a harbinger of the Treasury's immense needs in the future. **********Monday's regular auction of three-and six-month bills was increased to $12 billion from the $11.6 billion level of recent weeks.

Land, retired patriarch of the Polaroid Corporation, is surrealistic.  More than 30 years ago, after achieving the startling advance that made possible the first instant black-and-white photography, Mr. Land summoned his friend and associate, Howard C. Rogers, and told him to sit down ''and think about color.'' **********For several years, Mr. Rogers, now the 67-year-old director of research at the company, ''simply sat, and, saying very little, assimilated the techniques we were using in black and white,'' Mr.  Land relates in a collection of his papers recently issued by Polaroid. ''Then one day he stood up and said, 'I'm ready now.' '' A color laboratory was built and color film produced. ''My point is,'' Mr. Land writes, ''that we created an environment in which a man was expected to sit and think for two years.'' **********The anecdote says a lot about the way Mr. Land used to run Polaroid and perhaps it tells even more about why the company is troubled today. Its profits have plunged in recent years, its sales have been flat at best and its future direction is uncertain. It is no longer a place where scientists can sit around and think for a couple of years. **********''We don't have the luxuries we used to have,'' says Sheldon A.  Buckler, a Polaroid executive vice president. Echoing a plaint heard frequently among current and former Polaroid employees these days, Mr. Buckler adds: ''We don't have a, well, we don't have another Land.'' **********The 74-year-old Mr. Land broke off his last formal ties with Polaroid last July, when he resigned as chairman. Last week, for the first time in 46 years, the company's founder and the holder of 8.3 percent of its stock was absent from the annual meeting. **********To one typical stockholder, Roscoe Dwayne of Boston, a Polaroid without Mr. Land is difficult to imagine: ''I just can't picture it.'' **********But there are a lot of things new to Polaroid these days. The company is in the midst of changes so fundamental that no one, including its top managers, seems able to describe what kind of company Polaroid will be in the next few years. **********One thing seems certain, however. Polaroid appears poised to lessen its dependence on instant cameras, a market that caters to the amateur photographers whose appetite for the company's products once seemed insatiable and propelled its stock to as high as $261.75 a share in 1960. (The stock traded at about $32 last week.) **********In the process, say some analysts, Polaroid promises to become sleeker, trimmer and better positioned for broad diversification. ''I think the Polaroid of the future is going to be a much more stable and reliable company,'' says Louis Rusitzky, a securities analyst at Adams, Harkness & Hill, a Boston brokerage firm. BUT while its new leadership is to be lauded for trying to separate P olaroid from its old image as a one-product company, ''this place d oesn't have that old flair'' for inventiveness, says Robin S.  L incoln, a broker at the Boston securities firm of Tucker Anthony & R .L. Day Inc. **********Such criticism puts Polaroid's management on the defensive. At the annual meeting, one shareholder demanded to know whether Polaroid had lost its ''long tradition of creativity.'' William J. McCune Jr., Mr. Land's 67-year-old successor as chairman and chief executive, replied, ''It is a different kind of creativity.'' **********Tall, graying and angular, Mr. McCune in an interview quietly describes Polaroid's transition into tougher and potentially more fruitful fields outside amateur photography. He notes that Polaroid is spending about $100 million a year on research and development in technologies including a variety of specialized chemicals, ultra-thin plastic coatings and intricate precision lenses, all with potential industrial uses in electronics imagery, lasers, magnetics and fiber optics. **********Indeed, Polaroid's biggest competitor, the Eastman Kodak Company, began extending beyond photography years ago. Today, although Kodak has had troubles of its own, its amateur photography division accounts for only about a third of the company's sales and about half its earnings, leaving it less vulnerable than Polaroid to ups and downs in the consumer market. By comparison, amateur photography accounts for more than two-thirds of Polaroid's sales and more than 85 percent of its profits. **********While many outsiders and securities analysts say that Mr. Land's departure clears the way for the company to expand away from photography, others are skeptical. **********George S. Yip, marketing professor at the Harvard School of Business, says Polaroid's previous success raises some knotty questions about the abilities of the current leadership. ''It's a question of management transference,'' he says. ''Was Polaroid's past success based on the product or the management? If it was on the product, then you have to wonder whether the new management has the ability to manage what appears to be a new venture.'' **********Mr. McCune, a Land protege who joined Polaroid as a scientist in 1939, two years after it was formed, is considered a far more pragmatic manager than was Mr. Land. And he, like many others, believes that in producing an assortment of optical and electronics devices as well as a wide range of chemicals and plastics, Polaroid has already built up a treasury of technology for a broad array of commercial and industrial uses. **********Moreover, Mr. McCune is ready to use Polaroid's estimated $335 million cash supply to acquire other companies, something Mr. Land would not consider, to help advance the development of new technolgies. **********Even in areas connected with photography, Polaroid is still bringing out an array of new products, including a system to develop instant 35-millimeter transparencies for slides. The company estimates that each year in American business and industry, photographers take an astonishing 10 billion 35-millimeter slides. **********Actually, Mr. Land established Polaroid in 1937 not as a photography company but to make and market products from his new technology on polarizing, or filtering, light. **********The fledgling company experienced its first crisis early, when the United States auto industry turned down Mr. Land's proposals to install his polarizers on car headlights. Meanwhile, another use of the polarization process - sunglasses - did succeed, and later the company fared well selling goggles, filters and glasses during World War II. **********But it was the invention of instant photography that made his name famous around the globe.  ''I recall a sunny day in Sante Fe, N.M., when my little daughter asked why she could not see at once the picture I had just taken of her,'' he wrote in his collected papers. ''As I walked around the charming town I undertook the task of solving the puzzle she had set me. Within an hour, the camera, the film, and the physical chemistry became so clear to me.'' It was 1944, and Mr. Land was 35 years old. **********In the process, a negative is exposed and then brought into contact with a positive print sheet. Both are drawn between two rollers and a pot of chemicals is ruptured and spread across the positive print sheet. The first instant camera, which Polaroid began selling in 1948, weighed four pounds and carried a retail price tag of around $90. It was called the Land camera. **********THE very first one turned a profit, and tens of millions of Polaroid cameras, in more than 60 different versions, have been sold.  A worthwhile invention, Mr. Land once said, ''must be startling, unexpected and must come to a world that is not prepared for it.'' And his company produced several such innovations, not all of them rousing commercial successes. **********In 1972, Polaroid came out with the SX-70, which produced instant photos that popped out of the camera and completed the development process in the user's hand. It was a departure from the older system, in which the print emerged from the camera incomplete, then had to be peeled away from the negative and wrapper, which then were thrown away. But the development cost Polaroid $600 million, and the company's stock plunged. Yet today, analysts credit the simpler, ''garbage-free'' SX-70 with blunting Kodak's 1976 incursion into instant photography. **********Perhaps Polaroid's biggest misadventure was its instant movie system, Polavision, introduced in 1977 but withdrawn two years later. Analysts said at the time that Polaroid lost $200 million on the system, for which the company was forced eventually to take a $68.5 million write-down on inventory. The instant movie system, which was listed to sell as high as $700, produced movies on a two-and-a-halfminute cassette which was inserted into a television-like screening system. But consumers did not take to the system, which produced poor-quality images and lacked sound. **********The company's troubles mounted. Instant camera sales leveled off as consumers graduated to the higher quality 35-millimeter photo systems whose electronic gadgets had made them easy to operate. Polaroid's overall sales in 1979 flattened, at $1.36 billion, compared with $1.37 billion in 1978. In 1982, sales stood at $1.29 billion. Last year Polaroid's share of the total United States camera market, instant and conventional, plunged to 17.4 percent from 27.1 percent in 1978. **********Profits also began to plunge, slipping finally to $23.5 million, or 73 cents a share, last year from $118 million, or $3.60 a share, in 1978. Finally, years after a younger Mr. Land had spoken so confidently about a wealth-sharing plan for workers that he called ''semi-topia,'' Polaroid began the process of reducing its work force, bringing it from 17,900 in 1978 to 14,200 currently. **********The company offered workers a lucrative retirement inducement last year that resulted in a $30 million write-off against earnings.  Because of the retirement lure and in some cases concern about the Polaroid retrenchment, at least three key executive vice presidents left the company. Theodore N. Voss and Peter Wensberg both went to Atari Inc. and Richard W. Young became president of the Houghton Mifflin Company. **********In 1980, Mr. Land resigned as chief executive officer and director of research at Polaroid, saying he wanted to devote himself to pure science. Then last July he resigned as chairman and a director. He still holds the symbolic title of honorary chairman. **********''Dr. Land is a genius, and much of the creativity of the company came from his perceptions and convictions about things,'' says Mr.  McCune. ''We obviously do not have a genius of that caliber in the company anymore.''  EDWIN LAND:STILL SEARCHING, AT 74 **********CAMBRIDGE, Mass.  Edwin H. Land is no longer an active part of the Polaroid Corporation, but he is still involved with the mysteries of light and color, among other things. **********Mr. Land, right, is head of the Rowland Institute of Science, a private, nonprofit center dedicated to basic, no-goal research. And the institute, founded and financed by Mr. Land, has made a discovery of sorts. **********Rowland researchers headed by Mr. Land have learned that perception of light and color is determined primarily by the brain's intelligence system. Previously, researchers believed color was perceived mainly through a spectrum system in the retina of the eye. **********Last year, Rowland moved into a three-story building in Cambridge, near the Charles River and about half a mile from Polaroid's headquarters. **********Other than Mr. Land himself, who would@n't be interviewed, few people know where the name Rowland comes from. ''Honest, I don't know of anyone who knows,'' says a spokesman for the institute. **********Still Polaroid's largest stockholder, Mr. Land owns or controls more than 2.6 million shares, or about 8.3 percent of the company's stock. While other members of his family also own some stock, neither of his two daughters is actively involved in the business. **********Besides his consuming interest in his work - associates say he often spends 12 hours a day in his laboratory at the institute - his time is occupied by his family and by the two mastiff dogs given to him by co-workers upon his retirement. **********Mr. Land, who lives in a rambling clapboard home on Brattle Street, in the heart of Cambridge near Harvard Square, is said to be a very private person - a trait that he apparently developed long ago. In 1928, when he was 18 years old, he dropped out of Harvard after discovering polarization of light and moved to New York City. There, according to company lore, he and his wife, Helen, continued his experiments clandestinely by climbing through a window of the physics laboratory at Columbia University and working long into the night."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/03/business/dealers-bond-rally-falters.html": {"writer_name": "Yla Eason", "pub_date": "1983-06-03", "snippet": "A rally in bond prices, begun by professional dealers yesterday, faltered late in the day as institutional investors refused to join the buying spree.\n\nThe reluctance of investors to purchase bonds was attributed to the lack of a clear-cut Federal...", "word_count": 974, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DEALERS' BOND RALLY FALTERS", "print_headline": "DEALERS' BOND RALLY FALTERS", "body_text": " **********A rally in bond prices, begun by professional dealers yesterday, faltered late in the day as institutional investors refused to join the buying spree. **********The reluctance of investors to purchase bonds was attributed to the lack of a clear-cut Federal Reserve policy at this time. While concluding that the Federal Reserve has not yet moved to tighten credit availability, several investors believe the Fed might do so if the basic money supply continues to grow beyond the Fed's targets. **********Wayne Lyski, vice president of the Alliance Capital Management Corporation, an investment management concern, said: ''My own feeling is the Fed hasn't done anything to tighten reserves. But we're taking a wait and see attitude.'' **********He added, ''We're concerned about what kind of growth we've seen in M-1 and would like to have a few more concrete facts that this growth was an abberation.''Awaiting Report on M-1 **********The level of M-1, the measure of currency and checking deposits readily available for spending, will be reported today for the week ended May 25. Several analysts have predicted a drop of about $500 million in M-1, but a decline that small would not make much of a dent in the sharp growth of M-1 in recent weeks. It is now about $16.8 billion above the Fed's 8 percent upper limit for 1983. **********Stephen Slifer, money market economist at Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, said yesterday's price rally halted because ''on one hand Preston Martin gave the impression that the Fed would not respond to monetary growth, but there were reports that some Fed members were considering tightening.'' **********On Wednesday Mr. Martin, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, indicated before a Congressional panel that the Fed would not respond quickly to the monetary increase so that it could continue to accommodate the economic recovery. That statement was taken as a sign that the Fed would maintain its present policy of keeping interest rates stable despite the sharp money growth. **********However, other published reports quoted Fed sources as concerned about the surge in money growth and actively considering the possibility of marginally tightening bank reserves, which would raise short-term interest rates.Reaction to Rate Move **********The credit markets were on edge about any sign that the Fed was moving toward tightening its policy, and when the cost of overnight loans between bank - the Federal funds rate - traded at 8 3/4 percent and the Fed did not add reserves to the banking system to help lower the rate, some dealers took that as a signal of tightening and sold securities. **********One trader said: ''People began wondering if the Fed has snugged up a little. Their overall plan is a little uncertain.'' The trader said the market had rebounded earlier in the day because there was strong demand for the five-year, two-month note auctioned Wednesday. The note, due in August 1988, was offered at 99 27/32 to yield 10.53 percent, up from the 10.50 yield set at the auction. After dealers bought to cover previous sales, however, they found there was no retail demand to keep the rally going. **********Mr. Slifer said conflicting views about the Fed's policy is further complicated by M-1 growth. ''M-1 will be a problem for the Fed,'' he said. ''The real issue is: Does the Fed expect the growth to continue? If it does, the Fed will be forced to respond.''Outlook for Weeks Ahead **********However, Peter Treadway, economist at Cralin & Company, a securities trading and investment firm, believes interest rates are still headed lower. He does not think the Fed will move to tighten because he expects ''the money numbers will unravel in the next few weeks.'' **********Mr. Treadway said that private sector credit demand was still weak and that ''the real rate of interest is still too high for a really good recovery.'' **********But Henry Kaufman, the Salomon Brothers economist, told an audience at a University of Chicago economic dinner, ''While the Federal Reserve may hesitate to tighten markets in response to larger-thantargeted growth in money or credit, it cannot avoid doing so ultimately because fiscal policy appears straitjacketed on a course of large budget deficits.'' **********Thomas G. Gribbon, executive vice president of Drexel Burnham Lambert,also expressed concern. He said: ''The market is in a tenuous situation. It is looking for something overt. The Fed did not show its hands, but people suspect some change in the wind, and people are not sure what form it will take.'' He said the market ''disciplined itself'' by trading lower yesterday.Offerings by Treasury **********Adding to the supply of short-term securities, the Treasury auctioned $5 billion in cash management bills yesterday. The average discount rate on the 73-day bills was 8.51 percent, and the average discount rate on the 164-day bill was 8.65 percent. **********Reflecting the slight increase in interest rates, the three-month Treasury bill was offered at 8.47 percent, up from 8.46 percent Wednesday. The 10 3/8 percent bond due in 2012 was offered at 95 10/32 to yield 10.91 percent, up from 10.89 percent Wednesday. **********The municipal market continued to suffer from the rate backup as well. In Illinois, Cook County had scheduled a $105.5 million bond issue that was to be awarded on a competitive bid basis. But the county rejected the only bid it recieved and negotiatated for a smaller issue with shorter maturities in an attempt to pay less for the bonds. **********Also Merrill Lynch repriced a $45 million Independence County, Ark., pollution control revenue bond issue, raising the yield on the one maturity due in 2013 to 11 1/8 percent, from 11 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/26/business/company-reports-gulton-industries-inc-n.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "** Company Reports ** GULTON INDUSTRIES INC (N)", "print_headline": "** Company Reports ** GULTON INDUSTRIES INC (N)", "body_text": " **********Qtr to Feb 26 1983 1982 Sales 36,132,000 36,711,000 Net inc 1,785,000 bd1,209,000 Share earns .60 Yr sales 151,180,000 155,745,000 Net inc c3,942,000 d1,599,000 Share earns 1.30 .49 b-Net loss. c-After a loss of $640,000 from discontinued operations and a net gain of $940,000 from the sale of land and buildings. d-After a loss of $379,000 for the quarter and year from discontinued operations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/25/business/clausen-to-see-china-officials.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-05-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 83, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Clausen to See China Officials", "print_headline": "Clausen to See China Officials", "body_text": " **********A.W.

I accept responsibility for the bad as well as the good.'' **********While acknowledging that the marines were ill-prepared to deal with the Oct. 23 terrorist truck bombing that took 241 lives, the President said their commanders ''have already suffered quite enough.''  Report's Conclusions Listed **********Speaking at a hastily called news conference this morning before leaving for his ranch in California, the President said he had read the report of the special Defense Department commission that has investigated the bombing. That 166-page report, which criticizes the marines' security precautions, has not been made public. But officials who have read the report, or who were involved in its preparation, discussed it today. They said these were among its conclusions: **********- The marines were in a difficult position in an increasingly hostile environment and were not adequately trained to deal with terrorists. **********- The entire military chain of command, including the Marine commander in Beirut and the admirals and generals above him, shares blame for failing to insure that proper security precautions were taken against terrorists. **********- The marines did not have the ability to analyze the mass of intelligence on possible terrorist threats that they were receiving. **********- The marines should not have housed so many men in one building, presenting a sizable target for terrorists. **********- United States personnel responded well immediately after the bombing and were correct in evacuating casualties to Europe rather than to closer Israeli hospitals that had been offered. **********- In the weeks following the attack, the marines did reduce their vulnerability to terrorist attacks, but their precautions were still inadequate.   'Felt It Would Be Unfair' **********Although the report did not advise disciplinary action, it recommended that Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger take whatever disciplinary or administrative action he deemed appropriate. A White House official said today that after reading the report, Mr. Reagan decided he would override that recommendation. **********The official said the President wanted to make his own statement absolving the marines of responsibility before the report was made public because it was critical of them. **********''He felt it would be unfair to the guys out there to have a board of inquiry or a court-martial hanging over them,'' the official said. ''It would be unfair to discipline them for something nobody could anticipate.'' **********The President ''does accept that the marines' security precautions were lax,'' the official said. ''But you have to realize there are two terms: responsibility and culpability.'' **********Of the marines, he said the President believes: ''Responsibility, yes; culpability, no.''  Commission Member Pleased **********The official said Mr. Reagan received the commission report late Friday and reviewed it over the weekend. He was given a list of possible options for action by the national security adviser, Robert C. McFarlane, with no particular recommendation on which one to choose, the official said. **********At his news conference, Mr. Reagan said he had ''soberly considered the commission's word about accountability and responsibility of authorities up and down the chain of command.'' But, Mr. Reagan said, he did not believe that the marines' commanders ''should be punished for not fully comprehending the nature of today's terrorist threat.'' **********Adm. Robert L. J. Long, retired, who was chairman of the five-member commission, said he would not comment on the President's remarks today. But another commission member, Robert J. Murray, director of national security studies at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, said he was pleased with the President's statement. **********Mr. Murray, a former Under Secretary of the Navy, said he thought it was ''a good idea'' not to punish any of the commanders, and he said his views ''are a reasonable summation of the commission's point of view.''  Officers 'Did Best They Could' **********The Long Commission report ''did find things that could have been done better,'' Mr. Murray said, ''but we didn't offer recommendations on punishment.'' **********''We left it up to the Secretary of Defense to do as he saw fit.'' **********Mr. Murray said the commission found that the Marine commanders and their superiors ''did the best they could under difficult circumstances.'' **********''Basically,'' he said, ''no one who was guilty of sins was guilty of unreasonable sins.'' **********Of Col. Timothy J. Geraghty, who commanded the unit in Beirut at the time of the bombing, Mr. Murray said the commission concluded that ''it wasn't that he was being stupid or casual or indifferent'' to the security of his men. ''No one foresaw the chain of events that would occur.'' **********Mr. Murray said the findings of the Long Commission report were ''reasonably consistent with the findings'' of the highly critical report on the bombing issued last week by the House Armed Services' Investigations subcommittee.   'His Decision to Make' **********''Their conclusions are the same as our conclusions,'' he added, ''except on one point: General Kelley.'' The House report criticized Gen. Paul X. Kelley, the Marine commandant, saying his testimony to Congress a few days after the bombing contained many inaccuracies. **********But the Long Commission report ''does not mention General Kelley,'' Mr. Murray said.

One key official said it was his understanding that this interim offer would be dependent on Moscow's ultimate acceptance of Mr. Reagan's so-called zero option, which calls for the elimination of all intermediate-range missiles in Europe. Arguments by State Department **********The officials and diplomats explained that Mr. Reagan agreed with State Department arguments that he had to temper his zero-option approach or risk growing West European belief that he was not seriously pursuing arms control. **********Administration officials said there is a possibility that Mr.  Reagan will include this new proposal in a televised national security address he is scheduled to deliver Wednesday from the White House at 8 P.M. **********That would allow him to combine proposals for limiting nuclear arms with what officials said will be a defense of his Administration's military spending plans. In this way, the officials said, Mr. Reagan feels he can regain the political initiative in the United States and Europe and restate his fundamental theme that successful arms control agreements depend on a continuing American military buildup. Timing Is the Key Question **********Administration officials cautioned again today that Mr. Reagan has made no final decisions either on the new missile proposal or the speech for Wednesday night. But at this point, the officials and sources said there was no doubt that Mr. Reagan would offer an interim arms agreement to Moscow - the only question being when. **********Other Administration officials familiar with Mr. Reagan's speech drafts continue to insist that it will contain no new arms control proposals. A Pentagon official said it would deal only with the military budget and the movement to freeze the nuclear arms race as a preliminary step to arms reductions. The Administration has taken a strong stance against the freeze idea, even as it gathers momemtum in Congress. **********The speech drafts now being reworked in the White House are said to resemble Mr. Reagan's June address at Eureka College in Illinois in tone and in the theme of peace through military strength. What officials described as tough early passages about the continuing Soviet military buildup are counterpoised against later emphasis on real reductions in armaments. The speech drafts would have Mr. Reagan reiterating his argument that he could not agree to a freeze until the United States had achieved military parity, and that his military program was making long strides toward reaching parity. **********It was in the Eureka speech, just as he was preparing to go to Europe and face criticism about his tardiness in making new arms control proposals, that Mr. Reagan unveiled his plan for reductions in intercontinental-range nuclear forces. Trying to Please Right Wing **********A Eureka-style speech would also continue Mr. Reagan's pattern of making strident accusations for several weeks on a subject followed by more moderate presentations, trying to please his right-wing supporters and trying to appear centrist at the same time. Recently, Mr. Reagan has charged Moscow with being the focus of evil in the world and implied that Congressmen who seek to cut the rate of increase in military spending may be giving comfort to Moscow. **********The current round of Soviet-American talks in Geneva on intermediate-range forces is due to end on March 29. Whether the President should unveil his new proposal before the end of this round was not resolved at the White House meeting last week. **********There was said to be considerable sentiment, particularly by Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, that Mr. Reagan should wait until April or May. The argument was that if Mr. Reagan shifted his position now, and the Russians rejected it - as they are expected to do - the Administration would fall under renewed pressure from the allies to make yet another compromise proposal before the start of the next round. **********As matters now stand, Moscow has proposed reducing its 500 SS-4, SS-5, and SS-20 missiles facing Europe to the current British and French level of 162 missiles, on the condition that no new American missiles be deployed. Some 108 SS-20 missiles facing Asia would not be included. Mr. Reagan's approach is for the Soviet Union to destroy all of its missiles in return for NATO's foregoing the planned deployment, starting late this year, of 572 new missiles. Pressure From Europeans **********Meanwhile, many Western European leaders have been increasing their pressure on Mr. Reagan to offer an interim solution. In Europe, it was common knowledge that Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany had told Washington that even after the recent election of his conservative coalition, he did not believe he had support for new American missile deployments unless new American proposals were made. **********After the White House meeting last week, officials said Administration diplomats were dispatched to North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters in Brussels to brief the Atlantic allies on the options under review by the President and to signal that he was ready to move toward the idea of an interim agreement of 100 missile launchers with 300 warheads for each side. **********According to diplomatic sources and Administration officials, the American diplomats were to make clear that the 100 American missile launchers would include Pershing 2 missiles as well as cruise missiles. Fear of Pershing Missiles **********There is some sentiment in Europe and in certain circles of the Reagan Administration that Moscow might be tempted by a proposal that would forego Pershing deployments. These experts argue that Moscow particularly fears these missiles, which can reach the Soviet Union much quicker than the slow-flying cruise missiles. **********One Administration official said the new American proposal would also call for freezing or reducing the number of medium-range bombers on both sides. **********Mr. Weinberger has also been in Europe in the last days, and for the first time has spoken openly about the possiblity of an interim agreement. ---- U.S. Compromise Is Urged **********VILAMOURA, Portugal, March 22 (UPI) - European defense ministers called on the United States today to modify its zero option stance at the Geneva arms talks and break the deadlock with the Soviet Union. **********''Everybody has the feeling that there must be some movement in the Geneva negotiations,'' said the Defense Minister of the Netherlands, Jacob de Ruiter, at the close of the first day of a two-day meeting of NATO's nuclear planning group. **********A senior United States defense official conceded that the Europeans want to see new proposals put forward at Geneva, even though they continue to support the zero option as an ultimate objective."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/29/world/mrs-thatcher-plans-debate-on-deployment-of-missiles.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1983-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 648, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MRS.

U.S. Aware of Political Problems **********A senior Government official reviewing the events for foreign reporters said today that Secretary of State George P. Shultz indicated to Sir Geoffrey at a meeting Thursday in Paris that the United States was aware of the political problems that the lack of communication caused. The most serious lapse occurred when the British were not told of President Regean's preliminary decision Sunday to invade, leaving Sir Geoffrey in the embarrassing position of telling the Commons Monday afternoon that there was no reason to anticipate any such action. **********A report that President Reagan telephoned Mrs. Thatcher Wednesday night is being interpreted by some officials here as a sign that the White House has also become aware of the shock waves the invasion has sent through the British political scene. **********The Government's political opponents, some of whom dislike the cruise missile in any form, have united in the demand that the Government block deployment of the weapons unless they are under the physical control of British forces. They argue that the Grenadian action shows that the United States is prone to react more aggressively than warranted and that its promises to consult are not reliable. **********President Reagan's speech Thursday night, which was televised live here, did nothing to change the well- drawn battlelines. **********''There's no such thing as an international search warrant,'' said George Walden, a Conservative Member of Parliament, when asked whether the discovery of arms caches linked to Cuba and the Soviet Union was properly cited by President Reagan as a justification for the invasion. **********Bonn Rebukes Reagan on Move BONN, Oct. 28 (Reuters) - The Reagan Administration's decision to lead an invasion of Grenada has hurt its credibility in a way that could significantly tilt the public debate over deploying United States nuclear missiles in West Germany, Western diplomats said today. **********The scope of the damage was hinted at by Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany in a special debate in Parliament on Thursday. **********Mr. Genscher said Bonn would have welcomed a chance to discuss United States plans that affected the West German Government ''politically as well as psychologically.''

After that setback occurs, the market will soar to new heights, according to the popular rationale. **********''The observation that a correction is overdue seems to be something of a consensus,'' said Robert J. Farrell of Merrill Lynch fully five weeks ago. ''The best we can say is that most observers have been predicting a correction for months simply because the rise has been so steep.'' **********At that time, the Dow Jones industrial average was at 1,052.98, having started its run at 776.92 on Aug. 12. Last Thursday, the Dow set a new closing high at 1,121.81. Yesterday, it dropped 8.32 points, to 1,112.62. **********In late January, Mr. Farrell also said that for three months about one-third of all investment advisory services had been looking for a correction. Meanwhile, of course, stocks kept rising. **********What might touch off a correction?  Block traders, analysts and other market professionals often respond by uttering two words: ''the unexpected.'' What unexpected event, then, might send stocks tumbling? **********One possibility would be a move by the Federal Reserve Board to tighten credit conditions and send interest rates sharply higher.  However, there seems little likelihood of such action since the Fed is leaning toward easier credit to stimulate the economy. **********Another possibility might be an early announcement by Paul A.  Volcker that he will retire as the Fed's chairman when his term expires in August. There is no hint this is going to happen, but if it did the stock and bond markets would sink because of the ensuing uncertainty. If world oil prices collapsed, that could jar the fragile balance of economies abroad and, perhaps, the fate of some banks in the United States. But, again, there is no evidence that oil at $20 a barrel is imminent. **********Some unexpected shock within the stock market itself could start a general price decline. One candidate might be a scandal in the hot new issue market. Speculation has become torrid in some technology and other companies selling stock publicly for the first time. **********One catch nowadays is that the so-called public, unlike the 1960's, consists mainly of institutions, hedge funds and well-heeled private investors. Hot issues are parceled out to these parties and they, in turn, often ''flip'' the stocks for a quick, almost sure-fire, profit. Thus, the new-issue market has become institutionalized just like the secondary trading market. **********Meanwhile, speculation in general has made the market more vulnerable to a correction, although some stockbrokers minimize the idea. **********One illustration of venturesome investor spirit is seen in a list of 35 stocks published on Jan. 5 by Standard & Poor's Outlook. This was clearly no roster of buy recommendations. The advisory service described the list as ''stocks you should avoid'' and it cited a reason in each case. **********When the market closed last Friday, all but eight of these issues carried higher prices than in early January. Most losers, moreover, were energy-related stocks, a particularly weak sector so far in 1983. **********People who say that some unexpected event will serve as the catalyst for a market correction could be dead wrong. Instead, stock prices might simply reach a level (''overextended,'' in the language of technical analysts) where they fall under their own weight. **********Some analysts have lately pointed to possible telltale signs of an impending decline. One example is the relative weakness in General Motors stock, which had been a market leader in the rally. **********What worries other analysts is a slowdown in trading volume. Record turnover accompanied the market's initial upthrust between August and November of 1982. **********A month ago, Prudential-Bache Securities forecast a 100-point correction in the Dow. Other brokerage firms, including Dean Witter Reynolds, have been predicting a pullback in prices. **********Merrill Lynch has talked of a correction for some time. In mid-February, it posed the possibility that the Dow could reach a new high ''of about 1,100 to 1,125.'' Moreover, since late December, the firm has cited the possibility of a 10 to 15 percent correction."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/26/business/crown-cork-seal-co-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 80, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CROWN CORK & SEAL CO INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "CROWN CORK & SEAL CO INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/28/business/advertising-ad-hall-of-fame-picks-4-more-industry-giants.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1983-11-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 299, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ad Hall of Fame Picks 4 More Industry Giants", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Ad Hall of Fame Picks 4 More Industry Giants", "body_text": " **********John Elliott Jr. of Ogilvy & Mather, Howard J.

On June 27 the United States Supreme Court ruled that unitary taxes are constitutional. It upheld a California law that had been challenged by the Container Corporation of America, a subsidiary of the Mobil Corporation. **********On July 12 the Florida Legislature narrowly approved a $237 million tax increase sought by Gov. Robert Graham to pay for improvements in the state's schools. Most of the increase, about $95 million, is to come from a worldwide unitary tax assessment.  Tax Also Applies to Exports **********While corporations in Florida previously paid state income taxes based on the percentage of their nationwide profit that was generated in the state, worldwide earnings will now be considered. And profits on exports by Florida corporations will no longer be deductible from state income tax returns. **********The new tax has infuriated the leaders of many large Florida businesses. **********''This law will almost completely negate the state's efforts to bring new industry into Florida,'' said Edward Bleckner Jr., president of Racal- Milgo Inc. in Miami. **********Racal-Milgo, a manufacturer of data communications equipment, is owned by Racal Electronics P.L.C. of Britain. Because the new law requires Racal-Milgo to consider exports from Florida and its corporate parent's earnings in calculating its state income tax, Mr. Bleckner said, the company's tax bill could more than double. **********The International Business Machines Corporation, which builds personal computers and robotic systems at Boca Raton, calculates that its Florida taxes will double, to $11.6 million, from $5.8 million. ''We are disappointed and dismayed with the enactment of the unitary tax in Florida,'' I.B.M. said in a statement that called the tax ''unfair and discriminatory.''

Both Illinois and New York recently backed away from unitary taxation. If Florida keeps the new tax, critics maintain, the state's growth could be jeopardized. **********For two consecutive years a Chicago accounting firm, Alexander Grant & Company, has ranked Florida as the leading state in the nation for starting a business. Tom Cox, a researcher at the firm, said unitary taxation would put Florida at a ''competitive disadvantage.''  New Status for Subsidiaries **********Until now, a foreign company could set up a subsidiary in Florida and pay no state income tax until the new venture itself made a profit. Under worldwide unitary taxation, however, such a venture could owe taxes from the very beginning on the basis of non-Florida earnings. **********Exporters in Florida also must pay the new tax. Previously companies were allowed to deduct the profits from any sales made outside the United States. **********In the past decade, Miami and suburban Coral Gables have become home to the Latin American sales offices of nearly 100 multinational corporations. These units have paid virtually no Florida income taxes because most of their sales are in international markets. **********Florida's exports have already been hampered by economic troubles in Latin America. **********''This additional tax could well be the straw that breaks the camel's back,'' said Coleman Travelstead, executive vice president of the International Center of Florida, a nonprofit business association in Coral Gables.

The debt principal for those years is now due in 1986 and 1987. **********Interest Still Being Negotiated **********Christoph von der Decken, a board member of the Dresdner Bank, which is the coordinator for Poland's Western creditor banks, said at a news conference in Frankfurt that the banks were ready to postpone payment of the $16 billion debt principal until 1989, when the entire amount would be due. But he said the banks were still trying to negotiate an agreement on the $9 billion in interest that would be owed on this principal this year through 1985. **********The Polish Government has said that it would pay the full interest for the three years if the banks agreed to return some of the $9 billion, a procedure they followed for interest payments owed last year. Mr. von der Decken said that the banks were still considering the Polish proposal. He said the main issue was how much of the $9 billion would have to be relent to Poland through 1985. **********Although banks often agree to stretch repayment of principal on outstanding loans, they rarely agree to postpone interest payments.  The decision to in effect postpone some interest payments last year and the readiness now to reach a three-year agreement on debt principal reflect Western concern that if these concessions are not made, Poland would default on its debt, Mr. von der Decken said. **********The proposed three-year rescheduling agreement was the subject of negotations in Warsaw this week between Polish officials and representatives of a six-member group of Western banks.

But the officials said that the latest Soviet comment was not necessarily a considered response to the detailed proposal.

However, it seemed likely that the writers had been briefed on the outline of the proposals that was put to Soviet negotiators in Geneva last week when the missile talks resumed after a summer recess. The chief Soviet representative, Yuli A. Kvitsinsky, told reporters after the Geneva session that he had heard nothing to make him hopeful about a breakthrough in the talks.   Higher Global Limit **********Reagan Administration officials said Friday that the centerpiece of Mr. Reagan's proposals is a recommendation for a higher global limit on medium-range missile warheads than the United States had previously suggested. But the proposals are expected to hold out for an equal limit on the number of those warheads that may be stationed in Europe, at a level that would require a sharp cut in the existing Soviet arsenal. **********Pravda said the outline of the proposals in the Western press indicated that they were ''nothing new'' and that they still sought to secure the ''unilateral disarmament'' of the Soviet Union in Europe. In this context, the paper said, the proposals could only be seen as a bid to sabotage the Geneva talks and guarantee that new U.S. missiles would be deployed in Europe as scheduled, beginning in December. **********A Tass report from West Germany said that the American proposals still omitted ''one of the issues without a solution to which an agreement is impossible,'' the Soviet demand that British and French missiles be counted on the Western side at the Geneva talks. The Kremlin has offered to cut its missiles in Europe to the level of the British and French arsenals, 162 missiles, if the United States cancels plans to deploy 572 new missiles of its own.   Eroding Equilibrium **********''The United States, as before, is pressing the U.S.S.R. into consenting to a unilateral disarmament in the face of NATO's nuclear rearmament in Europe, clearly with the aim of eroding the military equilibrium existing there and acquiring superiority over the U.S.S.R. and its allies,'' Tass said. **********It added: ''Any well-informed person should realize that the 'new initiatives' of the U.S.A. are nothing else than an old version unacceptable to the Soviet Union.'' **********Another Tass item asked: ''Why did the White House need this cheap trick?

Agreement Still Possible **********A recent series of apparently high- level pronouncements on the missile issue from Moscow have repeated that agreement in Geneva is still possible if the United States abandons its ''unrealistic'' course and accepts the principle of ''equality,'' as defined by the Kremlin. **********The pronouncements by Yuri V. Andropov, the Soviet leader; Marshal Nikolai V. Ogarkov, the chief of the Soviet General Staff, and Nikolai A. Tikhonov, the Prime Minister, have all implied that compromises at this point must come from the United States. **********The Kremlin has demanded not only that the British and French missiles be included in the Geneva count on medium-range missiles, but also that any agreement void altogether the plan for new American missiles in Europe."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/09/world/east-german-says-missiles-hurt-ties-with-west-germany.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "East German Says Missiles Hurt Ties With West Germany", "print_headline": "East German Says Missiles Hurt Ties With West Germany", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Willi Stoph of East Germany said today that West Germany's decision to accept the deployment of American missiles had damaged relations between the two German states. **********Mr. Stoph said in a speech in Parliament that West Germany had been warned and must now take responsibility for the deterioration.

There is a double pattern: one minute, a candidate for the City Council can roar about a dozen celery stalks left negligently on the sidewalk; seconds later, he may turn from garbage to national invective, insisting that Socialism's incompetence is driving France to ruin, or that returning Mayor Jacques Chirac to office means supporting a reactionary. **********According to a poll this week, the second, or unofficial, election is the one that interests Paris voters the most. Some 67 percent said they wanted to express their attitude about the national Government through their local ballot, and only 23 percent said they did not. **********A Long Maneuvering Process **********The points that will be scored now by Mr. Chirac or his opponents are not only part of a long maneuvering process, building and dismantling individual political reputations, but they also count as messages to the Government of President Francois Mitterrand from the electorate on his operating margins for the years until the legislative elections in 1986. **********The voting in Paris, where Mr. Chirac has held office for six years, is the reverse of the situation in a majority of French cities since the municipal elections of 1977, when left-wing gains began to open the route to the presidency. **********The capital's voting patterns are generally oriented away from left-wing candidates, and the national Government, apparently seeking to undercut Paris's status as a potential conservative bastion, talked early last year about a law that would have distributed many of the Mayor's prerogatives to district councils. The intent seemed transparent, and after considerable public resistance here, the Government switched course, settling for a limited revision of the city's statute that leaves the Mayor's office as a meaningful power base. **********Outside Paris the left expects to take substantial losses in the municipal voting but, according to a Socialist planner, it sees the capital as a potential windfall because any gains against the heavily favored Mr. Chirac would be impressive. The operative tactic appeared to be to concentrate on the so-called reactionary Mayor as a national symbol and avoid what would otherwise be a defensive or passive campaign. Attacks on Mayor Chirac **********The attacks on the Mayor have been two-tiered to fit the double sense of the election. On the national level, such a leading Socialist as Pierre Joxe described Mr. Chirac, a potential presidential candidate in 1988, as the ''most reactionary, the most frightening face on the French right.'' **********Calling him right-wing was insufficient for Le Nouvel Observateur, a weekly close to the Socialist Party; it painted Mr. Chirac, who leads the neo-Gaullists, as a man of ''the authoritarian right.'' And although the Mayor's powers fall far short of the intentions ascribed to him, Paul Quiles, the Socialist candidate, accused Mr.  Chirac of representing cuts in social services, an ''economic and social about-face.'' **********Mr. Quiles also attacked the weakest part of Mr. Chirac's local record, the city's acknowledged failure to build as much new housing as he said it would in 1977. The Mayor promised 5,000 new units a year, and the result is substantially less. For Mr. Quiles this is the symbol of Mr. Chirac's hardened attitude toward the world, and a situation that is making Paris into a city of the rich and the poor. **********Mr. Quiles, who is the third-ranking figure in the national Socialist Party hierarchy, has not turned out to be the ideal candidate. A handsome man at age 41, he became slightly ridiculous when an overeager poster campaign emphasizing his blue eyes gave the candidate the look of a hypnotized Paul Newman. Slogan Has Little Effect **********His trademark slogan, ''Paris - Tenderness,'' aimed at suggesting that Mr. Chirac is harsh by contrast, had little effect, because he got into arguments on radio and television and projected more of a cold grip than an embrace. Now Mr. Quiles is given virtually no chance of victory; more important, the **********Socialist Party in Paris seems less likely now than a month ago to do well.  Mr. Chirac has adopted the same local-national approach. He stopped by this week at the construction site of the Bercy Sports Palace, grinned furiously and left. The complex will not be completed for six months, but it seemed the right time for the Mayor to get his picture taken there. Most of his campaigning is done on busy shopping streets, where he reminds voters of his real successes, including advantages for the aged like boat trips, and a modernized sanitation department whose innovations include a motor bike patrol specializing in removing dog droppings. **********The link to national issues usually comes with a question, asked of a shopkeeper, such as ''How's business?'' Whatever the answer, it gives Mr. Chirac a chance to take his best shot at Socialism. **********''It's the system itself that's eating into our freedoms, our individual freedoms,'' he says. ''They hired 200,000 more civil servants nationwide, but I haven't a single new policeman or nurse in Paris. Where are these new functionaries? They're in the offices preparing the new laws that each day limit our individual liberties.'' Embarrassing the Socialists **********With his own victory seemingly assured - technically, the Mayor is elected by a vote of the City Council -Mr. Chirac has spent much time in districts where he thinks there is some chance of embarrassing other leading Socialists besides Mr. Quiles. **********With his help, City Council candidates allied to centrist and conservative parties have a chance at defeating Lionel Jospin, the secretary general of the Socialist Party, Culture Minister Jack Lang, and Edwige Avice, who is Minister for Leisure, Youth and Sports. **********Although Mr. Chirac does not say it, he is also running more than a just a little bit against the other two main opposition figures, former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and his former Prime Minister, Raymond Barre. Beyond the attention from news organizations that he has already received, an outstanding result in Paris would serve to give the Mayor more strength for the maneuvering within the opposition, likely to go for the next five years, to decide who it will run for President in 1988. **********Both Mr. Giscard d'Estaing and Mr. Barre have been campaigning hard, supporting allied candidates and attacking the Socialist Government in general. But Mr. Barre has no local constituency, and Mr. Giscard d'Estaing is not running for anything either; he has left that to his wife, a political debutante, who is seeking election to the Town Council of Chanonat, Pop. 649."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/14/business/morgan-s-net-income-climbs-37.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Bennett", "pub_date": "1983-04-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 786, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MORGAN'S NET INCOME CLIMBS 37%", "print_headline": "MORGAN'S NET INCOME CLIMBS 37%", "body_text": " **********J.P.

On a per-share basis, net income rose to $2.76, from $2.09. The company's primary subsidiary is the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, the nation's fifth-largest bank. **********The surge in earnings occurred despite a quadrupling of the provision for loan losses, to $70 million, from $17 million in the period a year earlier.

This widened to 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 1983, from 2.6 percent in the comparable period of 1982. In addition to the wider spread, Morgan's earning assets increased by $4 billion, to $50.1 billion. The combined result was a $73.8 million rise in interest income net of interest expense, to $302.9 million. **********Morgan's earnings from foreign exchange trading was also an important element in the rise in net income. In the first quarter of 1983, these profits amounted to $36.3 million, compared with a $2.5 million loss in the period a year earlier. The result was a positive swing of $38.8 million. **********Net income was also helped by a smaller loss, $3.9 million, from securities transactions. The loss amounted to $32.8 million in the first quarter of 1982. Until this quarter, gains and losses from securities transactions had been reported separately and most analysts had concentrated on net operating earnings before securities transactions. That was because banks often purposely take losses by selling low-yielding securities from their portfolios to reduce their taxes. The losses eventually are recouped because the proceeds from the sales are invested in higher-yielding securities. **********As a result of the $3.9 million loss from securities trading in the latest quarter, Morgan obtained a tax benefit of $2.7 million, while the tax benefit from last year's $32.8 million loss was $19.3 million, Morgan said. The change in accounting procedures was mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and all bank holding companies must comply with the new rules by the end of this year. Most, however, are putting the new reporting system into effect this quarter. **********Morgan said that its annual rate of return on each $100 of average assets, a key indicator of a bank's basic profitability, rose to 81 cents in the first quarter of 1983, from 64 cents in the period a year earlier. Its return on each $100 of common shareholders' equity rose to $16.95, from $14.28. Marine Midland **********The Marine Midland Banks Inc., the nation's 16th-largest bank holding company, reported that its first-quarter net income rose 17.6 percent, to $23.4 million, or $1.19 a share, from $19.9 million, or $1.04 a share, in the comparable period of 1982. **********Marine's provision for loan losses rose to $23.1 million, from $15.3 million in the first quarter of 1981, and its problem loans rose to $490 million, or 2.4 percent of total assets, from $320 million, or 1.7 percent of total assets. **********Its annual rate of return on each $100 of total average assets rose to 45 cents, from 42 cents in the period a year earlier. Irving Bank **********The Irving Bank Corporation reported a 15.5 percent rise in firstquarter net income, to $24.1 million, or $2.52 a share, from $20.8 million, or $2.37 a share. The provision for loan losses dropped to $6.8 million, from $8.8 million, and problem loans rose to $247.2 million, or 2.39 percent of total loans, from $193.1 million, or 1.92 percent of the total, in the first quarter of 1982. **********Irving's annual rate of return on each $100 of average total assets rose to 50 cents, from 46 cents."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/14/business/credit-markets-uncertainty-on-money-data.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1983-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 826, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UNCERTAINTY ON MONEY DATA", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; UNCERTAINTY ON MONEY DATA", "body_text": " **********The importance assigned by the financial markets to changes in the nation's money supply has varied widely in recent years and is still in a state of flux. **********The afternoon money supply announcement Friday had little effect on interest rates, which had increased modestly earlier in the day. But in previous days' trading, rapid money supply growth was worrisome enough to cause yields for notes and bonds to rise more than a quarter of a percentage point. **********From October 1979 to October 1982, the weekly money supply annmouncement was often the biggest event of each week and would send prices up or down, depending on whether the money supply seemed to be growing slower or faster than the Fed's growth targets. **********Beginning last October, however, money supply data seemed to wane in importance as Fed officials stressed that the data were distorted by new kinds of bank accounts and an abnormal tendency of the public to hold money in checking accounts at a time of high unemployment and poor economic conditions. Watching the Money Supply **********Along with those explanations, the Fed encouraged lower short-term rates in the last months of 1982, even though most measures of money supply growth were far above target at the time. **********Last week, however, there were signs that yet another change of fashion might be in the offing when the Federal Reserve chairman, Paul A. Volcker, referred on two occasions to rapid money supply growth as a problem. His most forceful comments were on March 8 when he told the House Budget Committee that money supply growth was faster than expected, was ''something we have to keep our eye on very closely'' and was not consistent with continued reductions in inflation. **********Robert S. Smith, an economist at the Chase Manhattan Bank, said in a recent issue of International Finance that the Fed might be less willing to tolerate faster-than-targeted money supply growth because of ''evidence from an as-yet-unreleased Fed survey of banks.'' According to Mr. Smith, the survey showed that the introduction of Super NOW accounts and money market accounts had ''depressed rather than stimulated'' the growth of M-1, the basic measure of the money supply. Signs of Fed Policy Sought **********Though there is a growing sense that money supply growth can not be easily dismissed as the result of new accounts, there is no agreement about what the Federal Reserve's response will be in coming weeks. **********Mr. Smith, for example, said that Mr. Volcker's comments ''may be a signal that a more stringent policy is in the offing.'' Elliott Platt, an economist at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, suggested that the Fed might keep its policy unchanged. He said: ''There is a lot of interest-sensitive money that is now parked in bank accounts because rates on other instruments have declined. The question is whether all this money will be turned into transactions accounts.'' **********If the money were to stay in the banking sytem and be used for spending and not as an investment, economists would conclude that the Fed has supplied too much credit to the banking sytem and thereby paved the way for more inflation in future years. **********Other economists expect lower interest rates in coming weeks. They reason that the Fed's primary concern is still the economy and that economic recovery will not be sustained without further rate declines. **********Traders keep track of the economic arguments, but their overriding concern is with the immediate condition of the market. Outlook for Short-Term Rates **********To many, Mr. Volcker's comments were enough to erase the last hopes for a decline in short-term rates before the Treasury's auctions later this month. Without declines in short-term rates, they reasoned that it would be more difficult to sell the heavy supply of forthcoming Treasury issues. The result was a decline last Friday in the price of the bellwether 10 3/8 percent bonds to 96 7/8 to yield 10.72 percent. As recently as March 4 the same issue was traded at 99 1/2 to yield 10.43 percent. **********Of course, money supply growth is not the only concern. Maury N.  Harris, vice president at Paine Webber Inc., said in a recent publication that ''the issues of the Fed chairmanship and the Federal budget are probably the two most important keys'' to a sustainable decline in Treasury bond yields to the 9 1/2 percent area. **********Henry Kaufman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, urged last week that President Reagan reappoint Mr. Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board when his term expires next August. Since the Fed's monetary policy is to be guided by judgments about the economy and inflation rather than to be a mechanical response to the money supply, it is important that the Fed chairman be someone of broad experience, Mr. Kaufman said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/09/world/around-the-world-seoul-opposition-leader-ends-a-hunger-strike.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 148, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Seoul Opposition Leader Ends a Hunger Strike", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Seoul Opposition Leader Ends a Hunger Strike", "body_text": " **********Kim Young Sam, a former opposition leader, said today that he had ended a hunger strike he began 23 days ago, but that he would press his struggle for democratic political changes. **********Mr. Kim, once rated a presidential contender, said in a statement that he had given up the fast because of pleas from supporters, family members and others. **********He said there had also been an effort by the South Korean Government authorities to bring an end to the hunger strike by moving him to a hospital from his Seoul home, where he began the fast on May 18, two days after he had issued a declaration outlining his demands for democratic change. **********The 55-year-old dissident lay motionless and feeble in his hospital bed, eyes closed, while his secretary read the statement to reporters."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/10/business/phone-rates-are-in-midst-of-upheaval.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1983-10-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1356, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PHONE RATES ARE IN MIDST OF UPHEAVAL", "print_headline": "PHONE RATES ARE IN MIDST OF UPHEAVAL", "body_text": " **********The plan by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company to charge 75 cents for long-distance calls for directory information is the latest example of an idea that could radically change how telephone users pay for services. **********The idea is to charge separately for each component of service, so that those who use a particular service pay for it. It is similar to the process that took place during the oil shortage of the late 1970's when some gasoline stations began charging for road maps and for pumping air into tires. **********The changes are scheduled because of increasing competition in the telephone industry, spurred by the breakup of the Bell System scheduled for Jan. 1. This increased competition is ending the distortion of economics involved in setting fees for various telephone services that prevailed in the past, when the phone system was run as a monopoly of A.T. & T. **********The new directory assistance charge, which was announced last week and is to take effect on Jan. 1, would apply to 600 million interstate information calls each year now made at no charge by dialing the area code plus 555-1212. **********The charge, which still requires approval by the Federal Communications Commission, is only one such new charge that consumers will see, according to telephone company officials and industry analysts. **********In what would be an even more radical departure, some analysts expect the telephone company to move increasingly toward billing consumers for all their use of the phone system, even for calls that are not completed because the line is busy or the call is not answered. **********That is not likely to happen immediately for general telephone calls, but it is already starting to happen for special types of calls. The new cellular mobile telephone service that is scheduled to start in Chicago this week will bill by the minute, starting from the time the receiver is taken off the hook, so that even uncompleted calls will incur some charge. **********A.T.& T. has also been exploring the possibility of charging something for person-to-person calls, even if the call does not reach the intended party. The reasoning is that those who try such calls should pay something to cover the cost of the operator's time. **********Another example of the trend is the new $2 monthly access charge that will be added to phone bills starting in January. Telephone installation, once subsidized by general rates, is now being broken out separately, so that installing a phone in New York now costs as much as $98.20, compared to $10 in 1970. And consumers who can now make unlimited local calls for a flat fee are finding the telephone company is trying to convert to the type of system long used in New York, in which people pay by the call. **********Unbundling of Charges **********The process of charging separately for different services is known as unbundling, and economists say it is often fairer and more efficient than the old practice of bundling directory assistance into overall long-distance service or bundling road maps into gasoline service. **********''It's an inescapable consequence of competition and indeed, it's a virtue of competition,'' said Alfred Kahn, a professor of economics at Cornell and former chairman of the New York State Public Service Commission. **********Imposing a charge for something cuts down on the waste that occurs when something appears to be free, economists say. Also, those who do not use directory assistance end up paying higher rates for telephone calls to pay for those who do use the free services. **********Nevertheless, unbundling can provoke indignation because people get used to having certain things for free. ''Something that's been given away free for 20 years takes on the character of an inalienable right,'' said Lee Selwyn, president of Economics and Technology Inc., a Boston consulting firm on telephone rate matters. **********Verification Difficult **********Moreover, critics of A.T.& T. often charge the company with bundling or unbundling for its own competitive advantage and not for reasons of fairness. They say the phone system is so complex that it is impossible to verify independently what the phone company says it costs to provide individual services. **********Critics are already charging that the proposed directory assistance charge is too high and is unfair because there is little alternative. Unlike local directory assistance charges, consumers cannot easily avoid long-distance directory charges by using the telephone book. **********''People will be paying more money for a cost they can't avoid,'' said Samuel A. Simon, executive director of the Telecommunications Research and Action Center, a consumer group. **********A.T.& T. said the company will not make a profit on directory assistance. It said it will be billed an average of 64 cents by the local telephone companies in each city, which will actually provide the service and which will be separated from A.T.& T. on Jan. 1. A.T.& T. said it would cost the company 11 cents on average to transmit the directory calls over its long-distance lines to the destination cities. **********Wasteful Calling **********All the arguments in favor of unbundling are used by A.T.& T. in its defense. One is that it will cut out wasteful calling. **********''I had a roommate once that didn't know what a telephone directory was,'' said Robert Self, a consultant on long-distance rates. ''He didn't even remember his mother's number. Every time he'd make a call he'd call directory assistance because it was free.'' **********Another reason is fairness. A.T.& T. said that a survey it took shows that use of directory assistance is highly concentrated. Over a three- month period, only 2.3 percent of residential customers and 27 percent of business customers used interstate directory assistance. If A.T.& T.'s cost figure of 75 cents is valid, then long-distance rates for everyone are about 2 percent higher to pay for directory assistance used by a small segment of customers. **********Some large corporations with their own communications networks also may be using interstate directory assistance to avoid local directory assistance, for which there is a charge, according to Kenneth L. Phillips, a vice president of Citicorp and chairman of the Corporate Committee of Telecommunications Users, an organization of corporate telecommunications users. **********A company in New York could route its local directory assistance calls over its own lines to New Jersey and then send them back over A.T.& T.'s lines to New York as free interstate directory assistance calls, he said. ''This is a technique in the telecommunications business that has been known for many years and is called the rusty switch,'' Mr. Phillips said. **********While such arguments for a directory assistance charge might be convincing, they are not A.T.& T.'s primary reasons for acting. If A.T.& T. was solely interested in fairness and preventing waste, it would have started charging for directory assistance years ago. The new factor that tipped the balance is competition. **********Competitive Services Used **********When A.T.& T. was a monopoly it was advantageous to offer free directory assistance because it encouraged overall calling, which increased the company's profits. But now A.T.& T. is finding that some customers are obtaining numbers for free and then making the actual calls over competing long-distance services, such as those offered by the MCI Communications Corporation and GTE-Sprint. **********That means that A.T.& T. customers are paying higher rates to finance directory assistance used by customers of MCI and Sprint. It also means that A.T.& T. rates have to be that much higher than those of its competitors because it alone shoulders the costs of directory assistance. **********For consumers, there is little choice right now, other than trying to write down numbers so that they do not have to needlessly call directory assistance. **********Analysts expect corporations, which will incur the largest directory assistance charges, to take more stringent steps. They might order phone books from around the country and urge employees to use them. Some large corporations might even set up their own in-house operators to look up numbers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/18/business/danish-jobless-rate-up.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 31, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Danish Jobless Rate Up", "print_headline": "Danish Jobless Rate Up", "body_text": " **********Denmark's unemployment in January increased to 319,300 people, or 12.2 percent of the labor force, the Government reported today.

And in 1981, for the first time, more foreigners than Americans received American doctoral degrees in engineering. **********Some universities say that without the foreign students, they would not have the faculty or the students to maintain engineering departments. And some high-technology companies say that the industry is in such dire need of engineers that without foreign engineering students they would be forced, as some already have been, to move some of their operations outside the country. **********This point of view was enunciated earlier this month by John Calhoun, director of business development at the Intel Corporation in Santa Clara, Calif. In testimony before a subcommittee of the House of Representatives considering immigration changes, Mr. Calhoun said: ''The problem is absolutely one of a shortage and not one of lower-cost labor. We in the industry have been forced to hire immigrants in order to grow.'' **********Some groups of engineers, on the other hand, say that there is no shortage, that in fact the foreign engineers who remain in the United States after having completed their education reduce the number of jobs and depress salaries. What is needed, they say, is not more engineers, but further training for engineers already in the work force. **********The position opposed to Mr. Calhoun's was voiced at the same hearing by Dr. David Lewis, chairman of the Career Activities Council of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.  Citing data from a nationwide survey showing that salaries had decreased in constant dollars, he said: ''If there were a shortage of engineers, their salaries would have risen.'' **********Now, the world's governments have entered the debate. Taiwan has taken steps to reverse what it calls the ''brain drain'' to the other nations. The United Nations has adopted a resolution calling upon its members to adopt policies to mitigate the damages caused by the reverse transfer of technology. And Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, and Representative Romano L. Mazzoli, Democrat of Kentucky, have introduced immigration-reform bills that would require all foreign students to return to their home countries for two years after they complete their studies here. SUBCOMMITTEE hearings held this month on the Simpson and Mazzoli b ills have provided the most recent forum for the debate. But in t estimony from engineers, universities and industry, the statistics u sed to bolster one side of the argument often contradict those used f or the other side, and those involved say that much of the relevant i nformation is out of date. **********What is clear from the hearings, however, is that the increase in the number of foreign engineering students, and further projected increases, have fueled the debate over whether they should be allowed to remain in the United States after having received their degrees. **********According to the Institute of International Education, foreignstudent enrollment in the United States increased 6 percent in the academic year that started last September, from 307,696 in the 1981 academic year to 326,299 in 1982. Foreign students made up 2.6 percent of the total United States enrollment in higher education. A sharp decline in the number of Iranian students was cited as the reason why last year's increase lagged behind the 8 percent increase from 1980 to 1981. **********In 1982, 23 percent of all foreign students in American universities were majoring in engineering, the largest proportion since the institute began conducting its annual census of foreign students in 1950. There were also increases in the proportion of foreign students who chose business, management, mathematics and computer sciences over the natural and social sciences and humanitites. Such a distribution demonstrates ''the vocational orientation of foreign students,'' according to the survey. **********In the 1980-81 academic year were more doctoral degrees in engineering were awarded to foreign students than to American students, according to the National Research Council. The council reported that 49.1 percent of the engineering doctorates went to foreign students, while Americans earned 46.2 percent. The nationalities of the remaining 4.7 percent of the students was unknown. **********Just how many foreign engineering graduates have returned to their home countries in the last five years has not been documented. The most recent study was conducted by the United States Department of Labor in 1978. In a wide-ranging survey of the aliens holding nonimmigrant visas, it reported that one out of three foreign students did not return to their countries after having finished their education here. **********Both immigration bills introduced in Congress last month would require all foreign students to return to their home countries for at least two years if they wish to come back to the United States. Both bills include sections that would waive the two-year rule for foreign students who marry United States citizens or who, depending on their degree, receive an offer for a job that the Labor Department has certified no American is available to fill. THE Senate version of the bill, however, specifies that no more than1 ,500 aliens who marry citizens can apply for permanent residence andn o more than 4,500 aliens who receive job offers can apply. The Housev ersion also restricts the number of foreign students who can remain h ere by limiting it to those who apply before 1989. **********The Senate passed its version last August, but the House bill failed to reach a vote before adjournment last December. In reaction to last year's bills, a meeting at Snowbird, Utah, of the heads of computer-science and computer-engineering departments unanimously adopted a resolution that recommended that the proposed legislation be amended to retain or ease provisions of current immigration law in their fields. **********In the hearings in mid-March on the new bill before the House Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees, and International Law, Dr.  Lewis, who said he represented the views of 43 engineering societies, testified that there should be no exemptions to the twoyear rule because there was no shortage of engineers here. **********''Some organizations have claimed that a critical shortage of engineers and computer scientists already exists,'' he testified.  ''They argue that the foreign engineering students should be allowed to stay in the country to replace the alleged critical shortfall of engineering manpower. The Engineering Affairs Council disagrees with that position.'' **********Dr. Lewis, who is the chairman of the Career Activities Council of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, argued that if there were a shortage of engineers their salaries would have risen. **********''In fact, the recent I.E.E.E. salary survey data for 1981 shows no significant escalation.'' he added. ''In fact, our data base shows that the second lowest-paid engineering specialty is computer science, the specialty in which the shortage is supposed to be most acute.'' **********The survey reported that the average salary among a group of 6,702 engineers was $36,867 in 1981. In 1972, the average for a similar sample group was $19,100. Adjusted to compensate for inflation, the 1981 salary corresponded to $17,733 in 1972 dollars. And the higher the income level, the more the engineers lost in ''real income,'' the survey reported. **********Mr. Calhoun, of the Intel Corporation, testified before the subcommittee on behalf of the American Electronics Association, a national trade association for more than 2,000 electronics companies. He said there was in fact a shortage of engineers, that salaries had increased to reflect the demand, and that industry and universities needed the foreign engineering students to meet the demand. **********A study by the American Electronics Association of 610 companies in 1981 projected that there would be an annual shortfall of 20,000 engineering graduates in electrical and computer-science engineering through 1985. In addition, a survey of 1982 salaries published this month showed that the average salary among 67,000 nonsupervisory engineers with degrees increased 9 percent from what it was in 1981. **********He noted that at Intel foreign engineers make up 50 percent of the M.S. degree graduates, and 66 percent of the Ph.D. graduates hired through the United States university system. **********''The shortage is so severe that Intel has already opened design facilities in Israel, France and Japan simply due to the availability of highly skilled technical talent,'' he added. ''Experience has shown that costs of operating an R & D (research and development) facility in these developed countries are no lower than for operating a similar facility in the U.S., but these other countries do have a better supply of engineers.'' **********Other high-technology companies including Atari Inc., National Semiconductor, Wang Laboratories and the Apple Computer Company have moved some of their operations overseas. Such moves by American hightechnology companies give an ironic twist to the political battles being waged over what many developing countries see as the drain of their highly skilled workers to countries where salaries and standards of living are higher. **********The most recent example was a resolution adopted by the General Assembly at the United Nations last Dec. 20. The resolution recommended that members ''should, as a matter of urgency, give due consideration to the formulation of policies with a view to mitigating the adverse consequences of the reverse transfer of technology.'' It also recommended that developed countries ''should assist and support the efforts of the developing countries towards the full utilization of their own trained personnel in promoting their economic and social development.'' The United States, Britain, France, Italy and many of the other developed countries voted against the resolution."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/28/business/dealer-files-chapter-11.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 186, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dealer Files Chapter 11", "print_headline": "Dealer Files Chapter 11", "body_text": " **********Attorneys for the International Gold Bullion Exchange, the gold and silver dealer closed under court order last week, filed petitions in United States Bankruptcy Court here today, seeking to reorganize the company's corporations in Florida, Texas and California under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. **********Filed with the petition were eight cardboard boxes containing names and addresses, on the exchange's stationery, of an estimated 25,000 investors owed money by the company. **********Documents filed with the petitions list the firm's largest creditors as: Dr. Lam (no first name listed) of Boca Raton, Fla., in the amount of $400,000; Elsworth Decker, a trustee for Florence Decker, Elmira, N.Y., for the amount of $300,000; St. Michael's Church of Life in Unionville, Conn., for $278,000; the Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for $270,931.97, and Edwin T.

A Court of Inquiry **********Serious offenses must first be reviewed by a court of inquiry, similar to a civilian grand jury, that is convened by the specific service involved, the lawyers said. This kind of court can recommend the initiation of court-martial proceedings, subject to approval by the Secretary of the service. **********If lesser forms of punishment appear appropriate, the chief of a service or a senior officer can issue a reprimand, suspend pay or take other actions that would block further advancement. **********Defense Department officials said that if the performance of General Kelley or any other service chief was questioned, the individual would not be involved in decisions about disciplinary action. The officials said they did not know whether General Kelley took part in the segment of the service chiefs' meeting today that was devoted to discussing the Long commission report. **********Mr. Weinberger, in his television interview, defended General Kelley on one issue stemming from the bombing, saying that the Commandant did not intentionally mislead Congress in testimony about the attack in the days after the explosion. **********In its report this week, the Investigations subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee challenged the accuracy of information provided by General Kelley in that testimony.   'Conflicting Materials' **********''Paul Kelley was reporting what was made available to him at that time, but he certainly wasn't reporting anything that he knew to be wrong,'' Mr. Weinberger said.

Stonehill did not have a single buy or sell order for shares of Southwestern Bell. **********''Everything can change with one order,'' he said hopefully, his face clearly showing disappointment and his hands nervously tearing apart the top of a used pad. **********Mr. Stonehill, a partner in the firm of La Branche & Company, was the specialist designated to supervise trading on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in Southwestern Bell, one of seven regional holding companies being shed by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. Southwestern is the one that will serve Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. **********Last week, Mr. Stonehill had predicted ''big volume'' in the stock - perhaps 400,000 to 500,000 shares - because there were so many opinions about the proper price of each of the regionals. **********That volume never materialized yesterday. Five minutes before trading began, Mr. Stonehill did get his first orders. But, for the day, he handled only 291,000 shares of Southwestern - the lowest volume for any of the seven regionals - and unexpectedly had time to trade other stocks for which his firm is a specialist. **********It was ''a bit of a letdown,'' Mr. Stonehill admitted. ''I think people sat back and waited for the smoke to clear,'' he said after the market's close. Still, he predicted that yesterday's low volume in all the regionals would increase in the coming months as A.T.& T.'s shareholders decide which of the regional shares to keep. Trading in the stripped-down parent was quite high yesterday. **********A.T.& T. will be divesting itself of the regionals on Jan. 1, with stockholders receiving one share of each regional for every 10 shares of the parent. The trading that began yesterday is on a ''when-issued'' basis because new stock certificates will not be sent out until Feb. 15. **********Trading in every stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange is supervised by a specialist like Mr. Stonehill, whose job is to smooth trading and keep prices from fluctuating too violently. The specialist does this by matching up the buy and sell orders of the brokers who congregate in front of him. And in about one of five trades, he buys or sells shares himself to expedite trading when there are more buy than sell orders, or vice versa. **********This trading for the specialist firm's own account, while sometimes risky, can be quite profitable because the specialist makes part of his money, like any other trader, on the rise or fall of a stock's price. The specialist also collects a fee for handling ''limit orders,'' clients' orders to buy or sell, but only at a specific price. **********Intense Competition for Listings **********An allocation committee of nine stock exchange members divided the new regional companies among the exchange's specialist firms after looking at their capital base and previous record at helping to smooth trading. Competition for the listings was intense, with La Branche winning the stripped-down A.T.& T. and Southwestern Bell, in addition to keeping the original A.T.& T. until its trading stops on Feb. 15. **********As intense as the competition was for listings, so, too, was the preparation for yesterday's trading. Each specialist had to be particularly familiar with his company because he had to set the opening price for his stock and did not have an initial offering price or a previous day's price on which to rely. **********Mr. Stonehill, a 47-year-old, second- generation specialist with 20 years of experience, said he had been studying Southwestern Bell for about three months, ''and certainly for the last two to three weeks on an ongoing basis.'' Recently, he had almost daily meetings with traders and analysts on Wall Street, the last of them on Friday. **********An Early Arrival **********After a weekend of ''getting rid of a lot of aggression on the squash court,'' Mr. Stonehill arrived yesterday at 8 A.M., almost an hour-and- a-half earlier than usual. He assured visitors that ''I'm all set,'' and accepted numerous wishes of ''good luck'' from floor brokers and exchange officials. **********By the time the stock exchange opened its computers to receive buy and sell orders at 8:30, Mr. Stonehill was anxiously awaiting his. **********At 9:15, there were still no orders, but Mr. Stonehill told R. Peter Sullivan 3d, a floor governor helping him to price the stock, that the ''consensus'' on Wall Street was an opening price of about $62, which would mean a 9 percent dividend yield. At 9:30, Mr. Stonehill issued his first price range for the stock, indicating it would open somewhere between $60 and $67. At 9:45, he had narrowed the range to $62 and $67. But there were still no orders. **********Finally, at 9:55, five minutes before the opening, they arrived. ''I knew it would have to come from the arbitragers, and they're always the last to come in,'' Mr. Stonehill said, referring to the professional traders. He admitted to being ''a little relieved.'' **********'A Shot in the Dark' **********Seconds after the 10 o'clock bell, Mr. Stonehill opened Southwestern Bell by handling a block of 49,500 shares - the second-largest opening block for a regional, behind BellSouth - at $62. ''It was what we would call a shot in the dark,'' he said later, adding, ''We were a substantial buyer.'' **********By 11 A.M., trading had already slowed for Mr. Stonehill, and during the rest of the day, it only picked up occasionally. But since his firm's trading in the stripped-down A.T.& T. and the original A.T.& T. got so frenetic, Mr. Stonehill had to pitch in elsewhere. He forfeited lunch out, eating a sandwich on the floor, and started working as the specialist in McDonnell Douglas, the aerospace company, and Arkla, a natural gas company, two of the three companies for which he had been the specialist last week. **********By the end of the day, Southwestern Bell had touched as low as $61 a share and reached as high as $62.125. It closed, in consolidated trading, at $61.625, the only one of the seven regionals to close below its opening price. **********Mr. Stonehill said his firm ended up long, or owning shares, at the close, and La Branche ''certainly'' lost money for the day, not surprising if it bought very much at $62. **********But will the company eventually make money on Southwestern Bell? ''I hope so,'' Mr. Stonehill said and headed home for Weston, Conn."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/15/business/company-reports-affiliated-publications-inc-a.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 17, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "** Company Reports ** AFFILIATED PUBLICATIONS INC (A)", "print_headline": "** Company Reports ** AFFILIATED PUBLICATIONS INC (A)", "body_text": " **********Qtr to March 31 1983 1982 Revenue 64,910,000 59,352,000 Net inc 3,082,000 2,589,000 Share earns .39 .33"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/13/business/advertising-foote-cone-net-plunges.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1983-05-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 54, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Foote Cone Net Plunges", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Foote Cone Net Plunges", "body_text": " **********Foote, Cone & Belding Communications reported yesterday that its net income dropped 56.9 percent in the first quarter, to $603,000, or 21 cents a share, from $1.4 million, or 50 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.

Norris, chairman of a major corporation, Control Data. He argues that most research in the United States is performed by universities accessible by Japanese graduate students, while Japan's research is carried out in Government labortories and private companies closed to American corporations. Since it is critically important that the United States be granted access to the markets and technologies of foreign countries equal to the access we provide, the most effective action would be to restrict foreign graduate students, he argues. **********As an educator in a university located near the headquarters of Control Data and as a Japanese who originally came to this country for study in a graduate school, I feel obligated to point out logical contraditions in his argument. First, let us recall that many inventions and discoveries in the United States have been made by immigrants from other countries. Foreigners residing in the United States and foreign-born Americans have played essential roles throughout the history of American achievements in science. **********Most graduate students from Japan or any other country are not sent by home companies to steal results.  They are here to study the truth of science in universities equipped better than those in their home countries. If they are offered good positions in the United States, they are more likely to stay here. Those who complain that graduate students steal results of basic research from American universities should have been hiring them. **********Second, it is conventional wisdom that basic research in Japan is hopelessly backward. What makes Japanese companies successful is their ability to apply widely known basic results into marketable products. A gripe about a closed Japanese market, such as the one described by Mr. Norris, is well taken, since the Japanese Government is notorious for mounting nontariff barriers on imports. However, this does not mean that results of the Japanese basic technologies are closed. Basic research (not R.& D.) is nonexistent compared with the United States. Mr. Norris confused basic with applied research when he argued that Japan's research in Government laboratories and in private companies is closed to Americans while the United States research conducted in universities is accessible to Japanese graduate students. **********It is one thing to gripe over a closed market but another to argue that graduate students are stealing results from American universities. Universities are open to any person who is dedicated to the arts, sciences or humanities, irrespective of nationality. It is a company's responsibility to transform basic research into marketable products. Academic freedom and basic human rights would be violated if students from Japan or any other country were barred from American graduate schools on the pretense of protecting American corporations. Let us not repeat a mistake which led to fellow Americans being sent into concentration camps just because they had Japanese ancestors.

Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, the man likely to be El Salvador's next Minister of Defense, is known in Government circles as an excellent administrator who enjoys the role of mediator. **********He was called on to replace Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia, a military source said, because he is the one ranking member of the military who has the respect of the departmental commanders and is considered able to keep the military out of politics. **********Since October 1979 General Vides Casanova has been head of the national guard, which had the reputation of being the worst of the three security forces for human rights abuses. ''He was called on to clean up the guard,'' said a political source, who added that although the force's reputation has not improved greatly it is no longer considered the worst. **********During the general's tenure, five guard officers have been accused of being involved in the murder of four American missionaries and two have been implicated in the shooting of two American labor advisers. Considered an Outsider **********General Vides Casanova, a political source said, has had a difficult time as head of the guard because he did not come from within the ranks and was considered an outsider by the other officers. ''On different occasions there have been near revolts, but he has managed to maintain control,'' the source said. **********The 44-year-old general comes from a middle-class San Salvador family. His father served in the government's tax department, but both his grandfather and uncle were military men. ''It was considered a family tradition to join the military,'' a family friend said. **********The general graduated second in his class at the Military School in 1959 and since then has served primarily in administrative positions. From 1969 to 1970 he attended the Command and General Staff School in Peru, which was known at the time as one of the most anti-American institutions in Central America. **********''When he came back he was suspected of being leftist because of his ideas on land reform,'' a friend said. A Reputation for Honesty **********After several assignments at the Military School in San Salvador, the general was appointed director of the Salvadoran Institute of Industrial Development, a Government agency that processes large businesses loans. ''While he was there he got a reputation for honesty and won the respect of a lot of people,'' a politician said.  ''But some people see his desire to always talk and negotiate as a weakness.'' **********Some political and military leaders who applaud General Vides Casanova's administrative record are unsure if he will be able to manage the war any better than General Garcia, who is a close friend. His men refer to him as ''Se@norita Casanova'' because of his lack of military experience. **********The air force commander, Col. Juan Rafael Bustillo, who threatened mutiny if General Garcia did not resign by Friday, said the post of Minister of Defense ''would be a good test'' of the general's military ability. **********A military commander said that General Vides Casanova was ''a good man'' but not ''the right man for the job at this time.'' Changes Are Expected **********Others said that because he has the respect of both the rightist and moderate elements in the military he will be able to make the necessary changes and improve the country's military situation. **********General Vides Casanova lives in San Salvador with four children from his first marriage and a child from a second marriage. His first wife died of cancer in 1973. **********His second wife, Maria Lourdes Illach, is in her early 20's and comes from the oligarchy. She was described by a friend as an ''independent'' woman who runs the family coffee farm in Usulutan, is a licensed pilot, and is a political moderate. **********At a recent gathering of businessmen she stood up and asked if they would support Jose Napoleon Duarte, the moderate leader of the Christian Democrats, if he is elected president next December. **********''There was dead silence in the crowd because they were surprised by the frankness of her question,'' a friend said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/29/business/computer-systems-applying-expertise.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPUTER SYSTEMS APPLYING EXPERTISE", "print_headline": "COMPUTER SYSTEMS APPLYING EXPERTISE", "body_text": " **********B y STEVEN J. MARCUS **********David I. Smith has worked for the General Electric Company for more than 40 years. Employed at the Transportation Systems division in Erie, Pa., he is an expert on the diagnosis and repair of locomotives and is considered one of the company's top field-service engineers. **********But Mr. Smith's expertise is a scarce resource. His help is often needed in many different places at once, and he is in great demand, far in excess of his availability, for training young engineers across the country. When Mr. Smith retires, moreover, his knowledge would normally leave the company with him. **********In this case, G.E. is trying to immortalize Mr. Smith. The company has developed a computer-aided trouble-shooting system, or CATS-1, that carries much of his knowledge and emulates what he would do on the job. **********This system, made public for the first time last week in Washington, at the annual meeting of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, is by no means alone among serious attempts to apply the tools of computer science to formalizing and roughly reproducing certain kinds of human thought processes. **********Forerunners include Dendral, a system developed at Stanford University to help chemists identify unknown organic compounds; Mycin, Stanford's system to aid physicians in selecting antibiotics for patients with severe infections, and Prospector, a system developed by SRI International to help geologists evaluate sites for mineral deposits. **********But CATS-1 is a significant advance in the ''industrialization of artificial intelligence,'' says Francis S. Lynch, manager of the Knowledge-Based Systems group that developed it at G.E.'s Research and Development Center, because it is one of the first that is designed for routine operation on the shop floor. It may well inspire similar systems, he says, for a wide variety of products and processes, some of which the company is already investigating. **********Developing Rules of Thumb **********An expert system has two basic elements: the ''knowledge base'' gleaned from the expert and the ''inference engine,'' the logical structure within which the computer applies that knowledge in response to available evidence to draw conclusions and recommend actions. **********A major difficulty in building expert systems is that human experts are not usually aware of the exact mental processes by which they diagnose a problem; they apply their knowledge in subtle, seemingly instinctive, ways that elude codification. An effort is thus necessary to determine usable ''heuristics,'' or rules of thumb, that can be embedded into precise logical sequences that a computer can execute. **********For Mr. Smith, the design process, was a labor of love.continuous. **********''I brought the system home to go through its nooks and crannies,'' he says, ''and soon lost all track of time. It's very exciting, and I had a ball.'' **********The CATS-1 system now has 550 rules to cover about 50 percent of the problems that locomotive repair shops may encounter, says Mr. Lynch, and is expected to have about 1,500 rules within a year, enabling it to diagnose 80 percent of locomotive repair problems. **********The system is also unique, he says, in its portability. It is the first to be programmed on a microcomputer for industrial use. **********Other Systems Being Developed **********John H. Clippinger, president of the Brattle Research Corporation, a consulting concern specializing in artificial intelligence, says G.E. is ''one of the first to intelligently and practically exploit the technology,'' but it will not be the last. **********Bell Laboratories has been developing a comparable system, called Automatic Cable Expertise, to encode the know-how of experienced telephone cable-maintenance experts. And I.B.M., Fairchild, Digital, Texas Instruments, Xerox and Schlumberger have also been developing expert systems. **********Not all are limited to repair. Digital built a system to configure components of the company's VAX-11 line of computers for the specific requirements of each customer, and it has been successful enough - the company estimates savings in millions of dollars a year - to have inspired the development of expert systems for other company product lines. **********New Industry Developing **********Until recently, most of the systems were developed by in-house groups within organizations devoted to other pursuits. But artificial-intelligence companies are now forming expressly to design and install expert systems for corporate clients. They include Syntelligence, Smart Systems, Intelligenetics, Cognitive Systems and APEX (for Applied Expert Systems). **********The ''granddaddy,'' only two years old, is Teknowledge. Formed in Palo Alto by 20 computer scientists from Stanford University, Carnegie-Mellon University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, it has developed 10 expert systems currently in operation. ''Drilling Advisor,'' for example, was developed for Elf-Aquitaine to diagnose the causes of sticking problems on oil rigs. **********Such a system can save clients a great deal of money, says John Vermes, director of knowledge-systems marketing for Teknowledge, but it costs them a great deal as well. He estimates that a basic core system can cost from $200,000 to $500,000, exclusive of the value of time spent interviewing the expert and training personnel. ''When all is said and done,'' he says, ''the cost of the first stage is about $1 million.'' And integrating the system with the client's data sources, he says, can make the price tag virtually ''open-ended,'' doubling or even tripling the cost. **********Job Elimination Feared **********In expert systems, as in robotics and computer applications in general, a common fear is that people will be replaced. Once Mr. Smith retires from G.E., for example, he will still be available in the form of CATS- 1. Therefore why expect someone else to grow into his position? **********G.E. officials say that its expert system simply assists in training - it is an ''explanation system,'' they say, not a magic black box - and just as students can eventually surpass their human teachers, trouble-shooters so trained may grow beyond the programmed approximation of one expert's knowledge. **********The G.E. expert, Mr. Smith, concedes that the original intent of the system was for any repair shop to plug it in and have an in-house expert like himself. But it evolved from a prompting aid to a teaching tool as field trials progressed, he says. **********''You could take a kid from the Pizza Hut and teach him how to approach maintenance problems,'' says Mr. Smith, ''and you could also retrain an experienced person in a subtle and polite way.'' **********Company officials contend, moreover, that the system will be attractive to professionals because it allows them to concentrate on more interesting tasks. ''It frees the expert from diddly problems,'' says Mr. Lynch, ''and enables him to choose the work he likes best.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/04/business/commodities-stock-index-contracts-decline-with-market.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 571, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stock Index Contracts Decline With Market", "print_headline": "COMMODITIES; Stock Index Contracts Decline With Market", "body_text": " **********As usual, stock index futures prices yesterday followed the drop in the stock market. But the declines in the three indexes varied widely, much to the satisfaction of many traders who play the intermarket spreads in these futures. **********For example, the nearest Value Line futures contract, March, closed at 158.60, off 2.40, while the underlying index fell 1.24, to 157.70. The same Standard & Poor's 500 index futures contract fell 2.80, to 139, but the actual index declined 2.30, to 138.34. The New York Stock Exchange composite index contract finished at 80.15, down 1.80, while the actual index lost 1.24, at 79.79. **********Meanwhile, the narrower Dow Jones industrial share average dropped 19.50, to 1,027.04.  Because each of the three index contracts consists of 500 times the index, each full-point move represents $500 per contract. Each hundredth of a point is $5 per contract. This is also helpful to the spreaders who simultaneously buy and sell short contracts in at least two markets in the hope that the gains will exceed the losses. Most Popular Spread **********''The most popular spread is between the Value Line and S.& P. 500 index futures, because the Value Line has thus far proved to be more volatile than the S.& P. 500, or the Big Board's composite index for that matter,'' said Donald M. Selkin, a specialist in spread operations at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. **********One big reason is that the 1,680-share Value Line index covers more secondary issues than blue chips, but gives equal weight to all issues. By comparison, the S.& P. 500 contains mostly blue chips, with each issue weighed by its capitalization. Another reason is that the average investor tends to favor secondary issues with potentially more growth than the blue chips. **********''A declining market will impact more heavily on the secondary issues and discourage small traders,'' Mr. Selkin noted. ''Thus the Value Line, as our research indicates, tends to be a more emotional gauge than the S.& P. 500, most of whose issues are in institutional or other strong hands.'' Bigger Moves in Rising Market **********As a result, Mr. Selkin said, the Value Line index moves are bigger than the S.& P.'s in a rising market and tend to be slower in a falling one. ''For example, when the market turned upward last August, the Value Line index had an 800-point premium over the S.& P. 500, which widened to 2,150 at the market's peak in November,'' Mr.  Selkin said. At yesterday's close, the Value Line's premium over the same March 1983 futures contract was 1,960 points. **********Based on the performance of the three index futures since the first one, the Value Line, began trading last February, Mr. Selkin said those spreaders who believe the stock market is headed higher favor buying the Value Line and selling the S.& P. 500 short, and vice versa. **********At yesterday's close the March Value Line futures premium was 1,960 points (the Value Line closed at 158.60 and S.& P. 500 at 139.00).  Between last August's upturn in the market and yesterday's close, the premium on the Value Line's March index futures expanded 1,160 points (1,960 less 800), or $5,800 per spread. The initial cash margin brokers require for putting on a stock index futures spread averages $1,500, or roughly half that needed to buy two ''straight'' contracts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/16/world/around-the-world-hijacker-of-turkish-jet-is-captured-in-athens.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 143, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hijacker of Turkish Jet Is Captured in Athens", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Hijacker of Turkish Jet Is Captured in Athens", "body_text": " **********The police stormed the cockpit of a hijacked Turkish Airlines jetliner at the Athens airport today and arrested a Turk who was holding the plane's crew at knifepoint. **********The police said no gunshots were fired when they overpowered the Turk, who was identified as Mahmout Kalkan. **********The plane was hijacked Friday while on a domestic flight over Turkey. **********Mr. Kalkan, whom police described as a member of the Turkish leftist group Dev Sol, had released all 112 passengers.

But by that time, it may be too late to prepare the strategic moves that must be undertaken in 1983 to help save money when filing Federal income tax forms next April. **********So with about three months to go in 1983, you might consider looking over your tax situation now for steps that can be taken to reduce your potential tax burden. Such actions can be either in response to actions that have already occurred or in anticipation of those to come. **********''Chances are good that you spend less time planning for income taxes than you spend planning for your annual vacation,'' said Roy Harrill, a tax partner of Arthur Andersen & Company, a certified public accounting firm. ''In essence, then, your income tax liability may be determined by default.'' **********One way to prevent this is to first develop a mock-up or worksheet of your 1983 return. Calculate your projected tax - taking into account the changes in the tax law and your own financial situation that affect this year's computations - with a view toward examining the various categories on the sheet for possible alterations that would offer tax benefits.  For example, a look at your withheld and estimated tax payments could determine whether taxes have been significantly overpaid or underpaid. The former unnecessarily deprives you of funds, while the latter might expose you to a non- deductible penalty by the Internal Revenue Service. Your goal here, of course, is to have withholding and estimated payments total no more than that requred to protect against the underpayment penalty. **********If it appears that there will be a large enough underpayment, you could add to your final estimated tax payment or ask your employer to increase withholdings for the remaining months of 1983. In contrast, if you seem to be overwithheld, you could adjust withholding downward by filing a new W-4 form with your employer or lowering the final estimated installment. **********Taxpayers who underpaid the first two estimated tax payments in expectation of 10 percent withholding on dividend and interest income at midyear - a process that never actually took effect - will not be penalized by the I.R.S. for this underpayment. **********Another procedure that some people can follow to reduce taxes is to accelerate deductions and/or to lower taxable income this year. Accountants sometimes refer to this process as stop-and-go tactics, since you try to establish the time when expenses are deductible and income is reportable for tax purposes. **********Under the cash receipts and disbursements method used by most individuals, however, deductions are usually recognized when they are paid, rather than when they are incurred. Similarly, income is usually recognized when it is received, rather than when it is earned. **********Among the deductions that can easily be accelerated if necessary are charitable contributions, since the timing can normally be fixed to suit the needs of the donor. State and local income and real estate taxes due in 1984 can also be paid in 1983. As for medical expenses, if you use a credit card to pay the bill, the amount is deductible in the year charged, regardless of whether this charge is not paid until the following year. **********As for deferring income, some employees may be able to postpone a portion of their compensation until 1984, but this deferral will not be effective if the salary or bonus is available at the worker's option this year. **********In such cases, the revenue service will consider that the taxpayer had what is known as constructive receipt and will tax these funds as 1983 earnings. Business and professional people generally have much greater opportunities to delay income through techniques such as billing customers at a later date. **********The proper utilization of securities transactions is another means of obtaining year-end tax savings. The objective is to pay the lowest tax on realized capital gains and to use capital losses to the greatest extent so as to offset gains that would otherwise be taxable. **********Included in the possibilities when considering stocks and bonds for tax planning are selling short ''against the box'' to lock in an unrealized gain without currently incurring the tax consequences that would result from the sale of the securities. **********A sale against the box is made with borrowed securities, and the deal is not concluded until the taxpayer covers this sale next year with other securities that he or she owns. **********Among the other alternatives for tax savings efforts at this time are acquiring Treasury bills whose interest income is not taxable until maturity or sale next year, making an individual retirement account contribution early rather than waiting until April 15, 1984, or so and asking a dependent whose earnings are approaching the $1,000 income limit to work less until the end of the year. **********Mr. Harrill warned taxpayers, however, that year-end tax planning does not necessarily take precedence over everything else. ''It is always necessary that the results of such planning be consistent with the goals of the broader process of family financial planning,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/18/business/lockheed-up-8.2-in-period.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lockheed Up 8.2% in Period", "print_headline": "Lockheed Up 8.2% in Period", "body_text": " **********The Lockheed Corporation said today that its profit rose 8.2 percent in the third quarter, helped by falling interest rates and a reduced debt load. **********In a separate development, spokesmen for the aerospace company and the machinists' union said about 25,000 Lockheed workers would vote Sunday on a new three-year contract proposal worked out by union and company negotiators during a month of intense bargaining. **********Union leaders are recommending ratification. **********Earnings in the three months ended Sept. 25 came to $59.6 million, or 93 cents a share, compared with $55.1 million, or 94 cents a share, a year earlier, when fewer shares were outstanding.

Eastern standard time last night. **********The deviations from assigned routes occurred on March 4 and 5 and took the planes 27 and 13 miles east of the proper airway, which passes near Syracuse, according to Peter Bruce of the State Department's office of aviation. **********Mr. Bruce said the suspension had been suggested by the Federal Aviation Administration, which operates the air traffic control system, and had been made mainly on safety grounds.

He said the Cuban planes could still fly the runs by following offshore airways and, in doing so, could continue to avail themselves of F.A.A. traffic guidance.

Crandall took over as president of American Airlines in July 1980, the hard-driving executive who had made his mark in marketing and finance faced a formidable task. The airline had lost money in seven of the 11 preceding years. **********American had opposed deregulation, which took effect in 1978. When Mr. Crandall arrived, the airline was only beginning to work out a plan to cope with the low-cost, nonunion carriers that were then emerging. **********Also American had to find some way to raise $3 billion to $4 billion over the next five years, mostly to pay for fuel-efficient planes to replace its fleet, one of the oldest in the industry. **********To help Mr. Crandall set the airline on a new course, its chairman, Albert V. Casey, gave the new president a lot of leeway.  Yesterday the Justice Department indicated it thought there may have been too much leeway. In a civil suit, the department charged that Mr. Crandall had tried to fix prices with a competitor, Howard D. Putnam, chairman of Braniff Airways. Several Drastic Changes **********Nobody questions the fact that Mr. Crandall, now 47 years old, drastically changed the course of American Airlines. He quickly cut its staff to 35,000 workers from 41,000. He also met with union leaders and told them bluntly that they must make major concessions in work rules and accept a wage freeze so American could generate enough cash to modernize its fleet. **********The basis of the airline's strategy, however, remained the same: to build up its hub at Dallas.  The hub-and-spoke strategy had become the gospel for most major carriers confronted by deregulation. Since they usually could not compete with new carriers on the basis of cost, the large airlines instead offered more connections at hubs than smaller carriers could match. As part of this strategy, American had moved its corporate headquarters to Dallas from New York in 1979. **********Under Mr. Crandall, American rapidly restructured its routes, changing most flights from long-haul runs and shifting from the Northeast to the Southwest. By the end of 1981 the changes were well under way, with 50 percent of American's flights originating in Dallas, compared with 22 percent six years earlier. Braniff's Fares Slashed **********About this time, however, the struggling Braniff became an aggressive competitor. Under the leadership of Mr. Putnam, who took over as chairman in the fall of 1981, Braniff (also based in Dallas) began to cut some of its fares sharply to win new customers. **********Before Braniff filed for bankruptcy last April and suspended all flights, it resorted to two-for-one sales, offering travelers one free trip for every full-fare ticket. **********This maneuver hit American especially hard, since Braniff overlapped many of its routes. Both Mr. Crandall and Mr. Casey assailed the fare slashing, estimating that it was costing American about $12 million a month in lost revenues. **********About that time Mr. Crandall was accused by some Braniff people of using ''dirty tricks'' to try to weaken Braniff. The Civil Aeronautics Board opened an investigation into the complaints, which led to a grand jury investigation by the Justice Department and eventually to yesterday's complaint."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/05/business/computer-rights-stir-legal-snarl.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1663, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPUTER RIGHTS STIR LEGAL SNARL", "print_headline": "COMPUTER RIGHTS STIR LEGAL SNARL", "body_text": " **********The nation's copyright and patent laws, which have protected literary works and inventions for nearly 200 years, apparently fail to safeguard much of the computer technology that many people hope will help revive America's economy, according to a growing number of legislators, judges and computer executives. **********They are wrestling with methods of protecting certain kinds of computer programs and the design of virtually all sophisticated computer chips. Both the programs and the chips are basic parts of the thousands of computers sold in this country every month. **********The degree to which present laws protect computer components against unauthorized copying and resale by competitors has become a troublesome legal issue for the computer industry, with possibly millions of dollars at stake. Computer technology has blurred the distinction between literary works such as a book (protected by a copyright) and inventions such as a gearshift (protected by a patent). **********Conflicting Court Decisions **********Numerous cases testing these issues have spilled into the Federal courts during the last year. The cases have yielded conflicting decisions, with some judges despairing because a computer program - a set of instructions telling the computer what to do - and the microscopic circuitry engraved on the silicon chips inside a computer resemble neither a book nor a gearshift. Some legal experts say the issues will not be settled until the Suprem Court deals with them. **********''Nothing has challenged the patent and copyright laws like this issue,'' said Ralph S. Brown, Baldwin professor of law emeritus at Yale University. ''It raises the question of whether we need a whole new system just to deal with computer chips.'' **********To Professor Brown and others, the courts have been forced to choose between protecting a vital new industry and preserving the carefully constructed line between copyright and patent laws. **********Adding urgency to the legal debate is an increasingly bitter rivalry between American and Japanese computer manufacturers. In the last few years Japanese dominance has been established in the market for mass-produced semiconductor chips. And in recent months Japanese companies have begun to move into the growing United States market for personal computers, until recently the sole preserve of American manufacturers. **********Already there have been charges that Japanese producers are copying American computer designs, and industry analysts say the struggle is swiftly moving into the courtroom. **********''In some ways it is locking the barn door after the horse is stolen,'' said Representative Robert W. Kastenmeier, a Wisconsin Democrat and chairman of a subcommittee considering a bill that would let companies copyright the ''masks,'' or circuitry, of computer chips. He said that ''we have about six months'' to enact legislation before the absence of protection could harm American companies in producing the next generation of high-capacity memory chips. Problem of Obsolescence **********United States companies have hesitated to rely on patent laws to protect many chip designs because in their fast-paced industry a design could be obsolete before the two-to-three-year process of patent approval is completed. Moreover, there is a legal question of whether chip designs are like dress fashions - simply variations on a single idea and thus unpatentable. **********Hampering the efforts to solve the legal puzzles are disagreements within the computer industry. The strongest protection is sought mostly by large companies such as the Intel Corporation, a manufacturer of semiconductors, and Apple Computer Inc., with a fastselling personal computer that has spawned numerous ''look-alikes'' in this country and abroad. **********Some smaller companies complain that their ability to create new programs and peripheral equipment to fit the most popular personal computers will be impeded if they are denied access to basic designs needed to make their wares compatible with other companies' products. The Franklin Computer Corporation, involved in a legal battle against Apple, contends that Apple is trying ''to use the copyright laws to create a monopoly position'' in the market for compatible equipment. Caution on Over-Protection **********A few major companies, including Texas Instruments Inc., suggest that the problems have been exaggerated and that over-protection could ''reduce the dynamism of the industry.'' **********The flurry of legal action has surprised people who thought Congress had already resolved most legal protection problems in the computer field. Under an amendment to the copyright law that went into effect in 1980, originators of computer programs were permitted to register their works the way they might register a book or magazine article. ''Copyrights protect literary works,'' said Dorothy Schrader, general counsel to the copyright office, ''and computer programs are clearly a subspecies of those works.'' **********But experts say the amendment leaves unanswered two critical questions - one involving computer programs and the other involving the computer chips themselves. **********The first question concerns whether one can copyright a set of highly specialized computer programs, called operating systems, which constitute the most fundamental instructions to a computer about the order in which it should process information. Operating systems are crucial because their structure dictates what other kinds of programs a computer can use, from a word-processing program to one that enables users to perform statistical analysis. Translated Into a Code **********The systems are derived from ordinary computer programs, which can be read by the naked eye. For use in most computers, however, they are translated into a code of ''one'' and ''zero'' or ''on'' and ''off.'' These instructions essentially constitute switches, and they are often engraved on the silicon chips that are built into computers. In their coded form, operating systems are generally unintelligible to most human readers. **********Until last year, most companies assumed that the code was simply another way of expressing a program and thus could be copyrighted.  It appeared to make little difference whether the program was printed on paper, stored electronically on computer disks or engraved on a chip. **********That view was challenged, however, in the case that has pitted Apple against Franklin Computer. Franklin manufactures a computer that is very similar to Apple's, and Apple charges that the logic and structure of its system was copied by the smaller company. In Federal District Court in Philadelphia, Apple sought an order to prevent Franklin from selling its ''look-alike'' model. Injunction Request Denied **********The court denied the request for a temporary injunction, ruling that there was significant doubt whether Apple's operating system was designed to explain or communicate information, a usual test of whether a work is worthy of copyright. **********The court found it was not clear that the code, ''which was not designed to be read by a human reader and can only be read by an expert with a microscope and patience, is a language of description.'' Judge Clarence C. Newcomer said instead that the code was an ''essential element of the machine,'' thus implying that it could not be copyrighted. **********The case is being appealed. Jack Brown, a partner in Brown & Bain, the law firm that represents Apple, points out that other court decisions handed down since Judge Newcomer's ruling have determined that the code is an expression of the computer program and could be copyrighted. **********''Our position is that we are copyrighting the program, and it does not make any difference what form it is in,'' Mr. Brown said. Problem of Unreadable Code **********Although the Copyright Office in Washington accepts computer programs in coded form, it cautions applicants that it cannot certify that the program is a work of original authorship because the code is not readable. **********Nonetheless, some companies are reluctant to file readable versions of their programs, for fear that competitors might use the Copyright Office's open files to gain access to proprietary information. Texas Instruments, for example, registers both the coded and uncoded forms of its programs but ''deletes proprietary information,'' according to Mel Sharp, the company's patent counsel. **********Such practices have brought objections from people who regard the copyright system as a method of preserving open access to information while protecting the rights of the author. ''The notion of secret copyrights is abominable,'' said Professor Brown of Yale. ''Companies are trying to have it both ways: to deposit something in the Copyright Office and to keep it inaccessible.'' A Question on Circuitry **********As for computer chips themselves, there has been less litigation but much debate over the question of whether the circuitry etched on the chips are copyrightable. Congressional hearings are scheduled to open this month on a bill introduced by Don Edwards, Democrat of California, that would permit copyrighting of the chips' distinguishing masks. **********''These chips can cost millions to develop,'' said F. Thomas Dunlap Jr., Intel's corporate counsel. ''Someone who decides to copy them can produce them on a large scale for less than $100,000.'' **********Intel accuses two Japanese companies, NEC and Mitsubishi, of having copied some of Intel's most popular microprocessors. One of them powers the personal computer made by the International Business Machines Corporation. **********The dispute with NEC over the copying of the code imbedded in the chip was settled out of court in March. The dispute with Mitsubishi, involving charges that the company copied masks of the chips, is still unresolved. Neither of the Japanese companies would comment. **********So far, Japanese companies have expressed little opposition to the proposed Congressional legislation, provided it is amended to permit ''reverse engineering,'' the dissection of a product to learn its operating principles. **********The Copyright Office has proven less enthusiastic. ''A chip is a utilitarian article, and it is not good policy to protect utilitarian articles under the copyright act,'' Mrs. Schrader said. **********Some members of Congress and the computer industry favor a compromise by creating a system that would protect chips immediately (like a copyright) but would give them limited-term protection (like a patent)."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/30/world/belfast-butcher-shot-dead.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 37, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Belfast Butcher Shot Dead", "print_headline": "Belfast Butcher Shot Dead", "body_text": " **********Two gunmen killed a butcher as he washed a window in front of his shop in Belfast today, and a young girl inside the shop was slightly grazed by a bullet."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/19/business/optimum-holding-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 50, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OPTIMUM HOLDING reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "OPTIMUM HOLDING reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/17/world/indians-press-trudeau-on-rights-under-new-charter.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas Martin", "pub_date": "1983-03-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 641, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INDIANS PRESS TRUDEAU ON RIGHTS UNDER NEW CHARTER", "print_headline": "INDIANS PRESS TRUDEAU ON RIGHTS UNDER NEW CHARTER", "body_text": " **********Canada's Indians and Eskimos have been trying for two days to tell Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau that God gave them the land that became Canada, and that it will always remain theirs. Mr. Trudeau was not entirely convinced. **********''God also sent Columbus across,'' the Prime Minister said. ''When do you stop reading history? Only when the white man came?'' The issue was at the core of a discussion between Indians, part-Indians and Eskimos and leaders of Canada's federal and provincial governments. The goal is to define the rights of these groups under Canada's year-old Constitution, something that has not been done in any form.

''It all belonged to us, and we shared it.'' **********Even the Indians suggested much of this talk was simply polemics, readily conceding they do not expect Canada to be returned to them anytime soon. Rather, they asked that their ''aboriginal title'' to the land be accepted as a theoretical basis for agreements to be negotiated over the next decade. Making up only about 3 percent of Canada's 24 million people, they seem keenly aware that their main weapon is moral suasion. **********The conference today and Tuesday -despite such colorful events as Mr. Trudeau's puffing a peace pipe and Indian shamans' chanting prayers - provided ample indications of the difficulty Indians may face in gaining land claims and increased self-government. **********The presence of the premiers of all 10 provinces of Canada, each with differing priorities, promised stumbling blocks. In particular, Quebec, whose government wants to secede from Canada, refused to vote on any matter concerning the new Constitution, which it has consistently refused to accept. Statement by Levesque **********''We cannot participate in this striving towards progress, because in all conscience we cannot stand by to see our own rights stolen,'' Premier Rene Levesque of Quebec said, while maintaining that his province supported greater protection for Indian rights. He warned Indians of the ''pitfalls'' of constitutional negotiations. **********The difficulties posed by bringing the provinces into Indian and Eskimo affairs, which until the new Constitution had been exclusively a federal prerogative, was even more apparent from a group of protesters standing in the rain outside the conference center. **********''Our business is strictly with the federal Government,'' Louis Stevenson, the befeathered chief of the Peguis Indian Reserve said.  ''Pretty soon the municipalities will get involved, and there will be no end to it.'' **********The Indians welcomed Ottawa's endorsement of limited selfgovernment.  Mr. Trudeau rejected the idea that Indians should be assimilated into the larger culture and also rejected ''full independence or absolute sovereignty.'' He said ''these two extremes lie outside the range of options that we are prepared to contemplate.'' Premier Is 'Puzzled' **********Premier Peter Lougheed of Alberta said, meanwhile, that he was puzzled by the Indians' claim that they held original title to the land, while Premier Brian Peckford of Newfoundland said he was confused. **********The premiers as a group appeared to backtrack on a preliminary agreement reached Tuesday evening to meet some of the Indian demands and provide regular channels to meet others in the future. **********Indeed, all that the participants could agree on as the conference ended this evening was to state that future meetings on Indian rights could be held."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/28/business/business-forum-industrial-policy-and-east-coast-myopia.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Cohen", "pub_date": "1983-08-28", "snippet": "SUNSET, like the TV evening\n\n news, comes three hours later\n\nto us on the West Coast.

Perhaps that is why the concern over ''sunrise'' and ''sunset'' industries, which occupies such an important place in the East Coast debate on industrial policy, hasn't captured our attention in the West. **********East Coast economic strategists have proposed a national industrial policy to shift resources, workers and America's future out of the sunset, heavy industries that they feel can no longer compete, such as textiles, garments, steel, machinery (the list has no boundary) and into high-technology sunrise industries such as microelectronics, computers and biotechnology, that they've seen on their visits to Silicon Valley. **********Such a policy makes no sense politically. It pits the few folks working in ''officially'' designated, high-technology sectors against the battalions of auto workers, steelworkers, textile workers - in fact, almost everyone - and tells that vast majority to organize its own demise. **********Worse still, it makes no sense economically. Doing something to improve industrial performance - the purpose of any industrial policy - is not a question of making lists that have textiles, apparel, ordinary consumer goods and metal bending nearing the end of their day and robotics, microelectroncis and biotechnology proudly hailing the dawn's early light. Unfortunately for such simplicity, exports in textiles recently surged while high-tech Atari has moved substantial employment abroad, and American producers of numerically controlled machine tools have lost much of the world market and much of our own market to foreign competitors. **********Even putting aside the thorny difficulties of how to pick winning industries from losing ones, the usefulness of organizing an industrial policy on the basis of what different industries make dissolves in the face of a simple question: Who is going to buy a robot or a bag of silicon chips? Much of what American high-tech industries make is bought by American business, not by consumers. Success for American producers of robots, CAD systems or industrial lasers depends upon manufacturers of automobiles, pens, washing machines, pants and electric motors buying and using the advanced technology and adjusting their manufacturing operations to the possibilities those technologies represent. **********Unless American manufacturers - principally those classified in the East as sunset - adopt the new technologies, they will not remain competitive. Unless they remain competitive, the high-technology industries will not attain their growth or promise. The workable strategy, economically as well as politically, is to bring high technology into the production of traditional products. The serious question is how to do it. **********INDUSTRIAL revitalization is vast and complex. There is no single **********best policy. Our options do not boil down to two simple but impossible alternatives: a blind faith ''let-the-markets-work'' approach, or a huge central investment and subsidization fund that will reconstruct the economy according to the judgments of its directors and the strengths of the political sectors that will converge on them. There is, in fact, no simple, single solution. We confront a multitude of problems and we will need a multitude of policies. **********Among others, new policies are needed to increase the flow of long- term capital into productive investment, and to improve the technical skills of the American work force. **********But above all, we must shift resources toward internationally competitive industries without adopting the simple-minded and politically impossible approach of industry-by-industry targeting. For example, it is not intuitively obvious to a planner that pushing dirt or sewing pants would be an American industrial strength. But Bechtel and Levi Strauss do very well internationally. **********Tax incentives based on performance are an excellent and traditional tool toward this end. We should institute a tax credit for research and development, with tax credits kicking in at a threshhold of, say, 8 percent of total spending - thus rewarding companies that are making an extraordinary effort in R.& D. and not simply to reward business as usual. **********A Factory Extension Service is another policy that does not require any centrally organized industrial triage. A modern industrial equivalent of the Agricultural Extension Service, it would aim at introducing advanced technology into a broad range of manufacturing industries and helping those industries, especially the small and middle-sized companies, to begin to reorganize their basic approach to manufacturing in order to apply microelectronics and other new technologies effectively in the workplace. **********The farm program with its research centers and extension agents was, arguably, America's most successful industrial policy. It brought a host of advanced technologies into use by very small, very unsophisticated farm enterprises. It contributed mightily to a dramatic and sustained improvement in farm productivity and to our national prosperity and power. It was also an invaluable aid, far more than a simple capital infusion would have been, for the growing industrial giants of its time, especially farm machinery and chemicals. What we did on the farm, we should do in the factory. Sweden has such a program; so does Japan. The State of New Jersey is making some interesting experiments in this area. A national effort should follow. **********No industrial policy will do much good in the absence of successful overall fiscal and monetary policy: Sustained recession, high interest rates and a disastrously overvalued dollar will nullify even the best trade and industrial revitalization efforts. But a successfully coordinated macroeconomic policy, by itself, will not solve the very real problem of declining international competitiveness. **********For the first time in our nation's history we no longer have the luxury of doing nothing. Foreign competition - not American politics - is setting the pace as it devastates sector after sector of our industrial capacity. The United States has been unwilling and unable to confront the kind of strategic choices it must now make. **********All debate over technique and the details of policy aside, the choice is basic.

Thus, every day, hundreds of reporters depend on military C-130 cargo planes to reach the island and return to Barbados to send their stories. **********This cumbersome procedure has been further complicated by what experienced reporters here say is one of the least adequately informed military offices they have ever encountered. Information is often released in Washington many hours before shorter versions are offered here. **********Restoring Communications **********The transmission situation may change soon, according to Ronald McKenzie of the Cable & Wireless Company in Bridgetown, who has been seeking to restore outside communications with Grenada. ''We've shipped over the last bits of equipment we had to order from abroad, and maybe service will be restored tonight or tomorrow,'' he said today. **********Communications experts have had to rebuild the transmitter atop Fort Frederick, and that should restore voice and cable links. But television news teams will still have to beam their ''feeds'' through an earth station here in Barbados, meaning continued dependence on the military shuttle, for which the rules change every day. **********And until all the wires on Grenada are put back up, reporters there will continue to function as they did before telephones, visiting each source of news personally or depending somewhat on others' accounts of events. **********News coverage of the Grenada invasion has, so far, meant spending half a day visiting a few places and another half a day trying to get the story out of Grenada. Some newspapers, magazines and television teams have organized a relay system, taking turns carrying material to Bridgetown, where it could be transmitted.   Nervous Tension in Newsrooms **********This has elevated the ''pigeon'' system - finding someone to carry a news story out to a colleague or depending on someone to actually send it - to new heights, while creating nervous tension in newsrooms around the world. **********One reporter was cut from the list of those on the last plane to Bridgetown a few days ago, when seats were commandeered by the State Department for diplomats and others. He stood on the tarmac writing his story by hand so that another reporter could read it and send it to New York. **********The magazine reporter who had volunteered to help was himself cut from the same flight. Both newsmen were placed aboard another cargo plane a half-hour later and made it back just in time to file their stories. **********The reporters' day begins typically at 5:30 or 6 A.M. in the former air terminal departure building here in Bridgetown, which now serves as the Joint Information Bureau operated by the United States military. Processing begins only at 6:30 or 7 A.M., but the tendency is to get in early because the flights are limited to about 90 reporters. Most flights are full, and some reporters are usually left behind.   Concentrated Press Corps **********The press corps is more concentrated here than it was in Vietnam, according to those who covered both wars, in part because of the limited access to the island and to the news. The corps is also somewhat larger than it might be, because Grenada is near to the United States. **********On the first flights to the island, only one dozen or two dozen reporters went, and news organizations were designated by name. Wire services were always on the list, although that included Reuters but not Agence France- Presse, and later only a half-dozen major newspapers and magazines were allowed to go before the list was opened to everyone. Among the early choices was The Washington Times, which is owned by the Unification Church. The choice of that newspaper's correspondent infuriated representatives of major daily newspapers that were not on the list. **********The foreign press was not represented on the flights for three or four days. When a Canadian television team was again rejected, the correspondent followed the military press officer around the room, shouting, ''We got your hostages out of Iran; why can't you get us onto Grenada?'' **********Press credentials are checked and correspondents are moved into another waiting area. All luggage, including cameras, sound equipment and sometime television editing gear, go with the passengers into the plane's belly.   An Envelope of Earplugs **********Passengers sit facing each other in double rows on woven plastic seats. Flying in a C-130 is like riding under the hood of a car, with each operation, the lowering of wheels or moving of flaps, easily heard. An envelope of earplugs is passed down the aisle. **********The first flight gets to the Point Salines airport, which the Cubans were building but did not finish, at about 9:30 or 10 A.M. It is always noisy and dusty. The airport is still designated a war zone, so the planes do combat turns, which means keeping the engines going. Most of the time small Army buses arrive for the half-hour trip into St. George's, but sometimes they do not appear. **********There have been military briefings, but they are dwindling because newsmen who had been in touch with their offices overnight or who receive telex summaries of morning newspaper stories found the briefings offered very little. The sessions have become more administrative, offering news of press conferences in town, for example, or the details of a visiting congressional group. **********The airport itself can produce news. One morning press flight arrived just before the repatriation of wounded Cubans. The reporters who stayed to cover it got on the 1:30 flight back to Bridgetown, certain they had seen something of news value and uncertain about the availability of the late afternoon flight.   Accommodation of TV Teams **********The midday flight was added, according to military personnel, to accommodate television teams seeking to edit their film in time to beam it to the United States in the afternoon, when the $1,000-a-minute satellite is more available for transmissions - and in time for the evening news. **********But Thursday, the midday press plane was requisitioned for the repatriation of Libyan diplomats. Frustrated television teams watched, a major news story in their cameras. Space was found for them on another plane that left at 3 P.M. **********There are no telephones linking the airport and the town. Taxis are available but since Thursday they have been forced to wait at some distance because the United States military is trying to clear the airport of the chaotic bargaining for rides. **********In St. George's, reporters have been sleeping on mattresses in the lobbies of hotels packed with reporters. An estimated 100 reporters have taken up residence on the island.   New Precautions **********Returning to Bridgetown means showing up an hour and a half before the 1:30 and 5:30 P.M. flights, a change demanded by Barbadian authorities since one passenger, described by a military spokesman as a ''soldier-of-fortune type,'' tried to bring back a gun belt with live ammunition. **********Reporters now wait in a roped enclosure on the field, once they've been checked in, making the ''pigeon'' work that much more difficult as guards discourage the passing of notes, television tape or other paraphernalia. The return flight arrives at Bridgetown at about 7 P.M. On Thursday night 10 reporters were unable to get on. **********Barbadian customs is now checking shoulder bags, television equipment and other luggage, adding a half-hour to the six or seven hours of transportation daily. And, as the news crews file through the terminal they are handed two- or three-paragraph news releases. **********The releases might disclose that United States forces swept the island of Carriacou looking for Cubans, an announcement that had been made in detail in Washington eight hours earlier. At their hotels, another half-hour away, the reporters talk to their editors, who are asking questions about events that officials in Washington say are happening in Grenada. Sometimes the reporter knows about it, sometimes not. Because there are no phone links with the island, there is no way to check it out, until tomorrow."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/20/business/executive-changes-124299.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 290, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " **********Abraham & Straus has promoted Chaim Edelstein, senior vice president of women's apparel, to executive vice president for all merchandise, effective Jan. 15.

The savings bank, with slightly more than $5 billion in assets at that time, was authorized to make about $250 million of commercial loans. **********James Bolster Jr., head of the Dime's commercial lending deparment, said it recognized quite early that, to succeed in New York's highly competitive market, it would have to specialize. The initial strategy, he said, was to carve out a special niche among small and medium-size busineses, mostly on Long Island. **********''Although Dime is significant in New York City as a mutual,'' Mr.  Bolster said in an interview last week, ''it would have been foolhardy to try to compete with the big money center, regional or even foreign banks in New York. I didn't want to waste two years ringing doorbells on the Fortune 500.'' Balance Sheets Scrutinized **********The Dime also decided to limit its corporate loans to mature, seasoned businesses. ''We wanted to see substantial balance sheets, fully audited, and we wanted five years of profitability,'' Mr.  Bolster said. **********In the fall of 1981, as part of its campaign to win business customers, the Dime invited about 150 company executives to a ''social hour'' of introductory presentations. According to Mr.  Bolster, about 115 of those companies are now Dime customers. **********A major hurdle for most thrift institutions considering commercial lending has been duplicating the costly back-office operations that already exist in most commercial institutions. The Dime leases its commercial lending computer system, including software and microcomputers, from the First Boston Corporation for $2,500 a month. **********So far, Mr. Bolster says, the Dime's commercial lending operations have performed far above expectations. The savings bank now has about 200 corporate customers, with an average loan size of about $1 million. At the end of 1982, its commercial lending operations had an average return on assets of 185 basis points, equal to 1.85 percent, and a 45 percent return on allocated equity. **********''With figures like that and no more than 15 people in the department,'' Mr. Bolster said, ''we really ought to be looking for some profit sharing.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/08/world/argentina-linked-to-rise-in-covert-us-actions-against-sandinists.html": {"writer_name": "Leslie Gelb", "pub_date": "1983-04-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1340, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ARGENTINA LINKED TO RISE IN COVERT U.S. ACTIONS AGAINST SANDINISTS", "print_headline": "ARGENTINA LINKED TO RISE IN COVERT U.S. ACTIONS AGAINST SANDINISTS", "body_text": " **********United States involvement in covert guerrilla activities against Nicaragua increased sharply last year after Argentina largely halted its assistance to the rebels, according to Administration officials. The Argentine move was in reaction to President Reagan's support for Britain in the Falkland war, the officials said. **********Until the early months of 1982, the officials said, Argentina had primary responsibility for financing and training the anti-Sandinist guerrillas to intercept military supplies going through Nicaragua to El Salvador and Guatemala. Beginning last fall, the officials said, United States dollars, personnel and direction were added, first to sustain the interdiction operations and later to expand them. **********As a result, the officials said, the United States found itself providing direct aid to a guerrilla operation whose aim - the overthrow of the Sandinist Government - went beyond Washington's goal of intercepting arms. The United States was thus brought into a potential direct confrontation with Nicaragua. **********To prevent precisely this outcome, the officials said, a number of Administration members had fought hard but in vain to persuade Mr.  Reagan not to side openly with Britain against Argentina. Argentina attacked the Falkland Islands on April 2, 1982, and surrendered on June 14. Complicated and Confusing **********The Administration officials related these details over the past few days in an effort to show there was no deliberate effort within the Reagan Administration to violate the law barring actions to overthrow the Government of Nicaragua, as some Congressional critics have suggested. **********The officials described complicated and often confusing accounts of more than three years of covert American actions in Nicaragua and against its Government. **********The centerpiece, the officials said, was an arrangement worked out between the Reagan Administration and the Argentine ruling junta led by President Leopoldo Galtieri. **********Under the pact, Argentina would be responsible, with some American funds and intelligence support, for attacking the flow of supplies moving through Nicaragua to El Salvador and Guatemala. Guatemala, El Salvador's neighbor to the north, had been battling a leftist-led guerrilla movement that predated by several years the one in El Salvador. The United States took for itself the tasks of curtailing Nicaraguan actions against Honduras, for providing money to political opposition groups in Nicaragua and for maintaining liaison with Nicaraguan exiles. **********The officials said the Administration was clear about the difficulties inherent in the arrangement. General Galtieri's support for the anti-Sandinist guerrillas predated the Reagan Administration. His goal, never hidden, was to entice the former Sandinist commander Eden Pastora Gomez to lead the guerrillas in an attempt to overthrow the Sandinists. According to Administration officials, this goal was shared by a number of Reagan policy-makers and Central Intelligence Agency operatives, but it was never adopted as official policy. 'It Was Convenient' **********''It was convenient to run the operations through the Argentinians,'' a high-ranking intelligence agency official said.  ''We didn't have to ask questions about their goals that we couldn't escape asking about our own goals when we took over.'' **********In 1979 and 1980, the Carter Administration had undertaken to expand American intelligence collection activities in Central America and to provide funds and other support to anti-Government, democratic individuals and groups in Nicaragua. By this time, relations had already begun to cool between Washington and the Sandinists, whom President Carter had backed in the closing days of their revolution against the long-time dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle. **********On March 9, 1981, President Reagan was said to have reaffirmed these covert programs and to have taken an important step beyond them, authorizing the start of covert military action to intercept arms supplies moving through Nicaragua to El Salvador and Guatemala.  The budget for these efforts was set at $19.5 million. **********Against the backdrop of what officials said they saw as a stalemated situation at best, but more likely a deteriorating one, the President and his senior advisers met on Nov. 16, 1981. Mr.  Reagan adopted a 10-point program, later to be embodied in National Security Decision Document 17. It called, in general, for increasing economic and military aid to the region. A Concession to Haig **********The document also approved the development of contingency plans to deal with ''unacceptable military actions'' by Cuba. This was described as a nominal concession to Secretary of State Alexander M.  Haig Jr. **********Mr. Haig had proposed going further and taking unspecified actions against Cuba, which he termed ''the source'' of trouble in Central America. **********But the 10-point program, the officials said, also called for issuing a ''finding'' to Congressional intelligence committees notifying them of plans to step up covert intelligence actions in the region. Such a finding, or document, is required by law and gives Congress an opportunity to raise objections. **********When the finding was submitted in December, several members of the intelligence committees were said to question whether the covert operations could be limited to interdiction of arms supplies or might evolve into a broader campaign against the Nicaraguan Government. **********The finding granted the C.I.A. broad authority to support and conduct ''political and paramilitary operations against Cubans and Cuban supply lines'' in Nicaragua and elsewhere in Central America.  The C.I.A. was also empowered to work with other governments. The other Governments mainly involved were Argentina and Honduras, although Venezuela and Colombia showed interest as well. Restrictions on Spending **********Under the finding, the C.I.A. was allowed to spend $19.95 million for all covert actions in the region. It was not clear from the officials' comments whether this figure was related to the similar amount mentioned in connection with the March 9, 1981, meeting. In any event, some of it was to serve as ''seed money'' to finance a 500-man force of Latin Americans. This force would later be joined with a 1,000-man unit then being trained and financed in Honduras, largely by Argentina. The finding told the C.I.A. to work ''primarily'' through third parties, but authorized action by C.I.A.  personnel ''in some circumstances'' against special Cuban targets. **********The larger part of the funds was to continue backing what was described as nationalistic, anti-Cuban and anti-Somoza groups, and intelligence collection. **********At the Nov. 16 meeting, there was said to have been considerable discussion of how to accomplish covert military actions without getting involved with the former supporters of Mr. Somoza. On the one side, it was generally recognized that identification with the Somoza forces would doom the operation politically. On the other side, it seemed that the operation could never get off the ground militarily without them. Taking Sides Over the Falklands **********Planning went forward on a large scale with the Argentines and Hondurans until Argentina's attack on the Falklands. General Galtieri, who would resign after the war ended, made clear that American endorsement of the British position would be the end of his cooperation in Central America. A number of Administration officials, particularly Thomas O. Enders, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, argued that this was strong reason for avoiding taking sides over the Falklands. But Mr. Reagan was to choose otherwise, and General Galtieri withdrew almost all Argentine advisers and funds. **********In mid-April 1982, during the fighting over the Falklands, Mr.  Reagan and his senior advisers convened again on the subject of Central American strategy. According to a summary of this meeting, Mr. Reagan agreed on ''increasing pressure on Nicaragua and Cuba to increase for them the costs of interven. The summary also showed a decision to increase funds by $2.5 million to expand covert operations in Guatemala. **********It was the operations approved in November and the further increases approved in mid-April that led to the general expansion of American covert actions in the region and to charges that the Administration may have violated the spirit, if not the letter, of the law barring covert action to overthrow the Government of Nicaragua."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/22/world/reagan-is-urged-not-to-publicize-arms-accusations-against-soviet.html": {"writer_name": "Hedrick Smith", "pub_date": "1983-04-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 358, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REAGAN IS URGED NOT TO PUBLICIZE ARMS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST SOVIET", "print_headline": "REAGAN IS URGED NOT TO PUBLICIZE ARMS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST SOVIET", "body_text": " **********Two former Carter Administration officials and two Democratic senators said today in interviews that possible Soviet arms violations should be discussed through diplomatic channels.

Wojciech Jaruzelski assumed when it declared martial law on Dec. 13, 1981. **********The Jaruzelski Government sent the draft legislation to Parliament, reportedly in preparation for the formal lifting of martial law next week. **********The draft amendments would apparently empower the Government to deal with future crises without declaring martial law. They would empower the Government to declare a state of emergency instead and do so without having to go through the formality of obtaining parliamentary approval. **********This would apparently complete a process of making the special governmental powers that were instituted last December, when a partial suspension of martial law was formally announced, the law of the land. The suspension order came as many martial-law edicts were incorporated into Poland's criminal code, making it illegal, for example, to strike, incite anti-Government demonstrations and distribute literature officially considered subversive. **********Polish sources said the Government would order a selective amnesty for several hundred political prisoners on July 22, Poland's national day, and formally announce at the same time the abolition of martial law. But it is widely expected here that the independent trade union Solidarity will remain outlawed and many of its jailed leaders behind bars. **********Underground Solidarity leaders took note of this expectation today in a statement that said, ''A merely formal lifting of martial law and amnesty will in no way induce us to halt our activities.'' **********They also demanded that the laws passed since the December 1981 crackdown be canceled.  ''The character of further struggles for worker and civil rights will be contingent on the sense of political realism displayed by the authorities,'' the underground leaders said. The statement was signed by Zbigniew Bujak of Warsaw, Wladyslaw Hardek of Cracow, Tadeusz Jedynak of Katowice, Bogdan Lis of Gdansk and ''Witold,'' believed to be a pseudonym for a union leader in Wroclaw. **********At today's session of Parliament, a draft amendment permitting the delaration of a state of emergency without parliamentary approval was referred without debate to a committee.

Czeslaw Kiszczak, an ally of General Jaruzelski. **********The official press agency P.A.P. said Parliament would also receive draft legislation at its session next week that would provide new regulations to ''overcome the socio-economic crisis.''

Andropov became the Soviet leader and has continued unabated under him. **********'Malicious Disobedience' **********The law, Article 188-3 of the criminal code of the Russian republic, states that ''malicious disobedience to lawful demands made by the administration of a corrective labor institution, or any other opposition to the administration in the execution of its functions'' by a prisoner who has been sent to an isolation cell or transferred to prison in the preceding year can bring up to three more years of imprisonment. **********Prisoners considered ''especially dangerous recidivists'' or those convicted of a ''grave crime'' can be sentenced up to five additional years. **********Dissidents say the measure codified and simplified a practice that has become increasingly frequent in recent years, when a number of dissidents nearing the end of their terms have found themselves sentenced to new terms, often on charges of slandering the state while in camp. **********In December 1982, for example, Valery Abramkin was nearing the end of a three-year term for publishing an underground magazine when he was transferred to jail to face new charges of ''orally spreading slander against the Soviet state.''  Others Also Charged **********Similar charges were brought against Vyacheslav Bakhmin, who had campaigned against the abuse of psychiatry, and a number of other dissidents. **********The new law, however, apparently relieves authorities of the need to compile a new case against a dissident who is nearing the end of his or her term. Diplomats said it appeared, in effect, to give prison authorities arbitrary power to extend the sentences of dissidents, a practice that was commonplace under Stalin but was largely abandoned in the 1960's and 1970's. **********The stipulation that the law is applicable to those prisoners who have been punished in the course of their term, either by spending time in isolation cells or in prison, would make most of the prominent dissidents now serving time liable to extended terms. **********Anatoly B. Shcharansky, for example, was sent from a labor camp where he had served several stretches in a punishment cell, to Chistopol Prison in November 1980, reportedly for refusing to acknowledge his guilt.   Similar Route Followed **********Viktor Nekipelov followed a similar route to Chistopol. Yuri Orlov, Aleksandr Podrabinek, Gleb Yakunin, the Russian Orthodox priest, and numerous other imprisoned dissidents have spent their terms in and out of punishment cells. **********Each of these dissidents now stands to receive added years in camps for the same alleged infractions that sent them to isolation cells or to prison. **********Mr. Shcharansky, who was convicted of espionage and is therefore considered to have committed a ''grave'' crime, is liable to receive five more years in prison. **********The new law appeared in the official gazette of the Russian republic, the largest of the Soviet republics and the one in which most dissidents are serving terms. The measure could be adopted by other republics.   Dealing Harshly **********To dissidents and Western diplomats, the measure represented further evidence that Mr. Andropov will continue dealing harshly with dissidents. **********He is generally believed to have been responsible for the stringent measures taken against the human rights movement under Leonid I. Brezhnev, when Mr. Andropov was chief of the K.G.B. Mr. Andropov became the Soviet leader when Mr. Brezhnev died in November 1982; if anything, the treatment of dissidents has grown more repressive over the past year, when sentences handed down to dissidents have been severe. **********Leonid Borodin, a writer who was arrested before Mr. Brezhnev died, was rearraigned on a tougher charge after Mr. Andropov came to power and was sentenced to 10 years in camps and 5 in exile. **********Iosif Begun, a Jewish activist, recently received the maximum term for anti-Soviet activities, 7 years in camp and 5 in exile. A special campaign has been under way to crush the Solzhenitsyn fund, which dispenses money to families of political prisoners.   Lithuanians Sentenced **********In Lithuania, two Roman Catholic priests, the Rev. Alfonsas Svarinskas and the Rev. Sigitas Tamkiavicius, have been sent to camps for participating in the Catholic Committee for the Defense of Believers' Rights. In Russia, a Russian Orthodox publicist, Zoya Krakhmalnikova, was sentenced to a year in prison and five in exile. This is only a partial listing of the trials and arrests reported over the past year. **********In the meantime, emigration of Jews and ethnic Germans has almost ceased. **********One increasingly frequent element that has disturbed many Western experts over the past year has been the publicity given some of the more prominent trials by the Soviet press agency Tass, a practice that to some smacks of the show trials of the Stalin era. **********Tass has reported on several trials over the past year, invariably beginning with the words ''at an open trial in'' and going on to denounce the activities of the defendant, whether the trial has finished or not. **********In the case of Father Tamkiavicius last week, Tass denounced the priest as a ''vain and money-loving man'' who systematically ''slandered the Soviet political and social system,'' even before the court had reached the inevitable guilty verdict.   Subversion From the West **********A similar report on Mr. Begun's trial in October in the city of Vladimir was issued by Tass the day before the trial opened.

Versus U.S.S.R.'' by Nikolai Yakovlev. The third edition of the book, issued last February, traced the entire dissident movement to a C.I.A. conspiracy that began with the ''thaw'' after Stalin's death. **********The most prominent dissidents were portrayed in the work as corrupt and debauched, and some of the most brutal attacks were focused on Andrei D.

It is also inconsistent with Mr. Deng's own reticent posture, since he has declined opportunities to hold formal high office. **********But Mr. Deng represents the new orthodoxy now being promulgated in a party purge. Such campaigns fall back on the proven format of citing one individual's words and deeds to inspire everyone else. **********Mr. Deng's writings are at the core of the purge, which will entail political study and self-criticism over the next three years and wind up with a review of party membership rolls. A list of required reading includes some of Mao's old writings dating from before 1957, when he began committing what are now viewed as the errors of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. **********The current leadership still pays lip service to Mao, in part because outright repudiation would alienate many conservatives and throw into question the party's legitimacy. **********''Mao Zedong's theory of democracy within the party and of a people's democracy is still the criterion guiding the political life of the party and country today,'' Liao Gailong, a party historian, said this week at a symposium. But he also listed Mao's mistakes, including an overemphasis on class struggle, as in the Cultural Revolution; the expectation of fast economic results, as in the Great Leap Forward, and a disregard for what are now regarded as the correct views of other leaders. **********Mr. Deng has been praised for ridding the party of the ''two whatevers'' - the dogmatic conviction that whatever Mao thought or whatver Mao did must be blindly followed. **********Mr. Deng has been careful not to appear a claimant to Mao's mantle. In mid-1981 Mr. Deng reportedly urged his protege, Hu Yaobang, the party's general secretary, to insure that a party assessment of Mao's rule show his merits outweighing his faults. **********The official line is still that Mr. Deng is enhancing Mao's philosophy, not replacing it. The magazine Beijing Review in September disparaged the ''myth of de-Maoification'' circulating in the West as ''ridiculous'' and ''totally groundless.'' **********But Mao's celebrated little red books have long disappeared from store shelves, while more than 40 million copies of Mr. Deng's new book have been published. **********Mao's mausoleum is to be converted into a memorial hall that will include other leaders like Zhou Enlai and Zhu De, according to Chinese sources.

And on Jan. 1, a host of further changes -including a n ew system for withholding taxes on pension payments - went into e ffect and will have a widespread impact on millions of taxpayers.  H ere's a rundown of some of those new provisions. **********PENSION WITHHOLDING. The new withholding system for pensions and annuities, the provision that has attracted the most attention, is designed to make sure that pensioners and others do not escape paying the Government at least some of the taxes they owe. (Waiters and waitresses have also become subject to withholding on part of their tip income, and investors are scheduled to come under the collection net too, when withholding on dividend and interest income goes into effect on July 1). **********In seeking the new rules, the I.R.S. argued that billions of dollars worth of tax revenues go uncollected each year because many people fail to pay tax on their pension, tip and investment income. **********Under the new rules, pension payments exceeding $5,400 a year that are paid periodically, as opposed to those paid in a lump sum, will have taxes withheld on a sliding scale as if those payments were wages. The amount withheld is determined by a pensioner's marital status and the number of exemptions claimed. (The pending interest and dividend withholding, by contrast, will be on a flat 10 percent rate.) **********The amount of the total tax due has not been changed by the new law - only the timing of making the payment. Taxes on pension payments now will be deducted automatically, unless the recipient opts out of withholding. Under the old rules, taxes were withheld only if pensioners requested it and most chose to make quarterly estimated tax payments instead. **********While it is still too early to tell, preliminary indications are that the majority of retirees receiving modest pensions are opting for withholding. ''Between 80 and 90 percent'' of pensioners receiving average pensions of $5,000 to $10,000 a year are choosing withholding, according to Donald E. Tegeler, a consultant with Hewitt Associates, a Lincolnshire, Ill., employee benefits consulting firm. ''It's really not surprising,'' he says. ''They're comfortable with withholding because it was something that was done with wages.  They aren't used to making estimated tax payments, and they don't want to worry about the I.R.S. knocking on their door.'' **********Mr. Tegeler gave an example of how withholding might affect a married person who earned $50,000 to $60,000 a year while working and who now receives an annual pension of $24,000. If the person claims three exemptions - two exemptions for one of the spouses who is over the age of 65 and one for the other, who is younger than 65 - the monthly withholding would come to $273.40. That would reduce the $2,000-a-month pension to $1,726.60. **********But people who receive substantial dividend and interest payments, and already are used to making estimated tax payments, may decide to opt out of withholding. ''It comes down to psychology,'' says Harold Danker, a partner in the Washington office of the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand. ''Do I want to hold that money or do I want the Government to hold it? And if I hold it, how am I going to budget for my tax payments?'' **********The decision on withholding becomes even more complicated when it comes to ''nonperiodic'' payments, such as lump sum distributions from pension or profit-sharing plans. If the distribution represents the return of a person's entire interest in a plan, it may qualify for 10-year forward averaging. But to qualify, a person must satisfy one of several tests, such as being 59 1/2 years old or over. **********New withholding tables, reflecting 10-year averaging, have just been published by the I.R.S. Recipients may be able to delay paying tax altogether if they reinvest the distribution into a qualified plan, such as a corporate pension plan or a Keogh plan, or into an Individual Retirement Account, within 60 days of receipt. **********LOWER INTEREST CHARGES. The good news is that it now costs less to be late paying your taxes. On Jan.1, the interest rate the I.R.S.  charges on unpaid taxes dropped to 16 percent from 20 percent. **********The bad news is that the revenue service, which used to charge simple interest, is now compounding daily. The result: Someone who is a full year late in settling up will pay an effective rate of 17.346 percent for the privilege of being tardy. **********Several years ago, when the I.R.S. interest rate was in the single digits, many people took a dilatory attitude toward paying their taxes. They figured that because the charge was tax-deductible anyway, it was tantamount to getting an interest-free loan from the Government. **********''But things are not that simple anymore,'' says Sidney Kess, director of tax policy with the accounting firm of Main Hurdman.  ''You've got to be careful when you take an aggressive position on your return, because the I.R.S. may not come in to audit you until 18 months after you file, and the interest clock will be running all that time.'' **********One way to stop that clock from running is to make use of a new, but little-publicized, I.R.S. procedure. It allows taxpayers who are being audited to make an interim deposit with the I.R.S. as soon as they find out they are being audited. The deposit is considered a cash bond, and stops interest charges from piling up on a possible tax assessment resulting from the audit. The bond can be paid even after an auditor has announced the result of the examination, so long as a formal notice of a tax deficiency has not been sent to the taxpayer. **********William G. Brennan, the publisher of Brennan Reports, a Valley Forge, Pa., monthly newsletter on tax shelters, notes that while interest will stop running on the tax underpayment once the bond is paid, the I.R.S. ''will not pay interest on the deposit'' if the taxpayer is ultimately successful. **********SIMPLE TAX FORM. Some 20 million taxpayers may find settling up with Uncle Sam easier than ever this year because of a new tax form dubbed the 1040EZ (pun intended, says the I.R.S.). **********There are some restrictions on its use, however. You must be single, have no dependents and claim only one exemption. You must also have less than $50,000 in taxable income from salaries, wages and tips. No more than $400 of that can be from interest, with none of it coming from All Savers certificates. **********The new form has only 11 lines, half the number of the short form, 1040A.

Even though its recent earnings have been uninspired, Fuji has fared far better than Kodak, whose profits are off sharply. Fuji grabbed the corporate sponsorship as the official film of the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles away from Kodak with a quick bid of $5 million, a move the Japanese company hopes will help establish its name in the United States market. **********And while amateur photographic products are Fuji's mainstay, representing half its business, in recent years Fuji has moved much more forcefully than Kodak into new fields - high-technology areas such as videotape and floppy disks for computers - that boast enviable growth rates. **********Indeed, a company founded in 1934 as Japan's first manufacturer of motion picture film is being steadily transformed into a high-technology enterprise. ''Fuji has moved into higher growth areas, based on electronics, optics and magnetics technologies, much more so than Kodak has,'' said Robert Burghart, an analyst at W. I. Carr Sons & Company in Tokyo. ''Fuji is extremely well placed for the 1980's.'' There is, to be sure, little danger that Fuji will, David-like, topple Kodak from its pre-eminent position in the amateur film market in the foreseeable future. Its total sales have about doubled in the past five years, reaching $2.5 billion in 1982, figured at the recent exchange rate of 235 yen to the dollar. But the American company is still more than four times Fuji's size, and the century-old Kodak remains the standard-setter in the industry: Fuji must follow Kodak's lead with each change in technology or film processing, since Fuji's products must be ''Kodak-comp- atible.''   Still, Fuji has come a long way in recent years, pulling about even with Kodak in product quality, manufacturing efficiency and technology. When he joined Fuji in the mid-50's, Hirozo Ueda, senior managing director in charge of research and development, recalled, ''Kodak's products seemed like things made by God. Their technology was so far ahead of ours. But today, our overall technological level is comparable to that of Kodak.'' **********Fuji's advance includes some of the classic elements seen in previous gains made by Japanese companies against American rivals in what is now a litany of industries, from steel to semiconductors. For example, the path for Fuji was made easier because it followed in Kodak's footsteps. Typically, Kodak has spent generously on research and development to come up with new products, which Fuji could then either license or imitate. **********IN addition, the Japanese Government protected Fuji at home with **********high tariffs on imports and curbs on direct investment by foreign companies in the 1950's and 1960's, when the Japanese market for amateur film began to sprout. These barriers were eventually abolished, but not before Fuji was firmly in control. **********Today, Fuji holds 75 percent of the $500 million in yearly amateur film sales in Japan, while Kodak claims about 15 percent of that market. In the United States, Fuji has about 6 to 7 percent of the $1.1 billion market for consumer color film, while Kodak has about 85 percent. **********But the Fuji-Kodak case differs from the usual pattern of Japanese- American competition. In autos, steel and other industries, Japanese companies were helped by significantly lower labor costs. Their cost edge dictated their international strategy: slashing prices to gain market share. **********Yet Fuji seems unlikely to resort to the same aggressive tactics. First, amateur shutterbugs tend to shun budget-priced film, preferring a high- quality image, a lesson Kodak has apparently learned in Japan (see box). **********Second, Mr. Ohnishi contends that Fuji's production costs are higher than Kodak's, and industry analysts agree. They say that the chemicals used in making film and photographic paper are cheaper in the United States. And lower labor costs, which have helped the Japanese in other fields, are not so important in the photographic industry. **********''Making color film is not a labor- intensive process,'' says Eugene Glazer, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York. ''It is a capital- and materials-intensive process. So Kodak's production costs are probably lower than Fuji's.'' **********Moreover, conventional photography is a silver-based technology, and Kodak has the advantage of buying the metal domestically. **********Still, Fuji could fight a price war with Kodak if it chose to, because the profit margins in the photographic business are thick enough to allow plenty of shaving. But Mr. Ohnishi insists, ''We won't cut prices to increase our market share.'' **********Yet American analysts note that while Fuji's suggested retail prices in America are about the same as Kodak's, the Japanese company has selectively offered discounts to large retail chains and other film dealers to try to grab business from Kodak. **********Given the strength of Kodak's brand name in the United States, a gradual advance is the most Fuji can hope for. One American says, ''No matter what Fuji does, I doubt that there is a big retail chain in the country that would have the courage to go with Fuji's film alone.'' **********Until now, Fuji's gains in the United States had come at the expense of film producers other than Kodak, such as 3M, Agfa-Gevaert and G.A.F., which dropped out of the amateur film business in the late 1970's. **********Analysts speculate that Fuji may someday snatch 15 percent of the huge American film market, but they agree that getting American consumers to break the habit of reaching for one of Kodak's yellow boxes every time they want film will be a formidable task. **********Fuji's Olympic sponsorship is a step in that direction, although Kodak has seized the right to advertise its photographic products during televised broadcasts of the Games. **********Internationally, Fuji's prospects are brighter outside the United States, where brand loyalty to Kodak is weaker. Fuji already holds nearly half the film and paper business in Southeast Asia. **********Fuji's share of the West European market is a bit more than 10 percent. To aid its European effort, Fuji is building a manufacturing facility in the Netherlands, to open next August. **********But although Fuji opened an operation in Anaheim, Calif., last year to develop film, it has no plans yet to build a manufacturing plant in North America. First, Mr. Ohnishi stresses, Fuji must reach a higher level of ''stable sales,'' but he does not say what that threshold is. Analysts place that critical market share at 10 percent or slightly more. **********''Fuji will be careful,'' predicts Yuichi Kohasi, an analyst for the Daiwa Securities Company in Tokyo. ''But exports should be one of the company's major forces for growth over the next several years.'' **********Mr. Ohnishi says his company's growth over the long term will depend on its ability to wed developments in chemistry and optics with microelectronics to create ''hybrid technologies'' with commercial applications in video, semiconductors, office equipment and medical instruments. **********Fuji has been laying the groundwork for its tilt toward microelectronics since the mid-1970's, when its top management decided a shift of course was needed and began hiring more electronics engineers. In Japan, bringing such expertise into the corporate fold is not a matter of bidding for people with money. **********Instead, it is a slow, painstaking process of nurturing contacts with university professors, whose recommendations are the most important factor in determining where their students will work after graduation. ''It has taken us nearly a decade to develop close relations with professors at Japan's leading universities,'' Mr.  Ueda said. **********Fuji's research and development spending has increased steadily: Today the company's budget for it amounts to 6.5 percent of sales, up from 5 percent five years ago. Of the 140 or so engineers Fuji hires every year, about 100 now go into its research laboratories, compared with 65 five years ago, Mr. Ueda says. **********Recently, Fuji's fastest-growing line has been videotape, a product that Kodak does not make. In the late 1970's, Fuji came into the field forcefully, intent upon fashioning a high- quality image, often pricing its products slightly higher than its rivals'. **********Today Fuji is among the world's largest producers of videotape, analysts estimate, closely trailing only TDK, Hitachi, Maxell and Sony. But analysts note that, thanks to aggressive marketing efforts, the growth in Fuji's sales during the past six months has been faster than that of the other big videotape producers. **********Videotape accounts for an estimated 80 percent of Fuji's magnetics products division, which also includes audio tape, and floppy disks and memory tape for computers. From 1978 to 1982, the division's sales jumped nearly fivefold, to $297 million. So far, the videotape business has yielded high profits, helping Fuji's overall profitability to outpace its revenue growth. In the five-year span, when sales about doubled, to $2.5 billion, Fuji's net income nearly tripled, to $243 million. **********Fuji began making floppy disks three years ago, but only within the past year or so has a sizable market developed, and now it is a leading Japanese producer. Mr. Ohnishi expects the growth of floppy disk sales to average nearly 50 percent annually over the next five years. **********Earlier this year, Fuji introduced a computerized radiography system that is essentially an advance over the conventional X-ray. It requires far less X-ray exposure for the patient, and computerization improves the image as well as storing and processing information about patients. **********By 1987, some analysts predict that yearly sales of Fuji's system could be as much as $250 million. Yet others warn that the prospects may be far more limited. **********In the current fiscal year, ended Oct. 20, analysts estimate that the company's not-yet-reported earnings were flat or slipped slightly for cyclical reasons. But while Fuji's profits have leveled off, Kodak's have fallen sharply. Still, ''comparing Fuji's financial performance with that of Kodak recently is like comparing apples and oranges,'' said Darrel E. Whitten, an analyst for Prudential- Bache Securities in Tokyo. **********For 1984, analysts estimate Fuji's earnings will rise 15 to 20 percent. **********Of greater long-term significance is the drastic improvement in Fuji's profit margins, as it improves its production efficiency and introduces new products. According to Prudential- Bache, Fuji's pretax operating margins widened to 20.4 percent in 1982, up from 12 percent in 1978. By 1986, the company's operating margins should reach 27 percent, Prudential- Bache predicts. By comparison, Kodak's operating margins are put at 28.3 percent in 1978, 22.5 percent in 1982 and 25 percent in 1986. **********KNOWN as an efficiently managed company that executes well-thought-out plans, Fuji has a style very much in the Japanese mold, with the emphasis on collective endeavor. Its corporate history does not include a charismatic leader of the stature of Konosuke Matsushita, founder of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, or a chief executive whose face is instantly recognized like Akio Morita, chairman of the Sony Corporation. For his part, Mr. Ohnishi discourages questions about his hobbies or other personal matters. **********An anecdote involving Mr. Ueda, the 53-year-old senior managing director and chemist, seems representative of the attitude at Fuji. Last year, the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers in Los Angeles gave Mr. Ueda the 82d Herbert T. Kalmus Award, named for the inventor of Technicolor, for his work on developing special color movie film. **********In his home, Mr. Ueda has a gold- plated copy of the medal. The real one, which is all gold, hangs in the Fuji laboratory in Ashigara, west of Tokyo. ''The technological advances were the result of group effort,'' Mr. Ueda said. ''The real medal is where it belongs.'' **********SELLING JAPAN ONKODAK'S YELLOW BOX **********TOKYO Kodak, giant of the world's photographic industry, is a small-time operator in Japan. The problem Kodak faces here is the same one confronting Fuji in the United States - the difficulty of making headway against an adversary in a market where the rival brand name is all but synonymous with film. **********''People are not about to switch from the green Fuji box to that Kodak yellow here,'' said Robert Burghart, an analyst for W. I. Carr Sons & Company in Tokyo. **********Analysts estimate that Kodak's share of the Japanese market for amateur color film and paper is about 15 percent, compared with 75 percent for Fuji. **********Kodak's products have been sold in Japan for more than eight decades. Yet its early start and high-quality products did Kodak little good when the Japanese market for amateur photography genuinely began to develop in the 1950's and 1960's, largely because of the prohibitively high tariffs on imported film and restrictions on direct investment by foreign companies. Today, these market barriers no longer exist. **********To explain why price-cutting will not be part of Fuji's international strategy, Minoru Ohnishi, Fuji's president, points to Kodak's experience in Japan earlier this year. The price of Kodak film, Mr. Ohnishi said, was cut but Japan's camera-toting throngs were not impressed. ''We heard some people say that Kodak film must not be as good as before since it is cheaper,'' he said. **********Of the Kodak price-trimming, one Japanese analyst said, ''It was not a successful tactic at all.'' **********The Japanese distributor of Kodak's amateur film, Nagase Sangyo, replies that there was no formal program of price-cutting for market share. Rather, retailers sold film at reduced prices to do a little ''inventory clearing'' after Kodak introduced new lines of film, according to a Nagase Sangyo official. The move was not extraordinary, he added, noting that Fuji had done something similar itself. **********Analysts say Kodak's price cuts were steeper and lasted longer. But one Japanese analyst agreed that Kodak's reductions were more likely cyclical shelf- clearing than an effort to strengthen its hand here."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/09/business/eg-g-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 55, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EG&G INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "EG&G INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/21/business/bankamerica-rose-15.3-in-2d-quarter.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 825, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANKAMERICA ROSE 15.3% IN 2D QUARTER", "print_headline": "BANKAMERICA ROSE 15.3% IN 2D QUARTER", "body_text": " **********The BankAmerica Corporation reported yesterday that net income rose 15.3 percent in the second quarter, to $141.9 million, from $123.1 million in the comparable period a year earlier. **********On a per share basis, net income increased only 2.4 percent, to 84 cents a share, from 82 cents a share. The per share increase was smaller because the $141.9 million net income figure for 1983's second quarter was not lowered by the $15 million that was paid in preferred stock dividends.

Continental Illinois **********The Continental Illinois Corporation, the nation's sixth-largest banking organization, said yesterday that its net income for the second quarter totaled $31.2 million, or 78 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $63 million in the period a year before. **********The deficit reported in last year's second quarter was one of the largest quarterly losses ever reported by the banking company. It resulted largely from Continental's purchase of about $1 billion in loans fromthe failed Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City. **********Despite the improved earnings, Continental said its nonperforming credits, or problem loans, stood at $2.08 billion in the latest quarter, and accounted for 6.6 percent of its total loans outstanding. About a quarter of these problem loans were purchased from Penn Square before it was closed on July 5, 1982, the bank said. Continental owns the Continental National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago. **********A year ago, Continental said its nonperforming credits totaled $1.3 billion, or 3.7 percent of its total loan portfolio. Analysts said the larger amount of problem loans reported for this year's second quarter mean that the Chicago-based banking organization will continue to have difficulties. **********''The direction of the magnitude'' of the nonperforming credits ''runs counter to other major banks and could be a source of concern,'' said James Wooden of Merrill Lynch. He added that no other major banks have problem loans that comprise as high a percentage of their loans porfolios as Continental. **********At the same time, however, other analysts said they expect the economic recovery and improved business conditions among many of the banks customers to result in a rapid improvement in its loan portfolio this year. **********John J. Mason of Interstate Securities Inc. maintained that Continental's problem loans are a ''finite problem.'' Even if the bank is only able to recover ''25 cents on the dollar from the Penn Square loans,'' he said, many of the other loans it has now classified as problems will be repaid in full. The companies that have those loans, which include many heavy industrial concerns in the Middle West, are only beginning to feel the effects of the recovery, and their balance sheets will continue to improve, he added.Part of the reason for Continental's improved earnings in the latest quarter was increased income from interest payments and a wide profit margin on those payments. It said its interest was $242.1 million, or $6.1 million more than in the 1982 second quarter. Its margin on interest payments, or the amount left after deducting the costs to service loans, was 2.66 percent, compared with 2.28 percent a year earlier, the company said. operating costssthe if **********The company said its provision for credit losses in the second quarter was $95 million.

Ogarkov, chief of the general staff, said that efforts by the United States to achieve military superiority were moving the talks on limiting strategic nuclear weapons ''in the same direction'' as the negotiations on medium-range weapons in Europe that were broken off by the Kremlin on Nov. 23. Another session of the strategic arms talks is scheduled Tuesday in Geneva, where the talks on medium-range arms were also held. **********Andropov's Health Is Discussed **********The warning of a possible breakdown in the talks on strategic weapons came at a news conference at which a senior Communist Party official made the fullest statement yet on the health of Yuri V. Andropov, the Soviet leader. **********The party official, Leonid M. Zamyatin, said that Mr. Andropov, who has been absent from public occasions for more than 15 weeks, was recovering from what he implied was a cold and was attending to ''party and state affairs in their full scope.'' The news conference also featured the Kremlin's clearest statement yet on its refusal to resume negotiations on medium-range nuclear weapons unless the new American missiles are withdrawn from Europe. **********'False Optimism' Derided **********Georgi M. Korniyenko, a First Deputy Foreign Minister, derided Western leaders' ''false optimism'' that these negotiations would resume. **********With these and other remarks, the Soviet officials set out a position on the arms talks that seemed to be tougher than the statement issued by Mr. Andropov after the Soviet walkout from the medium-range talks. **********Marshal Ogarkov, nine rows of ribbons on his khaki uniform, set forth the military's position on the missile talks against a backdrop of a multicolored chart showing the arms of the two sides and the proposals that each has made in two years of talks at Geneva. He said President Reagan's proposals on medium-range weapons had been absurd and said they were intended from the outset to block agreement so the United States could achieve the ability to inflict a ''disarming nuclear strike'' against the Soviet Union with Pershing 2 and cruise missiles close to Soviet frontiers. **********He said a first-strike strategy was senseless since both sides had many nuclear weapons with many basing systems and redundant command systems that made a return blow certain. ''Retaliation will be inevitable in all cases,'' he said. **********The marshal said that Washington, having blocked agreement on medium- range weapons to clear the way for deploying them, appeared to be ''pursuing the same goal'' in the talks on strategic arms. **********He said the Americans sought to exclude limits on bombers and bomber- launched cruise missiles, an area in which he said the United States had a lead of 7,000 warheads. Although his figure of a lead of 7,000 warheads agrees approximately with estimates published in the West, the Soviet Union has virtually ignored the bomber as a delivery vehicle for strategic nuclear weapons, concentrating instead on delivery by missile. **********In addition, Marshal Ogarkov said, Washington wanted cuts in the Soviet land-based missile force that would force a fundamental restructuring of the Soviet armory costing billions of rubles. **********Speaking of the end of the medium- range negotiations, the marshal said of the strategic weapons talks: ''I believe they are moving in the same direction.''  Andropov Said to Have a Cold **********The issue of Mr. Andropov's health arose in response to questions from Western reporters, and Mr. Zamyatin, head of the International Information Department of the party's Central Committee, responded with what appeared to be a prepared statement. **********His response was later carried in full by the official press agency Tass and on the principal evening television news program. **********''As Yuri Andropov has recently said in his letter of response to the leaders of the Physicians for Peace movement, he could not meet with them because of a cold,'' Mr. Zamyatin said, speaking of a message from the Soviet leader that was published in late October. **********''At the present time Yuri Andropov is recovering,'' Mr. Zamyatin continued. ''He is managing in full measure party and state affairs, including questions pertaining to the U.S.S.R. Defense Council.'' **********When a Western reporter asked whether there was any substance to reports that Mr. Andropov had an illness much more serious than a cold and had been in a hospital, Mr. Zamyatin responded: ''I do not believe your insinuations because they do not correspond to reality. Everything I meant to inform you about formally I covered in my statement, which is true to fact.''  Resumption of Talks Discounted **********In his statement on the medium- range missile talks, Mr. Korniyenko spoke scornfully of the prediction by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany that Moscow would eventually return to the negotiations. Mr. Kohl based his prediction on a message from Mr. Andropov that said the Kremlin did not like to think of the breakdown of the talks as irreversible. **********The Foreign Ministry official said it took ''an amazingly exuberant imagination'' to read this as a readiness to resume talks ''against the background of deployment'' of the American missiles. **********He said that when Mr. Andropov spoke of a return to the previous situation, he meant ''in the first place deeds,'' and this required the removal of the American missiles whose arrival in Britain, West Germany and Italy prompted the Soviet withdrawal from the talks. **********As for the possibility that the medium-range talks could be resumed in the context of the strategic arms negotiations, he said it would be pointless to talk of such a merger since the medium-range talks no longer existed. At this point, the official used a Russian idiom that translates roughly as died.   Countermeasures Discussed **********Adding some details about the military countermeasures announced by the Kremlin after it withdrew from the talks, Marshal Ogarkov said the additional seaborne missiles to be deployed against the United States would be placed adjacent to United States shores and would be ''adequate from the point of view of range, yield, accuracy and, which is particularly important, flight time to target'' to create a threat for the United States equal to that created for the Soviet Union by the new American missiles in Europe. **********Soviet statements have said that Pershing 2's in West Germany will cut warning time of an American strike to as little as six minutes, although American officials have responded that the time will be twice that. **********He also cited ''forms of military activity'' other than those involving nuclear weapons that would be adopted to counter the Western deployment, but he declined to give details. **********In further remarks about SS-20's, Mr. Zamyatin said that none of the 243 missiles so far deployed against Europe was aimed at population centers or against any nation not already deploying nuclear weapons against the Soviet Union, a statement that seemed to be intended to foster European protests against the American weapons."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/15/world/us-plans-inquiry-on-barbie.html": {"writer_name": "Ralph Blumenthal", "pub_date": "1983-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 541, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. PLANS INQUIRY ON BARBIE", "print_headline": "U.S. PLANS INQUIRY ON BARBIE", "body_text": " **********The Justice Department said today that it would conduct a full investigation into allegations that the United States Government assisted Klaus Barbie, a twice-convicted Nazi war criminal, to escape to Bolivia after World War II. **********The department said that it viewed the allegations ''with deep concern'' and that an initial review of Government files indicated that the assertions ''have sufficient merit to warrant a comprehensive investigation.'' **********The announcement came after days of maneuvering that included a message from William P.

The report of his visits to New Orleans and Miami, made under the pseudonym Klaus Altmann, was supported by immigration records, Justice Department officials said last week. **********According to authoritative accounts by Justice Department officials, Mr. Smith last week overruled the recommendations of some aides and rejected an investigation into the Barbie case on the ground that after all the years no prosecution was likely to result. A Note From Clark **********Last Friday, however, officials said Mr. Clark wrote a note to Mr.  Smith suggesting that the Justice Department was the place for an investigation after all. The department issued an announcement this afternoon: **********''Recent allegations have been made that Klaus Barbie had a relationship with the United States Government in the years after World War II and that the U.S. Government assisted his travel to Bolivia in 1951. **********''We view these allegations with deep concern, and a preliminary review of pertinent Government files indicates that these allegations have sufficient merit to warrant a comprehensive investigation. **********''Therefore the Department of Justice is undertaking a full investigation. The object of this investigation is to develop a factual record of any relationship that may have existed between Klaus Barbie and the U.S. Government at any time. A report to Congress and the public will be made as soon as the investigation is completed.'' Special Office May Get Case **********Further word on the conduct of the investigation is expected to come Tuesday. An official familar with the matter said the inquiry would most likely be put into the hands of Allan M. Ryan, director of the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations. The special investigations office was formed in 1978 to examine cases of people suspected of being Nazis or collaborators illegally living in the United States. **********Should the special investigations office get the assignment, it was said, Mr. Ryan may leave the office to take on the Barbie case fulltime as a kind of special prosecutor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/14/world/evil-schemes-scorned-at-south-korean-s-burial.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1983-10-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 796, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "'EVIL SCHEMES' SCORNED AT SOUTH KOREAN'S BURIAL", "print_headline": "'EVIL SCHEMES' SCORNED AT SOUTH KOREAN'S BURIAL", "body_text": " **********The South Koreans killed in a bombing last Sunday in Rangoon, Burma, were buried today after an outdoor funeral service that turned into a huge rally denouncing North Korea for what one speaker called its ''evil schemes.'' **********North Korea is generally assumed here to be responsible for the bombing, although the Government has not officially offered any evidence of this. **********Sixteen South Koreans were killed instantly in the explosion, which tore through a mausoleum in Rangoon dedicated to Burmese martyrs. It was announced this morning that a 17th person, Deputy Finance Minister Lee Ki Uk, had died at an American Air Force base in the Philippines where he was being treated for serious injuries. **********Perhaps a Million Mourners **********Hundreds of thousands of people, perhaps as many as a million, filled most of an enormous outdoor plaza often used for approved mass demonstrations. **********With its banners and orderly ranks, the crowd had the earmarks of carefully arranged gatherings that are familiar here. Nevertheless, it was the largest rally that many could recall in several years. And the grief etched into many faces spoke of jumbled emotions created by both the Rangoon incident and the downing by a Soviet fighter plane last month of a Korean Air Lines passenger plane carrying 269 people. **********The 17 slain South Koreans, who included some of the Government's highest-ranking officials, were eulogized in speeches as the ''proud pillars of this country.''  Portraits and Incense **********The speakers addressed the dead, turning their backs to the huge crowd and facing outsized photographs of the victims that were decked with black ribbons and almost enveloped by yellow and white chrysanthemums. The pictures lined a long platform thick with the smell of incense. **********Rain that had fallen all morning stopped the moment that the service began with a wail from a siren marking a minute of silence observed throughout the country. Representatives from more than 40 nations were here, among them the United States Secretary of Defense, Caspar W. Weinberger. **********Not present, however, was South Korea's President, Chun Doo Hwan, who escaped harm in Burma, where he had been on a state visit. Security reasons presumably were a consideration, though some officials said Mr. Chun also did not want his presence to draw attention from the bombing victims. **********The speeches were ornate in language and few in number. After prayers, relatives of those who were killed mounted the platform to lay flowers by the photographs. Men in black suits and women in billowing white dresses bowed their heads, and from the platform there rose a loud wailing of the sort that has been heard often in South Korea in recent weeks. **********But as much as the ceremony was a prayer for the dead, it was also an opportunity to assail North Korea.   'Without Any Brotherly Feeling' **********For its part, the North Korean Government has dismissed the charges as ''preposterous,'' and its Central News Agency accused South Korea today of aggravating tensions on the Korean peninsula. **********The tightly controlled press here said today that Burmese and South Korean investigators had found ''physical evidence'' of North Korean involvement. This was said to include batteries for a remote-controlled explosive device, an unexploded bomb shell and a remote- controlled ''wave receiver.'' It was not made clear why this material conclusively implicated the North Koreans. **********''Without any brotherly feeling,'' Prime Minister Kim Sang Hyup told the crowd of mourners, ''they are jealous of our development and resentful of our growth, and have plotted countless evil schemes at home and abroad to foment internal confusion among us.'' **********After the funeral service ended and the familiies left, hundreds of large banners that had been kept hidden were suddenly unfurled. They carried such messages as ''There is a limit to patience'' and ''Let's avenge the barbarous act of North Korea.'' **********North Korea Reports Infiltration **********TOKYO, Friday, Oct. 14 (AP) - North Korea charged today that at least 10 South Korean soldiers crossed into the North Korean side of the demilitarized zone between the two countries around midnight Thursday and fired more than 500 rounds of ammunition. **********The state-run Korean Central News Agency, in a report monitored in Tokyo, said North Korea immediately placed a telephone call to South Korea protesting the ''armed attack.'' **********The incident occurred at a time of increased tension between North and South Korea following the bombing in Rangoon, Burma. The North Korean press agency said the infiltration of South Korean soldiers Thursday night ''is a premeditated military provocation for leading the situation to the brink of war.'' It did not say if North Korean troops fired back or if anyone was wounded."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/23/business/questions-on-arkla-gas-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Wendell Rawls", "pub_date": "1983-07-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2064, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "QUESTIONS ON ARKLA GAS DEAL", "print_headline": "QUESTIONS ON ARKLA GAS DEAL", "body_text": " **********For the past quarter century Arkla Inc., owner of the powerful Arkansas-Louisiana Gas Company, has been an aggressive acquisitor of gas and oil leases and a developer of those lands. **********But last New Year's Eve, Arkla's board of directors agreed to sell its leases on almost 15,000 acres in the gas-rich Arkoma Basin in northwest Arkansas. The purchaser was the Arkoma Production Corporation, a small exploration and drilling company owned by Jerral W. Jones, a former insurance executive who went into gas and oil drilling in the 1970's. He is a close friend of E. Sheffield Nelson, Arkla's board chairman and chief executive. **********The transaction had some unusual features that seemed very favorable to Arkoma. That raised questions by other executives in the industry about whether Mr. Nelson acted in the best interests of Arkla in dealing with his friend. Arkla has even acknowledged in a proxy statement the possibility of ''conflicts of interest.'' And W.T. Murphy Jr., an Arkla board member for more than 25 years, said in an interview that he had asked the company for ''10 reasons why this is a good deal for Arkla and I never got a list.'' **********Plans Race for Governor **********Both Mr. Jones and Mr. Nelson are millionaires who made their marks as salesmen. Mr. Jones, 40 years old, is a former University of Arkansas football player who became friendly with Mr. Nelson a decade ago as part of a group of half-a-dozen young businessmen who had become influential in Arkansas politics. Mr. Nelson, 42, is a lawyer who joined Arkla as a salesman while still in college and became chief executive in his early 30's. He recently announced plans to run for Governor. **********The sale price for the leases was $15 million. Bill Williams, the Arkansas State geologist, described that price ''as probably a real big bargain'' for gas land in this northwestern Arkansas-eastern Oklahoma area. The 15,000 acres are in the Cecil and Aetna gas fields, which have already produced almost half a trillion cubic feet of natural gas. According to Mr. Williams, they appear to have about that much more in untapped reserves. That would mean a potential market value of about $250 million for gas from the 15,000 acres. **********By comparison, within the last three years, gas land in the Arkoma Basin has been auctioned at $2 million for 640-acre sections, or the equivalent of $45 million for 15,000 acres. Arkla still has substantial additional holdings in the Arkoma Basin. **********Under the accord, Mr. Jones's Arkoma Production Corporation promised to sell the gas it produces to Mr. Nelson's Arkla Inc., whose Arkansas-Louisiana Gas Company supplies more than 80 percent of the residential and commercial energy in Arkansas. ''The key for a producer, in this day and time, is not having the gas,'' Mr. Williams said. ''It's having somebody who will buy it.'' Accord on Drilling Costs **********Mr. Nelson made it clear in an interview that Arkla was likely to buy the promised gas from Arkoma, although a purchase contract did not exist. He said that Arkla had agreed to match all of Arkoma's drilling costs dollar for dollar up to $10 million a year on the 15,000 acres. That would be almost 12 percent of Arkla's annual drilling budget of $85 million. Mr. Nelson said that Arkla would pay $3.40 a thousand cubic feet, a ceiling price, for gas recovered from these new wells, each of which will cost $300,000 to $500,000 to drill. **********''The Arkoma deal increases our drilling budget by another $10 million,'' Mr. Nelson argued, in response to criticism in the gas industry that Arkla did not have to sell its leases in order to get $10 million drilling participations. Others with whom Arkla has partnerships in the Arkoma Basin would have put up this money, the critics say. Mr. Nelson acknowledges that this is true, but that only Mr. Jones approached with a deal. **********Arkla also agreed to finance $11.25 million of Arkoma's $15 million purchase price at 10 percent annually, an interest rate that was 2 percentage points below the prime rate when the deal was made and about 3.5 percentage points below what Arkansas banks then were charging many of their best corporate customers. **********Mack Norton, former chairman of the Arkansas Public Service Commission, said of the $15 million lease sale, ''I'm surprised that Nelson would sell the land without trying to get the best price possible.'' Mr. Norton said the commission had not been told of the deal in advance. ''Not necessarily as a matter of law, but as a matter of courtesy, the commission should have been apprised of the loan and a transaction of that size,'' he added. **********That type of comment has raised questions among some gas industry executives about Mr. Nelson's business relationship with Mr. Jones's Arkoma Production Corportion and Mr. Nelson's possible future involvement in Arkoma. 'One of the Best Deals' **********In the interview in his Little Rock office, Mr. Nelson, who resigned as president of Arkla in May at the company's annual meeting, but remains as chairman and chief executive, acknowledged his friendship with Mr. Jones. But he denied having ''any ownership whatever'' in Arkoma Production, which is privately held. He insisted that the sale of the leases to Arkoma was a good business deal. **********Mr. Norton, the former Public Service Commission chairman, was skeptical of Mr. Nelson's assertion that it was a good business deal for Arkla. ''Nelson probably doesn't own any part of Arkoma yet,'' Mr. Norton said in an interview, ''but he may in the future.'' **********The $15 million lease purchase actually represented Arkla's halfinterest in this acreage. The remaining 50 percent of the land in the Cecil field was held by the Stephens Production Company of Fort Smith, Ark. In addition, Stephens was one of the principal shareholders in the Aetna field acreage. The others were the Carter Oil Company, a wholly owned Exxon subsidiary; Continental Oil, and the Union Life Insurance Company, owned by Ray Hunt of Dallas, a son of the late H.L. Hunt. **********Exxon and the other small partners did not sell to Arkoma or try to buy the Arkla leases themselves, although they had a right of first refusal to match Arkoma's $15 million offer. Their principal problem presumably was matching that aspect of the Arkoma deal in which Mr.  Jones dedicated to Arkla all the gas produced on the 15,000 acres, plus the gas from 100,000 additional acres that he holds. **********In addition, Mr. Jones agreed to sell to Arkla, if that company wants it, any gas that his company produces from leases that Arkoma acquires over the next five years in a five-state area. These states are Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. **********The addditional acreage appears to enhance the quality of the deal. But some experts question the location and value of that acreage, saying that at least some of it ''is raw wildcat land.'' Special Relationship a Factor **********Independent gas producers insist that only Mr. Jones, with his special relationship with Mr. Nelson, could be successful in getting Arkla to buy the gas that Arkoma Production produces. As Mr.  Williams, the state geologist, said: ''The secret of success in the gas fields today is not having the gas, but having a market for the gas. If you can make a deal where you can get reserves and also have a pipeline and a market, you have made a real good deal.'' **********Mr. Jones was recently elected to Arkla's board of directors, presumably putting him in a position to help assure that Arkla buys gas from Arkoma. Acknowledging this potential, Arkla said in a proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that ''the business of oil and gas exploration and production engaged in by Arkoma Production Company and Mr. Jones may in the future involve conflicts of interest with the Company (Arkla) or its subsidiaries.'' **********In another major aspect of the Arkoma-Arkla deal, Stephens Production Company gave up to Mr. Jones a ''good portion'' of its 50 percent stake in the Cecil field leases, Mr. Jones said in an interview. It did so not for cash, but because Mr. Jones put together a deal that permits Stephens to sell its gas to Arkla's Arkansas-Louisiana Gas Company for far more than the 55 cents per thousand cubic feet it has been receiving from Arkla under a long-term contract. **********Arkla has been paying other customers as much as $2.75 to $3.36 a thousand cubic feet for new gas, but Stephens Production was a special case involving not only low-priced, long-term contracts, but also animosity between Arkla's Mr. Nelson and Witt Stephens, the 76-year-old part owner of Stephens Production. Mr. Stephens formerly was chairman of Arkla and he took Mr. Nelson under his wing years ago, helping to train him and picking him to take over Arkla as chairman in 1972 at the age of 33. Jones's Advantages **********According to Mr. Jones, he began trying to put together his deal to buy the land leases from Arkla about 18 months ago and he acknowledged that his special relationship with Mr. Nelson gave him the advantage of knowing how to structure the deal successfully. **********He knew, for example, the details of the decade of animosity between Mr. Nelson and Mr. Stephens. The two men split shortly after Mr. Nelson became chairman of Arkla and none save the two participants seem to know exactly why. Mr. Stephens, a former state senator and longtime political power in Arkansas, has said he was unhappy with the way his successor operated the company. **********Mr. Jones knew that Stephens Production was an equal partner with Arkla on much of the Arkoma acreage leases. And he realized that both Arkla and Stephens Production were two of the largest gas and oil drillers and developers in the region and that neither needed assistance in drilling whatever land they had. **********But he also recognized that there would be no cooperation between the two unless Stephens gave up some of its holdings in order to get Arkla to take Stephens gas at more than the 55 cents per thousand cubic feet specified in the old purchase contracts. **********Since Stephens Production had difficulty selling new gas to Arkla, it also had difficulty convincing landholders that they should lease mineral rights to Stephens instead of to Arkla or to others who could sell into the Arkla pipeline at a higher price. **********So Mr. Jones, armed with such knowledge, bought into the Arkoma Basin properties with the idea of convincing Stephens that as one of three partners, he could put together a deal that Mr. Stephens himself could not. All Stephens Production had to do was give up to him a good portion of its lease holding. Neither Mr. Jones nor Stephens officials would say how much Stephens gave up to Mr. Jones. Political Plans **********Mr. Nelson has said he will leave Arkla at the end of the year and will most likely run for Governor in the 1986 election, as a Democrat. The incumbent, Bill Clinton, also a Democrat, could run again in 1986, but some politicians speculate that he will run for the United States Senate that year. **********Mr. Nelson is one of the highest-paid utility company executives in the country. In addition to his salary of $340,000 a year, he has exercised more than $1 million in stock appreciation rights in the past five years and has accumulated about $1.2 million more in such rights yet to be exercised. At a recent board meeting, he was granted additional stock appreciation rights on 60,000 more shares at $14 a share. **********Stock appreciation rights give the holder the option of selling his stock during designated periods each quarter without having bought the shares, thereby earning the differences between the exercise price and the market price. **********Arkla's stock closed Friday on the New York Stock Exchange at $26.50 a share, down 37 1/2 cents. It has traded between $12.75 and $28.50 in the last 52 weeks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/27/business/new-bond-rule-lightens-schedule.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 572, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW BOND RULE LIGHTENS SCHEDULE", "print_headline": "NEW BOND RULE LIGHTENS SCHEDULE", "body_text": " **********Friday will see the virtual end of bearer bonds in the municipal market.

Motley, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, would arrive in Managua Thursday on a two-day visit. He is to meet with Daniel Ortega Saavedra, coordinator of the ruling Sandinista junta, Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto Brockman and Interior Minister Tomas Borge. **********One official said Mr. Motley intended to caution the Sandinista leadership that if they engaged in cross-border warfare against neighboring countries, it could lead to invoking of diplomatic and economic sanctions against Nicaragua by the Organization of American States. **********This official also said there had been signs that the Sandinista leadership might be moving toward some regional agreement on the issues of curbing the flow of outside arms and military advisers into the region. **********Some Administration officials have interpreted these signs as indications that the Sandinista leadership was ''feeling the pressure'' from increased activities by Nicaraguan rebels and the show of United States forces in ground and naval exercises in the region. **********For these reasons, the Reagan Administration was eager to have Mr. Motley hold talks in Nicaragua. Mr. Motley was scheduled to visit Nicaragua last month for such talks but called off his trip when, according to the United States version of the incident, he was informed on the eve of his departure that no ranking Sandinista leaders would meet with him. **********Since then, several members of Congress, including critics of Administration policy, are reported to have advised the Nicaraguan Government that its leaders had made a mistake in not receiving Mr. Motley and his visit was rescheduled. He is to stop first, on Wednesday, in Belize to discuss the century-old border dispute between that country and Guatemala. **********On July 31, Richard B. Stone, the President's special envoy to Central America, met briefly with both Salvadoran guerrilla leaders and Nicaraguan Government leaders. But not since the spring of 1982 has the Administration held talks with the Sandinista Government at the policy-making level. **********Since then, Washington has worked to persuade the Nicaraguan Government to work on some regional agreements with other Latin American nations rather than negotiate directly with the United States. Officials said Mr. Motley did not want to supplant that process and would not engage in substantive negotiations. **********Washington is concerned about the risks of a border conflict between Nicaragua and either Honduras or Costa Rica, as anti-Sandinista rebels operating from bases in both these neighboring countries have stepped up activities this fall against the Nicaraguan Government.  The Nicaraguan Defense Minister, Humberto Ortega Saavedra, told a news conference on Oct. 1 that Nicaraguan troops would cross into border areas of its two neighbors in pursuit of ''counterrevolutionary'' guerrillas.

M-1 includes currency in circulation and checking accounts. **********The four dissenters were Karen N. Horn, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland; Robert P. Black, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond; William F. Ford, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and Henry C. Wallich, a member of the board of governors of the Fed. Mr. Ford, Mr. Black and Mrs. Horn dissented from the October policy change. Growth Targets Set **********At the February meeting, the Fed set a growth range for this year of 7 to 10 percent for M-2, which includes M-1, the new money market deposit accounts and savings. The target range for M-3, which includes M-2 and large certificates of deposit, was set at 6.5 to 9.5 percent. The range for M-1 was set at 4 to 8 percent. **********As of this week's meeting, Mr. Black, Mr. Ford and Mrs. Horn were replaced on the committee as voting members by three other reserve bank presidents who are considered more pragmatic and unlikely to dissent if the Fed continues to encourage the recovery and does not move to rein in the money supply growth quickly. **********According to the minutes, Mrs. Horn and Mr. Black dissented because they wanted to put more emphais on M-1. Mr. Ford wanted to begin to reduce the growth rate of M-1 gradually. He also opposed the Fed's decision to use several money supply figures in guiding policy. Mr. Wallich wanted lower overall target ranges for 1983 than the majority of the committee approved. 4 Dissenting Votes Rare **********There are often dissenting votes on the committee, although the Fed likes to have unanimity. But four dissenting votes is rare, officials said today, although there was an 8-to-4 split on the Fed's short-term policy set last July, a course that aided the sharp drop in interest rates late last summer and fall. Mr. Black, Mr. Ford and Mr. Wallich also dissented on this vote. **********The 8-to-4 split reflects the debate that is going on over current monetary policy. On one side - which includes monetarists - many economists and market analysts are arguing that the Fed has to concentrate on M-1 again and move soon to slow the very rapid growth of this money supply figure to be sure that inflation is not reignited sometime next year. They are advocating this policy even if it means a rise in short-term interest rates. **********On the other side are other economists and market analysts who argue that the Fed cannot tighten now because a rise in short-term interest rates would threaten the recovery."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/21/world/around-the-world-114548.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD", "body_text": " **********Belgian Aide Arrested As an Economic Spy **********BRUSSELS, Aug. 20 (Reuters) - Belgium has arrested a senior Foreign Ministry official and ordered several foreign diplomats it would not identify to leave the country for economic espionage, Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans announced today. **********Mr. Tindemans, in a radio interview, said the arrested official was Eugene Michiels, 60 years old, of the foreign trade division, who had been responsible for relations with East European countries. **********Belgian television said tonight that two Rumanians and one Soviet diplomat had already left the country on orders of the Government, and the Belgian radio said the total number of those asked to leave was five. **********Belgian authorities and officials at the Rumanian and Soviet embassies would not comment on the reports."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/18/business/frequency-electronics-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-jan-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FREQUENCY ELECTRONICS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 31", "print_headline": "FREQUENCY ELECTRONICS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/05/business/japan-trademarks-can-prove-elusive.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JAPAN TRADEMARKS CAN PROVE ELUSIVE", "print_headline": "JAPAN TRADEMARKS CAN PROVE ELUSIVE", "body_text": " **********When the McDonald's hamburger chain arrived in Japan in 1971, one of the last things company executives expected was trouble with its famous trademarks. **********The McDonald's Corporation had operated in the United States and other countries for years, and the company's golden arches had become an internationally known symbol of Americana. The company's lawyers had protected that hard-won name and symbol with a wall of trademarks, and as the company opened in Japan it anticipated little trouble in adding a few more. **********But when McDonald's lawyers walked into the national patent office here to apply for trademarks, they discovered to their dismay that, just the day before, a Japanese food distributor had registered as its own trademark the very same golden arches. Under Japanese trademark law, the food distributor, Marushin Foods Company, could become its owner. **********Little Progress Made **********After more than 10 years of negotiation and litigation, including a case that ended last year in Japan's supreme court, McDonald's has made little progress. Japanese trademark examiners have not yet approved the Japanese company's applications, and so McDonald's can still use its symbol. **********Legally, though, the Japanese company may still one day own the Mc-Donald symbol, although McDonald's lawyer, Mikako Fujiki, believes this will never happen, ''It would create quite a political problem,'' he said. **********Marushin wants the McDonald trademark to enhance its fast-food sales from vending machines.  As McDonald's and other American companies are discovering as they chase after a slice of Japan's huge consumer spending, the critical area of trademark rights is radically different from procedure in the United States, and for the unprepared, Japan can be a business nightmare. Difference in Laws **********In Japan, the first party to apply for a trademark usually ends up owning it, and that constitutes a major difference with American law. In the United States, a company or individual can apply for the Federal trademark protection of its words and symbols only after actually using them in interstate commerce. Once the Government grants a trademark registration, its owners gain strong protections against its use by others on a broad series of similar or related goods. **********But ''America is in a real minority here in its view of what a trademark should be,'' according to David S. Guttman, an American patent and trademark attorney in Tokyo and the former chairman of the licenses, patents and trademarks committee of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan. **********Japanese law does not require prior use for the application or registration of a trademark, and the law permits the use of the same trademark, registered to different owners, in 34 different classes of goods for which trademarks can be registered in Japan. **********Rather than group goods according to the standard international system, Japan groups them according to the kind of shop they would be sold in. Knives, for example, rather than falling in the class with forks and spoons, are in the same class as swords. If a company applies for a trademark in one class and not another, then anyone is free under the law to apply for the same trademark in another class of goods and to use it. Numerous Filings **********Domestic and foreign companies knowledgeable in the ways of Japan regularly file identical or similar trademarks in classes of goods even marginally related to their business, both as a defense against infringement and in anticipation of possible future use. Katsuyoshi Koyama, in-house counsel for Max Factor & Company, the cosmetics company that is a unit of Norton Simon Inc., said his operation has its major names and symbols registered in 10 classes, including medical products. **********Foreign - and especially American - trademarks are prizes in this competition, Mr. Guttman says, because so many Japanese travel abroad, particularly to the United States, and learn to respond to well-known foreign brand names and trademarks. **********American lawyers stationed here report that United States companies preparing to enter the Japanese market sometimes discover that a Japanese company already owns one or more of their trademarks. The areas of food and drink, clothing, sports equipment, toys, drugs, and highly specialized industrial and scientific equipment seem particularly vulnerable, according to Mr. Guttman. **********''I've heard of cases where some Japanese companies were accused of buying foreign marks for later profits,'' says George O'Haver, inhouse counsel for the Coca-Cola Company in Japan. ''But this isn't as much of a problem as 20 years ago.'' **********When it decided to sell its soaps in Japan, the Neutrogen Corporation, a soap-maker headquartered in Los Angeles, found its trademark Neutrogena already registered in Japan by an individual.  The American company was forced to acquire the name from the individual, even though he had not used it to market a soap. **********Hunter Hale, an American lawyer who has prepared trademark advisories for the United States Embassy, says the Japanese law firm that he works for, Ishii Law Office, takes on a new case almost every month to retrieve a trademark. Kent Gilbert, an associate with the law firm in Japan that handles McDonald's, says it is ''common'' for Japanese companies to own foreign trademarks without authorization from the overseas company. Mr. Guttman concurs. Coca-Cola Negotiating **********Mr. O'Haver says Coca-Cola here is negotiating to buy back one of its trademarks from a Japanese owner. But he would not identify either the trademark or the Japanese owner. He added that Coca-Cola faces ''a continuing problem'' with the unauthorized use of its trademarks to decorate T-shirts, ashtrays and other items. **********''If you have a mark like our mark that is commonly identified as a part of Western culture,'' he notes, ''they think they can use it to decorate anything. The Japanese people have not really been tuned into the concept of industrial trademark property.'' **********General Electric has run into a problem with Japanese companies that use trademarks that include the letters GE. In recent years, it says that it has sometimes purchased these trademarks from the companies, or has contested their registration as too similar to its own famous GE trademark, which is registered in Japan by General Electric. **********Some foreign companies can afford to take the trademark issue to court, but the chances of victory are slim if the unauthorized owner was clearly the first to apply for the trademark. **********Mr. Guttman says: ''Trademark law here is unforgiving.'' Japan's unfair competition prevention law allows the foreign owner of a trademark to stop its unauthorized registration if the trademark is well known in Japan and if its use would create confusion among consumers. But these are often difficult standards to meet."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/18/business/pain-reliever-award-upset.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 167, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pain Reliever Award Upset", "print_headline": "Pain Reliever Award Upset", "body_text": " **********A Federal court has overturned a $170 million award to three men who charged that Johnson & Johnson Inc. had suppressed a pain control device. **********A three-judge panel of the Eighth United States Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-to-1 Wednesday that the men failed to show that they were hurt financially as a result of Johnson & Johnson's purported violation of antitrust laws. **********The case centers on an electronic device invented by Norman Hagfors in the late 1960's.

Small Increases Urged **********In fact, both resolutions call for far more revenue than Senator Dole wants to legislate this year, aides have said. The Senator said again today that increases for the fiscal years 1984 and 1985 should be small, coming from measures to strengthen taxpayer compliance and to broaden the revenue base by shrinking deductions. **********Senator Dole, who will not be a conferee because he does not sit on the Budget Committee, made his threat in a press release issued by his office here in advance of remarks he made in Portland, Ore. **********The Senator and his wife, Elizabeth Hanford Dole, the Secretary of Transportation, were campaigning for the re-election in 1984 of Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon, and will go on to Alaska tonight to urge re-election of Senator Ted Stevens, the Senate majority whip. **********On the other side of Capitol Hill, the House majority leader, Jim Wright, Democrat of Texas, signaling a new Democratic battle cry, insisted to reporters, ''It's Ronald Reagan's deficit.'' The slogan apparently portended an unwillingness by some House Democrats to accede to nonmilitary spending reductions sought by Republican Senators and the Administration. **********Mr. Wright also threw his weight behind an emerging Senate-House Democratic effort to send to President Reagan a separate bill that put a limit, possibly $700, on the 10 percent tax cut that goes into effect July 1. If, as expected, Mr. Reagan vetoes it, Mr. Wright said, ''It's just going to highlight his intransigence about tax cuts for the wealthy.'' **********Senator Dole expressed opposition to limiting the July tax cut, the third of the three-stage tax cut sponsored by President Reagan in 1981 as a major element of his economic policy. ''Low-and moderateincome taxpayers get 72 percent of the benefit of the third-year tax cut,'' Senator Dole said. **********An aide said that a $700 cap would deny tax relief to a single person who did not itemize deductions on income above $31,000. For a family of four without itemized deductions, the ceiling would be $39,250, he said. Senator Dole's position is that such taxpayers are not genuinely rich, the aide said. **********Congressional aides said the House-Senate conference would start no earlier than June 8 and the prognosis was murky. ''The differences are clear - on spending and taxes - and they're large,'' a Senate aide said. ''We haven't really made any progress.'' Talks with the House staff have resolved some technical matters, he said, but with the Senate in recess and with some House members away this week there have been no talks between committee members on big issues. **********''It's hard to find Senators or Senate staff,'' a House aide said.  ''There's no real activity this week.'' Senator Dole's statement said: ''A budget conference that calls for huge tax increases will give the tax-writing committees an impossible job. If the conferees press for unrealistically high taxes, the result may be no revenue increase at all.'' **********Senator Dole regards as beyond consideration the Senate's target of $51 billion of additional revenues for the fiscal year 1986, which starts Oct. 1, 1985. He was said to regard as somewhat high the Senate targets of $9 billion for the fiscal year 1984, which starts Oct. 1, and $13 billion for the fiscal year 1985, although on the floor he said they were ''not unrealistic.'' The House-passed budget calls for increases of $30 billion, $40 billion and $50 billion, respectively. **********Senator Dole, looking ahead to Finance Committee legislation, said that the panel would hold hearings on spending reductions June 15-16. He announced tax hearings for June 22 on fringe benefits and employer-paid health insurance, June 23 on possible compliance actions and June 28-29 on ''assorted tax expenditures.'' **********As for broadening the taxable income base, Senator Dole and his staff have talked about disallowing sales tax deductions and some deductions for consumer interest payments. **********Other changes being considered at the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee include either lengthening the depreciation period for buildings that change hands or curtailing ''churning,'' the frequency with which they can be sold with full depreciation for the new owner. **********Senator Dole has said repeatedly that significant revenue can be raised from compliance actions. Ways and Means Committee aides are skeptical.

Another country cannot pay its debts. What is to be done? The banks and the country's government start out on a well-worn path. The bankers get together to add up the country's debts. The government seeks help from the International Monetary Fund. The I.M.F. sends out a mission. **********After long discussions, the mission and government agree on a set of austere monetary and fiscal policies. The I.M.F. then approves a credit line on which the government can draw until its policy package has taken effect. **********Once that is done, the banks agree to reschedule some of the country's debt. Debts coming due during the next year are stretched out for an additional seven years or so, including a two-year grace period in which the country will pay interest but will not repay principal. The banks also agree to lend more money. Everyone sighs with relief. The crisis appears to be over. But no one should be happy yet. **********The banks have lent the country money so that it can pay the interest that it owed them anyway. To put it bluntly, they have added doubtful assets to their balance sheets in order to protect their income statements. They have done so, moreover, with the tacit approval of bank supervisors who are paid to keep this sort of thing from happening. **********The government has promised policy changes that are bound to create opposition at home. It has also given hostages to fortune.  Governments can promise to cut spending and raise tax rates and some can keep their promises. No government can promise firmly to reduce its deficit, because it does not control all of the events that influence its deficit. **********The I.M.F. has worrisome problems, too. It has put its famous ''seal of approval'' on the government's policy package and it faces a hard question if that package falls apart. Should it suspend the country's right to draw on its credit line or renegotiate the policy package? If it blocks the credit line, it may spark a new crisis. If it renegotiates the package, it tarnishes its seal of approval. **********No one talks about these problems and many bankers say that they should not worry us. Countries like Mexico and Brazil are good credit risks. They have liquidity problems but do not have solvency problems. When the world economy starts to recover, the debtors' export earnings will begin to grow again and they will be able to service their debts. **********Everyone agrees that recovery will help. It is indeed essential for solving the debt problem. But no one is forecasting the vigorous recovery that is needed to get the debtors out of trouble. Six months from now, Mexico may find that it has drawn all it can from the I.M.F. and used up its bank credits, too. Its budget deficit has fallen, but not by much. Its balance of payments has improved, but it has to borrow more to pay for its imports. Many questions come to mind. **********Will banks be willing to lend what Mexico needs to get through the year? Will they be willing to stretch out more debt at the end of 1983 and what new policies will Mexico have to provide in return?  When will some small bank declare that Mexico has defaulted, blowing down the house of cards? What will happen in three years, when banks are asked to stretch out debts that were stretched out once before? **********What will happen when a government decides it would be less costly to walk away from its debts? It would, of course, be cut off from all credit and punished in other ways, too. But it would save billions of dollars. Even more important, it would spare its citizens the social costs of prolonged economic austerity and spare itself the political costs. **********If we cannot shrug off these questions, we cannot dismiss the possibility of damaging debt crises in the next few years. We should therefore examine alternatives to the current case-by-case, year-byyear approach. **********ANY new approach must protect the banks' depositors, but it must do more. It must reduce the developing countries' debt burdens so that they do not have to pursue domestic policies that jeopardize internal stability and interfere with worldwide recovery. It must permit the banks to go on lending because developing countries must go on borrowing. **********My own approach is based on my belief that banks, debtors and the governments of the developed countries all share blame for the debt problem, and all must join in solving it. **********The governments of the United States and other developed countries should establish a new international institution - call it the International Debt Discount Corporation. They would subscribe to the capital of the debt corporation but would not have to put up cash if the I.D.D.C. did its job properly. The corporation would issue longterm bonds to banks in exchange for the debts of developing countries. It would do so at a discount, however, say 90 cents on the dollar. Finally, the corporation would reschedule the debts of developing countries on a one-time, long-term basis, using 5 cents of the 10 cents extracted from the banks for modest debt relief, charging lower interest rates or granting grace periods. **********The corporation should not buy up the debts of all developing countries. It should deal only with those countries that recognize it as successor claimant to the banks. It should probably limit its attention to those that have an I.M.F. ''seal of approval.'' The corporation should deal only in the debts of governments and debts guaranteed by governments. It should not take up debts that are already backed unilaterally by developed countries. **********Banks should not be allowed to choose the debts they discount with the corporation. A bank wanting to discount 60 percent of its claims on developing countries should be obliged to present 60 percent of its claims on all of the countries doing business with the I.D.D.C.  Otherwise, the corporation will inherit the claims that are least likely to be paid. **********Banks should not be allowed to decide when they will turn to the I.D.D.C. Otherwise, banks might be tempted to hold claims until they were worth less than 90 cents on the dollar. They would use the I.D.D.C. to minimize risks, not to resolve the debt problem. **********Should the I.D.D.C. attempt to treat countries differently according to their circumstances? In principle, yes. In practice, probably not. In fact, it might do best to publish standard terms on which it is willing to do business - to make an all-or-nothing offer to the developing countries. **********Should banks be permitted to lend again to developing countries?  Definitely. Developing countries have to go on borrowing. That is why it is important to prevent debt crises that can halt lending completely. But the I.D.D.C. must not be permitted to discount new debts acquired by the banks, and banks must be supervised more strictly than heretofore. **********Many other questions remain. Should I.D.D.C. bonds bear fixed or floating interest rates? What should be the share of each developed country in the capital of the new institution? But these questions are subordinate to another. Is there any other way out of the debt problem? I do not think so."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/16/world/general-gives-his-stars-wounded-marine-washington-nov-15-ap-marine-commandant.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 233, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GENERAL GIVES HIS STARS TO A WOUNDED MARINE WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 (AP) - The Marine Commandant presented his four stars today to the corporal who scrawled ''Semper Fi'' in a note to the general as the young marine lay seriously wounded from a bomb attack in Beirut.", "print_headline": "GENERAL GIVES HIS STARS TO A WOUNDED MARINE WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 (AP) - The Marine Commandant presented his four stars today to the corporal who scrawled ''Semper Fi'' in a note to the general as the young marine lay seriously wounded from a bomb attack in Beirut.", "body_text": " **********''Your gesture will remain in my heart forever,'' said Gen.

Adelman as the chief arms control official. **********But the committee did not block the nomination entirely. It sent Mr. Adelman's name to the Senate floor with a recommendation that he be rejected, setting the stage for a filibuster by opponents to the nomination and for a debate over the wider issue of arms control. **********President Reagan said in a statement that he was pleased the committee had sent the issue to the floor. He said he remained fully committed to the nomination and was confident Mr. Adelman would be confirmed. **********Tsongas Pledges Filibuster **********Meanwhile, Senator Paul E. Tsongas, Democrat of Massachusetts, pledged to filibuster the nomination of Mr. Adelman, who is now the deputy delegate to the United Nations. **********The committee first voted, 9 to 8, against the nomination and then decided, with three objections, to send it to the floor.  Two Republicans, Senator Charles McC. Mathias of Maryland and Senator Larry Pressler of South Dakota, joined seven Democrats in voting against the nomination. Mr. Pressler also voted not to send it to the Senate floor. **********Mr. Adelman has appeared before the committee on three occasions and each time has emphasized his support of arms control. However, his selection has taken on symbolic importance, with many senators viewing it as an indication that the Administration is not fully committed to arms talks. Effort to Muster Support **********The issue is likely to go to the Senate floor the middle of next month, after Republicans have time to muster support for Mr. Adelman, according to an aide to Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, the majority leader. The aide said Mr. Baker expected that the filibuster would be defeated and that Mr. Adelman would be confirmed. **********The scheduling of action in mid-March would also have the effect of postponing the arms control debate until after the West German elections March 6. **********Senator Tsongas said he expected opposition to Mr. Adelman to grow.  ''This thing has a certain momentum, and there is a certain dynamic to it,'' he said. ''We want to make people vote on whether they really are for arms control or not.'' Mr. Adelman, who was called back before the committee today, said that he would be a strong advocate for arms control within the Administration and that he believed ''deep reductions'' in arms could be negotiated with the Soviet Union this year. **********He appeared after Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, raised questions last week about remarks attributed to the nominee in a May 1981 article in a New York newspaper.  Mr. Adelman said under oath that he did not recall a telephone interview in which he was quoted as having called arms control negotiations a ''sham.'' **********''I do not recall making any such statement at any time in my life,'' he said. Adelman Refers to Writings **********Mr. Adelman said the remarks attributed to him ''do not reflect my views then or now.'' ''There is nothing in my writings, which have appeared in the most respected journals, to substantiate the remarks attributed to me,'' he added. **********His comments came after Ken Auletta, a columnist for The Daily News, in testimony before the committee, displayed copies of his notes, distributed telephone records and said Mr. Adelman had made the statement, which appeared in his column on May 24, 1981. **********''I believe he is not telling the truth on remembering speaking to me,'' Mr. Auletta said.  Mr. Adelman was quoted in the column as having said that the Administration favored arms talks for their public opinion value.  ''My policy would be to do it for political reasons,'' Mr. Adelman was quoted as having said. The quotation continued, ''I think it's a sham.'' Records Show 25-Minute Call **********Mr. Auletta's telephone records showed a 25-minute telephone call to SRI International, a policy study center in Arlington, Va., where Mr. Adelman worked on strategic issues. Copies of Mr. Auletta's notebook showed notes of the comments Mr. Auletta said Mr. Adelman had made, including the word ''sham.'' The notes indicate, and Mr.  Auletta confirmed, that he originally wrote the word ''shame'' and later changed it to ''sham.'' **********''This is a common practice among journalists when you make rapid notes,'' he said. ''I distinctly remember hearing Mr. Adelman use the word 'sham.' '' **********It is rare for Congressional panels to summon journalists to testify on their articles and unusual for journalists to accept such invitations. **********Mr. Adelman, confronted with Mr. Auletta's notes and telephone records, said his views on arms issues had been consistent. He said he had written 116 articles in 52 journals that presented ''my views on foreign policy very, very clearly.'' Lugar Discounts Importance **********Senator Richard G. Lugar, an Indiana Republican who has supported Mr. Adelman, discounted the importance of the Auletta article.  ''The idea that all Mr. Adelman has written is somehow overtaken by a remark he may or may not have made is extraordinary,'' he said.  The committee put off a vote on the nomination earlier this month when it became clear that it would not endorse him for confirmation.  Since then, the Administration has accelerated its activity in the arms control area, with the President seeking to indicate flexibility on the issue of limiting medium-range missiles in Europe. **********However, neither that activity nor Administration lobbying on Capitol Hill won further support for Mr. Adelman in the committee.  Besides Senators Pressler, Mathias, Tsongas and Cranston, Mr.  Adelman's nomination was opposed by Senators Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, John H. Glenn of Ohio, Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, all Democrats. **********Senator Edward Zorinsky of Nebraska was the only Democrat to support the nomination.  Senator Charles H. Percy, the Illinois Republican who heads the committee, said the nomination should be regarded as an important trump for the cause of arms control. **********''If he is confirmed, this puts the Administration in a position to move really forward,'' he said.

Orders for flat-rolled steel have rebounded sharply, discounting is moderating and a recent price increase seems to be sticking. In addition, imports have dropped significantly - down 44 percent in January from the level of a year before. And European steelmakers have agreed to cut their shipments to this country. **********In the latest good news, local leaders of the United Steelworkers of America have overwhelmingly approved these major concessions: a cut in wages of $1.25 an hour and a freeze on cost-of-living payments until July 1984 as well as reduced vacation time. **********The contract, which will run from next Aug. 1 until July 31, 1986, is likely to increase the cost of employment by only 11 percent, far less than the 41 percent increase over the course of the last contract. Those Idle Blast Furnaces **********But the steel industry is still running scared.  Pete Love, chairman of the National Steel Corporation, said in an interview yesterday that his company would soon restart one of its five banked blast furnaces because of the pickup in orders. But he added, '''We're being very cautious about it.'' **********Mr. Love said, ''Geez, you light one of these up and begin to call people back - it's important that we fully realize that we are in a sustained type of recovery.'' **********One reason for all the caution is the sharp and unexpected drop in steel shipments last year. After both analysts and industry executives had predicted 80 million to 90 million tons, the steel mills wound up shipping only 60 million tons. **********''The poor results of '82 tend to make you overly cautious,'' said Peter Anker, steel analyst for the First Boston Corporation.  Indeed, some steel companies are continuing to operate their plants at only 50 percent of capacity while orders pour in at a rate that would justify using 90 percent of capacity. **********''The order entry rate in the past month has been at a 90-millionton annual shipment rate,'' said Peter Marcus, steel analyst at Paine, Webber, Mitchell Hutchins. ''Yet the industry is still producing at a 57-million-ton shipment rate.'' Demand From Basic Sectors **********The surge in ordering has come from basic industries such as autos and appliances as they benefit from the beginning of a general economic recovery. But Mr. Marcus said the steelmakers ''all fear it's temporary.'' **********If the recovery continues, however, analysts and some steel executives agree that the steel companies, whose losses from steelmaking operations totaled $3.3 billion last year, could benefit greatly from the new labor agreement and the cost-cutting and phasing out of old plants accomplished during the downturn. **********Mr. Love said the new labor contract represented ''a milestone type of settlement'' that could allow his company to show a profit by the second quarter if the recovery runs strong. National Steel had an operating loss of $53 million from steel operations in the fourth quarter, and he said it would have a loss in the first quarter as well. **********He also said that, if the orders warrant, National and other steelmakers would be able to increase output with fewer workers than would have been required in the past because of productivity achievements. Personnel Patterns Noted **********''We've got the plants leaned out so they will support more volume without incurring more fixed costs,'' he said. **********Mr. Anker of First Boston said that in 1981 the steel industry had 361,000 workers - 258,000 steelworkers and 103,000 salaried employees. By the end of 1982, layoffs and permanent cuts had reduced the total to 235,000, of which 156,000 were steelworkers and 79,000 were salaried employees. **********''The companies will not put as many people back to work,'' he said, even if shipments go back to the levels of 1981. The industry shipped 87 million tons of steel that year. **********Joseph Wyman, steel analyst for Shearson/American Express, said in an interview that the contract concessions might enable many steel companies to return to profitability by this year's second quarter rather than the third quarter, as he had projected earlier. He estimated that the labor concessions could bring a 3 percent reduction in production costs. **********Analysts and steel executives remain conservative in their estimates of shipments for 1983, with most predicting a range of 71 million tons to 75 million tons. A Projection of Shipments **********Mr. Marcus of Paine, Webber, for example, predicts that the industry will ship 71 million tons and that imports will amount to about 14.5 million tons. This would compare with the 60 million tons shipped last year, when imports totaled 16.6 million tons. **********He predicted that the demand for flat roll would fall off later this year, since the underlying demand was not as high as current rates indicate. **********Meanwhile, the demand for steel products from the capital goods sector remains sluggish. At large integrated producers, such as the United States Steel Corporation, the capital goods sector accounts for three of every four tons of steel shipped. **********But Mr. Marcus projected that, even with only a modest recovery, operating losses for the steel industry would be cut significantly this year, to about $900 million. **********Despite the industry's hesitance, there is general agreement that it could recover much faster than was expected a few months ago, when the threat of a steel strike stirred fears that major domestic customers might turn to foreign producers.

Byrd, the Senate minority leader, as ''a false way for the Administration to attempt to avoid its responsibility of the law.'' **********Mr. Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat, is leading a largely Democratic effort to force Mr. Reagan to acknowledge that the Marines are in Lebanon subject to Congressional approval under the War Powers Resolution of 1973. **********At the center of the struggle between the White House and the Congress are interpretations of the war powers statute, which stipulates that the President must notify Congress when American troops face a combat situation, and must then withdraw the troops within 60 days unless Congress authorizes them to remain. The 60-day period can be extended by 30 days. **********The exchange between the White House and Mr. Byrd introduced a new note of contentiousness into the delicate negotiations to achieve some form of legislative authorization for the troops that met the institutional demands of Congress and the White House.   Attempt to Play Down Incident **********This evening, a senior Administration official sought to play down the confrontational tone that arose today. He said that the White House was not trying to accuse the Congress and that there would be no new attacks in the future of the sort that occurred today. **********He characterized the White House's attitude this way: **********''No one wants to concede the principle that the Congress should determine exactly how those troops should be deployed and for how long. It's also important, particularly in sending a signal to the Syrians, that we not have a plan that promises that the troops are going to be out of Lebanon on a given day.'' **********Mr. Byrd and other Democrats, as well as some Republicans, say they feel the requirement for Congressional approval came into effect last month when the first of four marines was killed in shelling by Syrian-backed Druse militiamen outside Beirut.   The White House View **********The White House argues that despite the onset of more violence, there is no requirement under the War Powers Resolution that Mr. Reagan seek Congressional approval to keep about 1,300 marines committed to the multinational force in Lebanon. **********Because both sides agree with the principle that the marines should be there, a battle has emerged over institutional prerogatives and constitutional questions. **********Today the White House seemed to be trying to sweep aside the complicated questions of prerogatives and assert that, in general, requirements for Congressional authorization for the troops damage American interests in the Middle East. **********Meanwhile, negotiations continued today between the White House and Senate leaders on compromise language in a possible Congressional resolution backing the use of the troops.   A Signal From Reagan **********Mr. Reagan seemed to signal today what White House aides had said before, that the Administration would be able to accept some form of resolution as long as it did not embody the idea that the troops were in Lebanon under Congressional authorization. **********Asked by a reporter in the Oval Office whether he could ''live with'' some sort of war powers resolution, Mr. Reagan said, ''I am sure I can.'' Asked to be more specific, he said, ''I can't get into that while it's being discussed.'' **********He was apparently alluding to the talks on Capitol Hill today involving James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff, as well as Senator Byrd and Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., the Tennessee Republican who is the Senate majority leader.  Mr. Reagan's comments came at a picture-taking session in the Oval Office before a meeting with supporters of tuition tax credits.   No Progress Reported **********The meeting with Senator Baker, Senator Byrd and Mr. Baker of the White House broke up this evening with no apparent progress in achieving a compromise. **********Aides indicated that Senator Byrd was still insisting that the President ackowledge that the troops' presence in Lebanon is subject to Congressional approval. **********An aide to Senator Baker said the Senator was ''tired of shoveling smoke'' and getting bogged down in a battle of prerogatives, and would try to break the impasse by introducing his own version of a compromise on Monday. **********There were few details tonight of that compromise, which the Baker aide said would be drafted over the weekend. The aide said Senator Baker wanted to ''precipitate Senate action'' by coming up with a resolution simply authorizing the President to continue to keep the troops in Lebanon for a period of time.

And although inflation has fallen to an annual rate of about 5.5 percent from twice that level a year ago, average family income has fallen for the past two years and unemployment is persisting at nearly 12 percent, the worst rate since the Depression.  No one is prepared to write off the possibility that Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau might stage a comeback, as he has several times in the past, or that perhaps another Liberal might do the same thing. **********But Conservatives as well as many Liberals, including the Prime Minister, are watching with attention as Mr. Mulroney begins to learn the ropes as the Tories' parliamentary leader. After a career as a lawyer and businessman, he was elected to Parliament for the first time last month, after being chosen as party leader in June.   Phone Call From Reagan **********Mr. Mulroney has publicly agreed that he is deliberately vague on some issues - particularly those which might later be the subject of negotiations - to avoid jeopardizing his subsequent position. **********But he has generally endorsed conservative positions. He received a phone call from President Reagan congratulating him on his election as the party leader. **********He has displayed cleverness in turning his wit against Mr. Trudeau and has been able to deflect criticism. **********Little of the bantering between the two bilingual leaders has been in French. But the area of rights for French-speaking Canadians has been perhaps the most ticklish issue Mr. Mulroney has had to confront so far.   Dispute on Language Services **********The topic grew out of a dispute in Manitoba about the extension of French-language services. During debate, Mr. Trudeau asked Mr. Mulroney to help draft a resolution supporting the Manitoba provincial government's plans to promote French. Mr. Mulroney agreed to meet with the Prime Minister to discuss the matter. **********For both parties, the stakes are the votes of French-speaking Canadians. The Liberals won 74 of Quebec's 75 seats in the 1980 election, while Mr. Mulroney's appeal to Conservatives was partly that as a Quebec native he could deliver more seats. **********But for Mr. Mulroney, the Manitoba issue is complicated by the fact that the provincial Progressive Conservative Party opposes the changes, and Tory policy is generally to give as much leeway as possible to the provinces, most of which are governed by Conservatives. **********Consequently, Liberals derided Mr. Mulroney when he agreed to the meeting, seeing the situation as one in which the Tories could not win. After two meetings between the two men, Mr. Mulroney has still not announced the position of his party's caucus.   Parliamentary Gaffes **********Mr. Mulroney has made other parliamentary gaffes, most of which do not appear to have been taken very seriously, including the Tory leader's misquoting of an International Monetary Fund report. **********On another occasion he asked the Transport Minister a question in Parliament about freight subsidies for the Maritime Provinces, only to be told the subsidy had already been granted earlier that day. **********This brought Liberal cries of ''Bring back Joe!'' referring to Mr. Mulroney's predecessor as Tory leader, Joe Clark. Mr. Mulroney appeared to take it well. **********Critics say they pardon Mr. Mulroney's reluctance to lay out details on his views, partly because the job of his party is to oppose the Government's initiatives, not to develop its own. **********But they do suggest that he might be clearer on such issues as the nature of economic relations with the United States and the proper balance between fiscal conservatism and the high level of social services Canadians have come to expect."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/14/business/nestle-puts-curbs-on-marketing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 340, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NESTLE PUTS CURBS ON MARKETING", "print_headline": "NESTLE PUTS CURBS ON MARKETING", "body_text": " **********Nestle S.A. of Switzerland, the world's principal seller of infant formula, said today that it had made several changes in its marketing practices to make them conform to an international marketing code. **********Carl L.

Two Chinese dynasties declared suzerainty over the island before the modern era, and for the last two centuries, the Japanese and the Russians have contested each other's claims. **********In 1905, as a result of defeat in a war against the Japanese, Russia ceded the southern half of Sakhalin to Japan, which named the area Karafuto. The Soviet Union regained southern Sakhalin as well as the nearby Kuril island chain in 1945, at the end of World War II, when Soviet troops swept southward and in nine days defeated 20,000 Japanese defenders. **********Since then Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands - some of them still claimed by Japan - have formed an oblast, or province, within the Soviet Union's Russian republic. Dotted with airfields and missile installations, it is a strategic Soviet position facing the Pacific. **********Sakhalin is a cold, inhospitable land - in the winter battered by icy storms and in the summer graced at best by cool damp weather. At the end of the last century, Anton Chekhov assayed the island: **********''I have seen Ceylon, which is paradise, and Sakhalin, which is hell.''  Producer of Coal, Oil and Timber **********The island produces oil, coal, timber, wood pulp and paper. In recent years, Japan has been working with the Russians in exploring additional oil and gas resources off shore. **********Sakhalin Island was first conquered in the 13th century when the Mongols' Y\"uan dynasty in China subdued the indigenous Gilyak and Ainu people. The succeeding Ming dynasty, preferring trade over arms, developed sputtering commercial ties with the island. **********In 1635, a Japanese survey expedition sent by the lord of Matsumae on Hokkaido landed on Sakhalin. Nine years later, Vasily Poyarkov and a band of Cossacks wintered at the mouth of the Amur River, opposite Sakhalin. The Japanese then established scattered settlements in the south, and the Russians in the north. **********In 1875, when all of Sakhalin was overrun by Czarist forces, Japan ceded all claims to the island in exchange for rights to the entire Kuril chain. **********In the years between 1875 and the outbreak of the Russian-Japanese War in 1904, the Russians used the island as a penal colony. In his ''Sakhalin Diaries,'' Chekhov chronicled the meanness and brutality of life on the island. **********After the division of Sakhalin in 1905, the Russians ultimately opened up oil deposits in the sparsely settled north while the economy in the more developed Japanese south, with a larger population, was based on coal and timber. **********After Sakhalin was reunified under Soviet rule in 1945, most of the Japanese settlers were repatriated and were replaced by Russian migrants. Sakhalin now has a population of more than 600,000, 80 percent of them Russians. The last Soviet census, in 1979, also reported the presence of 35,000 Koreans in southern Sakhalin, where many of them had moved while the area was under Japanese rule. **********Except for occasional visits by Japanese groups over the years, the island has been virtually closed to foreigners. In 1979, the Russians allowed a closely supervised visit by delegates attending a Pacific Science Congress at Khabarovsk, on the Siberian mainland. **********A Japanese member of the group, Hiroshi Kimura, a political scientist of the University of Hokkaido in Sapporo, found that the island capital, Yuzhno- Sakhalinsk, known as Toyohara under Japanese rule, had greatly expanded during the Soviet period and displayed little evidence of the Japanese times. **********In an account of the visit, published in the February 1980 issue of the American journal Soviet Geography, Professor Kimura noted that Yuzhno- Sakhalinsk, like many Soviet provincial cities, now had a main square named for Lenin, with a Lenin statue dating from 1970. **********On a visit to the regional museum, the Japanese traveler found that it was still housed in the original building, modeled after a Japanese castle with tile roof and stone dog guardians at the gate. The Soviet State Bank, too, is still housed in the old building of the Karaf uto branch of the Hokkaido Colonial Bank, Professor Kimura said. **********He reported a few chance encounters with resident Koreans and Japanese who had remained under Soviet rule and who welcomed the opportunity to speak Japanese and asked for books and records in Japanese and Koreans to be sent to them."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/24/business/no-headline-250058.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 42, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Headline", "print_headline": "No Headline", "body_text": " **********Listed below are the planned release dates for major economic indicators to be reported this week.

Bergerac, chairman of Revlon Inc., was eager to talk about the cosmetics and health care giant he was building. **********Then Revlon's glamour faded. The company's market share in cosmetics began to slide as more aggressive companies moved ahead in such growing areas as skin care treatment. A rapid diversification accompanied by the acquisition of several companies that make health care products, analysts said, distracted Revlon from its cosmetics operation. Add to that the recession. **********Suddenly Revlon, like the rest of the industry, discovered that regardless of the advertising budget, the days of rapid growth in cosmetics were over. And Mr. Bergerac's romance with Wall Street ended. **********A Long and Rich Contract **********Until then, Mr. Bergerac could do no wrong. From 1975 to 1980, the company's earnings quadrupled. Wall Street analysts praised his Gallic charm and strategic plan to diversify Revlon, which is still the nation's leading cosmetics company, into health care. **********They noticed, but said little about, the 51-year-old executive's long-term contract, signed in 1974, that would make him one of America's best-paid executives until his 60th birthday. **********He was equal, they said, to the task of replacing the flamboyant company founder, Charles Revson, who lured him away from the ITT Corporation's European business in 1974. Mr. Revson wanted a man to build Revlon's health care business as a balance to its cosmetics business. **********Mr. Bergerac did. But in the view of some analysts, he failed to go far enough in reorganizing the company's cumbersome management, revising distribution or creating new products to captivate the cosmetics shopper. ''I think there is a lot more to do,'' said Jack Salzman, an analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. **********And even now, in his first interview with a daily newspaper in more than a year, Mr. Bergerac makes no solid prediction about when Revlon might recover from its three-year slump. ''Being optimistic, I would tell you it will happen in 1984,'' he said. **********Sitting in his large corner office overlooking Fifth Avenue and Central Park at 59th Street, Mr. Bergerac now says that the heady excitement of nearly a decade ago has come back to haunt him. ''The pendulum has swung too far both ways,'' he said. ''We got overpraised and we got overblamed.'' **********Earnings Drop **********By the principal measure that matters to investors - earnings - Revlon has slipped with the rest of the cosmetics industry. Even Mr. Bergerac's rapid diversification into health care could not prevent a slide in profits from a record $192 million on sales of $2.2 billion in 1980, to $111 million on sales of $2.4 billion in 1982. **********And in this year's first nine months, Revlon's earnings were down 17 percent from the period a year earlier. Its earnings per share were up 33 percent in the third quarter, but that was because the company repurchased its series A stock in July. The repurchase of the stock, which had been issued in 1980 for an acquisition, cost the company $287 million. . , **********The repurchase will also help the fourth quarter by about 8 cents a share, the company said. Revlon's common stock closed yesterday at $33.375, down 12 1/2 cents. **********Focus on Health Care **********If it had not been for health care, which accounts for about 55 percent of Revlon's sales, the company might be faring worse. **********Since Mr. Bergerac joined Revlon in 1974, he has diversified the company to prepare it for the inevitable slowing of growth in the cosmetics field. He has chosen companies in a variety of growing health care markets, including diagnostic, proprietary and ethical drugs and vision care. The common thread among them, he said, is that they are in ''less regulated'' areas of health care. **********Revlon has done relatively well in this field. Most of the acquired companies have developed successful new products, such as the Oxy line of anti-acne preparations. Mr. Bergerac is proud of the company's rapid rise to 55 percent of the market in extended wear contact lenses. **********But he is embarrassed by Revlon's salt substitute, which was introduced last year. ''No Salt started like a house on fire,'' said Mr. Bergerac, who takes responsibility for developing the product. ''But people didn't like it.'' No decision has yet been made about the product, and it is still on supermarket shelves. **********A Gain in Market Share **********Although health care represents Revlon's future, the company is still the country's largest cosmetics retailer. Its market share dropped to close to 17 percent in 1982, but now stands at nearly 20 percent. **********Revlon, long used to being the biggest and the best, was not prepared for the change in the cosmetics industry. The company's chief mistake, analysts say, was its failure to change its policy and sell to the mass market at popular prices. In cosmetics, the prestige and discount markets are the areas of growth and Revlon was in the middle. **********''The marketplace changed and they didn't understand it,'' said Allan Mottus, publisher of the Informationist, an industry newsletter. According to Mr. Mottus, Revlon has failed to identify the new Revlon woman. It has been 10 years, he said, since Mr. Revson, who personally believed that women should not wear pants, created the industry's most successful life-style fragrance, Charlie, and ignored his own feelings for the sake of exploiting a new market. **********'Gut Instinct' **********''Revson had an unbelievable gut instinct,'' Mr. Mottus said. ''With Charlie, Mr. Revson put a man's name on a woman's fragrance and made a wide-striding, confident young female in white slacks, jacket and hat its image. ''Since then Revlon hasn't done enough to turn the consumer on.'' **********Mr. Bergerac is aware of the criticism. That is why Revlon will spend the bulk of its more than $250 million in advertising and promotion this year on its major cosmetics lines. **********Mr. Bergerac is quick to dispel the notion that he is not intimately involved in cosmetics. He is not running a holding company, he said. In fact in 1979 he said he had found a new fragrance in Kenya. That fragrance, from the African lantana bush, is now the basic scent in the company's new Ebene men's cologne, which was introduced in France a few months ago. **********And next month, the company will introduce its Hair's Daily Requirement products, which include four shampoos and four conditioners. The new products will have a $25 million advertising and promotion budget. **********But again, the company will not be first with a new product line. Revlon will face stiff competition from Finesse, made by Helene Curtis, Jhirmack, which is part of Esmark, and Silkience, made by Gillette, among others. **********Next year, Revlon will also move more aggressively into skin treatments, one of the fastest-growing sectors in cosmetics. ''In treatment, we have never had the strongest position,'' Mr. Bergerac said. **********''But what we were gaining in color and treatment we lost in fragrance,'' he added. According to Joe Koloff, an industry analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, Revlon's mass-market fragrances had a 15 percent sales decline in the third quarter. **********Mr. Bergerac is optimistic about Revlon's fragrance plans, however. ''In fragrance I think the hard times are behind us,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/08/world/a-reporter-s-notebook-the-latin-poor-vs-poor.html": {"writer_name": "Drew Middleton", "pub_date": "1983-03-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 852, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: THE LATIN POOR VS.

The long porch was cool, even in the midday heat. The family, originally from Canada, talked casually in Spanish, French and English about land redistribution, the personality of the Archbishop and political trivia. **********Lunch featured none of the specialties of the country. Served on Spode china, the food would not have been out of place in an English vicarage: roast beef, mashed potatoes and carrots and peas. Dessert was a coffee-flavored cream with whipped cream. **********Later the party moved to another of the three houses on the estate for coffee. The conversation meandered on. The scene was not unlike that at the start of ''War and Peace'' when a group of trilingual Russians discuss the French and Napoleon and the prospect of war.  They are people who better appreciate the amenities of life than its sacrifices. **********The war was closer here. The party could hear the hollow thud of mortar fire perhaps eight miles away. No one seemed disturbed. People such as these do not like the war, but they are learning to live with it. **********The dowager saw no need for panic. After all, she said, as a girl in Paris in 1914 she waited for the arrival of the German armies - ''and they never came.'' She could recall walking down the Champs-Elysees to the Place de la Concorde the day the Battle of the Marne began without seeing a single automobile. Now, with another war just over there in those hills, her serenity was unshakable. **********The war also seems very far away in the city. People seldom speak of it in restaurants and bars. They seem to concentrate more on the politics of the war than the war itself. Perhaps this is because few have a direct personal stake in the fighting. **********''The people you see here,'' a young Salvadoran said, looking around a well-filled restaurant, ''don't contribute their sons to the army. Oh, no. Their sons are out of the country at colleges in the States.'' **********The insurgents have proclaimed that they are the poor fighting the rich. But the soldiers of the Salvadoran Army are drawn mainly from the poverty-stricken villages. It is, one American said, a war of the poor against the poor. **********About 50 percent of the enlisted men are illiterate, an officer said. Inured to hardship in early life, they will march ''forever'' if ordered. The insurgents turn back captured enlisted men. In most cases the army sends them back to their units - twice. If they are captured a third time, an American said, they are shot. **********The guerrillas' psychological warfare often backfires. Not long ago the insurgents took a village in the north after a brief fight. They proclaimed to the shaken villagers that they were fighting for them, for all Salvadorans and for the good of the country. ''You have burned our trucks and our carts, on which we depend for a living,'' a villager said. ''Is that for our good and the good of the country?'' **********The hatred lies just below the surface here. People from the extreme and moderate right talk about the guerrillas in voices dripping with hate. Any story about guerrilla terrorism, no matter how flimsy the evidence, is believed. Nor do people try to excuse the killings carried out by the army and the national guard. The foreigner is told that he just doesn't understand the depth of feeling, as though that were an excuse. **********Oddly, the brutality is often unplanned. It is hard to think of the army planning to shell a city, but it is easy to envisage a patrol annoyed by one shot impulsively turning its rifles on anyone nearby. **********At night the Americanization of San Salvador is all too evident.  The streets are bright with signs advertising soft drinks and other American contributions to civilization. A McDonald's is doing fairly well. The Government has forbidden the importation of wine, but that is about the only drink lacking. Bars are stocked with liquor from all over the world. **********And there is even wine around. One party of three Salvadoran businessmen drank four bottles of champagne during a festive lunch. **********An American businessman long stationed here was asked if the land program and other measures introduced by the Government would change the nature of the people. **********''Nothing really changes down here,'' he said. ''The reforms will do some good for the peasants. If the Government wins the war, come back in five years. You'll see that the people who have the money now will have it then. The peasants will be a little better off - but not much. And the army? The junior officers will be holding back the men's pay just as they do now, and each senior officer will be seeing himself as the next President.

Palmieri, Baldwin's president and chief executive officer, said in an interview yesterday. On Thursday, the company asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to suspend trading for 10 days in its securities in primary and secondary markets to calm speculation about the debt negotiations. **********Under the terms of the agreement with the creditors, some of the company's debt payments will be deferred until Sept. 30. That new deadline extends and expands a 90-day moratorium on debt payments that was due to expire in mid-July. That moratorium had covered $630 million in overdue debt. **********The new accord covers certain collateral arrangements for Baldwin debenture holders, who were not party to the debt moratorium reached last April. **********Mr. Palmieri said the debenture holders would receive $9 million in interest payments during the period, contingent on the sale of assets that are part of the company's restructuring program. **********Another group of creditors, those holding $440 million in debt owed by Balunit, a Baldwin subsidiary, and the MGIC Investment Corporation, Balunit's principal holding, will receive interest and principal payments during the period. **********Aside from the Balunit-MGIC group of creditors and the banks holding $233.5 million in Baldwin-United and D.H. Baldwin debt, the other parties in the agreement are the debenture holders, who have $106.2 million worth of Baldwin debentures; a group of banks led by Bankers Trust, which made a $116.8 million revolving credit available to MGIC on Thursday; the Prudential Insurance Company, which has a $40 million loan outstanding to Baldwin-United, and Merrill Lynch, which holds $74 million in obligations from the company. **********The agreement provides for an extension of the collateral package offered to banks holding debt of Baldwin-United and D.H. Baldwin, another subsidiary, until Sept. 30. The company has 15 days after that to work out another accord, a period designed to placate anxious debenture holders, who are unsecured lenders. Asset Sale Planned **********The agreement sets in motion a process that Mr. Palmieri has said would include the sale of assets, projected to raise $500 million in cash. An announcement of the sale of the company's mortgage and leasing affiliates may be made in the next few days, Mr. Palmieri said. A series of announcements on corporate write-offs would also be forthcoming, he added, without elaborating. **********''The combination of good will and deferred acquisition costs will be very large,'' Mr. Palmieri said.  The basics of the agreement were worked out in a marathon meeting that began last Sunday and stretched into Monday morning. ''The next three days were spent negotiating the fine points and bringing in the holdouts,'' Mr. Palmieri said. **********But it was a near thing. According to banking sources, the last of the recalcitrant creditors did not sign until 11:30 Thursday night, only half an hour before the negotiating authority of some of the creditors was scheduled to expire. **********In an interview, Mr. Palmieri said the company would have moved for voluntary bankruptcy before any creditor could have forced it into involuntary reorganization. ''We had until the next morning when the judge woke up,'' Mr. Palmieri said. **********In at least one case, some outside assistance may have been a key factor in reaching the agreement.L?ate Thursday afternoon, the president of BancOhio, a Columbus-based bank that is a creditor of D.H. Baldwin, received a phone call from Ohio's Governor Richard Celeste. A 'Courtesy Introduction' **********''The Governor spoke with BancOhio as a courtesy to Mr. Palmieri,'' said Paul Costello, a spokesman for the Governor. He said the conversation was not ''substantive,'' but merely a ''courtesy introduction.'' In the Carter Administration, Mr. Celeste served as director of the Peace Corps while Mr. Palmieri headed the State Department's refugee program. **********Baldwin-United, based in Cincinnati, has 10,000 employees nationwide, 2,500 to 3,000 in Ohio, whose jobs could have been jeopardized by a Baldwin bankruptcy.

Marcos announced today that a new commission would investigate the killing of the opposition leader Benigno S. Aquino Jr. **********The panel will replace the five-member presidential commission that resigned on Monday, citing widespread doubts that its inquiry would be impartial. **********The presidential palace announced that two of the new panel's members would be appointed by Parliament and that three to five others would be named from among people recommended by ''various sectors of society, such as legal associations, civic and service organizations and the business, education, student and labor sectors.'' **********The President's action was immediately criticized by the opposition leader Jose Diokno, who said that as long as Mr. Marcos was President there could be no impartial inquiry. Parliament, which would appoint two members of the panel under the decree, is overwhelmingly controlled by the President's supporters. **********Foreign Minister Present **********Mr. Marcos signed the decree on television, in the presence of Government members including Arturo Tolentino, the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs. Mr. Tolentino said on Monday that he could not accept a presidential appointment as chairman of the original commission because the panel lacked independence and apparently had prejudged the case it was investigating. **********Mr. Tolentino said in an interview today that the commission envisaged in today's presidential announcement was ''a sort of compromise'' between the body he had recommended, composed only of nominees of the private sector, and one over which the Marcos Government would have more control.  In his television appearance today, President Marcos also formally abolished the original commission. In a letter to the four former justices on it, he said that their resignation Monday had been compelled by the ''present morbid atmosphere.'' **********Ever since they resigned, their staff members have criticized the Government for the reports it had presented to the commission on the death of Mr. Aquino, who was shot on Aug. 21 soon after arriving at the airport from three years of voluntary exile in the United States. **********One such document, which was submitted to the commission on Sept. 20, was described by a staff lawyer as substantially ''inconsistent with the technical reports'' that other Government investigators had compiled a few days after Mr. Aquino's death. **********''I don't believe that report,'' the lawyer, Amadeo Seno, said of the 11-page document bearing the signature of Maj. Gen. Prospero A. Olivas, who had been named by Mr. Marcos to conduct the Government's investigation. **********The report said a civilian named Rolando Galman had been proved ''scientifically'' and ''indubitably'' to have killed Mr. Aquino. Mr. Galman, officially identified as a hired assassin with leftist connections, was shot dead at the airport by security guards. **********According to Mr. Seno and other commission sources including its general counsel, Rustico V. Nazareno, the original commission's staff had been hampered by what was described as limited distribution of police and military findings. The sources complained also about the lack of funds with which the panel might have been able to engage independent investigators. **********The report said that Mr. Aquino, seconds before his death, had been followed down an airport stairway by four soldiers, including an intelligence operative who was evidently wearing civilian clothes. **********Mr. Aquino was shot in the back of the head from a distance of between 6 and 18 inches, according to the report, immediately after he reached the bottom of the stairs. **********Opposition leaders have contended that Mr. Aquino must have been shot by someone on the stairs. But military investigators have said he was shot by an assailant - Mr. Galman - who had dashed out from behind the stairs Mr. Aquino was descending. **********Dr. Bienventio Munoz, a police doctor, who had performed an autopsy on the body of Mr. Aquino, testified before the original commission on Sept. 7 that Mr. Aquino must have been looking upward at the time. That, the doctor said, would explain how the bullet had emerged through Mr. Aquino's chin. **********The Olivas report leaves many questions unanswered. For example, of the four military guards who are said to have followed Mr. Aquino down the stairs, only two are mentioned as having witnessed the killing. **********One, Constable First Class Rogelio Moreno of the paramilitary Philippine Constabulary, is never mentioned again in the report. The other was identified as Sgt. Filomeno Miranda, ''an intelligence operative.'' He ''ran for cover,'' the report says, when the shooting started. **********Constitutional Amendments **********MANILA, Oct. 14 (AP) - President Marcos also announced plans today for new constitutional amendments providing for parliamentary elections by district rather than by region. **********These were apparently a concession to critics who said current laws gave an edge to the Government party, the New Society Party, over the poorer opposition groups, since it costs more to campaign in the larger areas."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/25/business/james-river-says-debt-is-revamped.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 134, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "James River Says Debt Is Revamped", "print_headline": "James River Says Debt Is Revamped", "body_text": " **********The James River Corporation announced that it had completed the restructuring of its $525 million of debt and credit lines. **********The company said the restructuring included the exchange of $39 million of preferred stock in a subsidiary for James River preferred stock, the conversion of $11.1 million of James River preferred stock, and the redemption of $5 million of convertible preferred stock. **********James River said it had also completed a private placement of $55 million of new long-term debt having a fixed interest rate of 12.25 percent, a term of 15 years and a five year moratorium on principal repayment; that debt replaces bank revolving credit.

But now, with interest rates apparently stabilizing, the consensus on Wall Street is that the continued rise of most stock groups henceforth must depend upon higher profits, rather than the willingness of investors to push up multiples. **********Banks, however, offer a notable exception to this situation, in the opinion of Thomas H. Hanley, who heads bank stock research at Salomon Brothers. ''We believe multiple enrichment is inevitable for bank stocks,'' he stated. **********While he envisages gradually improving profits for banks in 1983 and 1984, Mr. Hanley based his optimistic case mainly upon earnings multiples. The 22-bank stock index of Salomon Brothers, as of July 1, carried an average yield of 5.4 percent and a multiple of 6.7 times earnings for the trailing 12-month period. This compared with a yield of 3.72 percent and an earnings multiple of 14.6 for Standard & Poor's 400-stock industrial index. **********''It means that the relative multiple of bank stocks to the index was 45.9 percent, or the lowest level of the entire postwar period,'' Mr. Hanley noted. ''We remain convinced that the industry's relative valuation will improve and approach 80 percent during the next 12 to 18 months.'' **********Among New York City banks, Salomon's current picks include Citicorp, J.P. Morgan and Bankers Trust, all of which are expected by the firm to outperform the general equity market. **********''Within this group, we now recommend banks which either have a clearly defined proprietary presence, or those which we regard as turnaround situations,'' the analyst said. ''In terms of a proprietary presence, Citicorp's bet on the consumer is paying off, Morgan is traveling the merchant bank route and Bankers Trust is out of the retail business and its strategy is to stress wholesale banking. In the turnaround camp, we advise accumulation of both Irving Bank Corporation and Marine Midland.'' **********Conversely, Salomon has lowered its investment opinion on Chase Manhattan, which now is expected merely to match the performance of the general market over the 12-to-18 month time horizon. The firm has reduced its 1983 earnings estimate for Chase to $11 a share from $12. **********''We're also leaning heavily towards regional bank stocks,'' Mr.  Hanley said. ''Our enthusiasm for bank securities is predicated partly on the 1983-1984 outlook for two economic variables -domestic inflation and short-term interest rates - which appear more favorable than at any recent time. Secondly, we foresee continued improvement in the emotional environment as credit quality worries, particularly concerning overseas borrowers, recede. **********''In addition, the banking industry's profit dynamics should gain momentum as 1984 unfolds. Finally, bank stock multiples typically advance during the second year of an economic recovery.'' **********E.F. Hutton & Company remains positive on the outlook for bank stocks, with a preference for the big money-center banks, such as those in New York City, according to Harold M. Levine. ''We think that, over the longer term, money-center banks will be more favorably affected by lower inflation rates,'' the analyst said. **********What about the huge amount of problem loans to foreign countries?  ''I believe these problems already are reflected in the price of bank stocks,'' Mr. Levine replied. ''I foresee no disaster on this front.'' **********Hutton is keeping four money-center banks on its recommended list - Bankers Trust, Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and First Chicago - although Mr. Levine acknowledged that these issues probably will underperform the general market ''over the next month or two.'' **********Two New York City banks - Citicorp and J.P. Morgan - are picked by the Value Line Investment Survey as among its most-favored issues to outperform the market over the next 12 months. Of problem loans abroad, the advisory service said, ''We think the borrower countries, and their loans, will muddle through.'' **********Stephen Berman of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin dissented sharply. ''I took money-center banks off my recommended list last October following a big run in their stock prices,'' he said. ''We encourage performance-minded investors to reduce holdings in large bank stocks. But if the Dow goes to 1,500, I'd be the last to say that these stocks won't go up.'' **********Meanwhile, he recommends two regional banks, Manufacturers National Corporation in Detroit and First Jersey National Corporation in Jersey City. **********Since the start of the bull market last August, one index of major New York City bank stocks, advancing 63 percent, has performed slightly better than the Dow Jones industrial average."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/28/world/salvadorans-protest.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 30, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Salvadorans Protest", "print_headline": "Salvadorans Protest", "body_text": " **********The Salvadoran Chamber of Commerce today condemned a United States plan to send a special envoy to help arrange elections, calling it ''offensive and humiliating.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/13/world/costa-rica-tells-anti-sandinistas-border-attacks-will-bring-ouster.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Meislin", "pub_date": "1983-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 524, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COSTA RICA TELLS ANTI-SANDINISTAS BORDER ATTACKS WILL BRING OUSTER", "print_headline": "COSTA RICA TELLS ANTI-SANDINISTAS BORDER ATTACKS WILL BRING OUSTER", "body_text": " **********Members of a key rebel group fighting the Nicaraguan Government ''are very close to being expelled'' from Costa Rica because of their military activities in the country, according to an official close to Costa Rica's Security Council. **********The official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation, said Tuesday night that a Cabinet minister had given a ''stern warning'' to Alfonso Robelo Callejas, a leader of the Democratic Revolutionary Alliance. Mr. Robelo was told, the official said, that every member of the rebel group would be ejected if the Government found any evidence of ''armed military action against Nicaragua'' from Costa Rica. **********The warning, officials here say, is the result not only of growing tension between Costa Rica and Nicaragua, but also between some top Costa Rican officials and Mr. Robelo. ''We have told ARDE,'' the official said, using the group's acronym in Spanish, ''that they can use Costa Rica as a political space, but they are trying to use it as a military space. If it's a choice between ARDE and Costa Rica's neutrality, Costa Rica's neutrality will prevail.'' **********Costa Rican sensitivity to the rebels' activities was heightened by an incident Sept. 28 in which a rebel attack on a Nicaraguan border station at Penas Blancas was answered hours later by a Nicaraguan attack on a Costa Rican rural guard station.

One Government report, which has not been made public, listed the arrests of 64 of the group's officials in September, including Orion Pastora, brother of Eden Pastora Gomez, the exiled Nicaraguan military commander, who is now said to be leading rebel troops in southern Nicaragua. Some of those arrested, the report said, were jailed and some were released. **********These arrests have led to a sharp increase in tensions between the Government and the rebels.

Andropov said today that the United States and the Soviet Union were approaching a crucial time when failure to negotiate a ban on weapons in outer space would make an extension of the arms race inevitable. **********The Soviet leader made the comment in a reply to a group of American scientists who have been campaigning for a ban on space weapons. The Americans had sent a cablegram to Mr. Andropov last month as part of an appeal addressed to the leaders of all countries with space programs. **********Mr. Andropov, in his reply, made public by the press agency Tass, spoke of ''the extremely dangerous consequences of saturating space with deadly weapons.'' He noted that the Soviet Union had submitted a draft treaty on the subject to the United Nations in 1981, and charged that progress had been blocked by the United States and its allies. **********''Moreover,'' he said, ''recent developments have demonstrated that the use of space-based military technology is being assigned an ever greater role in United States strategic plans, including those announced by the top United States leadership. **********''Now a crucial moment is really coming: Either the interested states will sit down at the negotiating table without delay to begin drawing up a treaty prohibiting the placement in space of weapons of any kind, or the arms race will spill over into space.'' **********Mr. Andropov did not elaborate on his allusion to high-level American pronouncements, but President Reagan last month called for an American research and development effort aimed at producing hightechnology space systems capable of destroying offensive missiles before they reached the United States. **********The President said such an effective defense against missiles would render them useless and thus help put an end to the threat of nuclear war. **********Mr. Reagan's announcement focused attention on the potential of laser technology and particle beams, which some scientists believe could be developed into an effective antimissile defense. United States officials contend that the Soviet Union already has a program under way on such defensive weapons. **********The appeal of the American scientists concerned over the use of space for military purposes was drafted and circulated for signatures before Mr. Reagan's speech about the need for effective antimissile systems. **********The signers included Hans A. Bethe and Isidor I. Rabi, Nobel Prize winners in physics; Carl Sagan, astronomer; Christopher C. Kraft, former director of the Johnson Space Center in Houston; Lee A.  Dubridge, honorary president of the California Institute of Technology; Richard L. Garwin of I.B.M.; Wolfgang Panofsky, George W. Rathjens, Herbert F. York, former weapon development or arms control officials, and two retired naval officers, Adm. Noel Gayler and Vice Adm. John Lee. **********In his reply to the scientists, Mr. Andropov called the effort to prevent the militarization of space ''one of the priority tasks facing mankind.'' He depicted the Soviet Union as favoring accords to that end, saying that it had initiated all the agreements now in force seeking to insure that space be used only for peaceful purposes. **********''As scientists and specialists, you are well aware of the extremely dangerous consequences of saturating space with deadly weapons,'' the Soviet leader wrote. ''Statesmen, politicians and scientists really ought to start doing everything possible even now to prevent the use of the achievements of the human intellect, the accelerating progress of science and technology, to the detriment of the people.'' **********The Soviet leader said the draft treaty submitted to the United Nations would have ended the threat by banning weapons of any kind from space. He said the draft had been supported by ''an overwhelming majority'' of member states, but the Disarmament Committee had been barred from starting work because of Western opposition. **********''I would like to hope that the scientists and public figures of the whole world will make a contribution of their own to making certain that space will forever remain free of all weapons, that it will not become an area of military clashes and that there will be no threat coming from space to those living on earth,'' Mr. Andropov said. ---- Leader in Antisatellite Work **********WASHINGTON, April 27 (UPI) -The State Department said today that the Soviet Union was the leader in developing a satellite interceptor as part of a military space program. **********''The Soviets possess the world's only operational ASAT interceptor, which they continue to test,'' a spokesman, Alan Romberg, said, using the abbreviation for ''antisatellite'' weapons. **********''That, plus the wide scope of their other military activities in space, belies their pose as champions of peace in outer space.'' Mr. Romberg said that, since the Soviet Union was developing a weapon system for space, the United States was forced to respond.  ''Other than a commitment to develop an ASAT capability to match the Soviets', we are not planning any space weapons systems,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/09/business/hyatt-submits-plan-in-braniff-hearing.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1983-06-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 717, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HYATT SUBMITS PLAN IN BRANIFF HEARING", "print_headline": "HYATT SUBMITS PLAN IN BRANIFF HEARING", "body_text": " **********The Hyatt Corporation submitted a final proposal on restarting part of Braniff Airways yesterday, meeting a deadline set earlier in the day by the Federal bankruptcy judge overseeing the case. **********In an attempt to stop what he called ''endless bickering,'' Judge John Flowers of Forth Worth had directed Jay A. Pritzker, chairman of the Hyatt Corporation, to make his best offer by sundown so that the judge could determine if the creditor groups could agree on a plan. **********At a hearing requested by Braniff, the judge also told representatives of Braniff's creditor groups to meet with him today at 9 A.M., with the authority to negotiate on Mr. Pritzker's offer.  The details of the latest offer, which were worked out yesterday between representatives of Braniff and Hyatt, were not released.  Howard D.

Mr. Pritzker's proposal, involving a $70 million investment, would put 30 Braniff planes back into service. The planes would be leased from the secured creditors, who hold liens on them. **********The judge, who has presided over the Braniff case since the airline shut down and filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in May 1982, made it clear yesterday that he wanted a quick resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings. **********''There will either be an agreement or not be an agreement,'' the judge said in ordering today's meeting. ''Essentially there is going to be a pie, and you are going to negotiate on how to divide it.'' **********The alternative to put Braniff planes back into service would be liquidation of the airline's assets, primarily its planes. Braniff would then emerge as a small ground maintenance company. **********Leaders of a major group of secured creditors made up of 38 banks and insurance companies, which hold $367 million of Braniff's secured debt, said on Tuesday that they were making progress in the talks with Mr. Pritzker. However, the secured bondholders, some 3,000 small investors who hold about $100 million of secured debt, have consistently opposed Mr. Pritzker's offers, unless he agrees to assume responsibility for payment of the bonds. Bondholders File Suit **********In a separate action, which could further complicate the attempt to re-start the airline, the bondholders yesterday filed suit in Federal District Court in Fort Worth. They accused Braniff's major lenders of conspiring since the beginning of 1980 to ''dominate, control and manipulate'' the airline's financial affairs in such a way as to benefit themselves and shortchange the bondholders. **********The suit seeks payment of nearly $100 million of principal as well as deferred interest and other costs that have been incurred since the airline filed for bankruptcy in May 1982. **********The suit argues that the lenders had got some proceeds from various assets sold by Braniff since 1980 but had not given any to the bondholders. The suit also says that the lenders allowed Braniff to keep some of the money to lessen the amount they would have to lend to the airline. **********James W. Toren, a vice president of the Prudential Insurance Company, who has been one of the leaders of the institutional investor group, was at meetings yesterday and not available to comment on the suit, a company spokesman said. **********Braniff also said yesterday that it had named Dale R.

Putnam, who will remain chairman of the board. Mr.  Putnam resigned this week as chief executive officer. **********Braniff also named Steven S.

Although dealers cautioned that reports of several major purchases of a few hundred million dollars of Treasury issues might be exaggerated, they concluded that sizable amounts of notes and bonds have moved out of dealer inventories and into investor hands in recent days. **********''A lot of pension fund managers have taken a look at the bond market and decided that yields of 12 percent look good against the stock market,'' commented Jay Goldinger, a broker in Beverly Hills, Calif. Demand for Treasury issues has also been strong from foreign investors, he said. **********The Herd Instinct **********Richard Davis, head of fixed-income research at the First Boston Corporation, said the rally owes some of its strength to the herd instinct of investors, rather than to any change in the outlook for the Federal deficit, Federal Reserve policy, the strength of the economy or the prospects for inflation. As bond prices fell almost 15 points between early May and early August, and sent yields rising on 30-year Treasury issues to more than 12 percent from about 10 1/4 percent, many market participants were convinced that the bond market was due for a rally. **********''Few people want to be the first to buy when things are unsettled,'' Mr Davis said. ''Investors would rather buy in an atmosphere of rising prices.'' **********Including yesterday's gain of almost 1 1/2 points, the newly issued 12 percent Treasury bonds due in 2013 had climbed to an offered price of 103 5/8, to yield 11.56 percent by late yesterday. They traded as low as 98 3/8 early last week, to yield 12.20 percent. **********Demand Strong for All Issues **********Demand has been good for shorter- term issues, as well as long-term bonds, traders said. The 11 3/8 percent Treasury notes due in 1986 rose more than 3/8, to 101, with a yield of 10.98 percent, while the 11 7/8 percent notes due in 1993 rose more than 3/4, to 101 3/4, and a yield of 11.46 percent. **********''The bond market is being prompted by hopes that first, the Federal Reserve will not have to tighten in the near term, and second, the interest rate levels already in place will be sufficient to cool off the economy,'' commented Wayne Lyski, a vice president at Alliance Capital Management Corporation. **********But Mr. Lyski added: ''I'm not convinced that either of those two conditions will be true this year.'' **********Many analysts are hoping that growth in the nation's basic money supply is on the verge of a significant slowdown from the 16.1 percent annual growth rate of the past three months. After last week's smaller- than-expected $400 million rise in the basic money supply, many forecasters said that the money supply number to be announced tomorrow may be unchanged from last week. **********As for the impact of higher interest rates on the economy, there are many forecasts that the pace of the recovery will slow from the second quarter, when the real gross national product expanded at an 8.7 percent annual rate. A slight decline in retail sales during July has so far been the strongest evidence that a slowdown is under way. **********Funds Rate Prompts Speculators **********Some analaysts said yesterday that a modest decline in the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market, to about 9 1/2 percent from 9.67 percent, helped prompt speculative buying of Treasury issues. Although Federal funds trading can be erratic on Wednesday, the last day of the banking system's statement week, some analysts said that allowing the benchmark rate to drop as low as 9 1/4 percent was a sign that the Fed is not trying to gradually raise rates. **********The rise in industrial capacity utilization during July to 75.8 percent from 74.6 percent in June was another sign that the economic recovery is proceeding, but it does not necessarily imply that inflation will heat up. The latest issue of the Griggs & Santow Report noted that after the 1974 recession, inflation ''did not become a major problem until the beginning of 1979'' - after industrial production had increased about 30 percent from its 1975 low and capacity utilization had increased about 25 percent from its low. **********''In current circumstances, percentage gains of this magnitude would take the industrial production index to about 180 and the capacity utilization index to about 85 percent,'' the report said.

''The increase in France was 90 percent; a 125 percent increase in Germany and 145 percent in Japan,'' he continued. Moreover, he added, Japan, with roughly half the population of the United States, is producing more engineers. **********The Soviet Union, Mr. Reagan said, which introduces basic concepts in geometry and algebra in its elementary schools, turns out five times as many engineering specialists each year as the United States. ''Obviously,'' he concluded, ''we must do better or we will be overtaken. In math and science instruction, the United States is a slow learner among the major industrial nations.'' **********As the President demonstrated in those remarks as well as in his State of the Union address on Jan. 25 and in a trip to Massachusetts in February, growing political capital is being made from support of math and science education and its beneficiaries, high-technology industry and research. The effect all the commotion will have on the problem is anyone's guess at this point, according to scholars, scientists and industrialists. But they say they are cheered by the interest, and especially by the President's enlistment in the battle. ''The nation is waking up,'' said Simon Ramo, a scientist and industrialist who has advised several Presidents, including Mr.  Reagan. **********''If it is sustained,'' said Richard N. Foster, a director of McKinsey & Company, the management consulting concern, who specializes in chemical and electronics industries, ''it could be terrific, bringing a significant change in the economy. But then we'll have to stick with it for more than four years at a time. The Congress has a responsibility for insuring that these programs being talked about continue from Administration to Administration.'' **********Legislators on Capitol Hill, who are also attuned to problems with science and math education, have been reading signals such as falling math and science test scores and a high percentage of unqualified high school math and science teachers as an erosion of the nation's technical prowess. As a result, the House of Representatives approved legislation earlier this month to spend more than $1 billion over the next five years to improve the teaching of math and science in public schools. The vote was an overwhelming 348 to 54. Yet the President's proposal was for much less, a $200 million commitment. **********Meanwhile, Senate Democrats are seeking to add $1 billion more in Federal and matching industry funds to upgrade science and engineering resources and curriculum in colleges. ''I have no desire to see high technology, the base my state now depends on, lost to the Japanese,'' said Senator Paul E. Tsongas, Democrat of Massachusetts, who sponsored the amendment. **********Dr. Marvin L. Goldberger, president of the California Institute of Technology, is among those who express dismay over the quality of the nation's secondary-school education, and said he felt the problem lay with the low nationwide level of scientific comprehension. ''I want to emphasize,'' he said, ''that in the debate over science and technology, all aspects of high school education are lousy, not just the education in mathematics and science. The problem is not that the kind of kids we get at Caltech won't keep coming along. The guys who win Nobel Prizes, who go to Caltech will always keep rising through the system, no matter how bad it is.'' **********Asked what the result would of an increase in the number of scientists and engineers in the American work force, he questioned how automatic such correlations actually were. ''Everyone knows instinctively,'' he said, ''that there should be an enormous correlation between the rate of technological innovation and the transfer of basic research into commercial applications. But it becomes very difficult to prove in a quantitative way.'' **********Dr. Goldberger acknowledged that innovations such as the transistor, the silicon chip and xerography had all created large industries, but added, ''When you go beyond these flashy examples, the case is more complex.'' **********Dr. Charles Falk, director of the division of science resource studies at the National Science Foundation, agreed with Dr.  Goldberger that it is difficult to say in quantitative terms how an increase in research and development improves productivity. But referring to President Reagan's speech warning of a decline in science and math training, Dr. Falk emphasized that the comparative figures in Mr. Reagan's speech were for scientists and engineers in research and development, not total number of scientists and engineers. Other countries do not have reliable figures on total scientists and engineers, he said. **********Dr. Falk said that the United States continued to lead Western nations in its total of research and development scientists and engineers as a percentage of the labor force. In 1979, he said, the last year for which figures are available, the United States had 58 research and development scientists and engineers for every 10,000 people employed in the labor force. In Japan, the figure was 50. The National Science Foundation estimated that the Soviet Union's rate was 80 per 10,000. **********To be sure, most analysts still regard the United States as the world's technological leader. It is significantly ahead in key growth areas, such as telecommunications and computer programming, according to Mr. Foster, the management consultant, and other experts. Richard Cyert, president of Carnegie-Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, said the nation's biggest problem in technology was not innovation but bringing new ideas to the marketplace. ''In terms of knowledge and research, we still are ahead,'' he said. ''What we've got to do is get those things off the drawing board and into reality more quickly.'' He faulted business schools for stressing finance, accounting and marketing at the expense of manufacturing in the last 15 years. But he added that most had since improved their manufacturing courses. Carnegie-Mellon's solution was to merge elements of its graduate engineering and industrial admininstration schools, with a two-year course leading to a combined degree in engineering and management. ''By having bridges we are going to have a much better integration with technology and management issues,'' said Angel Jordan, the engineering dean. ''The beauty of the thing is that it is not going to produce an M.B.A. type.'' **********Dr. Ramo said the Federal Government could take several steps to bolster the nation's technological competitiveness. As a former chairman of TRW Inc. who testified recently before several Congressional committees on technology issues, he called for a cut in the defense budget, saying that the Administration's proposals would spread the nation's technical resources too thin for many of the defense projects to be achieved efficiently. **********He backed an increase in Federal spending on basic research in universities and an extension of the present year-to-year budgeting practice. ''No civilized nation other than the United States has year-to-year funding on research,'' he noted. **********In one of his most strongly held views, Dr. Ramo advocated paying bonuses to high school math and science teachers, financed by the Federal rather than state or local grants, with matching dollars coming from local industry. ''The typical local school board does not know whether we need more math in high school, just like the typical school board does not know how many more ICBM's we need, '' he asserted. **********''There needs to be a Federal education crash program that requires money and organization, but it's totally do-able and it's going to happen,'' Dr. Ramo added. ''We've got a disaster impending if we don't change.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/27/business/focus-remains-on-fed-policy.html": {"writer_name": "Yla Eason", "pub_date": "1983-06-27", "snippet": "The credit market continues to focus on trying to judge the Federal Reserve's policies.

Some analysts contend that the recent rise in the Federal funds rate -the cost of overnight loans among banks - is an indication that the Fed has tightened the availability of credit. They point to an increase in this rate over the past week, from 8.84 percent to 9.14 percent, as a sign that the Fed wants higher short-term interest rates over all. **********Others look at the bank reserve position as a sign of Fed policy.  Based on the data supplied Friday by the Fed, banks ended the banking week with $78 million in net free reserves. This meant banks had more in surplus deposits at the Fed than was needed to meet reserve requirements. **********Since the Fed can control the amount of reserves in the banking system, analysts said this free position indicated that the Fed was freely supplying reserves and not restricting credit availability.  This, they say, suggests that Fed policy remains unchanged.Concern Over Money Supply **********Underlying the debate is concern over the growth in the nation's basic money supply, M-1, which measures funds readily available for spending. **********In recent weeks M-1 has mushroomed some $20 billion above the desired target growth pattern set by the Fed. Despite the $3.2 billion decline for the week ended June 15, M-1 growth is still $17 billion above target. Analysts say rapid money growth such as this must be reined in, if the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility is to be preserved. However, many analysts forecast that M-1 growth will slow significantly in the next two weeks, mitigating the need for Fed action. **********Fear that the Fed had tightened credit, or would soon do so, prompted investors to retreat from the market last week, when security dealers were trying to absorb a heavy $14.25 billion in new Treasury securities. Their anticipation of credit-tightening caused rates to rise. **********In addition, dealers are entering this week still looking for buyers of the new debt, and should investors' perceptions of Fed tightening keep them on the sidelines, yields may rise further. **********Compounding the problems are additional signs of a robust economy, with economic data suggesting greater demand for housing and automobiles and an accompanying increased desire for credit among businesses and consumers. These pressures could continue to push rates higher.'The Fed Has Firmed' **********Against this background, Phillip Braverman, an economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, said he believes that ''the Fed has firmed.'' He said the Fed is pushing the Federal funds rate higher as a way to slow money growth. ''They are coming back to setting policy by M-1, and while M-1 is better this week, it is still bad.'' **********He added that ''even though the situation looks less desperate, investors were unwilling to buy the auction. That's why I believe market interest rates are not high enough, and the yield levels are a reflection of all the problems the market faces.'' **********Michael L. Tindall, a money market economist at Republic Bank in Dallas, said, ''The changes in component factors in the monetary base to smooth out the seasonal effects are what's causing money to drop.  Those who look at the funds rate see a tightening; those who look at reserve position don't see a tightening.'' **********But, he says, the Fed is playing a hedging strategy. ''The Fed has allowed rates to move up, but it has not contracted reserves. So what we see is that the Fed has not tightened explicitly, but it has made a conscious decision to let rates rise, hoping that rising rates will contract money.''Analyst Sees no Policy Change **********Marc Wanshel, a financial economist at Crocker National Bank, said he believes that, based on the reserve position, ''there has basically been no fundamental policy change that has occurred yet. '' He said the increase in the Federal funds rate ''reflects technical factors associated with tax payment date rather than any significant change in Fed policy.'' **********Merrill Lynch wrote in its weekly credit market bulletin: ''The Federal funds rate is a very poor barometer of Fed intentions during the month of June, as it is deeply influenced by such seasonal factors as quarterly tax and dividend payments and end-of-quarter window-dressing practices.'' **********The auction of $12.4 billion in three-and six-month Treasury bills today should indicate the investors' perception. Last week the threemonth bill rose to 8.98 percent at the auction; it was offered late Friday at 8.96 percent. The six-month bill rose to 9.02 percent at last Monday's auction; it was offered late Friday at 8.97 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/16/business/molson-companies-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MOLSON COMPANIES reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "MOLSON COMPANIES reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/15/business/business-update-safeguard-scientifics-after-lewellyn.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Hammonds", "pub_date": "1983-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 407, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SAFEGUARD SCIENTIFICS, AFTER LEWELLYN", "print_headline": "BUSINESS UPDATE; SAFEGUARD SCIENTIFICS, AFTER LEWELLYN", "body_text": " **********For Safeguard Scientifics Inc., 1982 would have been bad enough without Gary Lewellyn. **********Battered by the economy, the tiny Pennsylvania machine parts manufacturer lost $6.7 million on sales that fell to $38.9 million from $39.1 million.

Gerard Defois, who is overseeing the preparation of the French episcopate's letter, said in an interview published today that the French bishops did not expect ''directly to condemn and judge from the exterior'' the actions of poltical and military leaders. **********He also suggested that the French bishops intended to support France's nuclear force by defending the concept of nuclear deterrence. **********By contrast, the American bishops' document, ''The Challenge of Peace,'' was widely interpreted as a criticism of American nuclear policy. **********First Major Pronouncement **********Father Defois's comments, published in Le Monde, represented the first major pronouncement of the French bishops' intentions. His statements, however, were in line with views expressed earlier this year by the Archbishop of Paris, Jean-Marie Cardinal Lustiger. **********The French contribution to the Roman Catholic debate on nuclear weapons, a debate heavily influenced by the deliberations of the French bishops, has been awaited with particular interest, partly because France also posesses nuclear weapons and because the disarmament movement has been less powerful both in French politics and within the French church. **********The French statement is likely to bear some similarities with a pastoral letter issued in January by West German bishops. The West Germans said ''nuclear deterrence is not a reliable instrument for preventing war in the long run'' but also defended ''the choice of the whole range of arms,'' including nuclear weapons, to help prevent war. **********In the interview, Father Defois said that ''deterrence, which is the response to a threatening situation, is but provisional security.'' 'Paradox of Peace' **********But he added that ''the paradox of peace in the nuclear era is precisely that one can only prevent war by evoking the horrors of the destruction of humanity.'' **********Father Defois was careful not to criticize the American bishops, noting that their statement was ''the point of departure'' for the wide discussion of the arms race in the Roman Catholic Church. He also appeared to go out of his way to minimize what will likely be seen as substantial differences of opinion between the French and American Catholic leadership. **********Echoing the views of many American Catholic leaders, he said the American bishops' statement had been misinterpreted as supporting unilateral disarmament. In fact, he said, the American bishops' statement, and the European hierachy, supported bilateral disarmament agreements. **********''All is in the term 'bilateral,' '' he said. ''I'd say that the American position is less new than people have said.'' Church's Role in Politics Cited **********Father Defois also argued that the variance between the expected French statement and the American pastoral letter could be partly accounted for by differences in the political and military situations of the two countries. One of the biggest differences, he said, was the important role played by churches in American political life. **********Another, he said, is ''the movement of strategic ideas'' since ''the arrival of President Reagan in the White House.  ''In particular,'' he said, ''a certain number of voices have been heard in that country extolling limited nuclear intervention, and even a 'first use' of that arm, that is to say, a crossing of the nuclear threshold.'' **********Thus, he said, ''what was in play in the American debate was not deterrence itself, but the fact that there was a tendency to banalize the recourse to nuclear weapons in public opinion.'' **********On the other hand, he said, the French discussion ''is situated in the context of deterrence in order to prevent nuclear war.'' Suggesting that the French nuclear force was too small to be used to start a worldwide nuclear war, Father Defois said that for France, ''a strategy of using atomic weapons is absolutely unthinkable for political, ethical and even technical and military reasons.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/11/business/imf-near-accord-on-quota-rise.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1983-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 743, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.M.F.

But now, the conference sources said, Washington would accept a rise of 48 to 50 percent. **********Most European countries want at least a 50 percent increase. Japan is said to be ready to accept 65 percent. The developing countries, which caucused yesterday as the Group of 24, issued a statement after their meeting asserting that anything less than a doubling of the quotas would be insufficient. **********The United States, which has been easing its position in the last few months, recently drew the line at a 40 percent increase, according to Administration officials. That would have meant an American contribution of $6 billion or $7 billion. **********Once an agreement is signed, it will require approval by the legislatures of the participating countries before going into effect. The outlook for ratification is least promising in the United States, which explains the tough American bargaining position. **********Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, who has already urged Congress to authorize American participation, will go to Congress Monday, according to Treasury officials, with a specific request if agreement is reached at the I.M.F. meeting. **********He is expected to argue that the increase is important to strengthen the world economy and therefore to encourage a recovery in the United States. Testimony from the United States Chamber of Commerce in support of the quota increase is awaited. **********Bankers have testified for the quota increase, which would help the I.M.F. to make new loans to countries having difficulty meeting debt payments to Western banks. But they declare that they are not seeking a handout. Like Administration and Chamber of Commerce officials, bankers say the money is needed to bolster the global economy. **********''In a sense the I.M.F. quota increase proposal is, in part, 'a jobs bill' affecting the growing numbers of our workers and farmers who depend on healthy foreign markets for their livelihood,'' said George J. Clark, executive vice president of Citibank. **********But many Congressional liberals and conservatives alike have already expressed grave doubts about any American contribution.  Conservatives do not like the idea of public subsidies; liberals insist the money would be better spent producing jobs at home. The Senate minority leader, Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, said in a breakfast interview Wednesday that he did not expect to vote for the increase. **********Secretary Regan brought a dozen Congressmen for lunch with the I.M.F.'s managing director, Jacques de Larosiere, on Wednesday. A spokesman for Representative Stephen L. Neal, chairman of the House trade subcommittee, said the North Carolina Democrat would ''probably be willing to support the quota increase, depending on what his hearings show.'' **********The United States would contribute both to a quota increase and to a rise to $19 billion, from $6.6 billion, in a line of credit that the 11 richest industrial countries provide the I.M.F. That line of credit is now available only for lending by the 11 nations, but would now be made available to all I.M.F. nations. So altogether, officials said, the United States would provide somewhere between $8 billion and $10 billion. **********Such money does not count as a Federal budget outlay, but as an exchange of assets, since the United States would get enlarged borrowing rights in return for its new contributions. **********Another part of the agreement still being worked out related to the percentage of quotas that members may borrow. The current limit is 450 percent, meaning that a country like Brazil with a $1 billion quota may now borrow $4.5 billion. **********The United States wants to lower the borrowing limit. Mr. Regan's initial position, officials said, was that the ceiling should be lowered to 300 percent.

But who would have thought that Chrysler's stock, written off by analysts as a dog in 1981 after trading as low as $3, would rise from the dead - it closed at $25.50 on Friday - and become one of Wall Street's biggest winners this year? **********Or consider International Harvester, the troubled maker of farm machinery and construction equipment. In August 1981, the prognosis on Wall Street was that Harvester might not survive the year. Negotiations with lenders, however, enabled the company to carry on. Since then, its stock has risen from a low of $2.75 last year to $8.88 now. **********Such increases are, of course, the exception in the stock market. For every Chrysler there is a W.T. Grant that slips into bankruptcy and is never heard of again. But the fact is that many American companies that fall into financial distress each year - including those flirting with insolvency - stage remarkable comebacks that send their stocks soaring. And although spotting these turnaround candidates is a difficult business, buying the shares or bonds of a company on the ropes can be enormously profitable for investors with courage and staying power. **********''Is it profitable? It can be fantastic,'' said Max L. Heine, chairman of Herzog Heine Geduld Inc., a Wall Street firm that invests heavily in the stocks of low-rated or bankrupt companies. **********''It's a high-risk game but an extremely rewarding one if you are right,'' said Martin D. Sass, president and chief executive of the M.D. Sass Investors Services Company, a Wall Street firm that invests in ''fallen angels'' - blue-chips experiencing temporary financial distress. ''It's hazardous, but I know many people who make a business out of it successfully.'' **********How, then, can one spot companies with a good chance of recovery? What steps can an investor take to find turnaround candidates among a ward of corporate basket cases? **********Probably the first thing to realize, investment experts say, is that it is generally safer to back large blue-chip institutions instead of small, lesser-known concerns. That is because the blue chips have greater access to capital and with their large payrolls, they often have the strong political support that might be needed to keep them afloat. **********And, said William H. Pike, portfolio manager of the $220 million Fidelity High-Income Fund, keep in mind that a company is not necessarily in trouble if its sales are falling. In fact, he said, if it is cutting costs faster than its receipts are falling, its financial situation could be improving. **********General Motors is a good example. A year and a half ago, when the American auto industry was in a deep slump, G.M. was busy paring costs in anticipation of a recovery late in 1982. Throughout this period, the auto maker's financial situation was said to be improving - despite flagging auto sales. Financial experts call this relationship between sales and costs the gross margin, and say that one of the best ways to spot a turnaround candidate is to look for a rising gross margin. **********Mr. Pike also suggests studying an ailing company's selling and administrative expenses - known in accounting circles simply as ''S.&A.'' - to see if a recovery is in the cards. S.&A. typically consists of such expendable items as travel and entertainment costs, executive perquisites, office supplies and public relations expenses. These costs should be listed clearly in a company's income statement and it is wise to study the trends, analysts say. If a troubled company is moving to right itself, Mr. Pike says, S.&A. costs should be falling. If they're not, he says, it means management has not done any necessary belt-tightening. **********THERE are other checkpoints of equal import, experts say, such as cash balance. **********Cash, after all, is the vital body fluid that supports operations once lenders cut off credit. If cash balance falls dangerously low, the company could be forced into bankruptcy by a single creditor. But if its cash balance is rising, a troubled company is more likely to be able to pay its bills and sustain itself until recovery sets in. **********Mr. Heine, who has spent his career investing in troubled or bankrupt concerns, including Manville, Braniff and AM International, says he looks almost immediately to the cash balance to size up an investment prospect. He looks at the most recent quarterly report to get the balance and to prior reports to see the trend in cash. **********This policy, part of a broader investment strategy to spot corporate Phoenixes, has paid off handsomely. In late 1981, for example, Mr. Heine paid $300 for AM International bonds with a face value of $1,000 when the company, now reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, had $10 million in cash. Now AM has about $80 million in cash, Mr. Heine says, and its bonds have more than doubled in value, to $700 each. **********Other balance-sheet items can also be telling in spotting companies ripe for a reversal, says Mr. Sass. In particular, he looks for ''obvious strengths'' on a balance sheet such as a debt-to- equity ratio less than the industry average, and a current ratio - the difference between a company's short-term assets and liabilities - that is above industry average. He also prefers to deal in well-known companies that are experiencing what he considers temporary financial distress rather than in companies on the brink. Among his favorites are Kodak, Nike and SmithKline. **********And he advises investors to look for companies with dominant market positions in one or two products because one highly successful product with strong consumer allegiance can pull a company out of the doldrums even when its industry lags. ''Leaders have more control over their customers and prices than followers,'' Mr. Sass said. **********Still another thing to consider is the attitude of institutional investors. If pension funds and insurance companies decide to buy the stock of a troubled concern, it means ''some sophisticated, knowledgeable people think there is hope for the company,'' said Mr. Pike. This is particularly true, he says, if bankers agree to share in a company's equity. Money Manager Portfolios, a Huntington, N.Y.-based publication of H.F. Pearson & Company, tracks institutional holdings and is available at many large public libraries. **********Finally, Mr. Pike and others encourage investors to look at management. If top management is replaced, they say, that could be a good sign because lenders, key to a companys' survival, are in control. But if fraud is uncovered in top management, most agree that a turnaround is a long shot - and that investors should steer clear."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/08/business/the-new-software-suppliers.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1983-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 987, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE NEW SOFTWARE SUPPLIERS", "print_headline": "THE NEW SOFTWARE SUPPLIERS", "body_text": " **********Mickey Mouse has come a long way since Walt Disney introduced him in 1928: Now, Mickey and his cartoon friends are featured in a line of home computer software being offered by a division of Walt Disney Productions. **********Disney, which almost adopted the advertising slogan ''Mickey Turns Micro,'' is but one of the unlikely companies showing new software at the International Winter Consumer Electronics Show here. Other new providers of software, which are the instructions that run computers, include such well-known entertainment companies as CBS, 20th Century-Fox, Parker Brothers and Thorn EMI. **********The push into software mirrors the broad move into the home video game market in the past year, and with good reason: Just as home video games have been the fastest-growing consumer electronics product in the past two years, so home computers are perceived to be the up and coming products for 1983, as the growth rate of the game market slows. **********Cost of Machines Has Fallen **********Most ''personal'' computers, such as the Apple and I.B.M. machines, sell for more than $1,000 and have been used mostly for business.  But machines selling for less than $1,000, and usually for less than $400, have been doing extraordinarily well in building a market for use in the home. **********Sales of such home computers in the United States rose to about two million units in 1982, more than triple the 1981 sales, according to Future Computing Inc., a market research firm in Richardson, Tex. The total is expected to grow to at least five million this year. **********Until now the home computer market has been a battleground for only five suppliers - Texas Instruments, Commodore International, Tandy Corporation's Radio Shack division, Warner Communications' Atari Inc. and the team of Timex and Sinclair Research Ltd., a British company.  In addition to manufacturing the computers themselves, these companies also sold much of the software. Newcomers to the Market **********That is no longer the case: A host of newcomers introduced lowprice personal computers here. Some, such as Mattel and Japan's Nippon Electric and Matshushita, which markets its products in the United States under the brand name Panasonic, are well known; others are virtually unknown, such as Spectravideo Inc. of New York, which is marketing a computer made in Hong Kong. Its president, Harry Fox, used to market watches made in Hong Kong. **********It will be difficult for the newcomers to catch up. Texas Instruments and Commodore International are already shipping more than 100,000 machines a month, meaning they can get production costs way down. They also have huge catalogues of software. **********The newcomers' entry is likely to worsen the price war. Some analysts say supply will exceed demand this year, leading to sharply reduced prices and profits. **********The home computer market has already broken into three segments: **********- Computers selling for $100 or less, used basically to learn about programming. Timex and Sinclair have been the only companies in this field until now. Timex has sold more than 500,000 of its $100 computers since introducing them last summer. **********- Computers selling for $150 to $400, typified by the Texas Instruments 99/ 4A and the Commodore VIC20, and used mainly for games and educational purposes. **********- Business-oriented computers, a category that is growing as the machines decline in price. The Commodore 64, which cost $600, has many of the capabilities of the Apple, which costs nearly twice as much. By the end of the year, Apple and I.B.M., which exhibited at the show for the first time, are expected to introduce computers selling for less than $1,000. Aggressive Pair of Leaders **********The current leaders in the low end of the market are Texas Instruments and Commodore, and they are expanding aggressively.  Texas Instruments introduced here a small portable computer and a $100 machine to learn programming. ''We designed this as a Timex killer,'' said Donald P. Bynum, manager of Texas Instruments' personal computer division. And Commodore introduced two computers - a tiny briefcase-size machine and a larger but still portable computer selling for less than $1,000. **********For its part Timex, whose traditional turf is being invaded by Texas Instruments, countered by going into T.I.'s marketplace with a more powerful computer selling for $200. **********Falling behind are Radio Shack and Atari, whose machines are considered somewhat high priced and outdated. In particular, Atari, which once led the whole market, is sorely in need of a replacement for its Atari 400, whose flat keyboard has proved unpopular. ''Until they get something to replace the 400, they're going to be left in the dust,'' said Egil Juliussen, chairman of the board of Future Computing. Software as Source of Profits **********With the drop in prices for basic computers, which consist of a keyboard with electronic circuits, the profits for both manufacturers and retailers will come increasingly from the software, and from peripheral equipment such as printers, game paddles and data storage devices that attach to the main computer. **********Software already accounts for 25 percent of total sales and peripherals for 50 percent, according to Future Computing. The software share is expected to grow dramatically in the years ahead. **********This explains the entry of CBS, Walt Disney and other companies, as well as companies that have specialized in home video games, such as Activision Inc. and Imagic Inc. **********The movement of the video game software companies into computer software illustrates what many in the industry think will happen - the video game will be replaced by the more versatile home computer.  Home computers, analysts argue, can also be used to play games, but they do other things as well, and they cost little more than the game machines."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/18/world/french-say-new-rapid-reaction-force-is-to-stop-thrust-into-europe.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1983-06-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 368, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FRENCH SAY NEW RAPID REACTION FORCE IS TO STOP THRUST INTO EUROPE", "print_headline": "FRENCH SAY NEW RAPID REACTION FORCE IS TO STOP THRUST INTO EUROPE", "body_text": " **********The French Defense Minister revealed details of the country's new rapid reaction force today.

He also announced the redeployment of sections of the First French Army so that it will be better placed to fight an attack against northern France through central Germany, where the bulk of the United States' NATO forces are stationed. Integrated Command Is Rejected **********Mr. Hernu insisted there could be no question of the rapid reaction force, or any other part of the French armed forces, being placed back under NATO's integrated command, which France left in 1968.  Indeed, he said the fact that the force would remain exclusively under French control made it more effective as a deterrent, presumably because an adversary could not predict for certain where or whether it would be used. **********Mr. Hernu acknowledged, however, that France would need to make contingency plans with other NATO commanders for the force's possible deployment. ''Of course, this eventuality supposes preparation with our allies,'' he said. **********In addition to infantry, the new rapid reaction force is to include an armored division, a special force of 140 antitank helicopters and an infantry regiment trained in antitank warfare. ''It will thus be a large unit capable of opposing the armored thrust of an aggressor and engaging defensive combat wherever we decide,'' the Defense Minister said. **********Ever since the announcement of the plans for the rapid reaction force, officials and military experts have been saying it implies a greater willingness to fight a forward defense of Europe in West Germany and abandonment of Charles de Gaulle's strategy of trying to defend France at its frontiers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/10/world/soviet-scientists-call-missile-defense-plan-by-us-an-illusion.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 219, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviet Scientists Call Missile Defense Plan By U.S. an Illusion", "print_headline": "Soviet Scientists Call Missile Defense Plan By U.S. an Illusion", "body_text": " **********Soviet scientists said today that President Reagan's plan for an effective defense against nuclear attack was an illusion. **********An appeal by 244 scientists, published by the press agency Tass, said: ''Proceeding from the understanding of the basic nature of nuclear weapons, we declare in all responsibility that there is no effective defensive means in nuclear war and their creation is not practicably possible. **********''The attempt at creating so-called defensive weapons against the strategic nuclear force of the other side will inevitably grow into the emergence of a new element strengthening the American firststrike potential.

''They will certainly not scare us,'' Mr. Arens said in a speech in Tel Aviv. ''We will not be dragged into any hostilities. We will not lose our nerve.'' He added: ''We can sit quietly, watch events and reach a correct assessment. We cannot be provoked.'' **********The pledge of firm restraint followed a pattern of public and private comments by Israeli officials in recent days as tension has mounted over the military situation along the Israeli-Syrian ceasefire line in eastern Lebanon. **********Israeli Army Reported on Alert **********The Israeli Army was reported today to be in a state of alert after the Syrians began maneuvers near Israeli lines. The maneuvers, officials said, could easily develop into an attack. They followed two reported incidents earlier in the week of Syrian missiles' being fired at an Israeli helicopter and a reconnaissance jet over the Bekaa, Lebanon's eastern valley. Neither aircraft was hit, the Israelis said. **********Prime Minister Menachem Begin briefed leaders of the opposition Labor Party on the situation.  Despite the rumblings of war, Defense Minister Arens sounded a note of calm; he welcomed a comment from the Syrian Defense Minister, Lieut. Gen. Mustafa Tlas, that Syrian measures were purely defensive. **********''I hope that this is correct,'' Mr. Arens said, ''and if it is correct, this is good news.'' Apprehension and Uncertainty **********Still, there was apprehension and uncertainty here about Syrian intentions. Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir said: ''We hope that Syria will not commit a terrible mistake. We are watching carefully this situation, and we are taking the necessary measures.'' **********The jittery mood of the army was indicated by an increased monitoring, by the military censor, of foreign correspondents' incoming and outgoing telex communications. The censor blocked the receipt by the Jerusalem bureau of The New York Times of a message from The Times's foreign desk reporting the contents of a dispatch from Beirut by The Associated Press on waves of Israeli tank transporters clogging the roads from Israel into Lebanon. Only after the censor was persuaded, in a protracted argument, that the bureau was receiving the message, not sending it, did he clear the telex line and allow it to be conveyed. **********Correspondents who tried to report from Israel on the army's movements in the north were told by the censor that they would not be allowed to do so. Theory of Brinkmanship **********One theory among officials in Jerusalem held that President Hafez al-Assad of Syria was engaging in a familiar game of brinkmanship to strengthen his position in negotiations with Lebanon on a possible pullout of Syrian and Palestinian forces. **********Since Israel and Lebanon signed their security agreement providing for an Israeli withdrawal, Syria has denounced the accord and has pledged to prevent it from being put into effect. Israel has said it would withdraw its forces only as Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization withdraw theirs. **********But many officials here believe that Mr. Assad might ultimately agree on a pullout if he receives extensive security arrangements in Lebanon, money from Saudi Arabia and perhaps political concessions from the United States, such as a pledge to press Israel to give up the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria in the 1967 war. **********The atmosphere on the eastern Syrian-Israeli front two days ago was considerably more relaxed than the tense mood on the political front in Jerusalem. No Flak Jackets or Helmets **********While officials were issuing warnings, soldiers at Israeli outposts were calling and waving to their Syrian counterparts. Troops on both sides were going around in full view of the others without flak jackets or helmets, sometimes even without weapons. **********Some Israeli soldiers asserted that the only tension was in the newspapers, and one officer said that soon after he arrived two weeks ago he arranged to call home to reassure his family that things were calmer than they appeared on television. **********Nevertheless, the Israelis' stated approach is to fortify positions in case the Syrians attack.

They run from bank to bank - putting money in, taking it out - all to earn higher interest. Their days are consumed with following rates as investors' days are filled with following stocks and bettors' with horses. **********I suppose this is a good thing: Even ''the little guys'' (those with $2,500 to fool with) have a chance to make money on their money. But there seem to be a few problems: **********1. Psychic insecurity: A new neurosis seems to be developing.  People wonder if they are earning every possible penny on their pittance. Ads are scanned each day, banks called and visited, friends and relatives consulted. I never thought I'd regret the passing of the 5 percent rate, but the worried faces of people at the bank have given me second thoughts. **********2. Fine Print Shock: Customers find high rates are not all they are cracked up to be. Charges and penalties are levied where they never were before. Caveat emptor, always a bit of a joke in a society where the growth of consumer information never kept up with the increase in commodities, seems emptier of substance than before. **********3. Social loss: The personal waste of time and energy involved in shopping for the extra quarter point of interest is compounded by the social loss. There is less time for other things, for people. What we didn't need was a reinforcement of the already ubiquitious greed or of the tendency to think only of accumulation. **********4. Problems at banks: Banks seem to be busier than ever, but more are failing than at any time since the Depression. Bankers, who pay lip service to competition and deregulation, say in the next breath that they pay out more in interest than they should. **********5. Fruits of Success Syndrome: Many people busily running from bank to bank don't need that extra one-quarter percent - and don't know what to do with it once they have it. Worse, it creates larger tax burdens for them. So they spend the little energy left in costly tax avoidance strategy sessions with a multiplying army of ''advisers'' seeking ways (let us be plain) to cheat the Government, legally, illegally, or ''by not saying anything.'' The only economic growth is in the underground economy. **********6. Growth of nonproductive activity: There is another area of growth, in the numbers of bankers, lawyers, accountants, brokers - of whom we had already more than enough. So far as is known, not one new factory or useful product or service has been developed from this activity. Money is just being moved around. **********7. Growth of cynicism, skepticism and the ''you can't win'' attitude: Some pressures for deregulation came from consumer groups wanting the middle class to have the investment opportunities of the top 2 percent. But the middle class can't afford the tax avoidance specialists of the rich. So it ends up a bit richer, more than a bit harried and more envious. **********When I see former hippie and radical friends shopping for interest and avoiding taxes (not this time from principle), I grow sad.  ''Everyone else does it,'' says one, or ''The Government wastes money, I might as well spend it on myself.'' **********What has happened to the idealism of the 60's? One thing is that more energy goes into getting more. It isn't just bank deregulation.  And it isn't just President Reagan. In fact, deregulation was started by President Carter. His intentions were doubtless benign.  And a little of this is good. But, as usual, it's gone beyond reason. Maybe it's all a plot to get us to trivialize our lives even more. **********St. Thomas would have called all of this usury. Today, we find even the Vatican involved in banking scandals. Perhaps it is time for Christ to chase the money-lenders out of the temple again. The problem is that if He came they'd probably try to sell Him a new money market account with access to his funds 24 hours a day, at high rates, F.D.I.C. insured, with a minimum investment of $2,500 plus a $25 premium or an iron.

There are also, without much doubt, some significant differences. **********Perhaps the most striking analogy between the experiences in Vietnam and El Salvador has little to do with the situations that prevailed on the ground in both countries. Instead, it involves the world view and political instincts of policy makers in Washington. **********United States officials in the 1960's initially viewed the war in South Vietnam as a challenge originating in Peking and Moscow, and the more direct support of the Vietcong from North Vietnam as international aggression. Soviet Union Blamed **********In much the same spirit, early in his Administration President Reagan said: ''The Soviet Union underlies all the unrest that is going on. If they weren't engaged in this game of dominoes, there wouldn't be any hot spots in the world.'' His first Secretary of State, Alexander M. Haig Jr., said the problem in El Salvador ''is external intervention in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation in this hemisphere - nothing more, nothing less.'' **********Another apparent similarity grows from the fact that in both situations the United States began by trying to fight a proxy war and assume an advisory role. **********In this connection, both the South Vietnamese Government of 1961 and the Salvadoran Government of 1980 did not seem to many critics to be the most suitable instruments or proxies with which to wage a war. **********In Vietnam much of the American advice was not taken. When the advice was taken it usually involved decisions that were the least painful politically and socially for the South Vietnamese ruling elite. Loyalty Was First Priority **********One example involved military promotion policy. For more than a decade a series of Governments in Saigon fought a stubborn and successful battle against United States pressure that selections of commanders be based on military merit. **********The successive South Vietnamese Governments could grasp the argument but would not agree with the priority. To them the first priority always remained the political loyalty and reliability of division and corps commanders to the leaders in Saigon. **********In the Vietnam War some of the leading thinkers on counterinsurgency used to say the early stages of a guerrilla war tend to skew priorities. The leader of the embattled nation knows that the fledgling guerrilla army cannot storm the presidential palace and depose him. But his own army clearly can. The more competent a commander is militarily, the less attractive he may seem to the political leader. **********The final collapse of South Vietnam in 1975 began when an incompetent, but politically loyal, division commander panicked and began a headlong retreat from the Central Highlands to the coast. **********''You could argue,'' said an official who served in Vietnam, ''that, in the end, promotion policy lost the war.''  Promotion by Politics **********Until recently, at least, it seemed to some United States officials involved in El Salvador's guerrilla war that a clear parallel existed here. **********El Salvador's small army had fewer than 500 commissioned officers until recently. It also had, a United States expert said, ''an automatic promotion policy.'' **********There was also a tendency much like that in Vietnam to give key command jobs to officers on the basis of political reliability rather than merit, according to United States analysts. **********There have recently been some signals in El Salvador that a more wholesome policy on military promotions may be evolving. But even optimists tend to agree that it is too soon to declare that a fundamental change for the better is under way. **********A variety of analysts agree that while Gen. Eugenio Vides Casanova, who became the Defense Minister this spring, has been more receptive than his predecessor to advice on tactics and humane treatment of civilians by the army, little change has been made among unit commanders.   Resisting U.S. Advice **********Until recently, another similarity seemed to involve other forms of military and political advice. **********The South Vietnamese Army was in many ways a very competent military organization. But much of the time it resisted adopting the tactics and aggressive spirit that United States advisers pleaded for. A United States officer who served in Vietnam and El Salvador recalled what he bitterly called Vietnamese ''search and evade'' missions, which substituted for search- and-destroy operations. **********As late as this spring, the situation in El Salvador seemed to be similar. United States advisers told visitors that many Salvadorans were fighting a ''9 to 5, five day a week war,'' and giving up the night hours to the guerrillas. **********But since early summer there seems to have been a change, close to dramatic, in the Salvadoran willingness to accept military tactical advice.   Elections Considered Important **********Another striking parallel between Vietnam-era officials in Washington and Reagan Administration officials involves a strong and persistent belief that the holding of elections in the proxy nation, and the creation of what they regard as a legitimate government, will cripple the rebel movement.  Some experts in counterinsurgency are dubious about the validity of this premise. In some third world nations, various measures such as stamping of identity cards at polling places tend to coerce people to vote. But elections do not seem to coerce guerrillas. After the March 1982 elections in El Salvador, the leftist guerrillas regrouped and by October were stronger than ever. **********Many United States officials again seem to believe that presidential elections in El Salvador, most likely to occur early next year, will significantly affect the ability and persistence of the leftist coalition. **********There seems to be another analogy in the reluctance of United States officials, particularly those far away in Washington, to apply strong pressure on the host countries when they ignore United States advice or pursue what the Washington officials consider to be self-destructive policies.   Withdrawal Not an Option **********United States officials sometimes did apply heavy pressure in Vietnam but would not press their point of view to a serious confrontation. ''Suppose they ask us to leave?'' officials sometimes asked. **********The ultimate sanction of United States withdrawal was regarded as unthinkable and not a serious option. Much the same situation seems to prevail in El Salvador, according to officials here and in Washington. **********While there seems to be more willingness here recently to accept purely military advice, there has been less inclination by the Salvadoran authorities to adopt social policies repugnant to the economic oligarchy, the upper middle class and the army. And United States pressure to do so has been timid. **********Despite promises to see justice done in the cases of eight Americans slain here, almost certainly by right-wing, Government-controlled gunmen, El Salvador has not brought anyone to trial. It is not thought likely that if trials are finally held officers who ordered the killings will be tried.   Human Rights an Issue **********More important to the course of the war is the continuing abuse of human rights involving Salvadoran civilians. **********Salvadoran church officials believe that at least 40,000 civilians have been killed since late 1979 and that the great majority were the victims of right- wing ''death squads.'' **********Although officials in Washington put the figure much lower, the former United States Ambassador here, Deane R. Hinton, put the death total at 30,000 in a speech in San Salvador this year. **********In that speech Mr. Hinton warned that the Government's behavior was hurting the war effort. He said the ''gorillas'' of the right-wing ''Mafia'' were destroying El Salvador as surely as the left-wing guerrillas in the mountains. **********Although Mr. Hinton's speech had been cleared by officials in the State Department, it was repudiated by White House officials as too strong and unsuitable in its nearly anguished call for an end to official thuggery.   Distance Is Emphasized **********Moreover, a variety of experts believe that the statutory requirement that President Reagan certify every 180 days that El Salvador is making progress in improving human rights, disciplining its security forces and in carrying out land redistribution and other social changes has tended to give ''Salvador the leverage, not us.'' **********As certification has routinely followed cerification, it seems to have become apparent to Salvadoran officials that only cosmetic measures are required on their part. Much the same situation applied in Vietnam, although the South Vietnamese authorities and security forces never showed the same callousness that prevails here. **********Reagan Administration officials who argue that there is almost no analogy between the two crises tend to emphasize heavily an argument that Vietnam was very distant and El Salvador is very close to the United States and that El Salvador more clearly represents a vital United States interest. **********Among the differences between the two conflicts, the intensity of combat stands out. The troops of North Vietnam and of main force Vietcong units were among the best assault infantrymen in the world. They had an awesome willingness to climb over barbed wire under the muzzles of Government machine guns. The Salvadoran rebels are apparently not in the same league.   Fighting Is Less Intense **********Moreover, the disparity in firepower, whether used discriminately or indiscriminately, in the two wars is hard to exaggerate. It may be that more steel and powder was expended in a day or two in Vietnam than in the entire Salvadoran conflict. This, some American experts think, may be to the good. **********But it also seems to be one expression of a vast difference in mood and confidence on the part of policy makers in Washington. President Kennedy met little domestic opposition when he undertook a program of ''combat support'' in South Vietnam that soon had 16,000 advisers actually living and fighting with Vietnamese forces. **********And the Vietnam War began on a euphoric, ''we don't lose'' mood. That kind of optimism seems less evident today. If policy makers in Washington feel certain that they can win in El Salvador, few of them explicitly say so. **********President Johnson began direct United States involvement in Vietnam with a 98-to-2 vote of confidence from the Senate. **********President Reagan has had no such blank check, but he has not seemed to want a blank check. The Administration's moves here have been on a much smaller scale than its vigorous policy statements might indicate. **********Although Vietnam-era officials have often been accused of waging the Vietnam War halfheartedly and too cautiously, they seem in retrospect much more aggressive in their policies than carefully proscribed efforts in El Salvador, where there is no combat support, no field advisers and little military aid."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/24/business/celanese-corp-restructuring.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 152, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Celanese Corp.

Instead, the public has been offered reports on a lieutenant shot dead in an ambush, on infantrymen feasting on knishes in the shadow of the armored personnel carrier on the eve of a hazardous mission, on the Islamic insurgents plunging Kabul into darkness by sabotaging power lines, on Russian nurses stranded in dangerous outposts, or on a popular rock group refusing to travel to distant bases. **********The coverage is still remote from anything resembling a credible picture of what the soldiers are doing in Afghanistan or why. The Soviet force is described only as doing its ''international duty'' against counterrevolutionaries waging an ''undeclared war'' at the behest of the United States, China, Pakistan and Egypt. Nothing is published about the size of the force, the operations it conducts, the scope of the opposition or the casualties. **********Better Feeling for Conditions **********The difference has been in an attempt to give some feeling for the conditions and dangers of Afghanistan, with sweltering lowlands and freezing mountain passes, stalking rebels, loneliness, nostalgia and the other travails of men in combat far from home. **********The trade union daily Trud, for example, depicted the heroic death of a young infantry lieutenant and aspiring poet, killed while trying to hold off guerrillas. Krasnaya Zvezda, the armed forces daily, wrote of a decorated sergeant preparing to lead a column through three rebel-infested provinces. **********These and other soldiers are shown, if not in combat roles, at least in military roles - as infantrymen, sappers, sentries. And the terms used seem to echo military activities, with ''counterrevolutionaries'' giving way to ''basmachi.'' a term used in the 1920's for anti-Soviet guerrillas in Central Asia, or ''dushman,'' the Afghan word for insurgent. **********Some Soviet press accounts, though disparaging the Afghan rebels' claim to uphold Islam, have even cited their term for Soviet soldiers - ''nevernye,'' meaning ''infidels.'' **********The unusual expansion of Soviet press coverage followed the ascendancy to power of Yuri V. Andropov, and Western diplomats suggest that it may reflect the wishes of the military establishment, eager to receive some credit for a major and costly operation. **********According to Western estimates, more than 100,000 Soviet soldiers have been in Afghanistan for more than three years now, and the diplomats surmise that they, their relatives and the military in general must be generating pressure for recognition of their role. **********''The military must chafe at having to read only about troops planting flowers down there,'' said a diplomat who follows Afghan affairs. ''They simply cannot like that image.'' Catching Up With Western Radio **********He said the more candid reporting may also have been caused by the need to counter rumors and Western radio broadcasts.  A report in Izvestia on Feb. 24 about three bomb explosions in Kabul, for example, merely acknowledged incidents already reported by Western radio stations and made a point of denying that Soviet saboteurs could be responsible, a rumor possibly afoot in Kabul. **********The expanded coverage does not seem to reflect any great curiosity about the war among the Soviet populace in general. The war rarely comes up in conversations among Russians, and few Russians in meetings with Westerners display much interest in learning what is being reported abroad. Some diplomats think that military frustration with this apathy may lie behind efforts to publicize the Afghan operation. **********An example was Trud's account of the death of Lieut. Aleksandr I.

Like most Soviet accounts about military activities, Trud said Lieutenant Stovba had been on a training mission, and the paper used quotation marks around the words ''attack'' and ''defense'' as if to suggest maneuvers. **********In the story, the detachment was ambushed in a gorge, and the lieutenant confronted the attackers alone after having ordered his men to seek safety. **********The account included the ''zing, zing'' of bullets and described how the lieutenant was hit in an arm, the stomach and finally his heart while his comrades clambered up cliffs to his aid. **********The story was unusual not only in the account of a soldier's death, of which the press has acknowledged only about half a dozen, but in the report of the posthumous honors accorded the lieutenant in his hometown of Dneprodzerzhinsk, the Ukrainian steel center. Lieutenant's Family Background **********Trud said Lieutenant Stovba's grandfather had fought against the original ''basmachi'' in Central Asia, and his father had served in World War II in a Red Army unit that drove the Germans from the Soviet Union to Vienna. **********On Sunday, Krasnaya Zvezda, the armed forces newspaper, told about three mines being set off in Kabul on the eve of Soviet Army Day, which falls on Feb. 23, and about calls for a general strike that the paper said went unheeded. It said that guerrillas had placed the mines in areas where Soviet soldiers were not likely to be to insure that the casualties would be Afghan civilians. **********''It was a primitive scheme,'' the paper said. ''intended to set Afghans against the Soviet people. It was as if they said, 'Behold, countrymen, the Russians are celebrating while you are mourning your dead, victims of the 'holy war against the infidels.' '' **********Describing Kabul, the paper cast unusual light on the Soviet military presence. On the streets, it said, brightly colored buses and trucks mingle with Soviet jeeps, while a bridge across the Kabul River is manned by the police and Soviet soldiers. The paper spoke of dangers outside Kabul - mines uncovered by Soviet patrols, a sergeant preparing for dangerous convoy duty. **********Among the more unusual press reports was one about the visit of the Blue Guitars, a Moscow rock group. Army officers complained in a letter to the editor that not only did the group produce noise with no ideological content, but it kept complaining about accommodations, and, under various pretexts, refused to visit remote and presumably dangerous outposts. **********A followup to the letter said the Blue Guitars had conceded their wrongdoing and had been penalized by being barred from foreign tours and from appearing in Moscow."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/07/world/mrs-gandhi-loses-grip-on-2-states.html": {"writer_name": "Sanjoy Hazarika", "pub_date": "1983-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 733, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MRS.

But the setbacks led to some speculation that she might decide to call a general election before it is due in January 1985. **********The setbacks appeared to be especially stinging since Mrs. Gandhi campaigned heavily in both Andhra Pradesh and neighboring Karnataka, declaring that only a national party like hers could adequately tackle national and regional problems. She was elected to Parliament from a district in Andhra Pradesh in 1980, when she was returned to power with her large majority in Parliament. **********Control of the Andhra Pradesh legislature was won by a seven-monthold party led by a popular film actor, Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao. Mr. Rao campaigned on pledges to clean up public life and restore the honor of the Telegus, as the people of Andhra Pradesh are known. He charged that Mrs. Gandhi interfered too much in local affairs and appointed corrupt politicians to powerful posts. Chief Minister Resigns **********Late tonight it was already clear that his Telegu Nation Party had won a majority in the 294-seat legislature, capturing at least 150 seats, while the Prime Minister's followers had about 40. In the previous house, the Congress Party had 250 members. **********In Karnataka, no single party appeared to have won an outright majority in the 224-seat legislature. But Gundu Rao, the Congress Party Chief Minister, resigned after he lost his race for a legislative seat. At least five of Mr. Rao's Cabinet colleagues also lost. **********With 215 of the 224 races decided, Gandhi candidates had won 76, while 98 had been captured by an opposition alliance made up of the Janata Party of former Prime Minister Morarji R. Desai, two Communist parties and a regional group. The National People's Party of former Foreign Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee took 18 seats, and the 23 others were won by independents and rebel Congress Party candidates. **********Adding to the bitterness of the Congress Party defeat in Andhra Pradesh was the victory of three nominees of a group led by Maneka Gandhi, the Prime Minister's rebellious daughter-in-law. **********Maneka Gandhi, whose husband, Sanjay, was killed in a plane crash in 1980, was ordered to leave the Prime Minister's official residence last spring after she participated in a convention of rebels in the ruling Congress Party. She was not a candidate in the elections, which marked her party's debut in Indian politics. Mrs. Gandhi and Son Campaigned **********Her candidates were aligned with Mr. Rao, who allotted them five seats, apparently to embarrass the Prime Minister and her other son, Rajiv Gandhi, who also campaigned. But Mr. Gandhi, a 38-year-old former airline pilot and Member of Parliament who is regarded as his mother's closest adviser, failed to make much of an impression in the campaign, while his sister-in-law drew large crowds. **********As a result of the elections, Andhra Pradesh will become the second southern state to be ruled by a successful film actor who has moved into politics. An actor named M.G. Ramachandran heads the administration in the neighboring state of Tamil Nadu. **********Mr. Rao is a 59-year-old veteran of 300 films and is revered by some of his fans as a Hindu god. In 1981 the villagers of Pumuru built a temple and installed an image of the actor as their chosen deity. In his films he has often portrayed Hindu gods; other roles have included those of honest, poor men and patriots. **********In his campaign he traveled in a sturdy van, equipped with loudspeakers, microphones and floodlights, and he spoke on street corners and at mass rallies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/05/business/markets-closed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 26, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Markets Closed", "print_headline": "Markets Closed", "body_text": " **********Stock, commodity and foreign exchange markets were closed yesterday in Britain, West Germany, France, Australia, Hong Kong and South Africa because of the Easter Monday holiday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/23/business/standard-logic-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-jan-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 41, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STANDARD LOGIC INC reports earnings for Qtr to jan 31", "print_headline": "STANDARD LOGIC INC reports earnings for Qtr to jan 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/10/business/producers-lose-in-court-on-gas-price.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 224, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Producers Lose in Court On Gas Price", "print_headline": "Producers Lose in Court On Gas Price", "body_text": " **********A Federal court, in a move that may mean a $900 million refund for natural gas suppliers and consumers, threw out a Government pricing regulation today. **********The ruling by the United States Court of Appeals here was a defeat for natural gas producers and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. **********Rachelle Patterson, a representative of the agency, said it had not decided whether to appeal the decision. **********The three-judge appellate panel threw out a rule that had been adopted by the F.E.R.C. under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.

Barkley, president and chief operating officer of PSA, the parent company of Pacific Southwest Airlines, said in an interview that the plane would not only strenghten PSA's position on hard-fought California routes but would also reduce fuel costs. **********PSA offers ''no frill'' flights and emphasizes keeping its costs low. It and other smaller carriers are engaged in an intense battle with the full-service United Airlines, which has increased flights in large markets such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, between which two million passengers flew last year. Full- service carriers offer drinks, meals and other amenities not usually provided by their no-frills competitors, which charge less for tickets. **********Four-Engine Craft **********The new plane, the BAe 146-200, has four engines that are considered among the quietest and most fuel efficient. It is thus well suited for some of the airports in suburban communities, such as Long Beach, Calif., which have strict noise restrictions and are part of PSA's route system. The first eight aircraft will be delivered in 1984 and the remainder in 1985. PSA has an option on 25 more aircraft. **********Mr. Barkley said the first 10 aircraft, each of which will seat 100 passengers, would be leased from British Aerospace. He said the company expected to receive British export financing to purchase the remaining 10. PSA estimated that the cost of the total order, including lease charges, spare parts and engines, would be about $300 million. **********Leslie Tuck, president of British Aerospace Inc., the American subsidiary of the British company, said in an interview that the order was a major coup for the company and would greatly aid it in marketing the plane to other airlines. **********'A Very Large Order for Us' **********''It's a very large order for us,'' he said. ''Its the largest civilian order that we have had for some time.'' **********The plane is already being flown by four other airlines in the United States, including Air Wisconsin, and is in service in Europe and Africa. Total orders for the plane stand at 38, and there are options to purchase 45 more. **********Mr. Barkley estimated that the new planes burned about 600 gallons of fuel an hour, compared with the Boeing 727-200's 1,550 gallons and the McDonnell Douglas Super 80's 1,100 gallons. **********PSA plans to phase out its 727's next year. According to Mr. Barkley, that would give PSA one of the most fuel-efficient fleets in the country. **********He said the fuel efficiency and fast turnaround time of the plane at airports would enable PSA to increase the frequency of its flights. PSA has 17 flights a day between Los Angeles and San Francisco, a route that in its earlier days generated much of its profits and growth. United recently increased its flights between the two cities from 15 to 24. **********Mr. Barkley said the only alternative to the BAe 146-200 would be the MD-90, a similar plane in size and fuel efficiency made by McDonnell Douglas.

The nation's top military officers also attended, in line with a new Marcos policy to have the military present at important policy-making sessions.

The expedition began in late March and is to continue until the ice breaks up in two or three months. **********The expedition, known by its acronym Cesar, is being sponsored by the Canadian Ministry of Energy, Mines and Resources to chart and explore a huge underwater mountain range that looms below the slowly creeping ice. On charts prepared by the United States Navy, the ridge covers an area larger that that spanned by the Alps. **********''The ridge is the last relatively unknown and uncharted major geological feature left in the world,'' explained Hans Weber, the camp's chief scentist. **********His reddish beard was whitened and thickened by the icicles of frozen breath. At this point only 240 miles from the North Pole, the weather has hovered during the last four days around 40 degrees below freezing. **********''We have a fantastic opportunity here to gain data we will all be analyzing for years,'' said the Swiss-born geologist whose own high level of excitement was clearly sustained by the pure challenges of pursuing new knowledge in a harsh and largely unknown environment. **********But Christopher Bunting, a spokesman for the Canadian ministry, did not hide the more practical hopes of the Canadian sponsors.  Mr. Bunting, who accompanied a small group of reporters on a 3,000-mile northward journey from Montreal, said, ''An Arctic presence is important to us if Canada is going to be competitive as a northern nation, and sovereignty is obviously one of our concerns.'' **********Mr. Bunting was alluding to several scientific tests that may establish if the Alpha Ridge is an extension of the Canadian continental shelf, or whether the chain of submerged peaks rose up in an ancient volcanic eruption. **********Under the Law of the Sea Treaty, which Canada, unlike the United States, has initialed, a nation has 10 years in which it can make a claim to an exclusive economic zone lying beyond the submerged geological extensions of its national land masses. **********The fine points of the recent treaty have not yet been tested or honed but, according to interpretations offered on the ice, it is at least technically possible for Canada, whose maple leaf flag temporarily flies here, to assert title and control over much of the Arctic, almost to the pole. At the moment, these are international waters. **********Among the key ongoing experiments whose results could enhance a Canadian claim are chemical and geological analyses of sediment and borings brought up from the Alpha crests and their comparison with samples from the shores of Canada's Arctic islands. Pieces of the Puzzle **********Also, seismic tests, movements of currents, electromagnetic flows and the gauging of relative variations in gravity are being studied in a broad survey. **********''These different approaches may supply us with different pieces of the whole puzzle of the Alpha Ridge,'' Dr. Weber said, explaining the multidisciplined effort going on in the laboratory huts and tents scattered around the ice runway. From a mound of glacial ice, 42 chimneys can be counted, each with its own comforting plume. **********After a daylong storm on Saturday in which wind-churned surface snow cut visibility to inches, and days and nights of numbing temperatures that induced grateful thoughts on duck down, some of the trespassing nonscientists wondered how anyone could feel possessive about this place. An Awesome Expanse of Ice **********The ice station lies at 85 degrees 45 minutes north latitude and 110 degrees 53 minutes west longitude. From the 42-year-old DC-3 that carried the visitors on the final, 700-mile leg from Resolute Bay, the flat, occasionally crinkled ice appears awesome in its scale but largely undifferentiated in its features. **********Mr. Bunting again expressed the long view. ''What scientists find out here could perhaps give initial indications of mineral or energy resources which could prove valuable to future generations,'' he said. **********Ruth Jackson, a 32-year-old geophysicist from Halifax who is supervising the extraction of cores and sediment from the ridge below, noted over freshly baked apple pie in the mess tent that the acquisition of Alaska by the United States was ridiculed at the time the territory was purchased from the Russians. **********Miss Jackson alluded to to current geopolitical concerns with the Arctic when she mentioned that advance warnings were given to all the interested authorities before she set off blasts to obtain seismic profiles of the slopes of the Alpha Ridge. **********''There are Soviet and U.S. submarines poking around here all the time,'' she said. A Permanent Soviet Station **********For an area that appears so remote and desolate, there is indeed quite a lot of activity going on. Just 250 miles northwest of here, the Soviet Union has a permanently staffed ice station called North Pole 25. **********Mr. Weber, the chief scientist here, has hoped to arrange exchanges of scientists with the Russians. But after some diplomatic overtures to the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa, the prospects of contact seemed remote this week. ''Even in their literature on Arctic studies the Russians don't give much away,'' Miss Jackson said. **********The Russians are apparently concentrating their efforts on the Lomonosov Ridge, another submarinal chain, which the Canadians studied in their last high Arctic expedition three years ago. The scientists here are all in agreement that the Soviet effort is far more costly, although not necessarily more sophisticated, than Cesar, which has a budget of $1.7 million in Canadian currency, or about $1.4 million in United States dollars. **********That there is also some current United States involvement in the region beyond the deployment of submarines below the ice was made clear by the receipt here of a radio message on Sunday from the crew members of a specially modified, three-engine DC-3, the only one of its kind. They sought to land here because a fuel leak. Runway Damaged by Storm **********The pilot mentioned that he was flying south from Crystal City, which scientists here explained was a small encampent at the North Pole staffed by American civilians under contract to the United States Navy. The three-engine plane, operated by a California company identified as Pol-Air, could not land here because the storm had damaged the 5,000-foot runway. **********The landing strip was bulldozed and then glazed into smoothness with water pumped from below by Canadian troops who parachuted in last month to start building this camp. **********The troops have long since gone and camp discipline now functions solely under the laws of good sense and politeness. Sources at the camp say the Crystal City plane, which operates from a United States base at Thule in Greenland, went on to land at Alert, a Canadian military base about 350 miles from here. Two Adventurers on the Ice **********In addition to such flurries of national activity, there has been concern for individual Arctic enterprises. Two adventurers, a Briton and an Italian, have taken advantage of the firm ice and what is said to be relatively good Arctic weather to begin separate journeys by foot to the North Pole. **********Although earlier rumors contended that David Hempleman-Adams, the 26-year old Briton, had radioed for a plane to take him off the ice, a message from Resolute Bay on Sunday said both Mr. Hempleman-Adams and the Italian, Ambrogio Fogar, a 41-year-old former sailor, were still heading for the top of the world after several weeks of solitary hiking. **********Their efforts coincided with the 74th anniversary of Comdr. Robert Edwin Peary's dog-sled dash to the Pole. On April 6, 1909, Commander Peary, who was escorted by Matthew Henson, wrote in his diary: ''The Pole at last! The prize of three centuries, my dream and goal for 20 years, mine at last! I cannot bring myself to realize it.'' **********During some meals at the Cesar camp, the exploits of the two contemporary walkers on the ice brought the conversation around to the old Arctic adventurers. Several of the old hands who had spent years above the Arctic Circle indicated that they could not bring themselves to realize Commander Peary's achievement. 'It Could Not Be Done' **********''You don't think that Peary really reached the pole, do you?'' Mr. Weber asked. ''No one could have traveled 50 kilometers a day with dogs as he says he did. It could not be done.'' **********Leif Lundgaarde, a 52-year-old Arctic survival expert who serves as superintendent of the camp, was similarly skeptical.  ''I just don't know how Peary could do some things he wrote, but as a Norwegian my hero was of course, Nansen,'' he said, referring to the Norwegian Arctic explorer Fridtjof Nansen. **********If the views of a new Arctic hand matter, it is hard to see how anybody could walk 50 blocks up here."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/13/world/military-aide-says-reagan-critics-damage-us-stand-in-arms-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Hedrick Smith", "pub_date": "1983-07-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 486, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MILITARY AIDE SAYS REAGAN CRITICS DAMAGE U.S. STAND IN ARMS TALKS", "print_headline": "MILITARY AIDE SAYS REAGAN CRITICS DAMAGE U.S. STAND IN ARMS TALKS", "body_text": " **********A senior Pentagon official charged today that critics who questioned President Reagan's seriousness about arms control were damaging the American position in arms negotiations. **********Richard N.

Shultz and other top officials have been emphasizing flexibility in the Administration's position to ease criticism from Congress, but Mr. Perle struck a harsher posture. He advocated firmness and castigated people who are too ready to make concessions to Moscow, evidently including some in the Administration. **********''Our national consideration of arms control matters is in danger of deteriorating into an exhange of epithets between 'good guys' and 'bad guys,' '' he said. **********''Is it a sign of seriousness to make concessions to the Soviet desire to accumulate and preserve significant advantages in nuclear weapons?'' he asked. ''Is the ease with which we abandon our objectives and make 'progress' toward an agreement - any agreement - a sign of seriousness?'' **********''The burden of advice we are receiving from many of our critics amounts to little more than that we should modify our proposals so as to permit the Soviets to retain a vastly larger strategic arsenal than the levels the Administration has proposed,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/29/business/next-dome-chief-a-financier.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas Martin", "pub_date": "1983-06-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 936, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEXT DOME CHIEF: A FINANCIER", "print_headline": "NEXT DOME CHIEF: A FINANCIER", "body_text": " **********Today's annual meeting of Dome Petroleum Ltd.  here marked the end of an era for the company that John P. Gallagher built into one of Canada's top oil and gas producers. **********Amid speeches and slides extolling the career of ''Smiling Jack'' Gallagher - so named for his courtly charm - control of the company he founded 33 years ago passed to John Howard Macdonald, a chartered public accountant whose financial skills may help end nine months of negotiations over a billion-dollar rescue plan intended to save the company from bankruptcy. **********Mr. Macdonald, now treasurer of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, will become Dome's chairman and chief executive officer on Oct. 1.  ''I've always been interested in challenge,'' said Mr. Macdonald, a Briton.  He may have come to the right place. Dome has been in trouble since its $4 billion (Canadian) purchase of the Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas Company in 1981. Because of rising interest rates, Dome was almost crushed by the burden of the debt it incurred to make that purchase. **********Although there were some indications at today's meeting that Dome is making headway in reducing its debt, analysts still perceive the company's difficulties as mainly financial. They suggest that Mr.  Macdonald's worldwide expertise in high finance may well prove helpful. **********By contrast, Mr. Gallagher was known for his pioneer drilling in the inclement Beaufort Sea and the zeal with which he proselytized these efforts to Wall Street investors. **********Mr. Gallagher will continue to serve Dome as a director and consultant. He said that the resolution of the leadership question - left dangling since he resigned as chief executive officer in April - might help bring a deal with the 56 banks Dome has been negotiating with over a rescue plan. **********''Bankers logically wanted to know who they would be dealing with,'' Mr. Gallagher said. Until Mr. Macdonald assumes control, Dome will continue to be managed by the company's executive committee. **********Dome executives suggested repeatedly today - both to the 400 shareholders who were present and at a news conference following the meeting -that talks with the banks were making progress. Because of the delicacy of the negotiations, however, they declined to provide any details. **********''Progress has been made, but with difficulty,'' said F.W.  Sellers, chairman of the executive committee.  Dome's leaders implied that negotiations were helped by falling interest rates, a better operating performance, some Government policy changes and the sale of nonessential assets. **********In the last six months Dome's debt has been reduced by $750 million, to $6.35 billion, Mr. Gallagher said.  Dome's problems result directly from its strong push to take advantage of the National Energy Plan, which was intended to increase Canadian ownership of the oil and gas industry in Canada by discriminating against foreign oil companies. **********Dome paid $4 billion of Canadian money in a two-step acquisition of the American-controlled Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas, with the purchase financed by taking on debt. This heavy debt load, when combined with soaring interest rates and plunging energy prices, pushed Dome to the brink of financial collapse. **********''We obviously reached for Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas at the wrong time and got caught,'' Mr. Gallagher said today.  Dome found itself unable to make repayments of $1.35 billion of principal due last year to four big Canadian banks. The banks and the Government in Ottawa then stepped in with a rescue package that could give them effective control of the company. **********Both the banks and the Government agreed to purchase $500 million of convertible debentures. Private shareholders could subscribe for a further $500 million of the convertible bonds. The package called for the long-term debt to be rescheduled over a period of at least 10 years. For the first 18 months, the conversion rate would be $2.50. **********Shareholders have been sharply critical of the plan for these reasons: The number of shares outstanding would be greatly diluted, control would pass to the Government and the banks, and the price of $2.50 seemed too low at a time when shares have risen greatly. **********Accordingly, Dome's officials are believed to be trying to alter the terms in the talks with the bankers, although they would not comment on whether they were trying to persuade the bankers to raise the $2.50 conversion price. For their part, bankers privately suggest that Dome still needs the money and may, in fact, not be able to avoid any of the rescue plan. **********Dome, however, makes a powerful case that it is doing a more effective job. Some $2.2 billion in assets have been sold. The office staff has been slashed 22 percent, and salaries have decreased 10 percent. **********''Within the scope of the agreements, there is ample opportunity for the company to help itself,'' said William E. Richards, the president. Moreover, luck seems to be running with the company again. a recent re-evaluation of the company's oil and gas resources indicated that they amount to 15 percent more than an estimate made less than a year ago, Mr. Richards said. **********A final factor in favor of Dome seems to be the enthusiasm shareholders feel for the company. ''I want to give Dome some money,'' David Pearce, 89 years old, said today, stirring applause.  ''If the other shareholders give $1,000, I'll give $1,000.'' **********Mr. Gallagher, smiling broadly, said, ''Thank you for your faith in Dome.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/05/business/third-worlds-700-billion-debt-posing-threat-to-richer-nations.html": {"writer_name": "H.

Developing nations in Latin America, Africa and Asia plus a number of Eastern European countries have amassed total debts of about $700 billion. A large portion of these loans cannot be paid on time. **********At stake, should a significant amount of these debts be repudiated, would be the solvency of some of the world's largest multinational banks in the United States and elsewhere. **********If losses from international lending were to trigger widespread bank failures, recovery from the longest postwar recession would be in jeopardy all over the world, as would the system of international finance that serves to channel savings from the mature industrial economies to those that are just beginning to emerge. **********''Failure to manage and diffuse these strains,'' according to the Federal Reserve's chairman, Paul A. Volcker, ''could deal a serious blow to the recovery of the United States and the world economy.''Divergent Interests **********The interests of the debtors and creditors are sharply divergent, but nonetheless so far they are cooperating in renegotiating the terms of the loans. They are finding common ground in the overriding need to get the world economy moving again. **********No one can predict the eventual outcome, but to Martin S.  Feldstein, President Reagan's chief economist, ''it is surely true, as Benjamin Franklin said in quite a different context, that 'We must all hang together, or we shall all hang separately.' '' **********Politically, the crisis over international debt is inextricably interwoven with the long-standing confrontation over distribution of the world's resources between the rich industrial nations of the Northern Hemisphere and their poor cousins in the developing world to the south. If loans were to be repudiated, and not paid, the result would be a transfer of wealth to the debtor country. **********The debtors have had to endure severe belt tightening to obtain resources to make payments on their loans. ''Unduly harsh adjustment,'' warns the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, ''would raise the risk of a moratorium on repayment of principal or interest.'' **********The crisis, which is far from resolution, is now moving into its second round. In the first round, the scope of the problem was delineated. Now bankers and borrowers are starting to wrestle with a far more difficult question: How, if at all, to repay the loans. **********As much as some individual bankers might want to pull back from the precipice of lending to developing countries, there is a consensus that more, not less, credit to these nations will be required before the world economy can recover and the loans now on the books be brought up to date. The bankers are trapped on a treadmill. **********Some critics, in fact, charge that the bankers were foolish and greedy, and have only themselves to blame for forcing money on countries that obviously could not repay. Not surprisingly, the bankers reject this charge. **********''Implicit in the criticism,'' says the head of a major New York bank, ''is that banks loaded up on loans to the developing countries, secure in the knowledge that they'd get bailed out if things went sour. It simply isn't so.'' **********If and when the crisis subsides, the critical factor is likely to be largely outside the control of either the borrowers or the lenders - namely, the strength of the world economy. As one banker put it: ''The only sure route out of this mess is through economic growth in the industrial countries.'' **********Following is a summary of the basic issues in the international debt crisis: Q. What was the origin of this problem? A. The roots of the debt crisis go back to 1973, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries began to increase the price of oil from about $3.50 a barrel to a peak of $34 in 1981 and 1982. These increases created huge financial surpluses in some of the OPEC countries and equally huge deficits elsewhere. These deficits had to be financed with borrowing. **********Q. Does the oil shock explain all the cases? A. No. Mexico, as one example, is both one of the largest debtors and, in recent years, a major oil exporter. Greatly oversimplified, the Mexicans were borrowing to develop their oil resources as well as overall economic growth. And in Poland, political upheaval compounded the difficulty of adjusting to the shock of higher oil prices and worldwide recession. **********At the same time, the accelerating inflation of the 1970's made borrowing seem attractive. Although interest rates were rising rapidly, there was always the hope that inflation would go up even faster so that loans would be repaid with depreciated currency.Banks Were Acting As Classic Middlemen **********Q. Why did the banks get involved? A. The banks played their classic role as middlemen. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, to cite three examples, deposited their surplus funds in the banks. The banks in turn lent the money to countries whose bills for imported oil were rising rapidly. **********Not only did the petrodollars have to be recycled, but also in 1979 demand for credit in the industrial countries began to slacken, reflecting the onset of worldwide recession. Moreover, bankers found the interest rates on these loans to be attractive relative to the other lending opportunities that were available at the time.  Typically rates on bank credits of this type have been linked to the fluctuating cost of short-term credit in the London-based market for dollars deposited in banks overseas. In 1980 and 1981 this rate surged to around 20 percent. **********A senior economist at a major New York bank said, ''There was a relaxed atmosphere in the late 1970's.'' In effect, he added, bankers fooled themselves into thinking that the short-term loans they were making were somehow ''safer'' and that loans to other nations were ''riskless'' because ''countries don't go bankrupt.'' **********The bankers, who were increasing their loans to developing countries at a rate of more than 20 percent annually, seemed reluctant to press the borrowing countries to tighten up. Warnings about possible future problems ''were clearly in the minority,'' said Rimmer de Vries, chief international economist at Morgan Guaranty.  ''Most monetary experts, from both public and private sectors, expressed confidence in the ability of the private banking system to continue playing the dominant role in recycling.'' **********Q. How heavily involved are the banks in overseas operations? A.  William M. Weiant, who is the chief banking analyst at the First Boston Corporation, estimates that almost half the $3.3 billion profits of the nation's 10 largest banking companies last year came from international business. Only part of these earnings came from lending to developing countries, but over the last decade the trend has been toward greater international involvement. **********During 1982, Citicorp, the nation's largest international lender, had domestic earnings of $299 million, or 40 percent of the worldwide total of $747 million. The next largest contributor was Brazil, where profits came to $153 million, or 20 percent. **********Put another way, loans to Mexico, Brazil and Argentina - many already overdue - by the nine largest American banks come to 113 percent of their total stockholders' equity. If these loans were to be repudiated, the largest banks would all be in serious trouble, and would probably require government assistance to stay open. **********Q. How big is the international debt problem? A. The staff of the International Monetary Fund in Washington, which probably has the best information on this subject, estimates that the total external debt of the 115 ''non-oil developing countries'' came to $612.4 billion at the end of 1982 and will total more than $664 billion at the end of this year. Mexico, notwithstanding its oil wealth, is arbitrarily defined by the I.@M.@F. staff as being part of the ''non-oil'' group. It is also the second-largest debtor in the crisis, after Brazil. In addition, Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union owed an estimated $81.5 billion in convertible currencies at the end of 1982. **********Q. Has all this money been lent by the banks? A. No. The banks appear to be the largest lenders, but governments and international lending agencies are also major participants. According to the I.M.F., the numbers break down this way:PU FIRST ADDFIRST ADD DEBT **********Almost $113 billion, or 18 percent of the $612 billion, was shortterm financing, primarily related to the movement of goods in international trade. The balance of roughly $500 billion is in longterm credits, of which almost two-fifths, or $193 billion, is owed to other governments or international organizations, while $306 billion was provided by private creditors. **********About two-thirds of the amount lent by private organizations, or about $202.2 billion, has been guaranteed by the recipient's government. This leaves an unguaranteed portion of $104 billion, which is the segment where bankers are concerned that their biggest losses may lie. **********Q. How many countries are in trouble? A. At last count 34 nations were seeking to ''reschedule'' - that means postpone - payments on their foreign debts. But Edward P. Neufeld, chief economist of the Royal Bank of Canada, says that ''from the point of view of the real risks to the stability of the international financial system, the problem is centered in perhaps seven countries - Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, Yugoslavia and Poland. They account for 81 percent of debt of the 24 countries engaged in private debt rescheduling.'' **********Keep in mind also that while it is convenient to talk about loans as though they were a homogenous total, this is not the case. There are tens of thousands of individual loans, each with its own terms and conditions. The common element in the debt problems of most developing countries - if there is one - is that the central bank controls the availability of hard currency, usually dollars, to service the debts. **********Q. What would happen if many of the developing countries were to repudiate their debts all at once? A. Such a development could largely wipe out the capital of many multinational banks in the industrial countries. In this event - which one banker described as an ''irresponsible doomsday scenario'' - many analysts expect that Western governments would take over the affected banks, rather than allow a general financial crisis to spread. **********At the same time, a country that repudiated its international debts would find itself cut off, not only from an influx of fresh capital, but also from access to the world banking system. Under such circumstances, bankers say, normal trade transactions would become very dificult to finance. **********Q. Could the world blunder into a general repudiation of debt? A.  The consensus among most experts is that, just because the problem has been widely analyzed, an accidental banking collapse is unlikely. In addition, bank regulators, as well as the bankers and the borrowers, are beginning to take actions designed to insure against any recurrence. **********The regulatory response is still uncertain, but the United States banking authorities have just announced new rules governing the required level of capital for 17 very large banks that the Fed has defined as being ''multinational.'' Then, too, the central banks of the industrial nations - meeting as a group - have recently clarified the ground rules concerning who would be responsible for what if one of the major banks should get into serious trouble. **********Q. Did governments encourage the banks to lend to developing countries? A. Governments all over the world not only encouraged banks under their jurisdiction to make these loans, but they participated in the process directly by lending money themselves.  The two most important reasons appear to have been a desire to soften the economic blow from higher oil prices by helping to recycle the petrodollars, and to protect export markets. The developing countries are among the largest customers for products sold by the industrial nations. **********Q. But wasn't this a colossal mistake? A. Perhaps it appears so in retrospect, but given the massive financial imbalance created by the surge in oil prices and rapid inflation, it seems improbable that the buildup in debt could have been prevented. However, there were serious errors. **********Mr. Feldstein charges that there was too much bank lending after the second oil price surge in 1979 and not enough belt-tightening by developing countries. There was too much lending, he says, to finance ''unproductive imports rather than finance productive investments that would contribute to the development process.'' **********Q. Do private bankers agree with Mr. Feldstein? A. Lewis T.  Preston, chairman of Morgan Guaranty in New York, concedes that both borrowers and lenders were slow in adjusting to the consequences of the severe drop in world commodity prices and trade. They erred, he said, in ''misjudging the capacity of sovereign countries to carry their debt in a protracted recession.'' **********Q. What role has the International Monetary Fund played? A. The I.M.F., which was formed in 1944 to stabilize the currency values of the industrial nations, has been in the forefront in dealing with the crisis of the developing nations. A 50 percent increase in the I.M.F.'s resources has been proposed, and legislation to authorize the United States's share in this increase, about $8 billion, is now working its way through Congress. **********The Fund often holds the key in specific loan negotiations. It sets the belt-tightening conditions for the debtor governments to achieve to have their debts renegotiated or to receive a loan from the I.M.F. **********In February, for instance, Brazil agreed to a strict austerity program that included a devaluation of the cruziero, cuts in the rate of inflation, government spending cuts and a reduction in the current account deficit in its balance of payments. Complex negotiations between Brazil, the Fund and the banks are now going on to determine if and when Brazil will get its next loan installment. **********Jacques de Larosiere, the former French civil servant who is now managing director of the I.M.F., admits that such economic castor oil has a nasty taste, but like any stern parent, he argues that in the long run it will be beneficial. He told the United Nations Conference on Trade and Developmnent in Belgrade this month that ''the policies undertaken in the context of a Fund program help borrowing countries to restore domestic and external balance, thus setting the right conditions for sustainable growth and giving renewed confidence to foreign creditors.''Central Banks Play Major Role in Crisis **********Q. Are central banks also involved? A. Very much so. The Federal Reserve in particular has been active in helping to head off crises by providing temporary credit, and by playing a backstage role in the complex loan negotiations. Among other things, Federal Reserve officials, including Mr. Volcker, have pushed medium-sized regional banks in the United States to continue lending to developing countries. Many of these institutions, which have only a limited commitment to international banking, tried to pull out after the crisis broke. **********According to Fritz Leutwiler, president of both the Swiss National Bank and the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, the central banks have been following two courses that ''at first sight may appear inconsistent.'' On one side, he said, they have been pressing for adequate loan loss reserves on credits already outstanding, and at the same time pressing the banks to provide ''adequate total new financing'' to these same countries. **********Clearly, the fear is that if the bankers are forced to increase their loss reserves too much - and nobody knows how much that is - they will stop lending to the developing countries. **********Q. What are the basic political issues in the international debt crisis? A. The most important controversies concern the age-old divisions between rich and poor. The developing countries, which by definition are relatively poor, argue that they are carrying a disproportionate burden as a result of the efforts of the industrial countries - the United States in particular - to control inflation.  They are already poor, and the effect of recession, high interest rates, the drop in world trade and now credit tightening by the banks has been to make them much poorer, they say. **********Q. Can a sovereign nation actually go bankrupt like a company? A.  Experts on international debt generally believe the answer to this question is ''no.'' There is no agreed-upon body of international laws that would govern such a situation, nor is there a world bankruptcy court that could order a country to make specified payments or give it immunity from future claims. The important question is whether the country is willing politically to pay its debts.PU 2D ADD DEBT2D & LAST ADD DEBT **********By the same token, says Lawrence J. Brainard, vice president of Bankers Trust Company, the concept of ''default'' has only limited meaning when it involves a sovereign government. In everyday language, he said, ''default simply means that a country is not doing what it agreed.'' **********Q. Speaking in practical, not legal, terms, how much international credit is in default? A. Nobody knows for sure. No formal, legal defaults have been declared against a sovereign government, but bankers say that for the foreseeable future the major part of the $210 billion in long-term credit extended to borrowers in Central and Latin America will have to be renegotiated. The same is true for smaller amounts in Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe. **********To deal with the lack of information, more than 100 major banks recently formed a new Institute of International Finance, based in Washington, which would act as a joint fact-finding organization. **********Q. Why have so many developing countries gotten into financial trouble all at once? A. Most experts would agree with Wilfried Guth, chairman of the Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, that the most important causes reflect ''the cumulative effect of prolonged recession, extremely high interest rates and growing protectionism in the industrialized world.'' **********The fight against inflation - which has been very successful in the last two years - has necessarily included a sharp drop in basic commodity prices. This has cut deeply into the earnings from the export of such products in many developing countries. **********There has also been a chain reaction effect. Brazil, for example, said one banker, ''is like a patient who goes to the hospital for a checkup and catches pneumonia from the guy in the next bed. They have a gross national product of nearly $300 billion, one of the dozen largest in the world. They have a reasonable balance between short-and long-term debt. But when the Argentines and the Mexicans got into trouble last summer, and the banks started cutting back on new credit, Brazil was in the soup, too.'' **********Then, too, the vast bulk of the $700 billion in the credit crisis is denominated in United States dollars. This means, according to Mr. Feldstein, that the rise in the real, inflation-adjusted, value of the dollar in the foreign exchange markets has led to a corresponding increase in the real resources that these already poor countries have to allocate to international debt service. **********Q. Will these loans ever be repaid? A. In one sense, no, and in another sense, hopefully. Bankers say there is no likelihood that the total amount of credit extended to developing countries will ever be repaid, any more than there is chance that the United States Government will ever retire its $1.2 trillion debt. As old loans are retired, new ones will be extended. **********The same principle applies to international credits. The issue is not whether Brazil as a country will ever repay the more than $80 billion that it owes to its international creditors. It probably will not. Rather, the question is whether the Brazilians - as well as other developing countries -will have sufficient earnings from their exports to service individual loans as they come due. **********Q. But what about foreign loans to the private sector? A. These are clearly different. Bankers have generally recognized that credit extended to private companies in other countries could carry higherthan-normal risk, and as economic conditions deteriorated they reflected this in increased provisions for loan losses. Last year, a sample of 160 large American banks surveyed by Robert Morris Associates, the national organization of bank credit officials, charged off almost $520 million in bad international loans, most to private borrowers. Comparable charge-offs in 1981 came to $316 million.Debt Rescheduling Modifies Terms of Loan **********Q. What is a debt rescheduling and how is it related to the problem of loan losses? A. A debt rescheduling is simply a deal to modify the terms of a loan with one or more of the following provisions: A grace period during which no payments are required; a longer maturity date; a reduced interest rate, and an additional loan that could be used for current payments or to make the required interest payments. **********The impact of such an agreement on the lenders plainly could be to cut into the flow of income from the loan. However, some of the largest banks have been able to obtain handsome fees for managing the loan renegotiations. How big the eventual effect would be on an individual bank and its stockholders is very hard to measure; that depends on the size, character and number of the concessions that are made, and what offsetting actions the bank can take in other areas. **********Arthur P. Soter, bank analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, says that ''some of these reschedulings have improved the banks' reported earnings because the stated interest rates on the loans have been increased. But over a period of time, the actual payments on these international loans have to be brought up to date, or the banks have just been fooling themselves and there will be some real losses.'' **********Q. Why don't the bankers simply cut off credit to the third world and the East bloc and stop the negotiations? A. Because it would be counterproductive to do so. There is wide agreement that the only way the debt crisis can ever be resolved satisfactorily is through economic growth - first in the industrial nations and then in the developing countries. This will require more, not less, credit. **********Q. Have any plans been proposed to try to deal with the international debt crisis in an overall way, all at once? A. Yes.  Felix G. Rohatyn, partner at Lazard Freres and chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, worries that if there is a ''unilateral repudiation'' of external debt by a major country, this could require ''drastic write-downs of the capital of many large banks, possibly impairing the capacity of several to function.'' **********Mr. Rohatyn doubts that the United States is at a point where international debts have to be restructured in such a fashion.  ''Because we don't have to do it in a crisis atmosphere,'' he says, ''I would be in favor of doing it now.'' **********Greatly oversimplified, Mr. Rohatyn's plan for dealing with the crisis calls for an exchange of the short-term loans held by the banks for long-term, low-interest paper that would be issued by a new government agency, either national or multinational. Such a swap, he says, would involve ''the recognition of significant costs and losses.'' To backstop banks that might get into trouble in such a circumstance, Mr. Rohaytn has proposed creation of an agency similar to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which aided shaky banks during the Depression. **********Q. What are the objections to this plan? A. Opposition to this approach has come from bankers and from conservatives in Congress.  William S. Ogden, who is interim chairman of the Institute of International Finance, charges that it represents a ''radical solution to a problem that does not exist.'' He says that the developing countries are not insolvent or unable to ever pay their debts, but rather are illiquid, or temporarily unable to pay.  Congressman Jerry Lewis, Republican of California, among others, is opposed to the creation of a new government agency to deal with what he sees as a temporary problem. **********Q. What is the outlook? A. There is no way to predict the final outcome of the debt crisis, but several consequences are coming into view. First, bankers, chastened by their experience of the last two years, have become much less venturesome in their international lending. Some economists are concerned that the bankers' new-found caution could put a damper on economic recovery in the developing countries. **********Second, there is pressure for governments to assume more of the lending, and hence more of the credit risk in providing financial support for the developing world. **********Finally, banking supervisors, in the United States and abroad, have received a liberal education in international banking over the last two years, and do not like everything they have learned. They plainly would like to tighten their regulations, even if they are not quite sure how to do it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/16/world/rumsfeld-is-in-cairo.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 31, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rumsfeld Is in Cairo", "print_headline": "Rumsfeld Is in Cairo", "body_text": " **********Donald H.

Seibert, called ''the only truly national department store chain in the country'' - one with big stores in major malls from coast-to-coast, and all operating under the same corporate logo. **********While other more traditional department-store chains, such as R.H.  Macy & Company and the May Department Stores Company, also have nationwide operations, their stores are run mostly under different local names. **********Most retailers do not categorize Sear's Roebuck, the nation's biggest retailer, as a department store because its sales are dominated by home furnishings. The sales mix in a typical department store is more heavily weighted toward soft goods, retailers point out. **********Penney's gamble is big, and it is not coming without some sacrifice. Some of its recent maneuvers have caused violent swings in its stock price this year, as well as somewhat lackluster sales.  Undaunted so far, the company has committed about $1 billion to remodel several hundred of its largest stores - considered the most substantial investment of its kind ever in the retailing business; it has also carved out additional space for its more upscale, highermargin clothing by dropping most of the things that made Penney Penney, including household durables, paint and hardware and automotive and auto-service centers. **********Penney has already remodeled stores in Atlanta, Columbus, Ohio, and Davenport, Iowa, which it considers prototypes for its new direction in style and content. Meanwhile, it is expanding and stengthening both its catalogue division and its financial services operation. AND while all this is going on, the company is in the midst of a m ajor management shuffle. At 60, Mr. Seibert is facing mandatory r etirement in September (see box) and will be succeeded by 4 7-yearold William R. Howell, one of the company's two vice chairmen.B ut, said Mr. Siebert, who has been the Penney chairman since 1974: ' 'I can see no change occurring from the shift in officers.'' **********Regardless of who is at the helm, by 1990 the nation's third largest retailer will be battling head to head with the big, entrenched local department store branches of such companies as Burdine's in Miami and Bamberger's in New Jersey, whose customers traditionally have tended to be young, affluent and mostly women. **********In the past, Penney's principal competition had come from mass merchandisers like Sears and K Mart, which have generally catered to a lower-income, less fashion-conscious clientele. **********Its major push, the concentration and upgrading of apparel with its greater profit potential, should do the most to enhance the company's bottom line. For example, adult female apparel in large stores typically carries a 51 percent markup, whereas appliances have a markup of about 27 percent, floorcoverings run about 43 percent and furniture ranges between 48 to 51 percent. Markup is the percentage difference between the wholesale and retail prices. **********One obvious concern, however, is Penney's ability to adequately compete with the big mall anchor stores, especially in so-called ''designer'' or name-brand clothing. ''Logistically, they can do it, but it's a question whether the consumer will perceive them the way they want,'' observed David C. Taylor, retail analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities. **********Mr. Howell, who had started with Penney as a trainee in Tulsa, Okla., in 1958, said that repositioning of its mall stores was ''a monumental undertaking. But we're very fortunate that in the 60's the company began opening stores in some of the country's top centers.  There will not be another 600 malls in which we or anyone else can open, so we have an edge.'' **********Penney's other 1,030 stores are smaller and generally located in maturing urban and suburban markets.  A niggling question remains: As the economy improves along with the consumer's spending power, will Penney's policy of offering apparel at 15 to 20 percent less than most department stores mean as much to mall customers? According to Prudential-Bache's Mr. Taylor, ''Penney's price differential won't mean as much. But, as I see it, they could not do anything else but what they are now doing.'' **********And in light of its most recent sales performance, Penney management would readily agree. Just last week, the company reported only a 7 percent increase in June sales, continuing a year-long trend of similarly small gains. Meanwhile, nearly every other major chain posted double-digit increases. Penney's lackluster showing has generally been attributed to the shift in its merchandise direction. **********The new strategy has also dramatically affected the valuation of the company's stock. This year, Penney's stock rose to 67 3/8, fell to a low of 34 3/8, and then rose again to about 60. But, according to Bruce M. Missett, security analyst for Oppenheimer & Company, New York, because Penney earned a disappointing $5.87 a share last year, its stock in 1983 is being valued by investors at only about 10 times earnings; the overall Standard & Poor 500 index has a price-earnings multiple of 14. BUT Penney's financial woes have earlier roots. Its profit margin o n sales has been erratic in the last decade, variously reaching a bove 3 percent but mostly falling below it. Its return on equity, w hich management considers perhaps the key measure of performance, h it a high of 15.2 percent in 1972, but declined to as low as 10 p ercent before recouping to 14.7 percent last year. During this p eriod, it slowed its expansion pace and soon surrendered its r anking as the nation's second-biggest retailer - after Sears - to K M art. **********Profits, too, have been erratic since the mid-70's. But in 1982, Penney posted record profits of $430 million from continuing operations, up from $393 million the year before. Last year's sales also rose to a record $11.4 billion, though it was only 2 percent above 1981 figures. **********In the last few years, concerned with its sales slowdown, the company surveyed mall customers and found that for most major items of apparel, shoppers went to the mall's anchor department store. In an effort to correct this, the apparel upgrading program was launched in the mid-70's and has picked up steam ever since - while some of the low priced goods on which Penney made its reputation have been retained. **********Mr. Seibert said the company's survey also found that department stores were getting 17 customer visits a year versus only nine at Penney's. ''Think what would happen if we could narrow the gap. If we could get just one more $20 sale from each of our customers, it would boost our sales by more than $2 billion. Opportunities don't come much bigger than that.'' **********As of Sept. 1, however, it will be Mr. Howell who will try to turn these opportunities into black ink. At the same time, the company's Office of the Chairman, created in 1981 as a training ground for future leaders at Penney, will be expanded to five members from three. **********Will the change in command make a perceptible difference? ''It is very tough to see whose stamp in any big company is precisely on what,'' said Mr. Missett of Oppenheimer. ''But my impression is that Mr. Howell is a strong man with a definite sense of where Penney is going. It remains to be seen what kind of an executor he is.'' **********One thing, however, is clear: Mr. Howell, like Mr. Seibert, has complete confidence in Penney's current game-plan. And they both concede that the department store competition has larger individual stores and a long, built-in clientele. But Penney, they say, has many more stores and will have far more selling space allocated to apparel than it ever had before. **********''I think that Penney's can do it,'' said Walter K. Levy, a retail marketing consultant in New York. ''They have already made their stores look like department stores and customers see them in a department-store context.'' PENNEY'S thrust to assume the premiere, national department store r ole is not the only one in Mr. Seibert's legacy. The company is alsos triving for continued expansion in its catalogue division and in itsf inancial services operation. ''The catalogue business, now a ccounting for about 15 percent of total Penney's sales, is growing f aster than our retail sales,'' said David F. Miller, executive vice p resident. As a result, Penney opened a sixth distribution center l ast year in Manchester, Conn., and updated a new point-of-purchase c omputer system. **********As for financial services, Penney's already offers life, health and casualty insurance through many of its stores and by direct marketing. And in May, it opened Family Financial Centers in five Northern California stores. The centers are a a joint venture with First Nationwide Savings and Loan of California that provide a range of banking services, including consumer loans and discount brokerage advice, said Thomas J. Lyons, a Penney's executive vice president. **********But probably nothing that the company has done recently has drawn more attention than its announcement about Halston. Mr. Seibert, speaking recently at the American Museum of Natural History, where 1,000 viewed the new line, hailed the introduction of the collection as ''one of the most important events in Penney's history.'' **********But last week, Bergdorf Goodman, a key Halston retail account, said it would discontinue Halston's ready-to-wear and cosmetics lines because of the designer's licensing deal with Penney. Bergdorf's president and chief executive officer, Ira Neimark, asserted, ''We decided that designers, as well as retailers, have to decide who their customers are and proceed in that direction. Halston made his decision and we have made ours.'' **********When asked for comment, Halston said that he thought there was room for ''everyone in retailing'' and he hoped that ''a solution agreeable to all can still be worked out.'' Mr. Neimark said flatly, ''That's not possible. It is all over.'' **********For Penney, the Halston-Bergdorf flap will probably figure as no more than a slight blip on its corporate strategy screen. The stakes in Penney's push are just too big. And perhaps nothing indicates this more than the huge red banner with bold block lettering draped in front of its New York headquarters. It says simply: HALSTON III, J.C. PENNEY.   AND AFTER RETIREMENT?A DIFFERENT TUNE **********Donald V. Seibert, who will wind up a 36-year career with the J. C. Penney Company when he retires in September, sat last week in his office staring at a Telex video display terminal. The chairman was studying information on weekly store sales and the daily news summary. Occasionally, he deftly tapped out a message on the keyboard. **********But this fall he will be sitting before an entirely different instrument.  Reverting to a pursuit he was drawn to as a youth in his hometown of Hamilton, Ohio, and has enjoyed over the years, Mr. Seibert will compose music for the church. ''I like to write anthems and 'introits', which are short selections for a chorus,'' he said. **********Before joining Penney in 1947 after studying at the University of Cincinnati, Mr. Seibert took music lessons, intending to be either a musician of ''serious jazz'' or a classical clarinet player. ''But I learned when I was quite young that you made more money if you played either the saxophone or the piano,'' he said. ''So I took up both.'' But in a few years, he learned, there was money to be made in business. **********Music was not, however, his first or only calling in his early days. As a 15-year-old, he had ''a little printing business'' and, along with another little boy, publishing a tiny local newspaper called ''The Weekly Noose.'' The two boys listened to the latest news on the radio, then set it into type and printed it on a miniature printing press, often delivering the paper to neighbors' homes before the town's ''real'' newspapers did. **********Mr. Seibert will continue to serve on five boards, all at New Yorkbased companies, and will remain active in several nonprofit activities. He says that he and his wife, Verna, will ''of course'' continue to live at their home in Murray Hills, N.J., where they have been since 1960. **********''I am looking forward to a happy blend of activity, with more personal time with my wife,'' he said. And with some background music, too, it might be added."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/04/business/briefs-017306.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 557, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt Issues *********** BEHR Venture Partners Ltd., a California limited partnership formed to conduct research and development with 12 new products being developed by other companies, filed for an initial public offering of 6,450 units of limited partnership interest, to be priced at $5,000 each, through Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards.

No Plans for Partition **********According to Israeli officials, Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir told Mr. McFarlane that Israel stood behind its many declarations that it does not intend that Lebanon be partitioned. **********The two men met this morning in Jerusalem for an hour before Mr. McFarlane went to Tel Aviv to see Defense Minister Moshe Arens. **********According to Israeli officials, both Mr. Shamir and Mr. Arens reiterated Israel's statements that it would withdraw all of its forces from Lebanon only when Syrian and Palestine Liberation Organization troops in the country also leave. **********''Shamir also said, 'Listen, we are ready to clarify this stand of ours directly to the Lebanese Government,' '' an Israeli official said.

Power & Associates, an industry consultant, found that only 7 percent of new-car buyers this year think they might be interested in purchasing a turbocharged vehicle. **********Company officials acknowledge that their combined sales goal of 300,000 turbo-equipped cars is ambitious. Nevertheless, the units are an important part of the marketing strategy of both the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation this model year. **********\"The long-term potential for turbocharging is not those folks who will buy a Mustang with a turbo option,\" said Ford's general marketing manager, Thomas J. Wagner. \"It's getting people that would never buy a turbocharged car to understand what turbocharging is all about, and that it is a very viable product for the wife of the chariman of the board.\" **********Turbocharging has a number of advantages that the auto companies will push heavily in the next 12 months. **********The devices increase engine power on demand by forcing more air and fuel into each cylinder at higher than normal pressures. This increase in pressure causes the fuel to burn more efficiently and produces more power - 50 percent more in the case of the Ford EXP subcompact, for example, to 120 horsepower from 80. **********A turbo model also has a profit advantage for the dealers and car companies. The equipment package, which usually includes heavy-duty suspension and high-performance tires, can add as much as $2,000 to the price of a car. Although the companies will not reveal their margins, they do acknowledge that the accessories substantially incrase their profit on turbocharged models. **********Ford and Chrysler - with only three American-made engines each - have a special interest in promoting turbochargers because the units allow a power plant to be used several different ways, creating a range of profitable new models with a minimum of investment. **********During the 1984 model year, both companies plan to market some 20 turbocharged cars, ranging from the Escort subcompact to the more luxurious Chrysler New Yorker. In the 1983 yeear, Ford offered three turbo models while Chrysler had none. **********G.M., with 14 American-built powerplants, is taking a quieter approach to turbocharging. It will offer the option on only four cars in the 1984 model year - specialty versions of the Buick Skyhawk, Regal, Riviera and the Pontiac 2000. Last year, only the Regal and Riviera had the option. **********\"It's an important element in Buick's strategy to attract new customers, but we don't plan to sell turbos in volume,\" said Lloyd E. Reuss, general manager of G.M.'s Buick Division. **********G.M. estimates that it will deliver about 23,500 turbo models in 1984, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade publication. Ford and Chrysler, however, plan a much more ambitious 125,000 apiece. Some analysts think the Ford and Chrysler projections may be unrealistic. **********\"They sound awfully high to me,\" said David Healy, auto industry analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York. \"But as gasoline prices have come down and the economy and personal income have improved, people are more willing to consider buying these performance options. It goes with the recovery.\" **********Foreign auto makers have used the concept successfully on expensive sports models like the Porsche 924 and Datsun 280 ZX, and sales of imported turbo models have grown from about 20,000 in 1980 to more than 80,000 last year. **********But American auto makers have had less luck with turbocharging. G.M. and Ford introduced the systems in the late 1970's on a limited number of models. Initially successful, thanks in part to a steep rise in gasoline prices, deliveries during 1979 totaled about 100,000 units. **********But the early units quickly developed problems and, by the 1982 model year, sales fell to about 3,000 units. The units were unreliable and few customers or dealers understood how they worked. The additional engine pressure and higher temperatures required by turbocharging required frequent oil changes, sometimes as often as every 3,000 miles. And many customers ignored the service instruction, ruining their engines. **********The experience soured many dealers and customers on the systems. Even though the auto companies and their suppliers have spent millions in the last three years refining the turbocharging process, executives admit it won't be easy to resell the systems to a suspicious public. **********To pave the way for the new models, the auto companies this year began their marketing campaigns with dealers. Chrysler and Buick sent prototype units to their field offices for evaluation and training. And Ford created a 102-page manual on the Thunderbird turbo model especially for its sales force. **********\"There's resistance there,\" said George L. Lowe, specialty car market plans manager for Ford Division. \"People are naturally concerned about things they don't understand.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/20/world/the-marines-in-lebanon-a-year-of-changing-role.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 263, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Chronology", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARINES IN LEBANON: A YEAR OF CHANGING ROLE", "print_headline": "THE MARINES IN LEBANON: A YEAR OF CHANGING ROLE", "body_text": " **********Following is a chronology of the use of Marine forces in Lebanon: Aug. 20, 1982 - President Reagan orders 800 marines to participate in three-nation force, with French and Italian forces, to insure order during evacuation of Palestinian and Syrian fighters from Beirut after Israeli siege of the city.

O'Neill Jr.  traded angry accusations today over whose policies were hurting the middle class. **********Mr. Reagan, speaking to the National Federation of Independent Business, said the Democrats were shedding ''an ocean of crocodile tears'' over Federal deficits and were seeking to impose a ''graveyard philosophy'' of higher taxes and spending. **********The Democrats, he said, were practicing ''the politics of envy'' and were trying to pit one group against another with their proposal to place a ceiling on the tax cut so that families in higher tax brackets would benefit relatively less. **********''It takes a great leap of faith to trust the motivation and wisdom of the self-proclaimed champions of fairness who are now attacking the middle class,'' Mr. Reagan declared. ''The tax 'cap' is not a fairness bill. It's a jobs-destruction bill. It would cut off our nose to spite our face.'' **********After Mr. Reagan's speech, Mr. O'Neill retorted that the limit was ''a long overdue step toward fairness'' aimed at overcoming the ''windfall for the rich'' that he said came from the tax cut. The 10 percent cut in income tax rates scheduled July 1 is the third and last step in a rate reduction that began with a 5 percent cut on Oct. 1, 1981, and was followed by a 10 percent cut on July 1, 1982. **********Mr. O'Neill accused Mr. Reagan of distorting statistics in attacking the Democrats' tax program, and he added: ''The hardworking people of this country do not want crocodile tears or cook-up numbers. They want a fair shake. They want the rich to bear the burden as well as the benefits of Reaganomics.'' **********The sharp words between the President and the Speaker set the stage for a showdown that the Democrats, at least, hope to use as ammunition between now and the 1984 election. **********Although Mr. O'Neill predicted that the tax cut limit would be approved by the House Thursday and had a good chance of passing in the Senate, few expect it to be able to survive Mr. Reagan's promised veto. Thus the debate was an attempt by each side to use the symbolism of the issue. Saving Would Be Held to $720 **********The bill now calls for a maximum tax saving of $720, depending on the tax status of the filer. This means that a married couple, one of whom works, with two dependents and $46,000 or more of gross income would not get the full benefit of the tax-rate cut. **********Democrats in the House estimate that their plan would limit the tax cut for about eight million families and that more than half of them make more than $50,000 a year. But nearly 90 percent of the revenue yielded by the limit would come from families making more than $50,000, according to these calculations. Thus the Democrats view the proposal as punishing those in the upper income brackets. **********Mr. Reagan asserted today, however, that ''capping the third year of the tax cut won't soak the rich, but it will drown millions of taxpayers in the middle class.'' He said a working married couple making ''just over $35,000 in taxable income'' would be pushed from a 33 percent tax bracket into a 37 percent bracket by the Democratic plan. Effects of Inflation Noted **********''I question whether that couple, working to make ends meet, would consider itself rich,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''Let's remember that, just to keep up with inflation, that couple had to double its income in the last 10 years. The couple which earns $35,000 is no more wealthy today than when it earned $16,000 in 1973.'' **********Mr. O'Neill responded that Mr. Reagan was ''playing with the numbers.'' The Speaker said: ''He spoke today of a two-earner family making $35,000 a year that he said would be 'drowned' by the cap. The fact is, just 2 percent of those in that income category will be affected. These are people who do not itemize or have few or no dependents.  They are not a fair example, and the President knows it.'' **********Mr. Reagan also noted that it was the Democrats, not his Administration, who took a key step in 1981 that benefited wealthy people. He was referring to a Democratic amendment, eventually signed into law, that reduced the maximum tax rate on investment income to 50 percent from 70 percent. Tactics That Proved Futile **********The Democrats had advocated the cut in the maximum tax rate in what turned out to be a futile attempt to defeat Mr. Reagan's overall program. **********''Funny how they all forgot about that,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''Well, I haven't forgotten about it because I think it was a great thing to do.'' **********Much of the President's speech was devoted to a spirited, and even spiritual, defense of capitalism and the profit motive.  Speaking of a businessman's willingness to risk his money for investment, Mr. Reagan said business ''works best, creates the greatest wealth and produces the most progress for all'' when it follows ''the teachings of Scripture: Give, and you will be given unto. Search, and you will find. Cast your bread upon the waters, and it will return to you manyfold.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/27/world/belfast-mp-visiting-london.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 293, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BELFAST M.P.

No further details were given. **********Differences Reported Unresolved **********Mexican and American officials indicated after the meetings that longstanding differences over the region remained largely unresolved.  These differences center on Mexico's support for the Sandinist Government of Nicaragua and its recognition of the leftist rebels in El Salvador as a legitimate political force. The United States has sought some form of pressure by Mexico on Nicaragua to blunt what officials say is its export of terrorism to other Central American countries. **********Mr. Shultz, speaking to reporters tonight on a refueling stop at Tampico Airport, said that he saw ''some encouragement'' in Mexico's position toward Nicaragua. Discussing his meetings with Mr.  Sepulveda, Mr. Shultz said: ''He does see as important the cessation of arms from one country to another. That's really what's taking place from Cuba and Nicaragua to El Salvador.'' **********Another source of contention has been Mexico's insistence that all foreign involvement in the area stop. According to United States officials, Mr. Shultz told Mr. Sepulveda that the Reagan Administration was determined ''to continue to support friends and allies and be engaged in the area until a peaceful solution can be achieved.'' **********United States officials sought tonight to play down the differences. One official said the United States and Mexico differed more on means than ends. **********But other officials, both American and Mexican, conceded that essential differences over Central America marked the talks, at which the United States maintained that Nicaragua was a central source of subversion in Central America and was providing major help to the Salvadoran guerrillas. 'Results Will Be Seen in Actions' **********A Mexican diplomat said Monday night that both sides sought ''mutual comprehension in our outlooks in Central America.'' ''The results will be seen in actions, not words,'' he said.  What the two sides appeared to agree on, diplomats said, was the need for some form of regional approach.  Tonight, Mr. Sepulveda flew to Panama to join eight other foreign ministers from the region for a two-day meeting. Asked about the gathering, Mr. Shultz said at a news conference, ''We hope they will succeed.'' **********''The key to this meeting,'' Mr. Shultz went on, ''is that all five Central American countries will be there,'' which he called ''a recognition of the basic fact that the issues are regional.'' **********Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan and Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldridge, who were here with Mr. Shultz, discussed with Mexican officials trade and economic issues.

He noted that Mexico, the third largest customer for American exports, bought about $12 billion in United States products last year compared with $18 billion in 1981. **********''We're trying to see what can be done to encourage more trade,'' he said.  Mr. Regan said Mexico was ''definitely'' succeeding in adopting the austerity measures imposed by the International Monetary Fund to gain a $3.9 billion emergency loan last year. The loan was crucial to help tide over Mexico - the largest source of United States oil imports - when it faced default on its $80 billion foreign debt. The largest part of the debt is owed to United States banks. **********''Had they failed,'' Mr. Regan said, ''the hit to our banks would have been awesome.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/07/business/commodities-oil-futures-and-global-disruptions.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 904, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Commodities; Oil Futures And Global Disruptions", "print_headline": "Commodities; Oil Futures And Global Disruptions", "body_text": " **********NOWHERE is the disarray in the global petroleum market more visible than in the heating oil and gasoline futures trading pits of the New York Mercantile Exchange. **********Not only have the futures prices reflected the sharp drop in oil prices this winter. Last week they also showed that unless the oil refiners take measures to halt the rising surpluses of fuel, their operating losses will be even greater than they have been. **********Last Friday one major refiner, the Exxon Corporation, decided to take action and raised its wholesale price of heating oil by 2 cents a gallon, to 81.5 cents, despite the fact that all big integrated oil companies have been benefiting from the recent price cutting among the contentious members of OPEC as well as among suppliers who do not belong to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. **********The price increase seemed an anomaly but traders said, in effect, that Exxon had decided to recover its earlier high crude oil costs regardless of the risk of driving away customers. **********Exxon's move caused the spot March futures to rally 1.30, to 75.65 cents, leaving the contract showing a gain of 0.44 cent on the week.  But the near March futures are still well below the 97.25 cents of last Oct. 1, when most retailers had completed ordering for the winter, and the 95 cents posted Nov. 1, the nominal start of the winter heating season. **********''Obviously, the uncommonly mild winter, the recession, consumer conservation and an increase in non-OPEC oil supplies all contributed to the decline in cash and futures prices this season,'' said Steven Errera, president of Energy Futures Inc. ''But the same factors have caused the big oil companies to sustain huge refinery operating losses, which they may not want to let continue much longer,'' he said yesterday. **********In fact, Mr. Errera pointed out, ''It is more profitable today for many refiners to buy heating oil and gasoline on the open market for resale to their customers than to buy crude oil and refine it.'' **********The reason: The market prices of oil products have fallen to levels that make refining uneconomical in this country.  As a rule of thumb, a 42-gallon barrel of crude will yield the following products: 44 percent gasoline, 21 percent in No. 2 grade distillate heating oil, 11 percent in No. 6 and other heavy industrial heating oils, 5 percent in jet fuel, 3 percent in petrochemical feed stocks, 2 percent in asphalt and the remainder in other products. **********Although each refiner has a different mix, the bulk of the refined products - heating oils and gasoline -must be profitable to offset the cost of the raw petroleum and any losses that may be incurred in selling the byproducts. **********According to Mr. Errera's calculations, which were supported by several other oil specialists last week, a $30 barrel of crude is worth less today than the value of all the products extracted from it. Mr. Errera explained: **********''If the average mid-America refiner gets crude at $28 or $28.50 a barrel, it would have to sell heating oils today at between 80 and 82 cents a gallon and gasoline at 81 to 83 cents in order to break even. Last Friday, the cash price for No. 2 heating oil in New York harbor was 78 cents, with leaded regular grade gasoline at 80 cents.  However, cash prices for both fuels have been selling at discounts, which may deepen if retailers can not dispose of heating oil to make room for the gasolines they have ordered for the motoring season.'' **********With the winter two thirds over and the motoring season still a few months away, refiners are not getting anywhere near these break-even prices, Mr. Errera said. **********''Crude would have to be priced at $25 a barrel for most refiners to show profits on today's product mix,'' he said. ''Thus, we may yet see prices move up, surplus supplies or not, until the cheaper wellhead crude prices refiners are now paying move through the industry's pipelines.'' **********Joel Faber, president of a energy futures brokerage house bearing his name, agreed. He noted: ''The oil futures market has been sagging in recent weeks because buyers are waiting for all the cheaper prices they read about to work through the industry's product mixes. How much further will crude prices drop? It depends on each refiner's product mix, competitive factors, how friendly the refiners want to remain with their crude oil suppliers and other imponderables.'' **********While futures traders wait, they have been increasingly engaging in spreading operations, he said. ''The most popular spread today is to buy May heating oil and sell May gasoline, because many think the price spread in favor of leaded gasoline is too wide, despite the seasonal factor,'' he added. **********Last Friday, May heating oil futures closed at 72.89 cents a gallon and May leaded gasoline at 79.72 cents.  Because the gasoline pricing situation has been far less clear than that of heating oil in recent weeks, trading in gasoline futures has soared. Last month, for example, the open interest in leaded gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange was 6,782 contracts, up more than fourfold from January 1982, while the volume jumped a similar amount, to 22,900 contracts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/02/world/the-un-today-june-2-1983-general-assembly.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 80, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

H. Robertson published a little book in 1922 called ''Money'' that made him famous because of his use of quotations from Lewis Carroll's ''Alice'' books as chapter headings. **********The connection between Alice in Wonderland and economics was no accident, no mere whimsy on Robertson's part. Lewis Carroll, who was a professor of mathematics and a most original logician, knew the slipperiness and arbitrariness of applying words and scientific models to the confusion of the social world. **********Carroll in fact appears to have been an amateur of economics. In the first chapter of ''Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There,'' he writes that Alice had never in all her life seen such a face as the White King made ''when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand'' - an ironic reference no doubt to Adam Smith's most famous metaphor. Kings, presidents and the rest of us are still astonished or even outraged when we discover what the invisible hand of the market can do to us in working its miracles. **********Since Professor Robertson is no longer alive, it must fall to other hands to demonstrate to rising generations the continued relevance of ''Alice'' to economics. Here are some notes on the meaning of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' today: **********It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: There was a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore. **********Useful for the coming meeting in Washington of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. All the countries, debtor and creditor, are in the Pool of Tears together. Somebody (the United States) must lead them out of it. But that is not to say that the others will listen to the leader. When the bedraggled creatures gathered ashore for a consultation on how to dry out, the Lory, a small parrot, turned sulky and would only say to Alice, ''I am older than you, and must know better.'' **********''The cause of lightning,'' Alice said very decidedly, for she was quite sure about this, ''is the thunder - no, no!'' she hastily corrected herself, ''I meant the other way.'' ''It's too late to correct it,'' said the Red Queen: ''When you've once said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences.'' **********Once the financial markets are convinced that the growth of the money supply determines the growth of the economy, that fixes it, and there is no point in trying to regulate anything but the money supply. Similarly, once you say that deficits don't cause inflation, don't cause high interest rates, in short don't matter, you can't say deficits do matter and start raising taxes. It's too late; you must take the consequences. **********Well, then the books are something like our books, only the words go the wrong way. **********Everything is reversed now that we are on the other side of the looking glass. A strong recovery is bad for the stock market, a weak recovery is good for the stock market. For with a strong recovery, the Federal Reserve will have to tighten the money supply and interest rates will rise, but with a weak recovery, the Fed can ease up and interest rates will decline. **********''Will you walk a little faster?'' said a whiting to a snail. ''There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.'' **********Unless the European economies grow faster, unemployment will increase, because productivity is rising and the labor force is growing faster than real output. This is a better quotation than the one about Alice's running to stay in the same place, for the level of unemployment, with different rates of real economic growth, may increase, decrease or remain the same. **********'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves **********Did gyre and gimble in the wabe. **********Explaining the poem ''Jabberwocky,'' Humpty Dumpty said a word like slithy, meaning lithe and slimy, was a ''portmanteau - there are two meanings packed into one word.'' **********Hence, stagflation - stagnation plus inflation. The important thing is to see stagflation as one state, not two states, requiring a different treatment from stagnation or inflation alone. Robert Triffin, professor emeritus at Yale, prefers a different portmanteau: infession, a combination of inflation and recession, suggesting a different diagnosis, with inflation coming first. ''When I use a word,'' Humpty Dumpty said, ''it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less.'' **********'' 'Tis so,'' said the Duchess, ''and the moral of that is, 'Oh, 'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round.' '' **********''Somebody said,'' Alice whispered, ''that it's done by everybody minding their own business!'' **********''Ah, well! It means much the same thing,'' said the Duchess. **********More economic philosophy by Adam Smith out of, as they say at the race track, Ronald Reagan. Champions of the poor, blacks, women and the jobless disagree. This could be a major issue in the electoral campaign of 1984. **********This barely scratches the surface of what Lewis Carroll has to offer political economy.

He was recently elected to head the Nicaraguan Episcopal Conference, which governs the Roman Catholic Church here. **********The other opposition leader is Enrique Bolanos Geyer, who has been chosen to head the country's largest business organization. Both have shown themselves to be adroit activitists and critics of the Sandinista Government. **********'The Right People' **********''We sense that the moment of definition of the revolution is coming soon,'' said Ramiro Gurdian, a businessman who helped Mr. Bolanos win election as head of the Superior Council of Private Enterprise. ''We want to be sure we have the right people in there throwing the ball.'' **********Mr. Bolanos is known here as an outspoken anti-Communist who, unlike many Nicaraguan businessmen, has never supported the Sandinista movement. In the months since he has taken over the Superior Council it has become one of the main centers of opposition to the Government. **********When the Sandinistas asked a variety of opposition leaders last month to testify about how ''Yankee aggression'' was affecting them, many were ready to accept. But Mr. Bolanos persuaded them not to do so, arguing that the limitations on subject matter and the low level of the commission that would hear the testimony constituted an insult to the opposition. **********When the Government invited Nicaraguan exiles to return home through a decree issued two weeks ago, Mr. Bolanos was quick to argue that the decree was in no sense an amnesty since it offered no guarantees of security to anyone who took advantage of it. His sharply worded statement was published in full in La Prensa, the opposition newspaper.   Testing the Sandinistas **********Mr. Bolanos's newest idea is to test the Sandinistas' proclaimed policy of dialogue by asking that the Superior Council be permitted to sponsor a daily program on radio and a weekly one on television in which political and economic topics would be discussed. At present, independent radio news programs function under censorship, and the opposition has no access to television. **********''The goals have changed,'' Mr. Bolanos said in an interview. ''There was a time when we thought we could make the Sandinistas come fairly close to their original Government programs. But now they have made very clear that they are Marxist-Leninists who are moving toward creating a totalitarian state.'' **********The coordinator of the Nicaraguan junta, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, was asked about his Government's commitment to Marxism in a recent interview and replied: ''We do not use cliches, and we do not accept that cliches should be imposed upon us. Our roots are profoundly Nicaraguan, though we do not deny our relationship with the universal ideology.'' **********Mr. Bolanos represents a significant number of businessmen who, though disaffected, have chosen to remain in Nicaragua. On his wall is a poster carrying an outline map of Nicaragua and the legend, ''I Need You, Don't Abandon Me.''  'Setting an Example' **********''We have the moral credibility to speak out because we have remained here,'' Mr. Bolanos said. ''Our counterparts in Cuba fled, and that did not work. We are setting an example for many people who might otherwise give up hope. And we give our employees more freedom than they have in government enterprises, since they do not have to perform guard duty or follow any political line.'' **********Bishop Vega, who at 64 is 9 years older than Mr. Bolanos, is a critic of a different sort. **********''We are not a political opposition,'' he said recently, ''we are believers in any regime based on Christian values. In Nicaragua today, people feel an excessive control and are unable to realize their full human potential. **********''Much of the creative dynamism of the revolution has been lost,'' the Bishop went on, ''and it has been replaced by a scheme imposed from outside. The church in Latin America has a great radical potential and can be more revolutionary than any political movement because it is interested in human liberation, not power.''  News Conference Creates a Stir **********Bishop Vega, who in October replaced Archbishop Miguel Obando y Bravo as president of the Episcopal Conference, impressed many Nicaraguans who had barely heard of him with his statements at his first news conference last month. Copies of the transcript are circulating in religious and diplomatic circles. **********Asked by a pro-Sandinista reporter whether he was firmly opposed to a foreign invasion of Nicaragua, Bishop Vega replied, ''The church rejects any invasion, whether it is an ideological invasion through repressive violence or whether it is an armed, military intervention.'' **********He also repeated the hierarchy's criticism of the so-called popular church, whose priests function independently and, in Nicaragua, support the Sandinista Government. **********''What is called the 'popular church' is neither popular nor a church,'' he said. ''It is not a church because it does not lead to God, and it is not popular because it is allied with power instead of man.'' **********Both Mr. Bolanos and Bishop Vega have emerged at a time when the Sandinista Government is seeking to show a commitment to democracy. They have taken advantage of the freer climate that has lately prevailed in Nicaragua to press their criticism of the Government.   Opposition Weak and Fragmented **********Opposition political parties in Nicaragua are small and weak, and they have not managed to unite behind a common program. For this reason, the actions of anti-Government activists in the church and the private sector, together with those of La Prensa, are the principal forms of opposition in Nicaragua. **********Mr. Bolanos and Bishop Vega have never met, but a Latin diplomat who knows both of them said they complement each other. **********''One represents political opposition, the other speaks from a spiritual point of view,'' the diplomat said.

The price will start at $21,000 for a basic unit with 128 thousand characters of internal memory and 30 million characters of disk storage. A large unit, with 512,000 characters of memory and 400 million characters of disk storage, will sell for $62,000. With printers and displays added, a total large installation might sell for as much as $176,000, I.B.M. said.

STUDY SEES SLOWER GROWTH IN POPULATION", "print_headline": "U.N. STUDY SEES SLOWER GROWTH IN POPULATION", "body_text": " **********A worldwide effort to limit population growth is beginning to achieve results, according to a United Nations study. **********The report, issued Thursday by the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, said the rate of population increase since 1965 will have fallen by 16.7 percent by 1985. **********From 1965 to 1970 the number of people in the world increased by 2.4 percent a year, the study said. In contrast, it said, the rate of increase is expected to be 2 percent a year for the years 1980 to 1985. **********The study predicted that global population would continue to grow until the end of the 21st century and then stabilize at 10.2 billion people, or more than twice the current total of 4.6 billion. 'The Notion of Having Fewer' **********The executive director of the United Nations agency, Rafael M.  Salas of the Philippines, said the pace of population gains had slowed because ''the notion of having fewer children has spread to the developing countries.'' National programs urging small families are exerting an influence, he said. **********The Fund for Population Activities, which is supported by voluntary contributions from United Nations members, provides technical aid to nations that operate family-planning programs. The fund issues annual studies on world population growth. **********Mr. Salas said the idea of smaller families had been ''largely accepted in the largest countries, India and China,'' whose people make up 40 percent of the world's population. He said the growth in China's population was now 1.5 percent and, in India's, close to 2 percent. **********Rising income levels have reduced the pressure on families in the developing world to have children as an insurance against old age, he said. In addition, better health services have reduced the rate of infant mortality, he said, thus decreasing the need for many births.  Finally, more women are entering the labor force in the third world and have less time to give to infants. A Gap Between Rich and Poor **********The report said the number of infants who die in their first year had fallen sharply around the world although there was still a huge gap between rich and poor countries. **********Among industrial nations, infant mortality has fallen from 56 in every 1,000 births in 1950 to 19 in 1980. Over the same period in developing countries the rate has dropped to 100, from 164, and is now estimated at 90. This still means 10 million infant deaths yearly in Asia, Africa and Latin America. **********In 1974 the fund organized a conference that set targets for, among other things, life expectancy in rich and poor nations. Next year another conference, to be held in Mexico City, is due to hear that the targets are not being met, Mr. Salas said. **********Participants at the 1974 meeting spoke of hopes that the average life span would increase to 62 years by 1985 and 74 years at the end of the century. Instead, Mr. Salas said, life expectancy is expected to reach 59.2 years in 1985 and 63.9 in the year 2000. **********''Economic development hasn't kept up to provide the medical and health facilities needed for longer life and reduced infant mortality,'' he said. The Key to Leveling Off **********The report singled out smaller families and fewer births as the key to leveling off population. In birth statistics, once again there were vast differences between rich and poor. Third-world rates of 33 births per 1,000 population are more than twice the 16 births per 1,000 people in industrial nations. **********However, the rate is dropping among the poor, the study said. From 1970 to 1975 it averaged 37 births per 1,000 population and it is expected to fall to 31.4 in the years 1980 to 1985. **********The growth of population in the third world, even at a slower rate, is too much for the available food. By the end of the century, developing countries may have 441 million more people than they can feed. But this problem could be eased, the United Nations report said, with greater use of fertilizer, pesticides and high-yielding seeds."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/24/business/business-people-a-chief-executive-elected-by-g-w.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1983-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 325, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A CHIEF EXECUTIVE ELECTED BY G.& W.", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; A CHIEF EXECUTIVE ELECTED BY G.& W.", "body_text": " **********Martin S.

Trade and Economic Council, an organization of American companies and Soviet enterprises, after President Reagan said he would keep agricultural exports free of sanctions and boycotts. **********Clustered in a 5,500-square-yard pavilion in Moscow's Sokolniki Park, a diverse group of exhibitors that included International Harvester, John Deere, Dow Chemical, Monsanto, Ralston Purina and the state of Nebraska set up their slide shows, samples, snack bars and pamphlets to attract a share of the billions of dollars that Moscow is expected to spend on its crash ''food program.'' The program was started 18 months ago by the late Leonid I. Brezhnev and accelerated by his successor as Soviet leader, Yuri V. Andropov. **********The goal of the food program, as Mr. Brezhnev put it, was ''to have adequate food and fodder resources of our own which would put us beyond the reach of chance.'' The creation of agricultural associations at various governmental levels is the centerpiece of the program. **********The political significance of the exhibition, after the strains between the two countries in the last few years, was evident in references by speakers to the long gap since the last American show, an oil and gas exhibition in 1977, and in veiled questions about the United States' reliability as a trade partner. **********The senior American spokesman, Dwayne O. Andreas, chairman of the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company of Decatur, Ill., and a director of the trade council, spoke strongly against political interference in trade at a news conference and at the opening ceremony. Government sanctions, he argued, had proved ''notoriously ineffective'' and had served only to throw trade to America's competitors. **********''We are here more or less out of fear,'' he said, ''fear of losing business to someone else.'' Mr. Andreas also argued for trade as a way to ensure peace ''Our trade efforts may be even more important than arms controls,'' he said.  Soviet Trade View **********Vladimir N. Sushkov, the Soviet co-chairman of the trade council and Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, avoided direct criticism of American trade policies. But he said, ''Our position is that if a government has given export licenses and contracts have been signed, nobody, not even God, could violate this.'' **********Mr. Sushkov focused on the Soviet food program, under which large sums have been earmarked to upgrade the foundering Soviet food-supply industry. ''There are good opportunities in this market,'' he told exhibitors. ''If you brought good machinery and good technology, you can look to good success.'' **********A sign of Soviet reserve, however, evidently reflecting the tensions in current relations with Washington and the history of American curbs on trade with the Soviet Union, was the fact that the opening ceremonies were not shown on Soviet television. Hard Bargaining Foreseen **********Officials of the trade council said they expected tough bargaining because the Russians seemed more intent on importing technology, while the Americans were looking largely to export finished equipment. **********Organizers said they expected 10,000 Soviet trade and agricultural officials to visit the exhibition through Oct. 25. They said that $10 million worth of equipment had been brought to Moscow for the show, and that the Commerce Department had endorsed the exhibition as being ''fully consistent with U.S. policy on trade with the U.S.S.R.'' **********At the exhibit, large combines and plows made by International Harvester and John Deere dominated the interior of the glass-walled building, while Caterpillar bulldozers stood outside. Booths in the building offered equipment ranging from potato chip makers to chicken eviscerators. **********American Cyanamid, Stauffer Chemical, Du Pont, Monsanto, Dow and other chemical manufacturers displayed fertilizers. Other companies showed models of silos, potato harvesters, poultry and livestock feeding systems, irrigation equipment, agricultural laboratories and hundreds of other commodities. **********The De Francisci Machine Corporation, of Brooklyn, attracted curious first-day visitors with its blini maker, which turns out 1,000 of the thin pancakes an hour. A cafeteria set up by the National Soybean Processors Association offered soybean hamburgers; the Pepsi-Cola stand offered Lay's potato chips; Coca-Cola offered Coke and Fanta, and a giant inflated white chef welcomed passers-by at the Pillsbury display."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/21/business/executives.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 229, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executives", "print_headline": "Executives", "body_text": " *********** Andlinger & Co., Tarrytown, N.Y., has elected Paul R.

Not only are people unafraid about walking streets late at night, but they are also so law-abiding that they do not even cross the street against a red light, leaving that to more anarchic Westerners. **********Many reasons are offered for Japan's safety, the most common being the tight family structure, the ethnically and culturally homogeneous population, the stern gun and drug laws and the fear of disgrace that an arrest would produce. This is combined with a high degree of cooperation with the police, leading, for example, to a 97 percent solution rate for homicides and 75 percent for robberies. **********But the crime statistics also suggest that no matter how glacially Japanese society may change, there are noticeable shifts. **********Some reflect Japan's affluence and a willingness to spend money in eye- catching ways. In the trendier sections of Tokyo such as Roppongi, it leads to the greatest display of Gucci and Louis Vuitton initials west of Rodeo Drive.   Bogus Fancy Labels **********In just one year, the number of cases involving bogus fancy labels and copied brand names jumped nearly five times from 1981, the police said. On a similar note, fraudulent use of credit cards rose by 50 percent and the incidence of stolen cards for cash-dispensing machines went up 60 percent. **********While cocaine is not the rage that it is in the United States, and heroin and marijuana use is fairly insignificant, various illegal stimelants are being experimented with more and more, particularly by young people. One popular substance is hiropon, a benzedrine derivative often smuggled in from South Korea and Hong Kong. Last year's arrests for possession or sales of stimulants, 23,365, were nearly three times the total of a decade ago. **********Most troublesome for many Japanese is youth crime. The numbers, though small compared with the United States', are rising inexorably and, some adults fear, ominously. **********Among the most violent crimes - homicide, rape, robbery, assault and arson - people under the age of 18 accounted for 43 percent of all arrests. And the age of these offenders seems to be dropping, with 14-year-olds comprising 21.3 percent of all youth arrests, the largest single group. **********Since World War II, Japan has experienced two big waves in teen-age crime, one starting in 1951 and another beginning in 1964 as the economic boom gained steam. ''Now,'' the police report said, ''we're in a third wave.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/29/business/3-guilty-in-herstatt-failure.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 233, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "3 GUILTY IN HERSTATT FAILURE", "print_headline": "3 GUILTY IN HERSTATT FAILURE", "body_text": " **********Three West German currency dealers were found guilty today of fraudulent transactions contributing to the 1974 collapse of Bankhaus I.D.

Andropov, the Soviet leader, as translated and distributed by Tass, the Soviet press agency. **********Q. What is your attitude to the U.S. President's letter to the people of Europe, in which he proposed that the U.S.S.R. and the United States sign on American terms an agreement on the elimination of medium-range land-based missiles? **********A. First of all, I must say quite definitely that there is nothing new in President Reagan's proposal. What it is all about - and this all the world's news agencies have immediately taken note of - is the same ''zero option.'' That it is patently unacceptable to the Soviet Union now is already generally recognized. Really, can one seriously speak about a proposal according to which the Soviet Union would have to scrap unilaterally all its medium-range missiles, while the United States and its NATO allies would retain all their nuclear weapons of this category. **********It is precisely this unrealistic position of the United States that blocked, and this is well-known, progress at the talks in Geneva.  That now the U.S. President has reiterated again his position indicates one thing: the United States does not want to look for a mutually acceptable accord with the Soviet Union and thereby deliberately dooms the Geneva talks to failure. 'For a Different Road' **********As I have said already, the U.S.S.R. will not agree to unilateral disarmament. If things are carried to the deployment of new U.S.  missiles in Europe, we shall answer this in a due way. But this would not be our choice. **********The Soviet Union is for a different road. It would be best, and we suggest this, not to have in the European zone nuclear arms at all, either medium-range or tactical weapons. And it seems the United States does not agree to this, we are prepared also to such a solution under which the Soviet Union would have no more missiles than NATO already has in Europe. At the same time an arrangement should be reached on cutting to the equal levels by both sides of the number of aircraft capable of medium-range nuclear weapon delivery.  Thus, there would be complete parity in missiles and aircraft, and the parity at a far lower level than now. **********The Soviet Union is prepared to sign such an agreement now. Is the President of the United States prepared to sign such an agreement based on the principle of equality and equal security? **********Q. The U.S. President suggests meeting with you to sign the agreement which he proposes. What can you say on this score? 'Not a Propaganda Game' **********A. We have believed and still believe that summit meetings have special significance to resolving complicated problems. This determines our approach to them. **********For us this is not a matter of a political or a propaganda game. A meeting between the leaders of the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A., aimed at finding a mutually acceptable solution to urgent problems and at developing relations between our countries, would be useful both to the Soviet Union and to the United States of America, to Europe and to the whole world. **********But when the U.S. President makes the meeting conditional on the Soviet Union's consent to the patently unacceptable solution to the problem of nuclear armaments in Europe, proposed by him, this by no means testifies to the seriousness of the American leadership's approach to the whole of this issue. This can only be regretted."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/09/business/patents-satellite-retrieval-system.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1983-07-09", "snippet": "WASHINGTON ASATELLITE retrieval system, intended for use by such craft as the space shuttles, was patented this week for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

I don't see what relation this could have with the macroeconomic policies of the country.'' **********At a news conference Tuesday night, President Reagan once again condemned the Sandinista regime, saying, ''The Marxists took over and created their totalitarian form of government.'' **********The charter of the Inter-American Bank, in which 43 governments are members, stipulates that it is a nonpolitical development agency set up to make loan decisions on technical criteria alone. **********The loan to Nicaragua was to be made by the Bank's Fund for Special Operations. It grants 50-year, no-interest credits to the poorest countries in Latin America. The United States has 35 percent of the vote in the fund, enough to effectively veto action, since loans by the Fund require a two-third affirmative vote. **********Some European governments were represented collectively by a single offical. Carlo Binetti, an Italian official who spoke for Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, West Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Britain, observed that the function of international development institutions is to promote social and economic development in the poorest countries, such as Nicaragua. **********''To depart from ideals of this nature causes great damage, with repercussions beyond our institution alone,'' he continued. ''I want to express our concern that yet again a project for Nicaragua is being delayed, the same as with the fishing project.'' **********The Inter-American Development Bank last year made loans totaling about $3.5 billion. At issue today was a loan approved in December 1976 for $18 million to construct local roads in Nicaragua. Last March 8 was the last day for disbursement of the money. Some $2.2 million was undisbursed. **********The proposal that the United States blocked today would have extended to Sept. 8, 1984, the time for disbursement of the $2.2 million. Nicaragua said that floods had forced it to delay construction of the roads. **********In November 1981, Nicaragua withdrew a request for a $30 million loan to buy 50 new fishing boats and spare parts for old ones. The withdrawal, according to reports at the time, came as a result of pressure by the United States, Argentina and Chile. An American Treasury official was quoted then as saying, ''We had an overall political problem with the direction'' of the Nicaraguan Government. **********The American position was stated by Ira Kaylin, a Treasury official who is temporary alternate executive director for the United States.  ''There clearly is a political content to the decision,'' said Caleb S. Rossiter, an assistant professor at Cornell University and also a consultant to the Center for International Policy. The Center is a Washington-based research organization concerned with human rights and economic development in developing countries. **********The United States has been putting a financial squeeze on Nicaragua in other ways. Last May 10 the White House announced that it was depriving Nicaragua of the right to sell most of its sugar crop to the United States. Sugar is its fourth-largest export crop, with virtually all of it exported to the United States. **********Nicaragua's entire public debt is nearly $3 billion, according to the Inter-American Development Bank's most recent annual report.

They refused to answer reporters' questions. **********'I Could Have Hugged' Rescuers **********But Mr. Heineken was overheard saying, ''I could have hugged the whole rescue team.'' **********Policemen rescued the two men Wednesday from concrete cells concealed in a warehouse on the outskirts of Amsterdam, after a ransom reported to be as high as $11.6 million was paid. As soon as they were freed the two men went to Mr. Heineken's villa south of Amsterdam where their families had stayed throughout the kidnapping. Mr. Doderer has worked for Mr. Heineken for 40 years.  Mr. Doderer, describing his ordeal, said: ''I thought, 'Don't lose my wits; I must keep busy to stay alive.' After a few days I made a program for myself to keep busy. I tried to do exercises despite everything. I had to keep busy.'' **********''At a certain moment I got a tangerine,'' he said.

He added, ''Three weeks of lying down, sleeping, reading, thinking, eating, drinking and, in the first place, trying to stay alive.'' **********''I was chained by my left hand, limiting my freedom of movement to almost nil,'' Mr. Heineken said. ''That was why I could only sleep on one side or on my back'' on a cot in a damp, unheated cell. ''Sometimes there was half a bucket of warm water, with which I could wash myself one way or another.

He added, ''I always kept one slice of bread to eat at night or the following morning, because you're never sure that there will be bread the next morning.''  Forbidden to Speak to Guard **********The captives said they were forbidden to speak to their hooded and armed guard. ''I asked the guard for several items by way of a note, most of the time a page torn from a book,'' Mr. Heineken said. ''Eventually I got some of these items, for instance my reading glasses, something to read and sometimes a cigarette.'' **********At first, Mr. Heineken said, he did not know that Mr. Doderer had been kidnapped. During the abduction the two had been hooded, and Mr. Heineken was knocked briefly unconscious when they were abducted. **********''When, after about four days, the door of my cell was opened once again, another door in the corridor was opened and I could see him in his cell,'' Mr. Heineken said, referring to his chauffeur.

But at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company everyone will have to wait until February, when the firm's final fiscal figures are in. **********Once again, many Wall Street firms, some celebrating record profits, are spreading Christmas cheer with hefty December bonuses for their employees. **********Although business slowed for many of them in the second half, the first six months of 1983 were such a gold mine that some firms also handed out rare midyear bonuses. And now many are distribut ing record Christmas bonuses to secretaries and executives alike. **********Even clerks and maintenance personnel who have been with the company a mere six months will get an extra three weeks' pay at Drexel Burnham. Drexel is a privately held firm and does not release numbers but said it will finish 1983 with record profits. The Christmas bonuses are pegged to seniority: up to 20 weeks' pay for those who have been there for 10 or more years. **********That maximum is up from 13 weeks last year, and comes on top of a special bonus of a week's pay awarded to all employees last May. **********''Everyone was thrilled,'' Angela Zizzi Dailey, a company spokesman, said of the latest windfall. ''If they weren't, I don't know what they expect.'' **********Although stock-option plans, performance pay and other more modern compensation packages are becoming increasingly prevalent at Wall Street firms, bonuses are still traditional at this time of year. They are a throw back, insiders said, to the days when partners, looking to conserve as much of their capital as possible, would pay low salaries but then award holiday pay if the markets were good that year and profits permitted. **********This is the second Christmas since the bull market's birth in August 1982. And although rising interest rates ate into some firms' bond trading profits in the third quarter, the profits still look quite healthy compared to pre-bull market days. **********New York Stock Exchange member firms dealing with the public piled up profits estimated at $1.22 billion in the third quarter. That was the worst quarter of the year so far but it was still more than quadruple the $291 million earned in the second quarter of 1982. **********Christmas is also the time when high-level executives at many securities firms receive ceive an installment of the bonuses that are included in their employment agreement. Many of these are generally considered just another part of an executive's standard compensation, rather than something special. **********But these end-of-the-year bonuses also usually fluctuate with the firm's fortunes and are becoming increasingly tied to individual performance. An executive's base salary, for instance, might be $75,000, while his or her bonus package could total one to three times that. ''A low-paid managing director has to be worth at least $250,000,'' said an official at a major firm who asked not to be named. ''A million a year is no longer unusual.'' At the First Boston Corporation last year, George L. Shinn, who retired as chairman last April, got $2.4 million in salary, bonuses and other benefits. **********Wall Street's holiday spirit is also evident this year at the stock exchanges. For more than five years, employees ees of the New York Stock Exchange have received bonuses equaling 7 1/2 percent of their salary. This year, the Big Board is paying 7 1/2 percent to 12 1/2 percent. Senior people get the bigger slice. **********Over at the American Stock Exchange, 650 of its 725 employees - everyone except the officers - will receive a 15 percent bonus. That is up from 12 1/2 percent last year. **********Generous Goldman, Sachs **********Among this year's most generous payments on the Street are those from Goldman, Sachs. It will pay 25 percent - up from last year's record 24 percent - to all clerical and administrative employees who do not receive profit-sharing or commissions. That is on top of a special 3 percent bonus paid in June. And traders and other professionals will get a minimum of 25 percent. **********''The bonuses go up and down, and they reflect the profits of the firm,'' said Robert W. Burke, Goldman's personnel director. **********At Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., clerical and administrative employees will get an extra week's salary, except those with the firm three or more years, who will get two weeks' pay. The bonuses are the same as last year, according to Chester A. Piskorowski, a senior vice president. He added that bonuses for the professional staff would almost certainly be up from last year and would probably set a record. They will not, however, be paid until after the books are closed in January. **********Bear, Stearns & Company paid a midyear bonus to all its employees and is handing out another round this month. Carlton A. Holstrom, chief financial officer, would not say how big the payments have been, but taken together, he said, they were the largest in the firm's history. ''It has been a good year,'' he said. ''I think that's a story you'll hear all over.'' **********Still Unannounced **********Other bonuses, still unannounced or of undetermined size, will be paid at E. F. Hutton, First Boston, Salomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Kidder, Peabody. **********Shearson/American Express Inc. said it does not pay Christmas bonuses and has no plans to break with tradition. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., the nation's largest brokerage firm, is expected to announce a bonus any day. **********At Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc., Christmas came early this year. The private company's fiscal year ended on Sept. 30, and its bonuses were paid then. ''It was a banner year.'' said James W. Hood, a spokesman. ''Bonuses were the largest they've ever been.'' **********In others cases, Christmas will come late. Smith Barney does not award its bonuses until February, after the year's final results are in.

Lee, would say that out of ''deference to the legislature'' Mr. Baxter would confine his presentation to issues not objected to by Congress. **********A spokesman for Senator Warren B. Rudman, who sponsored the restriction, expressed satisfaction with the decision but resisted what he said was the implication in the President's statement that Congress sought to change the law.

The official denied that the Government had ever planned to arrest Mr. Nkomo or ban his party. **********The Minister, Dr. Sydney Sekeramayi, who oversees the armed forces, confidently discounted the possibility that Mr. Nkomo could manage to muster support for an armed insurrection against the Government of Prime Minister Robert Mugabe. **********But Dr. Sekeramayi expressed concern that Mr. Nkomo, who crossed the border on foot into Botswana Tuesday night, might exploit recent accusations about indiscriminate killings by Government troops in rural Matabeleland in hopes of getting Western nations to use their aid programs as a political lever here. **********''He will cry human rights, and he knows he will have a sympathetic audience,'' said the Minister, a 38-year-old doctor who studied in Sweden. **********Dr. Sekeramayi, a Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office, supervises the armed forces for Mr. Mugabe, the titular Minister of Defense. ''It is up to the Western countries to make up their minds whether, in their cool judgment, Nkomo has a positive role to play any longer,'' he said. Beyond the Pale **********By entirely blaming Mr. Nkomo for the worsening ethnic conflict between the Shona-speaking majority and the Ndebele-speaking minority, Dr. Sekeramayi left no doubt that the Government regarded Mr. Nkomo as being politically beyond the pale even before he put himself beyond its reach this week. **********In his first interview with a foreign journalist since the atrocity accusations were made last month, Dr. Sekeramayi traced the conflict to Mr. Nkomo's unfulfilled ambition to lead Zimbabwe. **********''He hoped to use acts of banditry to put pressue on the Government,'' he said. ''That was his trump card.'' The case that Dr. Sekeramayi presented was based on a chain of reasoning that made Mr. Nkomo ultimately responsible - as the dominant political figure in Matabeleland - for the local population's readiness to harbor armed deserters from the army and its hostility to Government troops. 'Totally Behind the Dissidents' **********He then blamed the people of Matabeleland, the western part of the country, for the harsh action of the soldiers who had been sent to the area to rout out the deserters - former members of Mr. Nkomo's pre-independence guerrilla force - after they had committed various acts of terrorism. **********''The situation was really gravitating to the point where the local population was totally behind the dissidents,'' Dr. Sekeramayi said, using the euphemism preferred by the Government for the deserters who left the army after Mr. Nkomo was ousted from the Cabinet last year.  ''At that point, you either abdicate or take stronger measures. We decided to take stronger measures.'' **********Church and welfare groups, in addition to refugees, have said hundreds of unarmed civilians have been brutally killed since the Government sent a unit called the Fifth Brigade into the area in January. Dr. Sekeramayi said the local population had actively condoned atrocities committed earlier by the deserters, such as the burning to death of a Government official. **********He emphasized that the Government did not approve the shooting of unarmed civilians, but added, ''I am quite clear that some people get quite bruised before they are willing to cooperate.'' 'Cases of Individual Excess' **********Most reports of atrocities by Government troops, he noted, are second- or third-hand, and more than a month old. He said there might have been ''cases of individual excess or indiscipline on the part of soldiers caught up in a very stressful situation,'' but he contended that these had been magnified out of proportion. **********Since the first reports, the Minister said, the Government has made ''strenuous efforts'' to see that the troops do not kill unarmed civilians. But, with an ironic edge to his voice, he said those who ''plead about all the poor innocent people, suffering and so forth,'' seemed ready to overlook the challenge presented by the ''dissidents.'' **********Mr. Nkomo and his party, the Zimbabwe African People's Union, are especially guilty of such double vision, Dr. Sekeramayi said.''On the political side in Matabeleland, there is overwhelming support for ZAPU,'' he said of Mr. Nkomo's party. ''ZAPU is organized at all levels. If orders had been given to all these structures not to cooperate with acts of banditry, you would not have the situation we have now.'' Breakup of Army Forces **********The Government had to rely on the Fifth Brigade, Dr. Sekeramayi said, because the regular army - a mixture of former guerrillas who backed Mr. Mugabe or Mr. Nkomo - tended to disintegrate when sent to Matabeleland, with up to three-quarters of the Ndebele-speaking troops deserting. **********''In that situation, what we were doing was simply reinforcing the recruitment of dissidents and negating the exercise,'' the Minister said. ''We decided to send a unit that we knew to be loyal to the Government.'' **********Dr. Sekeramayi spoke bitterly of the role that Botswana had played in opening its doors to refugees from Matabeleland, but not as bitterly as The Herald, the semiofficial daily here, which said this morning that Botswana was, ''in fact, declaring war on us'' by admitting Mr. Nkomo. ---- Relatives Reported Detained **********BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe, March 10 (AP) - Security forces arrested Mr.  Nkomo's wife today after detaining his daughter and son-in-law for questioning about the opposition leader's escape, official sources said. The sources, who requested anonymity, said Joanna Nkomo was taken into custody on a train en route to Harare, the capital.

Except for a few disgruntled competitors and the e verprickly trustbusters at the Federal Trade Commission, most e veryone seems to be toasting this marriage of East and West, a nnounced appropriately on St. Valentine's Day. **********Should we be celebrating? After all, this marriage promises to spawn not only a fuel-efficient new car, but thousands of new United States jobs. **********Hold the bubbly. Check your invitation. This may be a closed party - for G.M. and Toyota only. What is good for General Motors in this case may not be good for America. **********When Americans begin switching from Chevettes to Toy-Chevies in 1985, will they be buying an American-Japanese hybrid - the best of both worlds? Hardly. From top to tires this will be an import. Look at the facts: **********Toyota will design and engineer the car, which will be a frontwheel-drive version of the Toyota Corolla. No laid-off designers from Fisher Body, and no engineers from G.M.'s Tech Center in Detroit need apply. The work has already been done in Japan. **********What about the car's components? According to the announcements, aren't these supposed to come from the United States and Japan in equal proportions? Not likely. **********By agreement, the engines and transmissions (some 20 percent of the value of the car) will be made in Japan. Much of the rest of the car, particularly the mechanical systems - the pumps, motors, carburetors, brakes and the rest - will also come from Japan. Only the bulkiest, lowest-value parts that cannot be shipped will come from the United States: springs, seats, glass, trim, batteries, body panels. **********The reason is simple: like Japanese cars, Japanese parts are generally cheaper. And low-priced components will be critical to the success of a new vehicle competing in the United States small-car market. **********In addition to their widely reported efficiency and wage advantages, Japanese suppliers are likely to have an even greater cost advantage over American competitors in this case. Why? Because they already supply Toyota with components that are compatible with the engine and drive train in the new vehicle. **********Unlike traditional G.M. sourcing, which has leaned toward domestic procurement for historic and strategic reasons, buying decisions at the Fremont, Calif., plant will be in the hands of an independent, cost-conscious management. Purchasing will be strictly on the basis of price, quality and delivery time. Should there be any doubt, the Toyota man in charge will make the final decisions. **********So when you look under the hood of the new vehicles rolling off the Fremont line, you will likely see the Nippondenso and Toyoda Gesei trademarks, not A.C. Delco's. Even the steel in the body panels, which General Motors has traditionally bought only in this country, is likely to come from Japan. Japanese sheet steel is several cents cheaper per pound than American steel. **********What about the tools, those specialized and expensive machines that make a modern automobile plant so capital-intensive and so productive? Most will come from across the Pacific.FOR example, the robots needed to fully automate the assembly line a nd the presses for the new stamping plant are sure to come from J apan. Again the reason is cost. For tools of equivalent productivitya nd quality, products from Japan are generally cheaper than American o nes. Even if this were not true, another reason points toward J apanese tools: Toyota is paying for them. Out of the total cash c ontribution, G.M. is kicking in $30 million, Toyota $150 million. Ift he past is any guide, Japanese auto makers will ''buy Japan'' when t heir money is in the checking account. **********Of course, some of the existing equipment in the plant can be reused. And G.M. is likely to install an automated paint booth - a technology in which it leads the world. But the bulk of the tooling will be Japanese. **********In sum, Japan will supply the highly skilled manpower, the sophisticated parts and the expensive tools. The United States will supply less-skilled (though highly paid) manufacturing labor, lower value parts, and the plant. **********Is this a harbinger of things to come, a glimpse of America's high-technology future? Strange. It looks more like automobile production in a developing country: an imported plant assembling mainly imported parts, with only the cheap, easy-to-make components procured locally. **********(Indeed it is ironic that arrangements such as this are no longer welcomed in the more sophisticated developing countries. This deal would be illegal in Mexico, Brazil or South Korea). **********Of course, the alternative to this arrangement is even less attractive. Toyota would eventually import the new Corolla itself, and G.M. would almost certainly build the replacement for the Chevette overseas. Either way, American automobile manufacturing will decline. **********For General Motors and Toyota, this venture makes perfect sense.  G.M. obtains a new subcompact to replace the Chevette at a fraction of the cost of developing its own vehicle. Toyota silences its American critics by establishing an American manufacturing presence.  In light of the intense competition in the American small-car market and the huge costs of developing new cars, it would be surprising if Ford and Chrysler were not considering similar arrangements. **********But though agreements such as this may help American car makers to survive, they will not help the American economy to prosper. By assigning to Japan the higher value, more technologically sophisticated share of production, this venture further undermines America's competitive position as producer of automobiles. **********If the United States is to remain the leading economic power in the world, it must consciously position itself on the leading edge of industrial change. **********This does not mean simply abandoning our mature manufacturing industries and pitching our tent in Silicon Valley. It means that we must be the designers of products, the developers of technologies, the suppliers of tools and the organizers of production systems for manufacturing industries. We cannot hope to prosper as the assemblers of imported parts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/17/world/india-with-bittersweet-memories-awaits-queen.html": {"writer_name": "William Stevens", "pub_date": "1983-11-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 924, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INDIA, WITH BITTERSWEET MEMORIES, AWAITS QUEEN", "print_headline": "INDIA, WITH BITTERSWEET MEMORIES, AWAITS QUEEN", "body_text": " **********Roughly 250 miles southeast of here, in the city of Lucknow, stand the ruined shells of a cluster of late 18th-century buildings. From them, the British once ruled a vast expanse of northern India. **********The Lucknow Residency, as the compound was called, crumbles hollowly, grass growing from walls and towers scarred by thousands of cannonball and bullet holes made a century and a quarter ago. **********More than 2,000 British men, women and children died there when Indian mutineers laid siege to the residency for 89 days during the 1857 Sepoy rebellion, the low point of the British adventure in India for both sides. **********Today, in a relatively undamaged part of the residency, there is a model of the place as it was during the siege. On the label, under glass that prevents frivolous alteration by unauthorized people, the besiegers are described as the ''enemy.'' That word has been scratched out and ''Indians'' penciled in - and then scratched out in turn and ''enemy'' put back.   Indians of Two Minds **********Indians have long been of two minds about their relationship with their former colonizers, and the ties are the subject of discussion again as Queen Elizabeth II prepares to arrive here tomorrow. It will be only the third visit to India by a reigning British sovereign. **********During the Queen's 10-day visit here, she will open a meeting next week of the heads of government of the Commonwealth, which grew from an association of nations formerly in the British Empire. **********''They bled this country dry,'' a young professional woman said of the British at a dinner party here last week. ''They had no right to be here,'' she pressed on, with some force. She said it, however, in fluent English, which since independence has become as close to a national language as India has. That is just one of many reasons, large and small, why the British imprint on India is widely recognized as deep and probably permanent. **********''They took away many things, but let's not dwell on those points,'' said Dev Kant Borooah, a former Cabinet minister and one-time adviser to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.   A Passion for Cricket **********Thirty-six years after British rule - ''the Raj'' - became history, many Indians are inclined not to make too much of the negative aspects of British rule, the undeniable economic exploitation, the sometime denial of human rights, the racism and condescension that Britons sometimes displayed, the denial of self-respect that, for the ruled, came with colonialism. **********It is no isolated symbol of what the British brought about in pursuing their duty - and also their self-interest - that on a grassy slope just below the residency, Indian youths were playing a game of sandlot cricket. It is India's national sport, a mania rivaling anything Americans have ever felt for baseball or football.  India today is studded with buildings, railway stations and government edifices that would seem very much in place by the Thames. Soldiers of the Indian Army still swing their arms far out when marching, like Tommies. Well-off Indian students still wear uniforms when they go off to the private schools that, in the British manner, are called public. Indian bureaucrats still use the same kind of file folders tied in red ribbon that the British used a century ago, ribbons that left in the English-speaking vocabulary the expression ''red tape.'' **********New Delhi itself is a monument to the Raj, its red-stone government buildings shouting ''empire'' to the world and its rambling bungalows (the word is one of many from India to enter the English language) and gardens reeking of imperial privilege even though they are now inhabited by egalitarian republicans.   Five Major Bequests **********But it is below the surface of style and appearance that the real legacy of the Raj is to be found. At least five tangible, major aspects of the British bequest are commonly cited as having been in some ways critical to India's independent existence so far: the institution of democratic, parliamentary government, a judicial system founded securely on the rule of law, railroads and public utilities - in Mr. Borooah's words, ''a certain infrastructure that was not perfect but could be built upon'' - a civil service devised to be incorruptible and efficient, and the English language. **********Some Indians fear that the institutions are deteriorating. Vigilante justice has taken over in many places where people perceive regular institutions to have broken down. And the civil service has become a symbol not of efficiency but of the worst kind of bureaucratic entanglement. **********Indian socialism, which in the past has almost approached the status of a secular religion even though it has been leavened and changed by significant doses of private enterprise, is also a British contribution. But some free-enterprise adherents, who see the economy has having been clamped in a straightjacket of government involvement that seriously hampers productivity, see this as a mixed blessing at best. **********''The worst thing the British did,'' said one Western advocate of free enterprise, only partly in jest, ''was to take unsuspecting youths like Nehru to England and let them sit at the feet of Harold Laski.'' **********Some consider the English language the most important bequest in some ways. ''Fortunately,'' says Romesh Thapar, one of Delhi's leading writers and intellectuals, ''it wasn't French, because French would only have linked us to France. But English links us to the world.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/15/business/a-high-tech-beer-from-silicon-valley.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 927, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A HIGH-TECH BEER FROM SILICON VALLEY", "print_headline": "A HIGH-TECH BEER FROM SILICON VALLEY", "body_text": " **********Silicon Valley seems about to produce another entrepreneural breakthrough: high- tech beer. **********The Palo Alto Brewery, which is really based in nearby Mountain View, is the latest of the ''micro- breweries'' that have sprung up over the past few years to produce a few thousand barrels of specialized beers each year for limited distribution. **********Most have been founded out of simple love of the brew, and a thirst by connoisseurs for an alternative to what many say is the bland nature of popular American beers. **********The West Coast has been especially active in spawning micro-breweries, likely inspired by the granddaddy of small California brewers - San Francisco's Anchor Steam Brewery, which produces 28,500 barrels a year. By comparison, the Anheuser-Busch Companies, the beer industry's largest, annually produces a bit more than 54 million barrels. **********Some Poor Products **********Despite admirable intentions and some pretty good products, many of the new beers are pretty awful - and the breweries shortlived. Most micro- brewery founders are just beer-lovers who want mainly to make their own idea of the perfect beer. They pick up most of their brewing experience in kitchens - with such resulting crude techniques as the use of new plastic garbage cans as fermenting tanks - and frequently have little interest in or ability to run a business. **********But in Silicon Valley, where billion- dollar companies such as Apple and Hewlett-Packard have started in living rooms and garages, one new micro-brewer is trying to meld a beer-lover's dream with the careful research and state-of-the-art manufacturing of a high-tech company. And Kenneth Kolance and his son, Jeffrey, know a lot about both fields. **********The elder Kolance is the co-founder of Bole & Babbage Inc., one of the first successful independent computer software companies and a pioneer in software engineering. Jeffrey is a recent graduate of the California Polytechnical Institute with a major in industrial technology and a minor in engineering management. His senior paper studied the organization of the physical plant of micro-breweries and the errors made by businesses already in the field. Armed with that knowledge, the Kolances decided in 1980 that they could make money in the micro-brewery business where others had failed. **********The result is a product that they call London Bitter, a draft, English- style beer, that costs between $2 and $2.40 at the half-dozen or so local bars where it is sold. They are selling 10 to 12 barrels a week of their brew and say that they will start making money when their volume reaches about 35 barrels a week. **********The Kolances say that making beer is not much different from making integrated circuit chips. The basics - marketing, management, manufacturing and capital - still must be covered. **********For the Kolances, the first decision was marketing: What kind of beer should they make? **********Local Market Sought **********''We wanted to produce a beer to market in the San Francisco area, not in the United States,'' said Jeff. They decided to make the traditional English unpasteurized beer, he said, based on census reports showing that ''California has the highest per capita sales of imported beer and the highest percentage of Brits in the U.S.'' **********Next, armed with Jeff's graduation paper, which included data on equipment, cost and operating techniques of micro-breweries in the United States, England and West Germany, they set about building their plant. **********While Kenneth raised $400,000 in capital from what he terms ''various sources,'' Jeff traveled to Faversham, England, near Canterbury, to the Fremlins Brewery, which conducts an intensive, six-week, course on running a small brewery. **********The younger Kolance also studied brewing equipment. No garbage cans for them. They wanted the state of the art in brewing, stainless steel tanks and sophisticated electronic controls. **********There were more decisions. Jeff went in search of ''the perfect beer,'' choosing Brakesther Best Bitter of Henley-on-Thames. Then came the decision on malt. To the horror of some purists, the Kolances chose to buy their malting from Edme's Malting House in England, rather than manufacture their own. To supply the yeast, the Kolances chose an unnamed, major British brewer. **********A potential problem, they say, is the inconsistency and inappropriateness of the local water supply. The Palo Alto Brewery therefore filters and purifies the water, adding chemicals to duplicate Burton-Upon- Trent's legendary brewing waters. **********Good Reception **********So far, a survey of the few local pubs carrying the beer indicates that it has been well received by the British locals. **********''We think it will be a best seller,'' said Colis Ball of the Churchill Arms in San Jose, where 60 percent of the clientele is British. ''One customer even said to me, 'it tastes like home.' '' But Mr. Ball also has a complaint: The quality of the beer varies. **********At the Prince of Wales Pub up the peninsula, the owner, John Curry, is still not wholly convinced, ''I'm hesitant at this time to pull out a good selling beer and replace it with an unproven one, particularly one that requires special handling,'' such as the temperature control that the Kolances insist upon. **********But David Neale, proprietor of two local British pubs, says his British patrons are amazed that such a beer could be produced in the United States and are quite enthusiastic about it. ''The Palo Alto Brewery has produced a more typical British product than we import from England,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/01/business/advertising-accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1983-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 33, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Smith & Wollensky and the Post House to Grey Lyon & King. *********** Princess House, North Dighton, Mass., a subsidiary of Colgate-Palmolive, to Leonard Monahan Saabye, Providence, R.I."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/26/business/advertisingpamela-g-hollie-one-woman-magazine.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 537, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AdvertisingPamela G.

''We're drowning in a sea of microchips,'' he said. ''That makes it even more important for people to talk to each other.'' **********One Woman, he said, will allow readers ample opportunity to get to know a single female star as she talks about herself. ''It is a personal magazine,'' he said, adding that Miss Fairchild was so delighted about having an entire magazine about herself that she did it for free. The writers and photographers were paid, but the magazine is a showcase for them, too. The six professional photographers were each given their own sections of the magazine to display their portfolios of the star. **********''Advertisers will get star treatment, too,'' Mr. Daniels said. The first issue has about 10 pages of advertising. The four-color page rate is $5,500. But because One Woman hopes to establish itself as a quality magazine for men, it will not accept mail order or sexually explicit advertising. **********The audience, Mr. Daniels said, will be the upscale male reader, ''not the blue-collar industrial man.'' In addition, he expects One Woman to emerge as a coffee table magazine with ''strong pass-along interest for women.'' **********''One Woman is not just the name of our new magazine but the dream every man has of finding one woman perfect for him, and the dream every woman has of being found,'' said the magazine's editorial architect, Mort Persky, former editorial director of new publications for Playboy. Mr. Persky, who has worked with Mr. Daniels on five other publications in Atlanta, Miami, Detroit, Philadelphia and Chicago, devised the idea for the magazine last winter. **********At $3.50 a copy, Mr. Daniels said, the magazine is expected to attract enough newsstand readers so that it will be profitable by the end of 1984, when it becomes a bimonthly. The following year, One Woman will become a monthly. **********''This magazine will be supported by readers,'' Mr. Daniels said. ''The advertisers are not expected to carry it on their shoulders.'' There will be no subscriber mailing. Almost all of the 400,000 copies in the first run are destined for newsstands. **********Financed by a consortium of Chicago and Houston backers, Mr. Daniels, formerly a senior vice president of Knight-Ridder Newspapers and executive editor of The Detroit Free Press, believes he and Mr. Persky have simplified the male fantasy for One Woman readers.

But there a re very attractive ways for people of more moderate means to s helter income from taxes while putting aside money for their c hildren. Although these tax shelters are available for virtually anya mount of money without steep legal fees, ''not enough parents fully u nderstand the options available to them,'' says Jeffrey Ashendorf, d eputy general counsel to the Bowery Savings Bank. **********There are several forms of trusts that can be created to shelter income and transfer it to a child, Dennis Cronin, senior vice president of Scudder, Stevens & Clark, says. But, he added, ''the custodial account is the most popular, particularly where you don't expect the amount of money to get so large that it makes anyone nervous.'' **********To establish a custodial account, you obtain a Social Security number for a child and then go to virtually any financial institution, mutual fund manager, or investment dealer and deposit funds under rules set by the Uniform Gift to Minors Act. **********There are no minimum amounts required for such accounts at many institutions. Federal law permits an adult to give a child up to $10,000 per year before incurring gift taxes. Because each parent may give each of his or her children $10,000 each year, and others may make similar gifts, sizable sums can be given without paying gift taxes. **********A custodian manages the account for the child until the child turns 18 and takes control of the money. The custodian is often a parent, but Mr. Cronin advises against that: He says this might ensnare the account in the donor's estate. **********Any income earned by the custodial account is taxable, contrary to what many parents believe, but it is taxed at a rate determined by the child's income. Thus, a child whose income is $5,000 in earnings on a bank account would be in a much lower tax bracket than an adult earning $80,000. **********While the tax advantages are clear, Mr. Ashendorf warns, ''when you put money into a custodial account, what you are doing is making an irrevocable gift to the child.'' While the money belongs to the child, that does not mean it cannot be spent instead of just accumulating until the child grows up. ''The most common thing these accounts are used for is to pay for a college education,'' says an I.R.S. spokesman. But he adds, ''the custodian may use the funds in the account for the benefit of a child in other ways that seem reasonable and prudent.'' **********However, he adds, ''that doesn't mean the custodian can use the funds for expenses that the parent would normally pay. A parent could not simply transfer the $2,000 a year that it would take to feed and clothe a child to one of these accounts and have the account pay for what he normally would pay.'' **********The custodian can use the funds for expenditures exceeding the legal responsibility of a parent. That might include private school tuition, elective or cosmetic surgery, or even a trip to Disneyland.  In determining what's appropriate, the I.R.S. takes note of a parent's income and standard of living. **********''If we're talking about an individual who earns $200,000 a year and who would in all likelihood send his children to a fancy Swiss boarding school,'' an I.R.S. official says, ''that would be ordinary support for the child,'' and an inappropriate use of a custodial account. However, he adds, ''for someone making $40,000 a year, who could obviously not afford such a school, but whose child has an account which maybe a rich relative contributed, that tuition payment probably would qualify.'' **********The I.R.S. official admits it can get ''fuzzy,'' but when in doubt, he notes, ''you can always ask the I.R.S. for a private ruling.'' Most financial institutions will let custodians move funds freely and custodians are required to keep records of what they do with the money. But the I.R.S. has no mechanism for monitoring use of the funds. If the I.R.S. raises questions about the use of the funds, ''as long as you're using it for the benefit of the child, it's just a question of paying taxes'' on the misused funds, Mr. Cronin says.  But if there is a pattern of using it for the custodian's benefit, he adds, in most states that is considered a form of embezzlement. **********Once the child turns 18, in many states the custodian loses control over the funds and this new adult can do whatever he or she wishes with the money. So, there is a risk that money carefully saved for college will instead be used to buy a fancy sports car. Legally, there is nothing the parent or custodian can do, although one banker says, ''if the child seems wayward, the custodian can let the child come looking'' for the funds. In New York State, a donor can specify before depositing funds that the age of distribution be 21 instead of 18. **********The two main negatives that some see in custodial accounts - giving up the right to use the principal for yourself and eventually giving the child control over it - may both be surmounted. **********For those who want to shelter income without letting go of the principal, one alternative is the Clifford Trust. In such a trust, earnings from the assets accumulate for the benefit of the child and in the child's tax bracket, but Frederick Lubcher, a partner of Fried, Frank, Harris, Schriver & Jacobson, a New York law firm, notes: ''At the end of 10 years, the principal reverts to you, so you've only given away the flow of income.'' However, he notes that if stocks put into a Clifford Trust are sold at a profit, you will have to pay the capital gains taxes at your own rate, even though you cannot get at the cash. Finally, it may cost several hundred dollars to establish a Clifford Trust, so it is practical only for those able to put sizable sums into it. FOR those who cannot wait 10 years to get the principal back, Mr.  L ubcher says there is another alternative, sometimes called the CrownL oan. Here, he said, ''the donor makes an interest-free demand loan t o a child or a trust established for the benefit of a child.'' E arnings on the borrowed funds accumulate in the child's name, yet t he donor can call the loan and get his money back at any time. This l oan, however, has been challenged by the I.R.S. People are still u sing it, Mr. Lubcher says, but ''whether or not it will hold up is u p in the air right now.'' He said the Supreme Court has agreed to r esolve the issue. **********Just as there are ways to get your assets back, there are ways to keep the principal out of the hands of your offspring. One device is a lifetime trust in which the beneficiaries receive only what a trustee doles out and never get the principal. **********Those who have the means and foresight to use any of these tax shelters will find that assets, like children, grow quickly. A $2,000 gift given to a newborn child and invested at 10 percent would grow to more than $11,000 by the time the child was ready for college. And the donor would have been spared 18 years of taxes that would otherwise have been incurred had he or she kept the money.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Harvey D.

The official itineraries did not include the slums, and the visitors often left with the same idealized visions of Israel they brought with them. **********Now some Americans, West Europeans and others have become directly involved in the rehabilitation of slum neighborhoods in Israel through an effort called Project Renewal in which Jewish groups outside Israel establish affiliations with poor communities here. For the last several years, Jews outside Israel have been raising money at home and meeting with the slum residents to devise social programs, thrash out budgets and coordinate appeals to the Israeli Government to fight poverty more efficiently. **********''When American Jews used to go to a town like Hatzor,'' Martin Gallanter of New York City said, ''it was to visit an archeological site, not to look at the town. They ignored the mayor. **********''Now, some of the richest and most powerful American Jews meet with and support the poorest and least powerful Israeli Jews.'' Where the Money Comes From **********Mr. Gallanter is the national director of Project Renewal in the United States for the United Jewish Appeal, which has raised $52.6 million of the $85.3 million that has been contributed worldwide and earmarked for 69 poor neighborhoods in Israel. Private donors have pledged $34.7 million more, and other neighborhoods are to be added.  The Israeli Government has budgeted $200 million more, according to Moshe Katsav, Deputy Minister of Construction and Housing. **********The project's activities include the expansion and rehabilitation of apartments, youth activities to keep youngsters off the streets, educational enrichment during and after school hours, social programs for the old and adult courses in Hebrew for those who never learned it after immigrating. **********The success of the programs is disputed by Government, neighborhood and foreign participants, with both slum dwellers and foreigners often impatient about the bureaucracy delaying, for example, housing renovation. **********But on one point all seem pleased: In its three years Project Renewal has fostered community leadership in the slums, teaching the poor, once apathetic or intimidated, how to organize to demand their rights and to find the pressure points of Government. 'The Process' in Action **********The effect of ''the process,'' as those involved like to call this community activism, was seen this spring in the impoverished Hatikvah quarter of Tel Aviv. A dozen New Yorkers had come for a week of budget meetings with the residents on the neighborhood steering committee. **********They sat together for long hours around tables littered with papers and empty coffee containers, reviewing each program in detail, the New Yorkers drawing from their varied experiences in accounting, teaching, real estate and business and the residents speaking out of their intimate understanding of poverty. **********The New Yorkers said they were excited by the very fact that Tel Aviv city officials attended a ''town meeting'' at which Hatikvah residents criticized ineffectual government. It was raucous and rude, appealing to the New Yorkers' sense of what grass-roots participation is all about. ''Did you ever see a community board meeting in New York?'' Bobi Klotz said delightedly. ''Is there any difference?'' **********The next day the New Yorkers and the Hatikvah committee came to Jerusalem for a working session with Housing Minister David Levy, airing some disagreements with him about priorities and arranging for a $6 million revolving fund to make loans for the purchase of vacant land on which residents can build their own houses. **********In a sense, the Americans have given the Israeli poor some leverage on the Israeli Government. ''Would those Hatikvah people have been able to go in and see David Levy without the powerful New Yorkers?'' Mr. Gallanter asked. ''Eventually they will be able to go in and see him on their own.'' **********The program calls for the Government to provide all its money after about five years, and as that time approaches there is apprehension about the future. ''We want to see the financial relationship and the dependency end,'' Mr. Gallanter said. ''But we don't want to see the personal relationships end.  The purpose is to help to develop self-sufficient neighborhoods, not charity cases.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/30/business/beecham-a-success-in-its-us-markets.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 912, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BEECHAM A SUCCESS IN ITS U.S. MARKETS", "print_headline": "BEECHAM A SUCCESS IN ITS U.S. MARKETS", "body_text": " **********With its latest American acquisitions, Beecham, the British chemical and consumer product company, is stepping up a strategy of expansion that has served the company well for more than a decade. **********J.B. Williams, which Beecham bought from Nabisco Brands last September for $100 million, brought the British company such strong performers as Geritol, a vitamin preparation; Sominex, the sleep aid, and Aqua Velva after shave. With Ohio-based DAP, Schering-Plough's do-it-yourself subsidiary that Beecham purchased early this month for $70 million, the British group has acquired a third of the American market in sealants, caulks and fillers. Together, the two purchases are expected to double Beecham's sales in the United States, to an annual $500 million. **********DAP, formerly Dicks Armstrong-Pontius, extends the company's interests in adhesives; Beecham sells its UHU product line worldwide.  'DAP Is Step Two' **********''In acquisitions we tend not to move too far out of fields we're in,'' said Sir Graham Wilkins, the company's avuncular 59-year-old chairman, from his west London office, which overlooks a small garden. ''DAP is Step Two in building an international business based on this type of product - a specialty product with room for improvement based on research.'' **********Indeed, research is the keystone of operations at Beecham, which is Britain's 39th-largest company in terms of sales, according to Datastream International, a computer service company. Beecham markets its products in more than 200 countries and earned $213 million last year on sales of $2.5 billion, with 60 percent derived from foreign operations. **********The vigor of the company's pharmaceuticals, whose earnings slightly outrank consumer products, dates to research conducted in the late 1950's by a group of Beecham scientists. Experimenting at a stately country house 25 miles from London, they learned to manipulate the chemical structure of penicillin to produce a wide range of new antibiotics. These semisynthetic penicillins have proved to be the core of Beecham's pharmaceutical expansion. **********Most Americans are better acquainted with Beecham's aggressively marketed consumer products, like Brylcreem hairdressing, Sucrets lozenges and Calgon bath fresheners. One brand, Aquafresh, has been so expensively marketed that although it scrubs 12 percent of American teeth, it has yet to make a profit after two years. U.S. Market Stressed **********''You cannot claim to be an international company unless you are important in the United States,'' Sir Graham said. ''We've had five major acquisitions there since 1971 and the reason is that in whatever sphere we're in, the U.S. represents at minimum 20 percent of our market, and this can go up to 40 in some areas.'' **********Its first consumer product success in the United States was Brylcreem, which in 1960 became the largest-selling men's hairdressing in the country. Then a dozen years ago, Beecham took over Tennessee-based S.E. Massengill, a pharmaceutical and feminine hygiene company. It tripled its consumer products business in the United States overnight when it bought Calgon, with its bath products and Sucrets, in 1977. Two years later Beecham bought the fast-growing Jovan fragrance and cosmetics company. **********''On the consumer side, Beecham keeps finding and integrating acquisitions successfully,'' said Ian White, an analyst for W.  Greenwell & Company, stockbrokers. ''After two years you see they were good deals, and I expect such acquisitions at the rate of more than one per year from now on.'' **********In pharmaceuticals, however, ''America has been a bit of a headache for the company,'' according to Eile Gibson, who follows this sector for the brokerage firm of Scrimgeour Kemp-Gee. The international success of Amoxil, the antibiotic introduced by Beecham in 1972, led to considerable competition in the United States, most of which the company says was unlicensed. The battle forced down prices, depressing profits. A court case with Bristol-Myers over the subject still drags on after six years. Drug Approval Awaited **********One big question for the company is whether the Food and Drug Administration will approve the American sale of Augmentin, an antibiotic introduced with high hopes in Britain in 1981. Only a few forms of the drug have been allowed on the market, however, and sales have been slow. **********Augmentin contains the penicillin protector clavulanic acid, which Beecham discovered and has been combining into new antibiotic compounds like Ticar, which is used in thousands of American hospitals. **********''Augmentin is likely to achieve its greatest success in Japan and the United States, where it will get a large marketing push behind it,'' Mr. White said. ''In Europe, there are good reasons why Beecham wouldn't promote it so forcefully - it has a sizable business with Amoxil, which it wouldn't want to cannibalize.'' **********Increasingly, Beecham is also exploring other types of drugs.  Nabumetone, an anti-inflammatory agent that appears to have few side effects, may come on the market next year and will find a ready-made market in the expanding elderly population. A drug that combats blood clots and an anti-obesity drug are also in preparation.  Progress on the consumer front is expected to stem from the introduction of successful brand names to new world markets. **********Sir Graham refuses to predict results for the year ending March 31. Although Beecham has increased its profits in all but one of the last 17 years, the combination of recession and competition means that gains in the fiscal year 1983 are unlikely to match last year's 34 percent rise."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/21/business/data-general-offers-desktop-computers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 219, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Data General Offers Desktop Computers", "print_headline": "Data General Offers Desktop Computers", "body_text": " **********The Data General Corporation of Westborough, Mass., entered the personal computer market yesterday, introducing a series of desktop computers aimed primarily at business users. **********Some of the models will be able to run programs written for standard personal computer industry operating systems, as well as programs written for Data General's own minicomputers and superminicomputers. **********The new models can also be connected to larger office automation systems containing Data General computers.

If the display on the monitor at Mr. Bachman's work station shows that parts are beginning to drift out of specification, he said, the production line is stopped and corrections made before a defective batch is shipped. **********The result: greater quality control and fewer complaints from buyers.  Factory 3 is just one part of Buick's sprawling manufacturing complex here, just as Buick is only a part of the General Motors Corporation and the American automobile industry. Yet the installation of computerized testing machinery in this aging plant, and Mr. Bachman's command of it, are indications of the sweeping changes now under way in the once complacent United States auto industry. **********Shielded Against Imports **********Until about 10 years ago, American auto makers were the unchallenged masters of their home market. Shielded against imports by low gasoline prices that allowed Americans to indulge their preference for large cars, the Big Three - G.M., Ford and Chrysler - were able to concentrate on styling gimmicks and short-term profits.  Few in the industry worried about the need to update plants. **********''Over the years American managers had grown so used to thinking of their major task as the marketing, under strict and analytic financial controls, of what their factories effortlessly brought forth, that they lost touch with the actual work of production,'' said Professors William J. Abernathy, Kim B. Clark and Alan M.  Kantrow of Harvard in their new book, ''Industrial Renaissance.'' **********Now, stunned by the success of Japanese cars in this country and aware that the Japanese production system gives manufacturers there a large cost advantage, the American car companies are pouring billions into new plants and machines. They are also trying, almost overnight, to erase 40 years of acrimonious relations with their factory workers. And there is a new emphasis on quality and a surprising tone of humility. A Change of Emphasis **********''We thought we were in business to make a profit,'' said Carlisle R. Davis, an executive with G.M.'s Assembly Division. ''Now we say we are in business to make automobiles; if they are good, customers will buy them and our reward will be a profit.'' **********There are some indications that this change in attitude is bearing fruit, despite the layoffs, losses and quality problems of the past few years. **********For one thing, as the result of tough cost-cutting, the auto companies are a lot leaner than they were just a few years ago. In the first quarter of 1983, the Big Three had combined profits of $1.04 billion on sales of 1,387,374 cars, compared with a combined loss of $458 million on sales of 1,760,175 cars in the same quarter of 1980. (Another indication of changing management attitudes is the decision by G.M., announced Tuesday, to delay the planned September introduction of its front-wheel-drive Cadillac DeVille, Buick Electra and Oldsmobile 98 luxury models to correct transmission problems.) **********''There are clear signs today that managements are correctly addressing problems with more creative solutions than the cliche responses of the past,'' said Maryann N. Keller, a Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins analyst who has often been critical of the industry. ''The auto industry is better managed today than it has been in more than a decade.'' PICKUP MOTORS ADD **********Analysts also note that its leaders have not deviated from their commitment to the car business. While companies in other basic industries, such as steel, have been investing in chemicals and other unrelated fields, the auto makers have concentrated on developing new models and equipping plants to make them. **********According to figures compiled by David Eisenberg of Sanford C.  Bernstein & Company, the Big Three has put over $43 billion into new plants and production machinery in the past four years. In the same four-year period a decade earlier, those investments only totaled $13.4 billion. **********But the process of modernizing an industry now into its eighth decade (Ford will celebrate its 80th birthday on June 16) is still under way. **********''At a cost of more than $80 billion, the American automobile industry will complete, by 1985, the retooling and re-equipping of 49 new engine and transmission lines and 89 new or fully re-equipped assembly lines,'' Ford's chairman, Philip Caldwell, said recently.  ''When the conversion has been completed, few machine tools or parts will remain unchanged in the industry's 260 domestic plants or in the plants of more than 5,000 U.S. suppliers of automotive components and materials.'' **********As a major part of its drive to upgrade to the state of the art, the industry is investing heavily in automated machinery, robots and computer-controlled processes. G.M.'s new robot painting system, for example, is considered as good as anything in the world. Rigid financial controls, once a hallmark of the industry, have been loosened to bring in the new technology. Sorting Out Priorities **********''You have to be careful not to confuse financial decisions with operational decisions,'' said John Betti, a vice president of Ford.  ''What looks good short-term financially, may not be the best longterm operational decision.'' **********Whether all this investment in new equipment will be enough for Detroit to counter Japan's formidable challenge remains to be seen.  In the meantime, American auto executives are employing a practice reputed to be a specialty of the Japanese - copying. **********Nowhere is that approach more evident than in Flint, long one of General Motors' more important production hubs. Meetings of worker quality circle groups are now common in Buick plants here, as is the use of statistical process controls to monitor their operations; both techniques were borrowed from the Japanese. **********And on a larger scale, the division plans to combine its separate engine, parts and assembly factories here into one integrated facility. The model for the consolidation is Toyota City, the tightly knit industrial complex developed by Japan's largest auto maker. 'Buick City' Project **********As part of its consolidation, Buick plans to take over the city streets alongside its assembly plant so trucks can feed parts directly to the assembly line where they are needed, reducing handling and storage. A conveyor link between the assembly plant and the engine plant two miles away will permit completed engines to be dispatched to to automatically meet the car for which it is intended. **********Herbert Stone, the manager of the ''Buick City'' project, said the result should be a major gain in efficiency. ''We'll take raw steel in one end and four hours later a car will roll out the other.'' **********Another auto industry practice that grew up over the years - one that made engineering subservient to styling - is also being discarded, Detroit executives say. Design and manufacturing engineers are now being invited into styling studios to make changes that will avoid later problems on the assembly line. **********''In the old days we did a design and threw it over a wall at manufacturing,'' said Howard Frears, one of Ford's chief design engineers. ''If it didn't come back in a few days attached to a rock, we assumed they could build it.'' More Attention to Production **********Styling remains important, of course, and Ford, for one, is counting on its new aerodynamic look to give it a clear distinction over competing models. But the difference, Detroit executives say, is that the process of actually producing the vehicle is receiving more attention these days. **********According to Mr. Frears, Ford formerly allowed only 28 months from the time a car's design was frozen until production commenced, so that it could match last-minute styling changes at G.M or Chrysler.  ''It's thirty-six months now, so we've got an extra eight months to engineer the car,'' he said. **********Those extra months can be important. Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, said the quality problems of the Plymouth Volare/Dodge Aspen models of the mid-1970's, which helped push Chrysler to the edge of bankruptcy, came from trying to meet a deadline. **********''The engineering on those products wasn't that bad, but it was rushed,'' he said. ''Not doing any galvanizing on the Aspen/Volare cost us $100 million because of rust. That happened because somebody cut $7 a car out of the metal.'' **********This re-emphasis on engineering, production equipment and manufacturing techniques is an acknowledgement that the advantage of the Japanese auto companies lies not in design or marketing, but on the factory floor. Indeed, many modern Japanese autos were styled outside Japan and the major Japanese auto companies all have design studios in California, staffed largely by Americans. **********In a way, the American auto industry is returning to its roots, to the days when Henry Ford and David Buick, men who knew their way around a factory, ran automobile companies. Donald Petersen, the president of Ford, said recently: ''We need to restore the prestige and status of manufacturing jobs.'' To do that, he said, Ford will ''provide compensation and career advancement opportunities in that field which will be comparable to other areas of our organization.'' ---- G.M. Models Delayed Special to the New York Times **********DETROIT, May 11 - General Motors will delay the planned September introduction of a new series of high-priced cars to avoid quality problems, the auto maker's president said. **********In a speech Tuesday, the president, F. James McDonald, said the company's new, front-wheel-drive Cadillac DeVille, Buick Electra and Oldsmobile 98 would go on sale ''only after we're satisfied with the results of special verification testing of early production runs.'' **********The cars, to be produced at new plants in Lake Orion, Mich., and Wentzville, Mo., had been scheduled to begin production in mid-July for introduction in late September. Industry sources said problems with the cars' transmissions could delay production for as long as six months. **********G.M. has been plagued with recalls involving its X-body cars, the first of its front-wheel-drive models, which were introduced in 1979. ''We're taking this step to assure the highest quality,'' Mr.  McDonald said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/27/business/city-investing-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 133, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CITY INVESTING CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "CITY INVESTING CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/26/world/around-the-world-a-ban-lifted-turks-say-they-ll-lead-parties.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Ban Lifted, Turks Say They'll Lead Parties", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; A Ban Lifted, Turks Say They'll Lead Parties", "body_text": " **********Several well-known Turks announced today that they would lead political parties, a day after the military Government announced that it would allow the establishment of parties starting May 16. **********Among those announcing were Turgut Ozal, a former Deputy Prime Minister, and Turgut Sunalp, a retired general and former Ambassador to Canada.

There once was talk of constructing a major office building on the site to accommodate New York State workers. For a while a post office was in service there. At one time the city worked with Harry Helmsley, one of the city's most prominent private developers, to convert the terminal into an industrial site. That plan fell apart in 1981. **********The complex of warehouses, office buildings and railroad tracks was opened in 1919 at a cost of $30 million. During World War II it was used to accommodate service personnel. In the mid-1960's the Defense Department decided to shut it down in an economy drive. The city bought the 55-acre terminal site in 1981. The price was $8.5 million, but the cost to the city was only $4 million because it received a $4.5 million grant from the Federal Government. **********Now there is another plan for the waterfront terminal that looks out over lower Manhattan from Bay Ridge - and there are faint signs that it may actually come to pass. The city plans to use public and private financing to upgrade the buildings and lease space for light industry and warehousing. **********The total cost for rehabilitating the property, expected to take four years, is estimated at $36 million. But the city will initially rehabilitate only one building at a cost of $20 million. Ultimately, the city expects the rehabilitation to create 5,800 jobs. **********The city has hired Eastdil Realty, a nationally known real estate investing banking firm, to arrange the private financing. The $20 million package will include private funds and $2 million of city funds. The city also hopes to get an Urban Development Action grant of $5.6 million from the Federal Government. **********The use of tax-exempt Industrial Revenue Bonds in the financing package has been discussed, but Elliot Matz, a senior project manager for the city's Public Development Corporation, said that for technical reasons the bonds have turned out to be a difficult, if not impossible, proposition for the terminal project. **********One attractive lure for private financing will be the 25 percent Federal investment tax credit available for historic renovation.  Joel Goldfrank, Eastdil's executive vice president, said he expected the financing arrangements to take six to nine months. The project needs to have 25 to 35 percent of the space pre-leased before investors will commit themselves, he said, adding that the terminal plan ''is one of the most ambitious redevelopment projects in the country in terms of generating employment and the amount of space.'' **********The Public Development Corporation, which is overseeing the project, is handling the leasing. No leases have been made, but Mr.  Matz said the agency expected to have 25 percent of the space leased by the summer in Building D, the first to be renovated. Building D contains about 2 million square feet of space. **********''We're in a juggling act between preleasing and financing,'' Mr.  Matz said. ''We have handshake deals on about 500,000 square feet.'' The largest potential tenant would use about 250,000 square feet. The city is hoping to start construction this fall and to have tenants in place by the fall of 1984. **********Mr. Matz also said that the city would soon seek bids from real estate companies to act as both broker and managing agent for the terminal. **********About 50 percent of the space in the first building will be rehabilitated for manufacuturing and the remainder for warehouse use.  The plan calls for new sprinkler systems, a new power system to replace the old steam generating plant, new elevators and bathrooms.  Under discussion also are shops and services, such as a newspaper stand, post office, bank and coffee shop. **********The city's ''nonnegotiable'' rents in the terminal are $2.25 a square foot for manufacturing space, $1.90 for warehouse space and $3.50 for the ground floor, Mr. Matz said. **********Phil Aarons, president of the Public Development Corporation, said that the plan to make the city a joint venture partner with private industry was a new arrangement for the city. The only similar arrangement is the Teleport project for a satellite communications center and office park on Staten Island. **********In the real estate portion of the Teleport operation, the city basically will take 8 percent of the gross rentals from the office park and 50 percent of the project revenues after maintenance and debt service, he said. The project is a joint venture with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and Merrill Lynch & Company. **********How the city and private investors will split the profits from the Army Terminal project has not been determined."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/17/world/lebanese-troops-try-but-fail-to-halt-israeli-patrol.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 515, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LEBANESE TROOPS TRY BUT FAIL TO HALT ISRAELI PATROL", "print_headline": "LEBANESE TROOPS TRY BUT FAIL TO HALT ISRAELI PATROL", "body_text": " **********Lebanese troops tried and failed today to keep an Israeli patrol from going through their checkpoint on the outskirts of the city in a confrontation that lasted about 20 minutes. **********It was just Tuesday that the Lebanese Army extended its control from West Beirut to the entire city, and the incident today touched off warnings from both sides. **********An Israeli Army spokesman said, according to the Israeli radio monitored here, that the incident occurred in an area under Israeli control and that the Israelis would continue their patrols there as part of routine security. **********The Israeli spokesman said the patrol, commanded by an Israeli colonel, broke through a Lebanese barricade near the town of Monteverde, about three miles east of here, and continued on its way. **********(A different version was given by Lebanese military sources, who said, according to Reuters, that the incident took place at Sinn al Fil, an East Beirut suburb two and a half miles from Monteverde.

Those changes are expected to lead to at least a doubling of local telephone rates in the next year or two. **********''It's fair to assume that if wages go up, rates will go up a commensurate amount,'' said Paul L. Gioia, chairman of the New York State Public Service Commission, which regulates telephone rates in the state. He added, however, ''If wages go up 5 percent in one year I don't think that's significant. That's in line with general economic circumstances.'' **********Bargaining Shifts to Locals **********The tentative nationwide agreement reached Sunday would end the 16-day nationwide strike involving 675,000 workers in three unions. Yesterday, bargaining shifted to the local telephone companies and union locals, which are trying to resolve issues specific to each region. That process is scheduled to be completed by late Wednesday, and could put workers back on the job Thursday. **********The agreement would provide a maximum wage increase of 5.5 percent the first year and additional increases of 1.5 percent plus cost-of-living adjustments in the following two years. Union officials estimated the total increase could be 16.4 percent over three years. The average hourly wage reportedly would increase to $14.35, from $12.33, **********A.T.& T.'s labor costs, including pensions, were about $26 billion last year, or about half of its operating expenses. A 5.5 percent wage increase, then, would make rates go up by about 2.2 percent, which would translate into a little more than $1 billion in annual revenue increases, assuming the ratio remains constant. **********By contrast, A.T.& T. and its local operating companies now have $7.2 billion in rate increases pending before state regulators, an A.T.& T. spokesman said. **********Swift Settlement Unexpected **********The settlement, reached late Sunday, was unexpectedly swift. Many analysts thought that A.T.& T. was in a strong bargaining position, were it not for the pending divestiture. Supervisors were able to continue running the company without the striking workers and, by some estimates, the company was improving its net income by about $100 million a week by not having to pay wages. **********Nevertheless, the longer the strike dragged on, the more inconvenient it became to the company. In addition, supervisors who were running the phone company were needed to help plan the divestiture. Had the strike continued, it would have endangered meeting the Jan. 1 target date. **********''The worst thing in the world that could have happened would be for anything to postpone the divestiture,'' said John Bain, an analyst with Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb. Indeed, A.T.& T. has accepted many things it did not like - such as the loss of its Bell name and logotype - in order to get the divestiture in place and get on with business. **********Concessions Made on Both Sides **********Nonetheless, the agreement has elements favorable to each side. The unions won a continuation of company-paid health care benefits and won several new programs to help retrain workers or to compensate them as technological changes eliminate many traditional telephone jobs. **********For A.T.& T., the wage increases granted were smaller than in the last two contracts, negotiated in 1977 and 1980. ''That's a pretty good settlement,'' said Steven Chrust, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Also, despite the new job security programs, A.T.& T. apparently retains the prerogative to transfer or lay off workers, which could be important as it tries to become more competitive. **********The pending divestiture and the increased competition in the telephone business were essential background factors in the negotiations. **********When A.T.& T. spins off 22 operating companies and begins to compete aggressively in equipment manufacturing and long-distance services, there will be pressure on the company to adopt the most modern technology and to slash labor costs, especially since it will be competing against many companies without unions, such as the electronics companies in California's Silicon Valley. **********Technology Eliminates Jobs **********Those factors could lead to substantial layoffs at a company that was once known for its job security. **********''That's been the fear of the entire bargaining arena,'' said Arthur Perry, director of the telephone department for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents 100,000 striking employees. The two other unions are the Communications Workers of America, representing 525,000 employees, and the Telecommunications Intenational union, representing 50,000 employees. **********Technology is already cutting into many traditional phone company jobs, such as operators and installers. Many credit card calls no longer require operator assistance. In some cities, computerized voices provide numbers to callers seeking directory assistance. **********With more people buying their own phones, fewer installers are needed. And fewer workers are needed to repair and maintain the electronic central office switches that are replacing the electromechanical ones. The workers who are needed require different skills. **********''The company is becoming more of a white-collar company and less of a blue-collar company,'' said James M.

Iacocca, said today. **********Mr. Iacocca said in an interview that he was sending a letter to Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan asking for the postponement. Last Friday, Mr. Regan announced that the Government had decided to sell the warrants to the public through an underwritten offering. **********Each warrant can be converted into one share of Chrysler stock at a price of $13. At today's closing price of $26 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, down $1.625, the Government could earn $13 a share, or $187.2 million, by converting the warrants itself. It is expected to earn even more by selling the warrants to underwriters, and Chrysler itself has offered to buy them back for $17.36 apiece, or $250 million. **********The Government obtained the warrants from Chrysler in 1980 in exchange for the risk it took in agreeing to guarantee repayment of up to $1.5 billion in loans that the auto maker needed to avoid bankruptcy. At the time, the warrants were considered virtually worthless. **********Chrysler subsequently borrowed $1.2 billion with Federal guarantees and is now in the process of repaying the last of these loans, now that it is profitable again. **********During the interview at Chrysler's headquarters here, a visibly disturbed Mr. Iacocca said the sale of the warrants by the Government would violate the intent of Congress when it wrote the loan guarantee legislation. He said the sale of the warrants would depress the price of the company's stock until 1990, when they expire, even though the Government's risk is about to end with the repayment of the guaranteed loans. **********''It doesn't meet the test of fairness, or even decency,'' Mr. Iacocca said. ''You can argue about the technicalities, but the operative line is that when you pay back a loan of that size seven years ahead of schedule, you often renegotiate the terms because there is no more risk left.'' Warrants Good Until 1990 **********Several Wall Street investment houses have indicated that they are planning bids for the warrants. Since the warrants are valid until 1990, each is considered to be worth more than the spread between the $13 face value and the current price of Chrysler stock. That is because Chrysler stock is expected to sell above its current price over the next seven years. **********The Government has said that it has already been offered more than $17 a warrant by underwriters who believe they can make a profit by reselling the warrants to the public at a higher price. **********Mr. Iacocca said the company offered on July 13, the day he announced that the last of the loans would be repaid, to buy back the warrants for just over $17 each, or a total of $250 million. He suggested that the board's decision to seek what he termed a ''speculative'' profit stemmed from hostility on the part of Government officials toward him and Chrysler. 'Source of Bewilderment' **********''I've dealt with an Administration and people representing that Administration who ideologically didn't like our deal,'' Mr. Iacocca said. ''And now that we've succeeded, we're the source of some bewilderment - if not embarrassment - and I've gotten the feeling that they just wish I'd go away and maybe fail.'' **********Mr. Iacocca said Chrysler made a second proposal to the Government that the expiration date of the warrants be accelerated to this year if they were sold to the public. That way, he said, the Government would make a profit and Chrysler would get a quick infusion of $187 million in cash through the exercise of the warrants. **********He said it was his hope that a Congressional oversight hearing, which he acknowledged has not yet been set, would persuade the loan board to choose that option. Mishandled Earlier Talks **********Mr. Iacocca, who said he had ''harsh words'' with Mr. Regan when the sale plan was announced, also conceded that the auto maker had mishandled earlier negotiations on the warrants. He said the request, made earlier this year, that the warrants be given back to Chrysler once the loan was repaid was a tactic that backfired. The request drew widespread criticism in Congress and created the impression that Chrysler was attempting to get out of its part of the original loan agreement. **********The auto executive, who has often harshly criticized the Administration's economic policies, said he was hoping that a Congressional hearing would define what the original legislation meant by a ''fair'' return to Government for its guarantees. **********''You have to ask if a quarter of a billion dollars is an adequate return for 36 months of guarantees,'' Mr. Iacocca said. ''The fact that I paid off the loans changed things a bit, and, I was led to believe, changed what they felt would be fair. As it turned out, I was twisted in the wind.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/20/business/advertising-ddb-international-wins-michelin-account.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1983-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 152, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "D.D.B.

This pre-auction activity has the approval of the Treasury, since it gives dealers more time to find buyers - most of whom are speculators or large instititions - and thereby helps lower the interest rate, set at the auctions, that the Treasury has to pay. **********Although individual investors rarely make commitments before the auction, they watch the early activity for indications of what interest rates the auctions will produce. **********By late Friday, the $6.5 billion of three-year notes due Feb. 15, 1986, to be auctioned this Tuesday were offered by securities dealers with a yield of 9.78 percent, and the $4.5 billion of 10-year notes due Feb. 15, 1993, to be auctioned Wednesday were offered with a yield of 10.74 percent. In the long-term bond market, the $3.5 billion of additonal 10 3/8 percent bonds due Nov. 15, 2012 were offered with a yield of 10.85 percent. **********The specter of these borrowings has contributed to lower prices and higher yields for notes and bonds during the past month. However, many analysts say that even if the heavy supply of Treasury issues causes yields to rise further, the increase is only temporary. The slowdown of inflation and weak credit demands by businesses and consumers will leave room for yields on Treasury issues to come back down, they say. **********While the Treasury has little control over the most important factors that influence interest rates, such as inflation and the state of the economy, it tries to keep its interest costs low by not suprising the market with unexpected financings. That means selling bills, notes and bonds on a regular schedule, so that securities firms and investors know what issues will be available when. **********Over the years, the number of Treasury financings has steadily increased. Securities dealers who used to provide quotes on the telephone for every outstanding Treasury issue now do so only for the half-dozen or so most recent and actively traded issues. Price quotes for all 32 outstanding issues of Treasury bills and 149 outstanding issues of notes and bonds are normally provided only on request or on quote sheets compiled at the end of the day. **********Since budget deficits seem to be the rule rather than the exception, Treasury officials have found it necessary each year to borrow increasing amounts both to finance that year's deficit and to repay maturing securities that helped finance previous years' deficits. The size of weekly bill auctions has increased dramatically, from $5.8 billion at the end of 1975 to $12 billion currently. But Treasury officials have been forced to sell longerterm issues as well, if only to be relieved from the burden of selling even larger amounts every week. **********In 1975, for example, a $45.2 billion budget deficit led the Treasury to sell two-year notes every month to raise cash. ''We thought there was demand for securities with a maturity between oneyear and long-term,'' said Edward M. Roob, an executive vice president at the First National Bank of Chicago and former Under Secretary of the Treasury for Debt Management. ''By regular offerings, we thought we could build a market for two-year notes.'' **********The two-year note is now one of the most widely traded Treasury issues and is extremely popular with investors such as commercial banks who cannot bear the risk of longer-term issues. **********The evidence of investor demand for intermediate-term issues led Treasury officials to increase their sales of three-, four-, five-, seven- and 10-year issues, all now sold on a regular schedule. **********Quarterly refundings, such as this week's, used to be the focal point of Government borrowing in the note and bond market. They were so named because there was a time when Treasury securities due in more than one year were scheduled to mature on Feb. 15, May 15, Aug.  15 and Nov. 15. **********This week's three-part, $14.5 billion financing, for example, will raise $8.7 billion of new cash to finance this year's deficit, as well as retiring $5.8 billion of publicly held 8 percent notes that were sold in February 1976 to finance part of that year's deficit.  Similarly, the $7.5 billion of two-year notes auctioned Jan. 19, raised $3 billion of new cash and retired $4.5 billion of publicly held notes that had been sold in January 1981. **********The following pattern of Treasury financings is expected by dealers who say that it is subject to minor changes. The term of issues due in three years and more may vary by three months or so as the Treasury adjusts maturities to keep from having too many issues falling due on the same day. *********** Three- and six-month Treasury bills, which actually have maturities of 13 and 26 weeks, respectively, are auctioned every Monday. *********** One-year Treasury bills are auctioned every fourth Thursday, most recently on Jan. 20. *********** Two-year notes are auctioned in the second half of each month. *********** Three-, 10- and 30-year issues comprise the old ''refunding'' package, and are auctioned in the first week of February, May, August, and November. *********** Four-, seven- and 20-year issues were once auctioned at various times each quarter, but the current practice is to lump them together into a single week, in the second half of the last month of each calendar quarter. Thus, analysts expect four-, seven- and 20-year issues to be auctioned in late March, June, September and December. *********** Five-year notes are auctioned late in the second month of each calendar quarter. The next issue has not been announced, but is expected Feb. 22. **********A recorded message at the Bureau of the Public Debt provides information about Treasury securities 24 hours a day.

Other reports have shown a weakening in the revivals in housing, retail sales and other areas of the economy during July. **********Mr. Cross added that the drop in orders could be partly attributed to the rise in interest rates during the summer and partly to the fact that the strong growth in the economy during the second quarter was not sustainable in the long run. **********Robert Wescott of Wharton Econometrics agreed, noting the declines in interest rate-sensitive durable goods - which are generally bought on credit. He said that it suggested that the Federal Reserve Board's credit- tightening moves over the summer ''are starting to bite into the economy a little.'' **********Shipments of goods were also down and Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige called the slides in the two indicators ''most likely temporary setbacks.'' **********Mr. Baldrige also noted that inventories held by manufacturers rose four-tenths of 1 percent, the largest one-month increase since November 1981, and said it ''indicates that the recovery is proceeding in typical fashion.'' **********Mr. Baldrige warned that inventory rebuilding - and the increased short-term corporate borrowing needed to finance such stocks - could put further upward pressure on interest rates ''if Government borrowing is not reduced quickly.'' **********In addition to the slump for durable goods, the report showed a slowing in the rise in orders for nondurable goods. Such orders rose two-tenths of 1 percent in July after increasing 2.5 percent and 3 percent in June and May, respectively. **********Orders for durable goods totaled $87.7 billion compared with $90.9 billion in June. Orders for nondurable goods totaled $87.8 billion compared with $87.6 billion in June. **********Before July, the last decline in overall orders was the 3.1 percent drop in February. Last month's was the second decline since orders reached a low of $152.4 billion last October, the report said. **********The report also showed that the value of inventories held by manufacturers rose four-tenths of 1 percent, to $258.4 billion, offsetting the three- tenths of 1 percent decline in June. Inventories had fallen 13 consecutive months before hitting a low in March and ''since then the level has somewhat stabilized,'' the report said. **********Orders for capital goods industries - covering items used for future modernization and expansion - fell 12.2 percent, to $28.3 billion, including declines for transportation equipment and nonelectrical machinery. That also included a 15.1 percent drop for the volatile category of military capital goods such as aircraft and missiles. Such orders had surged 66 percent in June. **********Orders for nonmilitary capital goods fell 11.3 percent. **********The 5.1 percent June gain in overall orders is a revision from the previously reported 3.9 percent increase. **********All figures are adjusted to discount for normal seasonal variations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/12/business/regulators-will-submit-bill-on-foreign-lending.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1983-04-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 712, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REGULATORS WILL SUBMIT BILL ON FOREIGN LENDING", "print_headline": "REGULATORS WILL SUBMIT BILL ON FOREIGN LENDING", "body_text": " **********The Federal Reserve Board and other bank regulators said today that legislation placing restraints on American bank lending abroad was unnecessary but that they would go along with it if it was ''not unduly rigid or inconsistent.'' **********Paul A. Volcker, the Fed chairman, along with C.T. Conover, Comptroller of the Currency, and William M. Isaac, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, defended their own package of proposals to restrain lending abroad. They testified at a Senate Banking Committee hearing. **********In submitting their joint recommendations last week, the regulators had insisted that legislation was unnecessary because they already had a mandate under earlier legislation to tighten the controls. **********Under prodding, however, the regulators agreed to put their proposals, which impose higher costs on banks with large amounts of loans to financially troubled countries, into a draft bill by the end of this week. **********The Banking Committee is considering an $8.4 billion increase in the American contribution to the International Monetary Fund. This 144-nation institution lends to debtor countries willing to reduce their budget deficits and accept other conditions that would help them improve their international accounts. The American increase would be part of a $40 billion rise in I.M.F. resources sought by the agency to meet the demands of developing countries asking for new credits to help pay their huge foreign debts. **********The lending restraints on American bank loans abroad have become the quid pro quo of Congressional approval of the expanded American participation in the I.M.F. American banks now have more than $100 billion in loans abroad. **********Senator Jake Garn, the Banking Committee chairman, said he hoped Congress would not ''overreact'' but promised that there would be a legislated restraint package. **********''Believe me, there will be legislation,'' said Senator Garn, a Republican from Utah. ''The bottom line is that the legislation is necessary so we can go home and say we are not bailing out the banks.'' **********Critics of the I.M.F. bill have held that the extra money would be used by the debtor countries to repay or bail out the banks. Others argue that the fund requires that the banks put up fresh loans to countries that get I.M.F. credits and that thus it is a ''bailing in'' operation. **********Today's hearing brought out the fact that the regulators had been divided over some of the provisions of their joint proposals. Mr.  Isaac, the F.D.I.C. chairman, had wanted tougher action than the others. **********Mr. Isaac acknowledged under questioning from Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania, that he ''personally would have liked to have seen something greater done'' on requiring banks to set up reserves against their nonperforming loans to financially troubled countries. **********Banks generally oppose greater reserves because the money is taken out of earnings and has to be set aside in accounts that bear no interest. Special Reserves Proposed **********The regulators' plan calls for initial special reserves equal to 10 percent of the problem loans, rising in 15 percent annual increments. Before these special reserves must actually be set aside, however, a debtor country would in effect have to be flat on its back, demonstrating in the words of the proposal ''protracted debt service problems.'' Among other things, it would have to miss interest payments for six months, fail to comply with I.M.F. or bank restructuring plans and lack prospects for the ''orderly restoration of debt service in the near future.'' **********Mr. Isaac said he would have begun to require special reserves at an earlier stage and at a lower threshhold.  Mr. Conover said he thought Mr. Isaac might have had a valid point, but he warned against precipitating huge withdrawals by banks from international lending. He noted, for example, the recent difficulties in getting banks to provide an additional $5 million in loans to Mexico as part of that country's adjustment program. **********''What we don't want to do is to cause international lending to come screeching to a halt at a time when it must continue,'' the Comptroller declared. **********Mr. Volcker emphasized that ''abrupt action by lenders to withdraw from lending can only be mutually self-defeating.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/03/business/intercraft-industries-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 63, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERCRAFT INDUSTRIES CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "INTERCRAFT INDUSTRIES CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/26/business/company-reports-eastern-utilities-associates-n.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 17, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "** Company Reports ** EASTERN UTILITIES ASSOCIATES (N)", "print_headline": "** Company Reports ** EASTERN UTILITIES ASSOCIATES (N)", "body_text": " **********Qtr to March 31 1983 1982 Revenue 80,700,000 80,400,000 Net inc 8,500,000 5,600,000 Share earns .80 .69"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/29/world/a-glossary-of-the-terms-used-by-the-commission.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 581, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Glossary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A GLOSSARY OF THE TERMS USED BY THE COMMISSION", "print_headline": "A GLOSSARY OF THE TERMS USED BY THE COMMISSION", "body_text": " **********Following is a glossary of military terms used in the Long commission report on the bombing at the Marine headquarters in Beirut:  B.I.A.  - Beirut International Airport.

''I want him to tell us in plain language just what it is he wants to do relative to Nicaragua and other countries.'' At Odds With House Plan **********Under current law, the President is required to inform the intelligence committees of covert actions, but the committees have no right to disapprove them.

Critics of the President's plan say the purpose is to disrupt the Nicaraguan Government. **********President Reagan, speaking in Phoenix, warned today that Congressional committees were ''indifferent to another Communist takeover on our doorstep,'' and added: ''Running away from this clear-cut responsibility would reward aggression and bring dishonor to the good name of the United States. It would swell the tide of political and economic instability, creating a new army of refugees and bring danger closer and closer to home.'' **********Meanwhile, Powell Moore, Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Relations, reaffirmed that the number of American military training officers in El Salvador had not exceeded 55 since the spring of 1981. He said, however, the Reagan Administration hoped Congress would not seek to restrict the training programs. A Letter to Percy **********''To the extent that available funds permit, we would be prepared to provide additional training at facilities outside of El Salvador,'' he wrote in a letter to Senator Charles H. Percy, the Illinois Republican who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ''At the same time, we would strongly oppose any rigid legislative constraint that would preclude reasonable modifications to the structure of our training program that might be advisable.'' **********Mr. Moore said the Administration would ''reprogram'' $30 million in foreign military sales guarantees to El Salvador, the amount approved by the House Appropriations Committee's subcommittee on foreign operations and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The White House had requested $60 million. **********He said, however, that the Administration intended to proceed with allocating $140 million in economic support for the Government of El Salvador, $25 million more than the Senate Foreign Relations Committee advised. **********The two committee members who voted against the compromise were both Republicans - Senators John H.

Expect bigger price rises ahead. **********Because of increased demand for goods and services, a slow restocking of inventories and more money chasing the same goods because of previously loose money policy, retailers are bound to start their markups soon, say the soothsayers. **********This means that modest rises in consumer prices, which edged up by only two-tenths of 1 percent in May to a 2.4 percent annual rate, will become just a memory. Economists predict a more sobering 6 percent and higher rate of increase for the rest of 1983, to an average of 3.9 percent for the year. **********''It is the inescapable outcome of high money growth,'' contends Robert R. Davis, vice president and economist at the Harris Bank in Chicago. **********Raymond T. Dalio, president of the forecasting firm of Bridgewater Associates in Wilton, Conn., says, ''Prices are going to come back up a lot quicker than people think. With the economy picking up so rapidly, people are going to get aggressive and start raising prices.'' In the final analysis? ''Inflation will approach 8 percent by the end of the year and turn higher in 1984 as labor gets stronger in its negotiating position.''Currencies Awry **********The French were shocked. Le Monde queried in a banner headline: ''8 francs pour 1 dollar?'' The Germans and Japanese were stunned, too. The almightly dollar flexed its muscle and roughed up a few of its trading partners last week. While the United States Government intervened - selling dollars to buy the weaker foreign currencies - the dollar stayed strong. Now analysts are saying that it will take another six to eight weeks to beat back the greenback. **********David D. Hale, chief economist for Kemper Financial Services Inc., Chicago, says it would take a change in fiscal or monetary policy to turn the dollar around effectively. He calls the intervention ''cosmetic.'' **********''People have decided that monetary policy will be restrictive and the dollar is the place to be,'' he says. Since the reasons to hold dollars are not entirely economic - they are also an investment in current political stability - he thinks that ''demand will continue for a while.''Casinos Playing to Win **********The tables are jumping at America's casinos. And if gamblers keep rolling the dice at the same pace as in the first half of the year, casinos in Atlantic City and Las Vegas will collect their highest revenues ever. **********Atlantic City, predictably, is ecstatic. Hotel bookings are up, car and bus traffic to the boardwalk is surging and gross casino revenues jumped to $804 million in the first half of this year, from $667 million this time last year. By 1987, four new casino hotels are slated to join the nine already in the game. ''We think it's fantastic,'' says Patrick Killian, programs coordinator for the Atlantic City Casino Hotel Association. **********Rossi Ralenkotter, director of tourism and research in Las Vegas, was equally pleased. ''It looks very strong,'' he said. Convention bookings in Vegas are up 25 percent and the number of convention goers may break the one-million mark for the first time ever this year. First-half gross casino revenue there is $930.7 million, up from $893.1 million this time last year. **********Mr. Ralenkotter credits the improved economy for the spending spurt."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/11/world/around-the-world-3-israeli-soldiers-slain-in-ambush-in-lebanon.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 254, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "3 Israeli Soldiers Slain In Ambush in Lebanon", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; 3 Israeli Soldiers Slain In Ambush in Lebanon", "body_text": " **********Palestinian guerrillas ambushed and killed three Israeli soldiers today in an attack seven miles northeast of the port of Tyre, the Israeli command announced.

Couriers and planes race to overtake rivals while hapless customers grow beards and miss business opportunities. **********For the industry, things are frantic, too. Just yesterday, Emery Worldwide started an overnight letter service that is now cheaper than the Federal Express Corporation's and handles up to four ounces, compared with two ounces for Federal. The day before, Purolator Courier, a subsidiary of Purolator Inc., had offered an overnight letter at a price that undercuts even that of the Postal Service. **********And all the companies involved in the overnight small package delivery business have also been offering discounts of up to 50 percent to lure big-volume customers. **********The reason for the fast-paced price cutting and discounting: The deliverers are awash in overcapacity following the rapid buildup of their aircraft fleets. At the same time, the weak economy has finally caught up with the industry. **********Even Federal Express, industry pioneer and giant, is concerned.  Although the company is handling 30 percent more packages than a year ago, Peter S. Willmott, president and chief operating officer, said, ''Growth has been slowed by the economy.'' Rivals Have Restructured **********Mr. Willmott also said that Federal Express faced greater competition since the restructuring of Emery and another rival, the Airborne Freight Corporation. Both have moved from being freight forwarders, which used existing airlines, into companies that, like Federal Express, have their own fleet of planes and hub operations.  They now compete directly for a larger share of the small package market - up to 70 pounds - and offer big discounts. **********Nonetheless, Federal Express apparently feels sure enough of its clientele that yesterday it raised the cost of an overnight letter of up to two ounces to $12.50, from $11. **********Adding to the pressure on the established overnight deliverers is an aggressive new entrant, the United Parcel Service of America Inc., which began overnight service to metropolitan areas last Sept.24, with 24 aircraft. Last November, United Parcel expanded its service to more major cities and now uses 33 aircaft to make deliveries by 3 P.M. the following day at about half the price of its rivals. Also, a Rival Technology **********With traditional competition growing, the industry is also facing a technological challenge: facsimile transmission. A nationwide network could offer delivery of letters and documents almost instantly, undermining the highly profitable air-delivery business.  Federal Express has already made preparations to maintain its edge; with 60 percent of the company's shipments made up of letters and documents, it will start its own transmission network if it has to. **********The U.P.S. challenge is having little direct effect on business so far, executives of Federal, Emery and Airborne said in interviews.  The executives said that their companies offer faster pickup, earlier delivery and superior ability to trace shipments than U.P.S. **********Also the discounts offered to high-volume customers have moved the rates closer to those charged by U.P.S. With the discount, the usual rate for overnight delivery for up to two pounds - about $21 - is reduced to $13 or $14, close to the U.P.S. $11. Large Customer Base **********But U.P.S. has a large customer base and a truck fleet that can deliver the overnight shipments sorted at its Louisville, Ky., hub to 29,755 communities. **********''U.P.S. has a history of being methodical and persistent and being extremely successful eventually,'' Peter R. Schlesinger, an analyst for the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, said. ''They are a very profitable company with substantial amounts of capital available for a venture like this. They can take their time.'' **********As Mr. Willmott of Federal Express put it: ''U.P.S. will be in the overnight business for a long time. This is not a six-month drill.'' To meet the threat, Federal Express has moved up its overnight delivery time from noon, the industry norm, to 10:30 A.M. Mr.  Willmott said that the company may go to 10 A.M. **********Federal is also promoting its second-day delivery service, a market dominated by U.P.S., and has lowered its rates to volume shippers.  Mr. Willmott said that his company now handles 20,000 second-day shipments, up from 7,000 last year. A Major Effort **********Meanwhile, Emery will make a major effort this year to increase its share of the under-70-pound market, which its chairman, John C. Emery Jr., predicted would grow 25 percent this year for the industry.  Emery's forte is moving heavy air freight. **********To put itself in a better position, Emery in April will start the first same-day service. The service, under which a shipment will be picked up in the morning and delivered in the afternoon, will be costly - at least $150 more a shipment. **********Airborne has not made any changes recently. Its overnight service costs $19 for a single letter weighing up to three ounces. If there is also a shipment going with the letter, the letter costs $10. **********Purolator Courier, which up to now has handled mainly packages, and those mostly by truck, has also entered the overnight-letter market.  On Monday it began to ship up to two ounces for $8.75. Will Pick Up the Letters **********At that price, the new service undercuts the rates for express mail service of the Postal Service, which charges $9.35. And unlike the Postal Service, Purolator - and the other private companies - will pick up the letters from its customers. **********Arthur DeMelle, senior vice president of finance, said that the company had extra capacity in its fleet of 3,700 trucks and 90 chartered aircraft to absorb the new business. **********Emery and Airborne also have extra capacity, because of expansions forced on the deliverers by changes in airline service in the 1970's. As jumbo jets were phased in, most airlines cut back flights, particularly at night, when most overnight freight is moved. This made it difficult for a company without its own fleet of planes to remain competitive. **********Then in 1977, the air cargo industry was deregulated. Companies in the air freight business were no longer limited to aircraft that could hold only 7,500 pounds. **********Mr. Emery said that his company was forced to invest $120 million to build a sorting center, set up a hub in Dayton, Ohio, and buy its own air fleet. And to be competitive, Emery had to offer service nationwide all at once. **********''You couldn't say, 'I'll deliver to Los Angeles but not to El Paso,' '' Mr. Emery said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/06/world/pope-warns-25-us-bishops-on-sex-morals.html": {"writer_name": "Henry Kamm", "pub_date": "1983-09-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 662, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "POPE WARNS 25 U.S. BISHOPS ON SEX MORALS", "print_headline": "POPE WARNS 25 U.S. BISHOPS ON SEX MORALS", "body_text": " **********Pope John Paul II repeated Roman Catholic teaching against abortion, divorce, the ordination of women, birth control, premarital sex and homosexuality today in a speech to 25 visiting United States bishops. **********Church sources suggested the Pope chose the Americans as his forum because he considers the United States a center of sexual liberalism and believes elements within the church in the United States to be sympathetic to such views.

Vatican sources noted in all the strictures a particulary defensive tone and an acknowledgment of the widespread unpopularity of the Roman Catholic doctrine, which the Pope appears to believe is particularly unwelcome among Catholics in the United States. **********The Pope restated his absolute exclusion of women from priestly functions. He did so, it was believed, because it was in the United States that he was most openly confronted with opposition from within the church on this issue. **********After declaring his support for the dignity of women and their right to ''every legitimate freedom that is consonant with their human nature and their womanhood,'' he told the bishops to be firm in rejecting any claim that women could serve as priests.   Exclude Women Priests **********''In this regard he must likewise endeavor to explain as cogently as he can that the church's teaching on the exclusion of women from priestly ordination is extraneous to the issue of discrimination and that it is linked rather to Christ's own design for his priesthood,'' the Pope said. **********''The bishop must give proof of his pastoral ability and leadership by withdrawing all support from individuals or groups who in the name of progress, justice or compassion, or for any other alleged reason, promote the ordination of women to the priesthood,'' the Pope said. ''In so doing, such individuals or groups are in effect damaging the very dignity of women that they profess to promote and advance.'' **********In Washington, during his visit to the United States in October 1979, a nun turned an expected address of welcome into a demand for the admission of women to the ministry. The nun, Sister M.

Less Formidable Than Believed **********On the question of Soviet air defenses, military analysts inside and outside the Government, having sifted through the evidence, said it revealed the air defenses to be less formidable than previously believed. They suggested Soviet actions had been a consequence of military confusion and rigidity rather than careful calculation. **********In the Soviet Union, the Air Defense Forces are a service arm separate from the Air Force, Army, Navy and Strategic Missile Forces. With 600,000 troops, it is divided into three branches - electronic detection, with 6,000 radars; aviation, with 3,000 interceptors, and missiles, with 12,000 surface- to-air missiles. **********According to some specialists, the need for the regional command in Far Eastern Siberia to communicate with Moscow accounted for the two and a half hours that the airliner was tracked before being shot down. Soviet spokesmen have said the decision to shoot down the plane was made by local commanders.   Border Regulations Tightened **********Under a recent law on Soviet national frontiers, the Air Defense Forces are understood to have received new regulations on guarding the boundaries. Specialists said the tightened controls undoubtedly governed Soviet actions against the South Korean plane. **********The specialists said radar was critical to Soviet air defense since all operations were controlled from the ground. **********''A Soviet pilot,'' said one specialist, ''is little more than a guided missile.'' **********Another said: ''The only thing a Soviet pilot does is to take off and land his plane. The rest is controlled from the ground.'' **********An Air Force officer said Soviet radar equipment, whether on the ground or in planes, lagged behind that of the United States and was not able to distinguish between the United States Air Force's RC-135 reconnaissance plane and the Korean Air Lines 747 in the same area, despite their differences in size and shape. **********Most Soviet radar operators are officers who have been given four years of training and hold the equivalent of engineeering degrees. Even so, an inexperienced operator could well have been confused by the appearance of two blips on his scope. **********Intelligence operations in the Soviet Union are highly compartmentalized, so that information from one unit is handed to another only slowly. Specialists speculated that information on air control radio transmissions from the South Korean plane, monitored by Soviet intelligence, was not made available to air defense radar operators."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/27/world/lebanon-cease-fire-accord.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 198, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LEBANON CEASE-FIRE ACCORD", "print_headline": "LEBANON CEASE-FIRE ACCORD", "body_text": " **********Following is the text of the cease-fire agreement in Lebanon as made public today by the Lebanese Government and translated by The Associated Press from the Arabic: **********- An immediate halt to fighting on Lebanese territory, on all fronts and demarcation lines.

Shcharansky has said that after an unsuccessful effort to visit her son in prison she still has no evidence that he has abandoned his four-month hunger strike. **********The dissident's mother, Ida P. Milgrom, said Friday that she was still awaiting a letter that her son told her in a note he would send on Jan. 25 or 26 and that she believes would establish whether he is still fasting. **********Mrs. Milgrom said she was told by the prison authorities that her son was being force-fed two or three times a week, and she concluded from his note and from its handwriting that his health was critical. **********After Mrs. Milgrom returned from her trip to Chistopol Prison, 500 miles east of Moscow, last week, reports from Paris said Yuri V.  Andropov, the Soviet leader, had told Georges Marchais, the French Communist Party leader, that Mr. Shcharansky had had contact with his mother and had abandoned his hunger strike. **********Andropov's Letter to Marchais **********''Nothing endangers his life,'' Mr. Andropov reportedly wrote in the letter to Mr. Marchais. Mr. Andropov's letter was dated Jan. 21, a week after Mrs. Milgrom was alowed to exchange notes with her son at Chistopol. **********In his note to her, Mr. Shcharansky said that if he got confirmation that she had received his message he would end his hunger strike. The next five lines were blacked out by the prison warden, Mrs. Milgrom said, and then Mr. Shcharansky continued that he would write her on Jan. 25 or 26. **********After more than a year without any communication with her son, Mrs. Milgrom said she needed more evidence than Mr. Andropov's letter to convince her that Mr. Shcharansky had resumed eating. **********''What basis do I have to believe he quit the hunger strike?'' she asked. ''None. If he has, why don't they let his letter through?  Certainly they'd want to get out any confirmation that he had gone off the strike.'' Telegram to Andropov **********Mrs. Milgrom sent a telegram to Mr. Andropov on Thursday demanding confirmation that Mr. Shcharansky had ended his fast, that he be hospitalized and that she be allowed to visit him. **********Mr. Shcharansky, who is 35 years old and an activist in the human rights and Jewish emigration movements, was arrested in March 1977 and later sentenced to 13 years at hard labor on charges of spying for the United States. Last Sept. 27 he declared a hunger strike to protest that the authorities had totally blocked correspondence with his family, despite regulations that permit one letter per month. **********Mrs. Milgrom said the exchange of notes with her son was the first communication they had in 13 months, and she won it after 10 days of standing outside the walls of Chistopol and imploring officials to allow her a visit. **********The small, frail woman of 74 arrived in Chistopol on Jan. 3, expected an allotted visit - one is supposed to be allowed every six months - on Jan. 4. But the warden, Alexander N. Romanov, told her that because Mr. Shcharansky was still fasting he was denied the visit. Visit in July Was Denied **********Mrs. Milgrom's last meeting with her son was on Jan. 4, 1982. The next allotted visit, last July, was denied on grounds of unspecified misbehavior. When she was denied a visit again this month, Mrs.  Milgrom besieged the prison. She said she went daily to the gates and would stay until she could take the cold no more. After warming up at a store, she would return, again demanding to see the warden, the medical oficer and her son. **********At one point she was allowed an interview with the head of the medical section, who confirmed that Mr. Shcharansky was being forcefed. After 10 days, Mr. Romanov received Mrs. Milgrom, and he and a K.G.B. oficial told her that she could exchange notes with her son. As she wrote, they ordered her to scratch out any reference to Mr. Shcharansky's wife, Avital, who emigrated to Israel in 1974, and to include phrases urging her son to abide by prison rules. She acceded to the former and refused the latter. **********When Mr. Shcharansky's return message came, Mrs. Milgrom said the warden blacked out 5 1/2 of the 19 lines and let her keep the note only for a minute. When she saw the note, Mrs. Milgrom said, she was horrified by the handwriting. The lines were faint, shaky and uneven, the writing of an extremely weak person, she said. 'Anxiety and Pain' **********From her recollection, Mr. Shcharansky's note read, referring to his mother and his wife: ''Dear Mamochka, I know how much anxiety and pain you and Natalya have had over the past year, and it was because of my concern for your peace of mind that I took this extreme step.  If I receive confirmation that you got my note, I'll quit this hunger strike.'' **********Here the lines were blacked out, and then the note continued: ''I will write you a letter on Jan. 25 or 26. If I could still write after all I went through in 1981 that my health was good, then I cannot write this now. I have a total absence of strength, I have constant headaches, dizziness, fever, changes in blood pressure.'' **********From the prison Mrs. Milgrom traveled to Kazan, a regional capital, where she confronted the chief local medical officer with demands that her son be hospitalized. His answer, she said, was that he would consider hospitalization only if Mr. Shcharansky ended his fast."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/22/world/john-paul-says-future-of-poland-depends-on-restoration-of-trust.html": {"writer_name": "Henry Kamm", "pub_date": "1983-06-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1210, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JOHN PAUL SAYS FUTURE OF POLAND DEPENDS ON RESTORATION OF TRUST", "print_headline": "JOHN PAUL SAYS FUTURE OF POLAND DEPENDS ON RESTORATION OF TRUST", "body_text": " **********Pope John Paul II said today that the future of Poland depended on restoration of mutual trust in all fields, including politics. **********''The whole Polish nation must live in mutual trust,'' the Pope said in a homily delivered at the race track on the edge of this southwestern industrial city as huge crowds listened, mainly in reflective silence. **********''Indeed, it must regain this trust in the widest circle of its social existence,'' he said. ''I will not hesitate to say that there depends precisely on this - first and foremost on this - the future of our homeland.'' **********Regime Moves to Counter Pope **********Moreover, the Pope said, ''the existence of the Polish state'' depends on such trust.  The Polish Government, meanwhile, sought today to rebut some of the statements the Pope has made in his eight-day Polish tour, which began last Thursday. The Government had earlier made known its displeasure at the politicial effect of the Pope's homilies, warning through a spokesman that continued opposition protests would harm relations between church and state. **********Deputy Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski, apparently alluding to the Pope, charged in an interview published in papers around the country today that an educator was feeding Polish youths ''myths, legends and half-truths.'' (Page A6.) **********Some diplomats suggested that the reason the Deputy Prime Minister was the first official to criticize the Pope publicly, though obliquely, was that the Rakowski wing of the party is likely to come under attack from hard-line Moscow-backed elements after the papal tour ends for having allowed a propaganda setback. **********Late in the day, the Polish press agency P.A.P. distributed an unsigned commentary that left ''the implications of the statements made by the distinguished guest on Poland's domestic questions'' for future comment. But it said his statements about the ancient Polish character of the region ''cannot give reasons for any equivocal assessments.'' It added, ''There are no differences on this matter among Poles.'' **********John Paul seemed to speak directly to the people of this city, a stronghold of the outlawed Solidarity trade union, when he said, ''There are many people, a great many people, who hunger and thirst for righteousness.'' **********Later, the Pope flew by helicopter to St. Ann's Mountain for a visit to a 15th-century monastery and then to Cracow, where he is expected to meet on Thursday with Lech Walesa, the former Solidarity leader. **********The Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, where Mr. Walesa works as an electrician, has given the former union leader today, Wednesday and Thursday off to allow him to meet the Pope, an aide said today in a telephone interview. Mr. Walesa is expected to drive to Cracow on Wednesday. Some Compensation for Regime **********Whatever discomfort the Pope has given the Government by his continued defense of Solidarity, he may have compensated for partly with his references to the Polish character of Wroclaw, which was a German city called Breslau until 1945. The fact that the Pope came here is, for the Government, an affirmation of legitimacy for its postwar borders. **********Pointedly, the altar erected between two grandstands at the Wroclaw race track was flanked by the seals of all the major cities that were German until 1945 and are Polish today. **********In his homily, the Pope went beyond merely affirming Polish legitmacy. He also called for ''reciprocal understanding and reconciliation'' between the Polish and German peoples. **********After the mass, fewer than a hundred youths, carrying banners and shouting support for Solidarity, began a march through the city but dispersed on running into policemen armed with riot sticks and water cannon. **********(During the demonstration, the police took two British reporters and two others - Thomas Sancton of Time magazine's Paris bureau and a translator - into custody, holding them, according to Reuters, for more than two hours.  In Washington, Metromedia News said that its three-man television crew was detained while filming in the Wroclaw streets and that its film was confiscated.) **********For the mass at Wroclaw, John Paul flew by helicopter this morning from Czestochowa, landing at the race track, where crowds estimated at about one million were waiting for him. **********The Pope was understood by the crowds - and they showed it by applause at key passages - when he spoke of ''the hunger and thirst for righteousness that has been manifested in a particular way during these recent years.'' **********''I greatly desire,'' he said, ''as a pastor of the church and also as a son of my nation to confirm this hunger and thirst, which springs from the healthy resources of the Polish spirit, from a sense of the dignity of human work, from love of the homeland and from solidarity, that is to say, from a sense of the common good.'' 'Preserve This Just Hunger' **********His allusion to the labor movement became its defense when John Paul continued: ''At the same time, I would like to preserve this just hunger and thirst of the great multitudes of my compatriots from all that would distort it and weaken it. But at the same time, I would like also to liberate and defend it from all unjust objections and accusations, from wherever they might come.'' **********In his subsequent visit to St. Ann's Mountain, the Pope was greeted by tens of thousands of Poles who had walked to the monastery on the summit, 1,200 feet above sea level. At the shrine, he paid tribute to ''those who once in this land did not hesitate to sacrifice their lives on the field of battle.'' **********Besides affirming the Polish character of this Silesian region, the Pope's visit marked a major step in the Vatican's formal acceptance of Germany's loss of the territory. **********In 1966, a papal visit to Poland, after Pope Paul VI had accepted a church invitation to attend the celebrations of the millenium of Roman Catholicism in Poland, could not be negotiated because the Vatican refused to meet the Polish Government's demand that a visit be paid to Wroclaw in return for the right to visit the sanctuary in Czestochowa. **********In 1970, West Germany accepted the loss of Silesia, Pomerania and East Prussia, and two years later the Vatican reorganized dioceses to integrate those areas under Polish church administration. Today's visit by the Pope completed the church's recognition. **********---- Pope Visits Cracow Special to the New York Times **********CRACOW, Poland, June 21 - Pope John Paul II arrived today in Cracow, the ancient city of Polish kings, on the last leg of his Polish tour. **********Huge crowds massed around the field where his helicopter landed as dusk fell and along the route to his old residence, the palace of the Archbishop of Cracow, where he lived as Karol Cardinal Wojtyla until 1978. **********John Paul was born in Wadowice, in the hills west of Cracow.

''We have to protect our interests on the Hill.''

As a rule, bank stocks now trade at slightly under 8 times their trailing 12-month earnings, compared with a multiple of just below 12 for the average stock. Loan-loss problems at several Texas banks underscore this fact. **********Earlier this month the Interfirst Corporation, the largest bank holding company in Texas, made an announcement that sent shock waves through Wall Street. Interfirst, generally held in high repute for its banking acumen, reported a $194 million operating loss for its third quarter, described as the biggest in a three-month period for any American bank. **********The quarterly loss at Interfirst reflected $334 million in charge-offs for bad loans, mainly in the oil and gas sector. Energy loan losses, in fact, have constituted a growing problem for a number of banks in the Southwest. Interfirst also raised its provision for loan losses to $430 million. **********In response to the third-quarter loss, which was in contrast to a profit of $1.05 a share a year earlier, shares of Interfirst dipped last week to 17 1/8, their lowest price since August 1982, before finishing at 18 1/4, down 1 1/2 points. Yesterday the shares were unchanged at 18 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. The record price was 32 3/8 in mid-1981. **********Interfirst is expected to show a deficit for the calendar year 1983, and analysts have pared their 1984 earnings estimates for the company, although they generally describe the bank's annual dividend rate of $1.20 a common share as secure. **********In April of this year Charles H. Lott, president of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., took a relatively optimistic view of the fortunes of Interfirst, despite the management's forecast of a drop in first-quarter earnings. He has followed the Dallas-based holding company for a quarter century. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyzes more banks than any other Big Board member firm. **********''I think that if the stock is bought at current prices, it will become over the next 6 to 18 months one of the most rewarding investments in the banking industry,'' Mr. Lott said on April 12, when Interfirst's shares closed at 19 1/8. Later the stock traded in the low 20's, before its recent setback. **********When asked yesterday about his current appraisal, Mr. Lott acknowledged that ''the impact of loan losses for the third quarter was more severe than we had expected.'' **********He added: ''I would make the same general statement today about the company's prospects, but I would take a longer time horizon of one year to two years. Over the short term, the stock could be affected adversely by tax-loss selling, since it recently reached a 52-week low.'' **********Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins Inc. was more prescient last spring about prospects for Interfirst's stock performance. The firm predicted then that the stock would drop ''into the mid- to high teens.'' **********At Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Lawrence W. Cohn said yesterday that his firm had recently lowered its rating on Interfirst, along with that of the First City Bancorporation of Texas, from ''hold'' to ''hold/sell.'' He described the latter designation as ''a run-of-the-mill sell.'' The analyst added, ''We never dreamed that loan losses at Interfirst might run so high.'' **********Shares of First City traded last week at a 1983 low of 19 1/8 on the Big Board. This followed an earlier disclosure by the Houston-based bank holding company that it expected third-quarter earnings to fall about 85 percent, reflecting an extraordinary increase in loan-loss provisions. Yesterday First City's stock declined 1/4, to 19 1/2, on the Big Board. **********Dean Witter has published an estimate of $2.25 a share for 1984 earnings at Interfirst. But, like several other analysts, Mr. Cohn said precise projections are something of a guess at this time. **********Robert B. Albertson of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company is somewhat more optimistic. He estimated next year's profit at $3.10 a share. However, this is 45 cents a share below the firm's forecast before disclosure of the bank's third- quarter results. Meanwhile, Smith Barney has upgraded its opinion on the stock from ''avoid'' to ''hold.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/24/world/us-soviet-tension-believed-to-bring-ties-to-low-point.html": {"writer_name": "Hedrick Smith", "pub_date": "1983-05-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1904, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S.-SOVIET TENSION BELIEVED TO BRING TIES TO LOW POINT", "print_headline": "U.S.-SOVIET TENSION BELIEVED TO BRING TIES TO LOW POINT", "body_text": " **********Soviet-American relations have reached one of the lowest points in a generation as the two nations trade recriminations over the Middle East, Central America, Afghanistan and missile deployments in Europe, according to many Government and academic specialists. **********The specialists regard the three years since the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in December 1979 as a time of protracted tension, sharp and acrimonious charges, diplomatic stalemate and mutual suspicion. Soviet visitors as well as American officials speak warily of the prospects for ''doing business'' with the other side. **********President Reagan suggested last week that a meeting with Yuri V.  Andropov could take place next year, and White House aides say that by sharply stepping up military spending and by speaking out forcefully against Moscow, Mr. Reagan has demonstrated resolve, bolstered American military strength and set the stage for what one official called ''a new season'' of more productive bargaining with Moscow. Talks on Grain Sales to Resume **********Senior Administration officials take comfort in the fact that the two sides have agreed to start long-term negotiations on grain sales. They also forecast more active probing in the Geneva negotiations on European nuclear weapons and strategic arms as a result of adjustments in American positions. **********Apart from arms talks, however, most cooperative activities have been shrinking. The volume of Soviet-United States trade has fallen from $4.5 billion in 1979 to $2.8 billion last year, to the point where the United States now supplies only 20 percent of Soviet grain imports, compared with 60 percent in earlier periods. 11 Commissions Suspended **********The activities of eight official groups set up under the Carter Administration to work on a treaty to bar satellite warfare, ban nuclear weapons in the Indian Ocean or develop a comprehensive underground test ban have lapsed. Eleven commissions set up a decade ago to work out exchanges in the fields of science and technology, seismic research, health research and developments in space have all been suspended. **********The downward trend began under the Carter Administration, but it has quickened during the Reagan period, in which a determined but unsuccessful drive was carried on to block the Soviet natural gas pipeline to Western Europe and to tighten curbs on Western trade with Moscow. **********''I don't know of a time when our relations have been worse at an official level,'' one experienced unofficial Presidential adviser commented. ''The mutual suspicions are very high. There's very little real dialogue going on. To cut through that will not be easy because I don't think either side wants to be seen coming to the other hat in hand.'' **********''The atmosphere is bad,'' said Helmut Sonnenfeldt, who was a ranking specialist on Soviet affairs in the Nixon Administration.  ''The Soviets are trying to heat up the Middle East and talk people into greater anxiety about the missile deployments in Europe. They're ominous in their tone. The arms negotiations are stalemated, though the nature of these negotiations is that they take five, six, seven years to succeed. The Russians are playing hard to get.'' 'A Period of Stalemate' **********''There have been periods of accommodation in the past and periods of sharp confrontation, but this is essentially a period of stalemate,'' said Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was national security adviser to President Carter. ''Both sides have openings which neither has exploited aggressively. They are like two weary boxers who have been slugging each other. They're hostile. They've backed off.  They're not really talking to each other but they're not pressing each other on the ground.'' **********Marshall Shulman, director of the Russian Research Center at Columbia University and former Soviet affairs specialist in the Carter Administration, compared the present climate to the cold war period and the time of the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962. **********''Relations are on a low plateau -poor communications, tension, dismantling of cooperative activities, sharp rhetoric,'' Mr. Shulman said. ''There aren't any signs for improvement in the near future. **********''Indeed,'' he went on, ''some factors could make relations worse - our nuclear force deployments in Europe and possible Soviet countermoves; second, the question of whether each side will deploy new strategic weapons systems; third, some third world event, say in Iran; fourth, the Middle East and particularily Syria. These add an element of unpredictability.'' Kennan Takes Grim View **********The grimmest assessment came from George F. Kennan, former American Ambassador to the Soviet Union, who said recently that Soviet-American relations were in a ''dreadful and dangerous state'' and changes were needed to halt ''a march toward war.'' **********Others, like Prof. Adam Ulam of Harvard University, temper pessimism with the reminder that for all the obvious strains, the two superpowers have avoided the sort of head-to-head showdowns they experienced over Berlin in the cold war in the late 1940's and during the Cuban missile crisis. But, Mr. Ulam added, ''things are more dangerous now because the Russians are more powerful and we are weaker.'' **********One saving grace, several analysts said, is that both President Reagan and the new Soviet leadership are preoccupied with domestic economic problems that tend to make them less activist and adventurous abroad. **********Moreover, the approach of the 1984 elections has engendered hope that the current stalemates will ease as President Reagan seeks to rebut criticism of his posture toward Moscow and arms control. 'Peace Issue' in Election **********''There might be some moderation,'' Professor Shulman said, ''as the Administration gets closer to the 1984 election and concludes that there is political advantage in moving toward the center to take the peace issue from the Democrats.'' **********Brent Scowcroft, the retired Air Force general who served as President Ford's national security adviser, said his recent informal contacts with ranking Soviet visitors indicated the Russians were interested in serious bargaining on arms control. The Russians, he told reporters at breakfast, are ''open at the present time'' for serious give-and-take but also are ''defensive'' and ''apprehensive about this Administration.'' **********''Official relations are really very bad and there are not a number of good contacts,'' the former general said. ''One way to break out of that, considering the depth of suspicion if not antagonism, would be to initiate some private kind of talks without each side having to worry about caving in or making concessions - to attempt to clear away some of the underbrush. I wouldn't say that it can't be done through official channels, but it's more difficult.'' **********During the Nixon years, Henry A. Kissinger, then national security adviser, engaged in what became known as exploratory ''back channel'' discussions with the Soviet Ambassador, Anatoly F.  Dobrynin, that developed breakthroughs for the formal arms talks. Shultz-Dobrynin Meetings **********This year, Secretary of State George P. Shultz has held several meetings with Ambassador Dobrynin. Some officials see those meetings as a potential opening, but others report that Mr. Shultz has proceeded ''very carefully'' and that these contacts have so far been less ambitious and promising than Mr. Kissinger's earlier venture. **********''Shultz is a very capable guy but he's very careful,'' said one well-placed Reagan adviser. ''He likes to master his agenda. I don't think he's comfortable with that kind of exploration.'' **********Other officials contend, however, that even if this is the case now, Mr. Shultz will step up his role in Soviet-American relations in the coming months. **********Administration officials assert that Moscow cannot simply expect Washington to resurrect past agreements if they are unwilling to accept much of the burden for the current stalemate. The Russians, these officials charge, aggressively pushed pro-Soviet takeovers in Angola, Ethiopia, Southern Yemen and Afghanistan in the late 1970's, cut back sharply on the flow of Jewish emigration, took a tough line against dissidents and promoted the crackdown in Poland. **********''It would be easy to set up a summit and to move ahead if one essentially adopted the Soviet agenda of 'Let's have business as usual,' '' said Richard Burt, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs. ''The Soviet position is that the U.S. needs to resurrect the series of agreements and relationships that emerged in the 70's, known collectively as detente. Internal Crackdown Cited **********''But we have concerns that need to be taken into account as well if a durable U.S.-Soviet relationship is going to emerge,'' Mr. Burt went on in a meeting with reporters. ''We can't ignore the fact that there has been an increasing crackdown on different groups in the Soviet Union. **********''A lot of people say the reason detente broke down is Soviet behavior in the third world,'' Mr. Burt said. ''And there was a view in the 70's that signing arms agreements was going to lead to greater restraint on both sides. It did in the U.S. Our military spending slowed down in real terms. But Soviet spending did not. What we're asking the Soviets is to meet us half way.'' **********Some specialists contend the Administration is hampered because it lacks a top-level foreign policy-maker or strategist with the experience of Mr. Kissinger, Mr. Brzezinski or Mr. Scowcroft.  Neither Mr. Shultz, Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger nor William P. Clark, the national security adviser, has a background in Soviet affairs or strategic policy-making. **********For specialized advice, officials say, the President draws indirectly on Lawrence S. Eagleburger, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, a former Ambassador to Yugoslavia and close aide to Mr. Kissinger; Mr. Burt, a former specialist in national security affairs at the Institute for Strategic Studies; Fred C. Ikle, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, who is a past director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; Richard Perle, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy, a longtime Congressional aide experienced in arms control and Soviet affairs; and Robert C.  McFarlane, the deputy national security adviser, a career marine officer who served several years on the National Security Council staff in Republican administrations. Roles for 2 Junior Specialists **********With the departure from that staff of Richard Pipes, a Harvard historian, responsibility for Soviet and East European affairs fell several months ago to two well-regarded but quite junior specialists, John Lenczowski and Paula Dobriansky. **********Within the Administration, Mr. Eagleburger and Mr. Burt have reputations as advocates of some flexibility in dealing with Moscow, whereas Mr. Ikle and Mr. Perle are known as proponents of toughness.  Mr. McFarlane was the key figure lately in helping President Reagan work out the outline of shifts in his arms control positions with key members of Congress. **********Outside specialists cite that sequence as symptomatic of the Administration's inadequate expertise in Soviet and strategic affairs. They note that the two new concepts now being incorporated into the President's strategic arms proposal originated outside the Administration. **********The idea of raising previous limits on missile launchers to make way for a new single-warhead missile emerged from Democrats in Congress and was adopted by a bipartisan commission headed by Mr.  Scowcroft. Another new idea, that of requiring each side to destroy two existing nuclear warheads for each new warhead on a new missile or submarine, came from Senators William S. Cohen, a Maine Republican, and Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/29/business/gatx-profit-falls-59.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GATX Profit Falls 59%", "print_headline": "GATX Profit Falls 59%", "body_text": " **********The GATX Corporation, a leading manufacturer and lessor of capital equipment, including railroad cars and ocean vessels, today reported a 59 percent decline in fourth-quarter earnings, to $6.3 million, or 51 cents a share, from $15.4 million, or $1.19 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. **********Revenues dropped 19.6 percent, to $261 million, from $324.7 million.

Gustavo Alvarez Martinez, said in a recent interview. ''There's an important interest for the United States, which is regional security. For us it's a vital interest. **********''All this implies a price,'' the general added. ''With aid we can maintain peace. If you don't want to help us now, you'll have to pay a higher cost politically, logistically and in lives.''  Says U.S. Could Turn Elsewhere **********The general said if Washington increased military and economic aid to Honduras, ''the United States could devote itself to more important parts of the world.'' **********Although the general said he hoped coexistence was possible with the Sandinista Government in Nicaragua, high-ranking military and civilian officials in Honduras have said they are pessimistic about a peaceful solution with Nicaragua as well as with the Salvadoran leftist guerrillas. **********General Alvarez said Honduras was benefiting from the joint military exercises known as Big Pine II that began in August and are scheduled to end in March. ''We are learning to work jointly with U.S. troops,'' he said. ''Nobody knows what the future holds. We may have to work in the future with the United States.'' **********In recent weeks the Nicaraguans have charged that the United States, helped by Honduras, is planning to mount a military attack on their country. Nicaraguan fears were said to have risen during joint maneuvers last weekend, when 1,200 United States marines and 580 Honduran troops, supported by American tanks, helicopters and aircraft, landed on the northern Honduran coast. **********General Alvarez denied that Honduras had any intention of attacking Nicaragua. The reason for last weekend's amphibious exercise, he said, was that Honduras has a long, remote and poorly guarded coastline. He said the Nicaraguan armed forces and militia were larger than the combined armed forces of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. **********United States Embassy officials in Tegucigalpa estimate that the Nicaraguan regular armed forces number 25,000, supported by about 75,000 armed militia. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in 1982, the armed forces of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras total 49,500.   'Should Be Well Prepared' **********''History tells us about the record of Communist aggression,'' General Alvarez said. ''South Korea is suspected because it is armed by the United States. **********''In this case,'' he said, in reference to the political tensions in Central America, ''we should be well prepared.'' **********''Contadora is making a great effort,'' the general went on, referring to the negotiating group represented by diplomats from Mexico, Panama, Venezuela and Colombia. ''But no one can guarantee an acceptable arrangement with Nicaragua.'' **********General Alvarez spoke in his office with Seymour Topping, managing editor of The New York Times, and Bill Kovach, The Times's Washington editor. On the walls of his office hung pictures of American F-5 fighter jets and South African-made 155-millimeter howitzers, neither of which Honduras has. **********General Alvarez said the United States invasion of Grenada ''reinforced our faith in President Reagan.'' He said it showed Nicaragua ''that Cuba is not going to defend it.''  Wants Small, Mobile Army **********General Alvarez said Honduras needed small, well-armed and mobile armed forces instead of an expanded military force. He said his objectives were ''strategic mobility, air tactical mobility and firepower.'' **********Ultimately, he said, he hopes the armed forces of Honduras will increase from about 15,000 to 25,000. He said Congressional approval in Washington was essential to meet his goals. **********United States military sales and loans to Honduras totaled $38.3 million for the year, and economic aid was $95.8 million. Last summer the Honduran Army said it needed a minimum of $300 million over four years to modernize its armed forces. When the commission led by former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger came to Tegucigalpa in October, the Government of President Roberto Suazo Cordova said Honduras would need $1.2 billion in aid in the next 10 years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/10/business/tokyo-developers-bet-on-goofy-and-sushi.html": {"writer_name": "Terry Trucco", "pub_date": "1983-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1528, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TOKYO DEVELOPERS BET ON GOOFY AND SUSHI", "print_headline": "TOKYO DEVELOPERS BET ON GOOFY AND SUSHI", "body_text": " **********IN 1962, Chiharu Kawasaki, the first president of a two-year-old development company called Oriental Land, visited Disneyland and told Roy Disney, Walt Disney's brother and a Disney official, that one day he wanted to bring Disneyland to Japan. **********Next Friday, 21 years and millions of dollars later, Tokyo Disneyland, the first Disney theme park outside the United States, will officially open in Urayasu, 40 minutes from Tokyo. **********Indeed, Oriental Land, the project's developer, is betting $650 million -and some say its future - that Japan's age of leisure and affluence will guarantee that a Tokyo Disneyland, where Mickey Mouse bows to visitors, will have the same success as its two American counterparts. The park's master plan, design, technology and name were all purchased from Walt Disney Productions, which has not invested a cent in the project. **********''The economic and social situation here is much as it was in the United States in the mid-50's when Disneyland opened,'' says Frank P. Stanek, a Disney vice president who has supervised development of the site. Already many of Japan's existing amusement parks have begun upgrading facilities to try to compete with Disneyland. And analysts here say success for Tokyo Disneyland could result in eventual growth of new recreational sites, particularly theme parks, much as occurred in Los Angeles after the success of Disneyland. **********But success for the new park rests on some variables outside Oriental Land's control, including weather (Japan is colder and rainier than California and Florida, where Disney World is situated), transportation (direct train service will not be available for at least three years) and the entertainment whims of the Japanese. **********In addition, neither Oriental Land nor its joint owners, the Mitsui Real Estate Development Company, Japan's largest property concern, and the Keisei Electric Railway Company, has experience in running a large entertainment facility, although Disney is providing a fulltime team of American-trained consultants. **********But advance ticket sales so far have been brisk, with nearly 3 million sold, mostly for the period of April 15 to mid-July. Maximum daily admission to the park is 55,000 visitors, and Sundays and the upcoming Golden Week spring holidays in May are completely sold out. **********''Many people saw previews of Disneyland by special invitation and were quite impressed,'' says Hisamichi Sawa, a vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in Tokyo. ''We think it will be a big success.'' **********Oriental Land could use a big success. Since its inception in 1960, it has concentrated its energies on a huge land reclamation project in Chiba Prefecture, where Tokyo Disneyland is situated. **********According to the deal with Chiba signed in the 1960's, Oriental Land reclaimed 8.7 million square meters of land from Tokyo Bay and purchased, at a reduced price, 3.4 million square meters of that for the purpose of developing 2.1 million square meters into recreational facilities and the rest for residential and commercial use. The company has built a shopping center and a small tract of houses, but most of its energies have gone into Tokyo Disneyland. **********The company borrowed heavily for the project. Its $650 million investment, which covers virtually all costs, grew out of a 1979 estimate of $284 million. Interest rates hit hard, but company officials also acknowledge that the original figure was too low. **********LAST September, the company's president, Masamoto Takahashi, c onceded that the company lacked the necessary capital for its April c ompletion and asked to borrow $208 million more, bringing total l oans to an estimated $500 million. The consortium of 20 Japanese b anks financing it provided the money but reportedly demanded that t he company tighten accounting procedures. **********But analysts here say there were no real worries in the financial community because the project is backed by Mitsui Real Estate, which has helped guide its progress. Once part of the huge Mitsui conglomerate, Mitsui Real Estate was established in 1941 and later merged with other companies to become Japan's largest real estate company. For the fiscal year ended March 31, Mitsui Real Estate posted estimated earnings of $61 million on revenues of $904 million, both up about 15 percent, according to figures from Daiwa Securities. **********In contrast, Keisei Railway, established in 1909, has lost money for years and last year posted losses of $10.8 million on revenue of $267 million. Kiyoshi Kojima, an analyst for Daiwa Securities, said the company's rail division was profitable last year, but losses from inventories of unprofitable property are causing losses. **********Yet Disneyland may prove its salvation. Optimistic expectations for the park have lifted stock prices in recent months for Keisei and Mitsui, and analysts say more gains may come. **********''Keisei is the Tokyo Stock Exchange's best performer of the year,'' says Mr. Sawa. From a 1982 low of 122 yen in early September, Keisei reached 235 yen in late January and was recently trading around 490 yen. (One dollar is worth about 240 yen.) The price may continue to rise ''between 15 and 20 percent,'' says Mr. Sawa.  Analysts credit Keisei's leap with other factors besides Disneyland, including the recent lure here of speculative stocks. **********Keisei is still considered speculative, analysts caution, but success for Tokyo Disneyland could eventually make a big difference in the company's consolidated earnings. Keisei, which hasn't paid a dividend in five years and had a 9 yen per share deficit on a consolidated basis in the fiscal year 1982 is not expected to have a profit this year but could post a 13 yen per shape profit in the fiscal year 1984 and a 21 yen profit in the following year if Tokyo Disneyland is as successful as expected, says Mr. Sawa. **********Mitsui Real Estate's stock has also risen, from a 1982 low of 550 yen in August to its recent price of around 740 yen. Tokyo Disneyland was responsible for the price rise between October and December, says Mr. Kojima, but there were other factors involved as well since then. ORIENTAL LAND predicts the park will break even in the first year i f it draws 10 million visitors who each spend about $21 - $4 for f ood, $4 for souvenirs and $13 for a book of tickets for 10 rides.  B ut some term such predictions too conservative. ''We think visitors w ill spend at least $30, that first-year attendance will surpass 10 m illion and that Oriental Land will make a profit right away,'' says M r. Sawa. **********Further burnishing the two companies' stock prices is confidence that Oriental Land could sell some of its Chiba property if the park fails. According to its agreement with the banks, in the event the park does not profit after several years, Oriental Land will sell its Chiba property, with the housing land followed by the recreational areas. In the event this happens, legal authorities will step in, and the company will make some sort of financial arrangement with Chiba, says Kazumi Hirai, Oriental Land's assistant director of general affairs. **********But the deal has sparked controversy, with opponents claiming that Oriental Land will be able to sell at a huge profit land it bought cheaply from the Government. Last month a member of Japan's parliament accused the company of land speculation, claiming its loans were unsecured. A senior Finance Ministry official dismissed the charges. **********Disney officials maintain that Oriental Land's difficulties did not worry them. ''We knew they were running thin on cash flow, but we never worried that the banks wouldn't come through,'' says Mr.  Stanek. **********In the deal with Oriental Land, Walt Disney Productions agreed to provide at cost its technology and operational expertise. Disney will also receive a percentage of the gross, including 10 percent of admissions and rides and 5 percent from souvenirs, drinks and food.  The company also will get a portion of profits generated from hotels, restaurants and other recreational facilities that might eventually be built on the 60 acres surrounding the park. **********This attractive arrangement, the only conditions Disney accepted for opening a theme park in Japan, will serve as a precedent for any future theme parks the company may open outside the United States.  ''We felt this was a way to recoup some of the research and development money we've spent over the years on Disneyland and Disney World,'' says Mr. Stanek. ''This might be considered an infinite return on investment, and the terms could apply anywhere.'' **********Disneyland is a potent and popular image here. Disney characters have pitched countless Japanese products for years. Fashionable youths sport Mickey Mouse T-shirts, and Cinderella's castle has served as the model for dozens of so-called ''love hotels,'' where couples here go for privacy. An estimated 200,000 Japanese visit California's Disneyland each year. **********But some skeptics say attendance at Disneyland Tokyo could drop sharply once the park's novelty wears off. ''What will count are attendance figures five years from now,'' says a Tokyo analyst who asked not to be named."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/03/world/sikh-holy-leader-talks-of-violence.html": {"writer_name": "William Stevens", "pub_date": "1983-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 899, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SIKH HOLY LEADER TALKS OF VIOLENCE", "print_headline": "SIKH HOLY LEADER TALKS OF VIOLENCE", "body_text": " **********Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who is considered a holy warrior by his followers, a fanatical preacher of violence by his adversaries, and the key figure in the Sikh uprising now flaring in the Punjab by many on both sides, looks as if he could have stepped right out of the ranks of Sikh warriors of another century. **********A white robe drapes the barefoot, six-foot-plus frame of the 36-year-old sant, or holy man. An untrimmed black beard reaches well down his chest. Piercing brown eyes peer out from under a towering saffron on blue turban. He carries a sword in a scabbard inlaid with what looks like silver, wears a pistol in a shiny black leather holster on his hip and slings a bandolier over one shoulder. **********On a late April day, as the afternoon sun conferred an extra-rich patina on the gilt-surfaced copper walls of the Golden Temple, Sikhdom's holiest shrine, Sant Bhindranwale reclined on a cot on the roof of a building with a magnificent view of the temple and its surrounding lake, and held court. **********Within the temple grounds, the strains of martial music played an accompaniment as hundreds of Sikh protesters, their heads wrapped in criss-crossed saffron strips, worked themselves up to march to the police station in one form of the daily, nonviolent protest action that has sometimes ended in shooting and killing in the last eight months. 150 Have Died **********More than 150 people have died, and more than 100,000 have been jailed, during the sustained direct-action protest by militant Sikhs on behalf of greater political autonomy for Punjab state, their homeland, and what they consider greater security for Sikhs as a religious minority in predominantly Hindu India. **********In the last week of April, in an act that heightened tensions considerably, a police inspector, a Sikh, who was worshiping at the Golden Temple, was shot and killed by an unknown gunman who has not been caught. **********High stakes are involved in what has become a bitter war of nerves, and sometimes of guns: The peace and security of the Punjab, which, as India's agricultural breabasket, is the country's main buffer against famine; the future of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's battered Congress Party in this part of India; the Sikhs' historic pride and sense of identity, and, not least, even the future shape and coherence of the Indian union. **********Sant Bhindranwale is widely regarded as the man who will have most to say about how nasty things ultimately get. And as followers gathered around his rooftop cot, pressing on him obeisance, attention and money, and as members of his heavily armed praetorian guards stood by, he invoked the names of the first and last Sikh gurus in explaining his philosophy of protest. Peaceful Protests Prescribed **********First, he said, the protest so far has followed the ways of peace prescribed by Guru Nanak, who founded Sikhism five centuries ago as a fusion of Hinduism and Islam. But if no solution is reached and Sikhs continue to be killed while protesting nonviolently, he said in Punjabi through an interpreter, ''We will have to adopt the part of Guru Gobind Singh, who taught us to take up the sword for the protection of religion and righteousness.'' **********If the sword is literally taken up, it would be in pursuit of a variety of religious and political demands, the mixture of which, wrapped in an appeal to Sikh chauvinism, has invested the situation with considerable emotion. **********Negotiations between the Akali Dal, a Sikh political party that is directing the ''morcha,'' or agitation, and Prime Minister Gandhi's Government have proceeded haltingly. The Government has said, however, that it will concede all religious demands, one of which would make Amritsar a holy city. **********The secular demands are more difficult. They include the transfer to Punjab of Sikh areas in neighboring Haryana; the transfer of Chandigarh, now the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana, to Punjab alone, and the restoration to Punjab of water from two of its rivers, the Sutlej and the Beas, that is now diverted to Haryana and Rajasthan. Federal System Demanded **********But the big demand, the one with perhaps the broadest implications, is that all governmental functions, except defense, foreign relations, communications, railways and currency, be transferred from the central Government to India's states. This would make India more of a true federal system, less the unitary system it mostly now is. **********Sant Bhindranwale said if he is not satisfied with any negotiated solution that might be reached on this point and all the others, he will ''make a program'' of action and announce it at an appropriate time. **********Most of the time, things are quiet in the Punjab. Each day ''jathas,'' or bands, of protesters drawn from Punjabi villages have been leaving the Golden Temple to march to the police station and be arrested in almost ritualistic fashion. **********Occasionally, some piece of direct action leads to real trouble, as happened earlier this month when Sant Longowal called for his workers to block the road. They did, successfully, but 21 people were killed after the police opened fire. From time to time, too, there are seemingly random murders and bombings. No one has been able to fix responsibility for them."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/12/business/business-people-manville-mine-investor-is-appointed-chairman.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1983-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 234, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Manville Mine Investor Is Appointed Chairman", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Manville Mine Investor Is Appointed Chairman", "body_text": " **********Peter D.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Deputy Foreign Minister Leonid F. Ilyichev, declined to comment on the talks when he arrived in Peking on Tuesday. **********Qi Huaiyuan, the spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at a weekly news briefing Wednesday that no fixed schedule had been set for the latest round of consultations, which in the past have lasted about two weeks.   Concern About SS-20 Missiles **********The head of the Chinese delegation, Deputy Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, told visiting Japanese journalists earlier this week that he would be raising China's concern about the Soviet SS-20 medium-range nuclear missiles concentrated along China's border with the Soviet Union and Mongolia. **********Mr. Qi denied Wednesday that this constituted a fresh demand. He said it was part of the three conditions that China has set for an improvement in Chinese-Soviet relations. These include a withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, an end to Soviet support for the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia and a sharp cutback of Soviet border forces. **********''China hopes that the Soviet Union would reduce its troops along the Chinese-Soviet border, including conventional and nuclear weapons,'' Mr. Qi said. According to United States estimates, up to 500,000 well-equipped Soviet troops are arrayed against a million Chinese soldiers armed with inferior weapons. **********The recent attention given here to the Soviet SS-20 missiles has suggested Chinese preoccupation with a new facet of the border issue. The People's Daily newspaper on Sept. 17 demanded that the Soviet Union substantially cut back its missiles in Asia, saying that ''they pose a considerable threat to China and other countries of Asia.''  Unhappiness About Arms Buildup **********Last week in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Chinese Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian emphasized Peking's unhappiness over Moscow's and Washington's arms buildup. Mr. Wu proposed an international conference on disarmament for all states possessing nuclear arms, but only after the Soviet Union and the United States reduced their nuclear arsenals and delivery systems by half. China exploded its first atomic bomb in 1964. **********Hewing to its current policy of active alignment with the third world, China has accused both the Soviet Union and the United States of a lack of sincerity in their disarmament proposals. **********The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mr. Qi, repeated Wednesday that ''China is particularly concerned about the dismantling of the nuclear missiles already deployed in Asia and the prevention of possible future deployment of such missiles in this part of the world.'' **********When another Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, Mikhail S. Kapitsa, visited China last month, he relayed an earlier pledge by Yuri V. Andropov, the Soviet leader, not to transfer nuclear missiles to Asia from Europe if a Soviet-American arms reduction pact was reached. This assurance does not appear to have assuaged the Chinese.   Change in Priorities **********The new stress on the missiles suggests a change in Peking's priorities in the current Chinese-Soviet consultations on normalization. Chinese officials used to say that the first step should be for Moscow to stop supporting the Vietnamese troops in Cambodia who are fighting guerrillas of the ousted Pol Pot Government, which Peking still recognizes. **********There has been no apparent progress on any of the issues in the first two rounds of discussions, which were held in Peking last October and in Moscow in March. Qiao Shi, a ranking Chinese Communist Party official, confirmed late last month that the Kremlin had rejected China's demands. **********China's decision two years ago to take a more independent course between the United States and the Soviet Union led it to accede to the Kremlin's requests for consultations on improving Chinese-Soviet relations. **********China has denied trying to play the Soviet Union off against the United States. Before he left for the United Nations, Foreign Minister Wu said that ''Sino-Soviet relations and Sino-U.S. relations are two different things and they cannot be linked together.''  U.S. Relations Improve **********But relations with the United States have improved noticeably. When Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger visited here last week, it was announced that China's Prime Minister, Zhao Ziyang, would go to the United States in January and President Reagan would visit China in April. **********Peking's contacts with Washington remain far more extensive than its dealings with Moscow. Chinese-Soviet border trade was resumed earlier this year in two frontier areas of Xinjiang and Heilongjiang, but overall trade remains a fraction of Chinese-American commerce. **********A handful of Chinese and Soviet students have enrolled this year in each other's universities, resuming an exchange that was broken off after relations soured more than two decades ago. Other contacts have also increased. **********Mr. Wu had planned to meet the Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei A. Gromyko, at the United Nations this month, but Mr. Gromyko canceled his trip.

Lately, however, Wall Street analysts have been impressed because the company has abandoned this quixotic battle and refocused its energies on cutting manufacturing costs and capitalizing on its historically strong research efforts. **********But just as Zenith's fortunes appeared to be on the rise, the company was shocked Monday night by the unexpected death of its chief executive, Revone W. Kluckman, who died of a heart attack after playing golf at the Medinah Country Club outside of Chicago. **********Mr. Kluckman, who was 54 years old, had joined Zenith as controller in 1967, and became president in 1977, chief executive in 1980 and chairman in 1982. **********Confidence in Turnaround **********Analysts said yesterday that Zenith's new strategy was well in place, and expressed confidence that the company would continue its turnaround - if the economy expands, the electronics boom continues and inflation remains low. **********Zenith last year lost $21.8 million on revenues of $1.2 billion, although it has reported profits in the first two quarters this year.  Several analysts said that Zenith has sufficient management depth to find a capable successor to Mr. Kluckman and to Walter C. Fisher, 64, the executive vice president for sales and marketing who temporarily succeeds Mr. Kluckman as chief executive under the company's bylaws. Mr. Kluckman's tenure is expected to be short because he has already announced his retirement. **********''It's like losing a father,'' said Charles Ryan, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. ''It's a lot different if you're 12 than if you're 45. In this case, it's more like being 45.''  Reluctance to Make TV's **********As its name indicates, Zenith's roots were in radio. The company was incorporated in 1923 as a sales agent for the Chicago Radio Laboratory and ultimately became known as a manufacturer of highquality radios. Afraid of offending radio dealers, Zenith resisted moving into television and did not sell its first receivers until 1948. **********But if it was slow off the mark, Zenith went on to become the largest domestic manufacturer of televisions, first in black and white, and then in color. Then the Japanese pushed into the American market with low-cost sets, and by 1976, they had grabbed more than 44 percent of the color television market. And two years later, the RCA Corporation, which had trailed Zenith in sales of television sets, pulled out ahead of Zenith in domestic share, using pricecutting tactics. **********Zenith first began its complaints about the Japanese competition in 1968, contending that the Japanese were selling televisions below market value and that the Japanese Government was subsidizing their sale. It was an argument that John J. Nevin, who became Zenith's president in 1971 and chairman in 1976, continued to press widely. **********But Zenith and other domestic producers had little luck convincing the United States Government to stem the Japanese flow of sets. And it was not until 1977 that the Japanese, fearful of eventual trade repercussions, agreed to a modest limit on their exports. **********Meanwhile, Zenith accepted the fact that Japan was a permanent player in the domestic television market, and under Mr. Kluckman's tutelage, the company tried to compete by lowering its costs and expanding its product line into related but potentially more profitable areas. Focus Switches to Cost Cutting **********''They finally realized that you don't win the war in Washington; you fight the battle in the plants to get costs down,'' said Mr. Ryan of Merrill Lynch. **********To that end, the company moved the manufacture of its black-andwhite sets to Taiwan and its labor-intensive color television components and modules to Mexico. It has also closed several obsolete color television assembly plants in Chicago, substituting an automated plant in Springfield, Mo. **********The company has also added new products, including personal computers and high-resolution monitors or screens for computers, power converters for computers and ''addressable'' decoders, which let cable television companies change a customer's service without entering the home. **********Most of the growth, analysts explain, has stemmed from their television business and continued research in that area.  ''They felt that their business was TV, and they couldn't escape it,'' so the company kept its research spending high despite low profits and developed related businesses, said James I. Magid, an analyst with L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, a New York brokerage house. **********In 1979, the company also acquired the Heath Company, which makes and markets electronic do-it-yourself kits. And last January, it signed a five-year agreement to produce teletext receiving equipment, which displays editorial matter on a television set. Immediate Pay Off Not Seen **********But the efforts have not paid off immediately. The company lost money last year and omitted its quarterly dividend of 7 1/2 cents a share last September. The dividend has yet to be reinstated and the company's debt has remained higher than it has historically carried. **********Zenith's problem last year - and one that analysts say has the potential to be a problem again - is the company's heavy reliance on color television sales, which accounted for 60 percent of the company's revenues last year, only slightly lower than the 65 percent of revenues in 1980. **********This year, however, TV sets have been selling at a record pace, up 17 percent from last year, according to Television Digest, an industry newsletter, and Zenith has captured 18.5 percent of the market. **********One reason for the increase in the sale of sets is the use of sets for computer screens, games, videotape recorders and pay television, said David Lachenbruch, editorial director of the newsletter. ''Most people can't get by on just one set,'' he said. **********With television sales up, and Zenith selling relatively expensive sets, the company reported a profit in 1983's first quarter, and on Monday, reported second-quarter earnings of $11.5 million, or 59 cents a share, compared to a loss in 1982. Sales were up 11 percent, to $324 million, from $292 million. **********Zenith's stock was the 10th most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. It closed at $28.125 a share, up $1.25 for the day, and a 52-week high."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/22/business/gm-faces-a-snag-on-japan-strategy.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1983-10-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 941, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.M.

But G.M. is planning to import about 200,000 cars from Isuzu and slightly under 100,000 from Suzuki next year. Thus, if Japan does not allocate a significant quota to the two companies, it could pose a problem for the American company. The quota system is to be revised next April. **********Mr. Ishihara, who is also president of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, was here for the lavish formal dedication of Nissan's $660 million, ultramodern plant, which has been in limited operation since June, producing pickup trucks. **********In a breakfast interview in the plant's cafeteria, the 71-year-old executive said all Japanese companies should share equitably in any increase in auto shipments to the United States. **********Problem With Toyota, Too **********G.M.'s so-called Japanese strategy is also apparently in danger on another front. The proposed joint venture with the Toyota Motor Corporation to build 200,000 Toyota-designed subcompacts in Fremont, Calif., has been delayed by Toyota's reluctance to provide detailed cost and profit information to the Federal Trade Commission, which must rule on the legality of the venture. **********It appeared today as if all 1,200 of the workers at the Nissan plant here turned out to greet Mr. Ishihara. They stomped and cheered as he carefully read two speeches that emphasized the importance of the plant as an American venture. **********A local band struck up ''America, the Beautiful'' between the various speeches. Mr. Ishihara, conservative and elegant in a dark blue, pinstriped suit and aviator-style glasses, spoke from the loading dock at the back of the spotless beige plant, which was decked out in American flags. **********Mr. Ishihara's English is good enough for speech-making, but he preferred to be interviewed through an interpreter. Commenting specifically on the outlook for quotas, Mr. Ishihara said he hoped ''the two Governments would have a good talk about this,'' adding that Japanese auto makers ''have not talked about concrete numbers'' with their own Government yet. **********Higher Quotas Expected **********Most auto industry executives are projecting that the quota for the year beginning next April 1 will be increased to about 2 million cars, from the 1.68 million that has been the ceiling for the last three years. The quotas, or ''voluntary restraint agreement'' between Japan and the United States, began in April 1981 after American auto makers complained about losing a big share of the domestic market to Japanese imports. **********G.M. executives have urged Japanese and United States officials to include Isuzu and Suzuki in any quota increase, arguing that both companies have made sizable investments in products destined for the American market. But Mr. Ishihara said, ''Isuzu and Suzuki are not the only Japanese companies that have made investments, so there is no reason to allocate expanded quotas to Isuzu and Suzuki alone.'' **********Unless the two companies get substantial shares of the expected quota increase of 300,000 units, G.M. will be left well short of the import levels it had been counting on. Thus, if the Toyota plant is also delayed, G.M. would go into the 1985 model year next fall with its relatively old-fashioned Chevrolet Chevette, which has been fading in popularity, as its only subcompact model. **********In a recent interview, Roger B. Smith, chairman of G.M., declined to say what the company would do if its Japanese connections failed, but said the issue was one of the most important facing the company. **********Trucks 'Made in U.S.A.' **********Mr. Ishihara also acknowledged that a ''Made in U.S.A.'' label is a stronger selling point on a light truck than it is on a car. This, he said, was an important factor in making the pickup truck the company's first American-made product. **********''If the quality is the same in Japan and Tennessee, Americans will prefer Tennessee-made trucks,'' he said. **********Officials of the Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corporation, the subsidary that operates the plant, conceded that some of the plant's machinery, which includes 220 robots, seemed more suited to auto than truck production. They also said there were empty spaces in the plant, apparently reserved for the installation of stamping presses for forming auto bodies. **********Mr. Ishihara said the company was studying adding automobile production to the Smryna plant, but had not decided when or what model. **********Nissan officials acknowledged that the company was not immune to the quality problems that have plagued American auto companies. **********A survey by J. D. Power & Associates, a market research firm, showed, for example, that Nissan had slipped behind Toyota in buyer satisfaction, to the level of some of the better American models. C. P. King, Nissan's senior vice president for sales, commented: ''We have brought out a lot of new vehicles over the last few years, and you don't always get the quality you want at first.'' **********Marvin T. Runyon, president of Nissan Motor Manufacturing U.S.A., said the Smyrna plant would reach full production of about 10,000 trucks a month about the middle of next year. About 42 percent of the parts and materials in the vehicles are made in the United States, he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/15/business/company-reports-kansas-city-southern-industries-inc-n.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 17, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "** Company Reports ** KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN INDUSTRIES INC (N)", "print_headline": "** Company Reports ** KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN INDUSTRIES INC (N)", "body_text": " **********Qtr to March 31 1983 1982 Revenue 94,773,000 102,017,000 Net inc 6,615,000 9,023,000 Share earns .65 .91"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/01/business/springs-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-jan-1.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SPRINGS INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 1", "print_headline": "SPRINGS INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 1", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/01/world/around-the-world-071295.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD", "body_text": " **********6 African Lands Impose New Rule on Journalists **********HARARE, Zimbabwe, July 31 (Reuters) - Information ministers of the six black African ''front line'' countries announced today that in principle no foreign correspondents would be allowed to cover their countries from bases in South Africa. **********The ministers, from Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia, Angola, Botswana and Tanzania, also agreed that any foreign journalist banned by one of them would be barred by the others. **********The ministers issued a communique called the Kadoma Declaration after the Zimbabwe town 100 miles southwest of here where they met. **********''Foreign correspondents accredited to South Africa and reporting to regional bureaus in South Africa will not be allowed, in principle, to work in front-line states,'' it said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/19/world/salvador-s-leader-rebuffs-congress.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Taubman", "pub_date": "1983-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 806, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SALVADOR'S LEADER REBUFFS CONGRESS", "print_headline": "SALVADOR'S LEADER REBUFFS CONGRESS", "body_text": " **********The Provisional President of El Salvador said today that he would not comply with United States Congressional stipulations that his Government begin unconditional discussions with insurgents. **********The rejection could upset the Reagan Administration's efforts to win approval of an increased aid package for El Salvador.

If necessary, he added, ''We are going to lose economic and military aid.'' **********Mr. Magana said that in the view of his Government, negotiations without conditions constituted an unacceptable opportunity for the insurgents to negotiate their way into power. ''We are a Government elected by the people,'' he went on. ''I don't have the right to discuss power sharing,'' adding that the Government was willing to talk to the guerrillas about their participation in free elections, but nothing more. **********Mr. Magana's statements added to an already complex debate about how and when the Salvadoran Government should talk to the guerrillas about ending the civil war. U.S. 'Can Live With' Terms **********Senior Reagan Administration officials have said they ''can live with'' Congressional conditions about talks because the requirements emphasize that free elections and the evolution of democratic forms of government should be key elements. **********The officials also hope that the legislative language spelling out the conditions will be softened before the bills reach a final vote by the Senate and House. **********The guerrillas, for their part, have refused to talk about taking part in elections, saying that the Salvadoran Govermment cannot guarantee the safety of leftist candidates or the integrity of the electoral process. Instead, they have called for discussions about broader political issues. **********Mr. Magana's flat refusal to consider an unconditional dialogue, combined with the guerrillas' unwillingness to limit discussions to their participation in elections, makes it unlikely that any direct talks will soon take place between the government and the insurgents about resolving the civil war. No Decision on Meeting Rebels **********President Reagan's special envoy to Central America, Richard B.  Stone, has under consideration an offer by the guerrillas to meet with him. The White House said on Friday that no decision had been made about whether to proceed with such a meeting. **********Along with his rejection of Congressional requirements about negotiations, Mr. Magana complained today about the overall approach Congress has taken to aid requests for his country. **********He chided Congress for approving aid that is ''attached to so many conditions'' and is provided after ''so many delays.'' The delays, he added, forced the Salvadoran Army to put off for six months a plan to conduct a military sweep of San Vicente Province. The sweep, which is designed to force the guerrillas out of the area and make it secure it for economic reconstruction efforts, began last week. **********Mr. Magana also said that his Government has had difficulty meeting American expectations about rapidly improving its human rights performance. ''I would like to have a little more understanding,'' Mr. Magana remarked. ''They have to realize that at this time, in the middle of a war with all the violence, it is not easy to eradicate things. We can't do that overnight'' **********Mr. Magana departed for El Salvador late in the afternoon after spending the day meeting with numerous groups of reporters and recording interviews for the evening television news programs. ---- Army Reports Killing 115 **********SAN SALVADOR, June 18 (UPI) -The army has killed 115 leftist guerrillas in 11 days of counterinsurgency sweep of San Vicente Province, part of a United States-designed pacification program, military officials said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/17/business/harris-bankcorp-seeks-4-banks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Harris Bankcorp Seeks 4 Banks", "print_headline": "Harris Bankcorp Seeks 4 Banks", "body_text": " **********Harris Bankcorp, involved in talks about its own acquisition by a banking company, said it had signed letters of intent to acquire four Chicago- area banks for $38.6 million. **********Harris said it would acquire the First National Bank of Hinsdale, with $140 million in assets; Glencoe National Bank, with $96 million in assets; First National Bank of Winnetka, with $112 million in assets, and the First National Bank of Wilmette, with assets of $17 million.

More competition, more s ources of credit, new technologies and new services are beckoning.  T he question is not whether these changes will occur, but how. Are wet o proceed in a disorderly rush? Or can we make an orderly transitiont o a more modern system? **********The disorderly rush has already started. New companies and new techniques are pouring through breaches that have been torn in regulatory dikes. Sticking fingers into the holes is not the answer.  Many of the changes are desirable. But change should happen in a systematic and predictable manner, with attention to equity and the public interest. **********Bankers work with other people's money, so banking must be supervised and regulated to insure prudent use of depositors' funds.  In the United States, banking is more heavily regulated than in most other countries. This reflects unhappy experience with past banking crises and various abuses. **********Thus, a major objective of banking regulation is prophylactic - to assure that principles of prudence and good sense prevail and that potential problems, like conflicts of interest, are avoided. When people put their money in banks, they need some degree of protection. So does the Government, when it insures those deposits, to say nothing of the economy as a whole, which needs to be insulated from the ripple effect of imprudent financial decisions.TODAY, much of the momentum for change comes from outside the b anking industry. Thrift institutions like savings and loan a ssociations, nondepository financial institutions like brokerage h ouses and insurance companies, and nonfinancial businesses like m ail-order or steel companies have found their way into some forms ofb anking. Through ''nonbank banks,'' which take deposits but do not m ake commercial loans and thereby escape many regulatory restraints, t hey can establish a base. **********These outsiders did not shoulder their way in because the banking business is so gloriously profitable; it is not. Rather, the combination of their own business, whatever it is, with some banking functions is the key. To get Federal deposit insurance, for instance, can be an enormous advantage to a nonbank financial firm.  It may also be very good for the customer. But if we have not done it all these years, why rush in suddenly without careful thought and legislation? **********The banks, who see their turf invaded, naturally are straining to counter-attack. Now that at last there is movement, they want to break out of the narrow confines of their present business, while the outsiders want to break in. If these forces prevail, the future shape of the banking system is not easy to foresee. **********Congress rarely enjoys banking legislation. There are few votes in it, and a lot of bitter lobbying. But sooner or later, Congress will have to come to grips with the headlong rush into a new financial services system. The nation has had too much grief with its financial institutions to allow a permanent free-for-all in this area. Currently, Congress is much exercised about what banks have done in international lending. It seems a peculiar occasion for uncontrolled experimentation in other directions. The question is not whether, but when, Congress will act. **********Congress may act late, after much of the rush is over. It would then confront a set of faits accomplis. It could roll them back only over the dead bodies of those who thought they had it made. It could also grandfather-in the claims that have been staked out, denying similar opportunities to latecomers. On the other hand, Congress could act early and hope that a quick job would be a good one. Or finally, Congress could impose a moratorium on new moves while it deliberated carefully. **********Some observers have looked at the bank holding company as a vehicle for change. This view would bring the banks into the securities business, into real estate development and into insurance. In an attempt to protect banks against recognized risks, such activities would be conducted only through subsidiaries of bank holding companies. Losses of the subsidiary would not fall upon the bank.  Unfortunately, this goes against the normal tendency of a bank to protect affiliates in order to protect its own name and credit standing. This is expected of banks, particularly in international banking, where the ''moral responsibility'' of banks for their foreign affiliates, however packaged, is taken for granted. This dilemma could be mitigated by recognizing such inevitable linkages, and by providing for a degree of supervisory oversight of the affiliate and the entire holding company to assure that basic public policy objectives are not circumvented or ignored. **********Matters such as these require careful Congressional consideration.  A good, quick job leading to definitive solutions no doubt would be best. Whether it is within reach is anybody's guess. A moratorium would provide time for study and reflection. The interested parties could have their say. The chances of a good job being done would greatly improve."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/13/business/finance-new-issues-228295.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 151, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES", "body_text": " **********Eurobonds Off Slightly LONDON, Oct. 12 (Reuters) **********- United States dollar-denominated bonds were down about 3/4 point at the opening today as **********the Eurobonds market reacted **********to news of the United States **********credit markets' sharply lower **********close on Tuesday. **********However, a **********few issues moved off the day's **********lows after some Swiss buyers **********entered the market, dealers **********added.
