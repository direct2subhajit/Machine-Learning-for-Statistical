By comparison, a worker in one of Ciudad Juarez's assembly plants earns $28 for a 45-hour week. **********But this time of year the Rio Bravo - known on the United States side as the Rio Grande - dwindles to the force of a lazy, muddy country creek. Just about anybody with a decent pair of jogging shoes, a good sense of balance and a sharp eye for ''la Migra'' - the United States Border Patrol - can make it from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso without help in about two minutes by skipping across the rocks that jut from the water. **********Little Fear of Border Patrol **********''When the water is up to here,'' Aniseto explained, pointing to his knees, ''and there are holes, that's when you make money.'' **********His face lit up in recognition and he called out to a tall, hefty woman wearing a red sweater, a scarf and running shoes. ''Hola, senora! Are you going to cross?'' A few moments later, Aniseto was in the water with the woman on his back, and within a few minutes both were on United States soil. **********There is little fear of the border patrol. When a patrol van approaches, whistles and shouts can be heard up and down the shoreline and the river traffic halts; as soon as the patrol passes, it begins again. The one van that came by during a recent 90- minute visit drove right past two Mexicans clambering up the El Paso riverbank and went on its way. **********On days of heavy traffic - El Paso- bound on Mondays and Tuesdays and Ciudad Juarez-bound on Fridays - some 300 Mexicans come to this point on the parched, rocky riverbank to avail themselves of the coyotes' services. **********''They pay what they can,'' said Javier, another coyote, who stalked the riverbank in a plaid shirt and rolled- up jeans. ''Some give you 50 pesos'' - about 30 cents - ''some give you $10.'' **********Along the airport road into Ciudad Juarez are dozens of signs saying ''Yonke,'' a Spanglish word that is pronounced somewhat like the English word ''junk.'' They are far more numerous than the billboards calling on the people of Ciudad Juarez to protect the Spanish language and are apparently paid greater attention. **********Yonke is big business here. Failed automobiles and metal scrap of every description is piled up high, to be stripped for parts or resold to the metal foundaries in Chihuahua. **********It was to one of these yonkes that a Ciudad Juarez resident not long ago sold a lead canister that turned out to contain pellets of radioactive cobalt 60. The pellets ended up scattered through the scrap, which was sold to a foundary in Chihuahua. Radioactive metal products - from structural steel bars to table bases - have been turning up ever since, both in Mexico and the United States. **********''People got pretty nervous when U.S. Army helicopters started flying overhead,'' said a Ciudad Juarez resident. Things calmed a bit, though, when it turned out they were only trying to detect the source of the radiation. **********There is a new yonke in Ciudad Juarez now, out by the airport, but no one is coming there to buy anything. It is filled with radioactive trash that has been found around Ciudad Juarez or is being returned to Mexico from the United States for disposal, and it may be there for a while. ''It is not our responsibility, it is the federal Government's,'' said the Mayor of Ciudad Juarez, Francisco J. Barrio Terrazas. Asked when it might be taken care of, he raised his hand in an open-palmed ''who knows?'' shrug. **********The main incentive for the illegal transit across the Rio Bravo, both for the coyotes and the people they serve, is, not surprisingly, financial. **********''I only do this when I don't have work,'' said the 35-year-old Javier, who has held jobs as a construction worker and carpenter. ''The people go over like this because they have to put food on the table, and they can make there in a day what they would make here in a week.'' **********''Besides,'' he added with a grin, ''it's faster.'' **********Just how much faster can be grasped only by visiting the offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the bridge connecting Ciudad Juarez and El Paso. **********Americans are waved right through. But Mexicans who try to enter the country legally by land endure a level of bureaucratic delay and rudeness that most United States residents seldom experience. It comes as a shock even to the Mexicans, whose legendary bureaucratic inefficiency is at least tempered somewhat by Latin politeness. **********On a recent morning, four lanes of traffic were closed and cars and trucks were backed up for more than an hour behind the El Paso checkpoint. In the offices of the Immigration Service, the plastic seats were filled with dozens of anxious Mexicans. They were waiting to be reviewed by the handful of officials, passing the time by reading and rereading the signs that say, ''Don't lean on the railing - be seated,'' ''No smoking'' and ''Fill out your form like this.'' **********One Mexican traveler, bearing a permanent United States visa in his passport, explained he had a plane to catch in an hour and was told by an agent that ''it won't be long.'' When the hour slid by and the flight was missed, the agent, reminded of her statement, said coldly, ''I never promised you anything.'' **********The problem, the agent explained later, is simple: ''There are a lot of them and not enough of us.'' **********There is no love lost between Ciudad Juarez and Mexico City. **********''They call us 'the provinces,' '' Arnulfo Castro Munive, a manager of the Sylvania plant here, said of the capital, ''and they think that in the provinces there are no brains, no talent, no love of the country.'' **********Certainly Ciudad Juarez lacks Mexico City's sophistication and, with its dry, sandy soil and lack of trees, much of the capital's beauty and elegance. But it also lacks its dirty air, its overwhelming crowdedness and its spirit that life is a continuing effort to get something at someone else's expense. **********''Here we think that working is a dignified manner of earning our bread, of surviving,'' Mr. Castro continued. ''In the capital, the attitude is one of surviving and nothing else.'' **********''We have a different sense of values, of respect,'' he added. ''Not better, not worse - but different.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/09/world/nigeria-hints-abduction-was-faked.html": {"writer_name": "Apby Thomas", "pub_date": "1984-07-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1079, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NIGERIA HINTS ABDUCTION WAS FAKED", "print_headline": "NIGERIA HINTS ABDUCTION WAS FAKED", "body_text": " **********A Government spokesman suggested today that a former Nigerian Cabinet minister might have been arranged his own kidnapping in London to gain international attention. **********The spokesman, Wada Maida, press secretary to the Nigerian military leader, Maj.

''Someone could have organized it to get his money - threaten to turn him over to Nigeria unless he paid a ransom. Or Dikko could have organized it himself, to gain international attention.

Since then, the military Government has accused Mr. Dikko of having amassed a fortune at the expense of the Nigerian people. Mr. Dikko, for his part, has angered the Buhari regime by calling for a popular uprising against the military.

''The N.S.O. has no one working for it outside Nigeria. It has nobody in London.'' **********Mr. Maida added, ''No Government official or any official of a Government agency was directly or indirectly involved.''  Nigeria Criticizes Britain **********Meanwhile, the Nigerian press carried commentaries today strongly critical of Britain's conduct in the affair. Nigeria, a member of the Commonwealth, gained its independence from Britain in 1960 and is one of Britain's principal trading partners. **********The Sunday Times of Lagos, in a front-page editorial, called Britain ''an enemy to the interests and aspirations of the Nigerian people'' for having given refuge to Mr. Dikko. **********Another newspaper, The Nigerian Herald of Ilorin, criticized London for ''pursuing a rather aggressive, clearly insolent diplomatic posture against Nigeria'' and deplored ''the rush to its implied conclusion on the Nigerian Government involvement.'' **********Nigerian Is Recovering **********LONDON, July 8 - Mr. Dikko was recovered enough today to speak with Scotland Yard detectives for several hours from his bed in a hospital near the airport where he was rescued, officials said. **********Both the Home Office and the Foreign Office were awaiting a full report on the incident before making any further comments, according to a spokesman, who said that the Government did not want to prejudge the case. **********Comdr. William Hucklesby, head of Scotland Yard's C13 antiterrorist branch, was expected to brief Home Office officials on the status of the investigation tonight. **********The police were said to be continuing their questioning of the four suspects, who are being detained in Britain under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which allows suspects to be held for seven days without charges.   Reports of Mercenaries **********British newspapers, citing unnamed British police souces, have said two of the four were Israeli mercenaries. **********Israeli newspaper reports said today that two Israelis were among the four in police custody. They were identified as Lou Shapira, 44 years old, a Soviet- born combat medic, and Felix Avital, 32, a native of Tunisia. Their last names were given with two different spellings. One news report identified them as Mr. Schapiro and Mr. Abotal. **********One of the papers, the Tel Aviv daily Davar, quoting British police souces, said the two had been hired by a private-detective agency in New York on behalf of an American-owned construction company doing business in Nigeria. The construction company, the newspaper said, had been approached by Nigerian authorities and asked to help in abducting Mr. Dikko to stand trial in Lagos. Neither the construction company nor the private-detective agency was named. **********A spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in London said today that he did not know the names of the people in police custody and could not confirm the newspaper reports. **********He emphatically denied speculation in the British press that the Israeli intelligence service Mossad had played any role in the kidnapping attempt.   Diplomatic Immunity an Issue **********Some British newspapers said in commentaries today that the Nigerian Government appeared the be the guilty party and demanded that diplomatic immunity not be allowed to stand in the way of justice. **********''There is not the slightest doubt that the military rulers of Nigeria were involved in the Dikko kidnapping to the hilt,'' The Sunday Express said in an editorial. ''The crates containing the drugged bodies were addressed to their Foreign Ministry; one of their planes had flown in empty to receive them; their Embassy cars were at the airport; one of their envoys was on hand to accompany the cargo.'' **********Another Sunday newspaper, The Observer, said, ''An outright breach of diplomatic relations would be an overreaction, putting as it would the Buhari regime on the same level as Albania, Uganda under Amin and Libya under Qaddafi - the only three countries Britain has broken relations with since 1945.'' **********The newspaper added that any Nigerian diplomat found to have been involved in the kidnapping plot should be ''declared persona non grata and sent home to Lagos - though not in a box.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/28/world/mondale-confers-with-gromyko-sees-hope-in-reagan-talk-today.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 824, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SEES HOPE IN REAGAN TALK TODAY", "print_headline": "MONDALE CONFERS WITH GROMYKO; SEES HOPE IN REAGAN TALK TODAY", "body_text": " **********Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic Presidential candidate, met yesterday in New York with Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko and said later that there was ''an opportunity for significant progress'' when the Soviet official sees President Reagan today in Washington. **********When pressed at a news conference to provide the basis for his optimism, Mr. Mondale said it was a conclusion drawn from his session with Mr. Gromyko, which had concentrated on arms control issues. **********The former Vice President, speaking at the Plaza Hotel after his meeting at the Soviet Mission to the United Nations, said the discussion had been ''serious and businesslike'' and had covered a wide range of subjects. **********Mr. Gromyko, who said earlier in a speech in the United Nations General Assembly that ''concrete deeds and not verbal assurances'' were needed for better relations, repeated during the meeting much of what he had said on arms control, Mr. Mondale said. **********There was no immediate reaction from Mr. Gromyko but Tass, the Soviet Government's press agency, issued an account that was favorable toward the Democratic candidate. **********According to The Associated Press, Tass said Mr. Gromyko had told Mr. Mondale that ''Washington had wrecked the negotiations between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A., virtually on all questions dealing with the cessation of the arms race, particularly the nuclear arms race.''  Tass Has Praise for Mondale **********''It followed from what W. Mondale said that he, for his part, regarded a turn for the better in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union as important, and, in principle, possible,'' Tass said. **********''Some ideas suggested by him in this context, should they materialize in Washington's policy, would open up certain possibilities for bringing the positions of the two powers closer and for subsequent agreements on arms limitations and disarmament.'' **********Mr. Mondale said in his news conference that ''there were no commitments given to me at all.'' **********''I did not try to get any commitment,'' he said. ''I was not negotiating. But it is my judgment there is the possibility of an opportunity. We will find out tomorrow.' **********Mr. Mondale has said that, if elected, he would order a freeze in all new weapons developments for about six months, as an incentive for the Soviet Union to agree to a summit meeting. He has also called for a negotiated, verified freeze at current levels of nuclear arms, to be followed by reductions. **********The Reagan Administration opposes a nuclear freeze on the ground that this would set back American efforts to offset purported Soviet advantages.   President's Role Stressed **********Mr. Mondale said he had urged Mr. Gromyko to be as forthcoming as possible with the President, arguing that there was nothing to be gained for the Russians in holding off any decisions until after the American elections. **********''I made a strong point that, in my opinion, U.S.-Soviet relations were at a fateful moment,'' Mr. Mondale said. **********He said he had told Mr. Gromyko that he hoped plans could be made for a summit meeting and that the Soviet Union would agree to return to arms control negotiations ''across the board.'' **********But Mr. Mondale added, ''I told the Foreign Minister that President Reagan is our President and there should be no misunderstanding of that fact.'' **********Mr. Mondale said the subject of human rights had also come up. He said he had raised the question of Anatoly B. Shcharansky, a dissident serving a prison term after conviction on charges of espionage for the United States.   Sakharov Issue Is a Topic **********Also discussed, Mr. Mondale said, was the situation of Andrei D. Sakharov, the physicist, and of his wife, Yelena G. Bonner, both of whom now live in banishment in Gorky, a city of a million people that is off limits to foreigners. **********Among other issues raised by Mr. Mondale was the situation in Afghanistan, where, he said, he urged that Soviet troops be withdrawn; Poland, where he urged that more freedoms be allowed, and Cambodia, where he sought a withdrawal of Vietnamese troops. **********On Central America, he said he told Mr. Gromyko that he was opposed to the introduction of offensive weapons to Cuba and he urged support for the Contadora peace effort being carried out by four Latin American countries. **********He said he had also talked about the Persian Gulf and had voiced the hope that the Soviet Union would use its influence to end the war between Iran and Iraq. **********Mr. Mondale was accompanied by his foreign policy advisers, David Aaron and Barry Carter. Mr. Aaron, who had been deputy national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter, consulted beforehand with the staff of the National Security Council and will brief the White House later, Mr. Mondale's aides said. **********Mr. Gromyko was accompanied by Anatoly F.

The committee meets 10 times a year to decide what policy would best promote economic expansion and price stability. **********This week's meeting is considered especially important because it comes just one week before Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, testifies before Congress. He is scheduled to testify next Monday and Tuesday. **********His Congressional appearances every February and July are closely analyzed by credit market participants. On these occasions, he provides a more detailed explanation of the central bank's policy than is available from the regularly published summaries of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee. **********Analysts in Opposing Camps **********Its meeting this week comes at a time when credit market participants are split into two camps - those who expect the Fed's next move to be toward a tighter monetary policy with higher interest rates and those who expect an easier monetary policy with lower interest rates. **********Analysts from both factions agree that the Fed may decide to hold its policy stable until fresh economic data indicate more clearly that a change is needed. For the last five months, the central bank's monetary policy has been stable, with Fed officials apparently satisfied with the present low rate of inflation and pace of the economic recovery. **********''If there is any change in policy, it will be on the side of ease,'' said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. Last Friday's announcement of a $2.7 billion decline in the nation's basic money supply was cited by Mr. Kellner as one more reason why the Federal Reserve would not tighten its policy. **********Some Wary of a Recession **********''There is a growing chorus of monetarists who say that the Fed has already kept policy tight enough to push the economy into another recession,'' Mr. Kellner said. **********Although a recession is not imminent, Mr. Kellner said the Fed might try to speed the growth of the money supply because ''another few months of little growth in money supply would tilt the economy dangerously close to a recession by summer.'' **********Henry Kaufman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said last week that he expects the Fed to gradually tighten monetary policy this year. In the latest issue of Comments on Credit, however, he noted that the Fed is not likely to make any policy changes at this week's meeting. **********''There is a natural unwillingness to depart from current policy in light of the continuing favorable performance of the economy and the low rate of inflation,'' Mr. Kaufman wrote.  Last week he repeated his forecast of rising interest rates this year with long-term Treasury bond yields rising to 13 percent by year-end from 11 3/4 percent recently and with the Federal funds rate on overnight bank loans rising to 10 1/2 to 11 1/2 percent, up from the recent 9 1/4 to 9 1/2 percent. **********M-1 More Closely Watched **********Mr. Kaufman and many other economists expect the growth of M-1, the basic gauge of the money supply, to be a more important guide to monetary policy in 1984 than it was in 1983. New kinds of bank accounts, which disrupted all money supply measures in 1983, are not expected to distort them this year. And as the economic recovery becomes more seasoned, the economists add, investors will want to look to controlled growth of the money supply for assurance that inflation will not rise. **********One aspect of monetary policy that Mr. Volcker is likely to emphasize is that there are no rigid rules for targeting money supply growth. Because of uncertainty about the effect of money supply changes on economic activity, Fed officials are guided by economic conditions as well as changes in the various measures of money supply and bank credit. **********Most analysts expect the Fed to stick with its 1984 money supply growth targets that were tentatively announced last July. **********Lower Targets Than in 1983 **********Those targets called for slightly less money supply growth than the 1983 targets, with M-1 set at 4 to 8 percent. M-1 consists of currency plus all kinds of checking accounts. **********Not all analysts, however, expect the targets set in July to be ratified. **********Analysts at Money Market Services Inc. a Belmont, Calif., consulting concern, said ''Washington sources'' indicated that the M-1 target range could be reduced to 3 to 6 percent because of an increase in velocity, the rate at which the public turns over the money stock. If velocity rises, a lower money supply growth target would not necessarily be a tightening of monetary policy, they said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/03/business/a-new-cash-source-for-banks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1264, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A NEW CASH SOURCE FOR BANKS", "print_headline": "A NEW CASH SOURCE FOR BANKS", "body_text": " **********Major banks are increasingly turning to a nontraditional area of profits: selling their office buildings. The reasons are varied - a troubled bank can use the one-time gain to offset operating losses, while a healthy institution may capitalize on a sale to help expand its basic business. **********On the West Coast, for example, the parent company of the Union Bank earned a profit of more than $80 million in February by selling its headquarters building in downtown Los Angeles. A couple of blocks away, the Security Pacific Bank plans to sell its building for more than $300 million. It built the headquarters for $110 million in 1975. **********In San Francisco, the Crocker National Bank recently announced that it would sell its headquarters complex. It may also sell its interest in the twin-tower Crocker Center in Los Angeles, which is across the street from the Security Pacific building. Crocker could raise more than $700 million from the sale. **********Sale in Baltimore **********Across the country in Baltimore, the First Maryland Bankcorp announced today that it had sold for $25 million the land beneath its headquarters and an option it had obtained in 1972 to buy the 22-story building. First Maryland is the holding company for the First National Bank, Maryland's second-largest bank. It said it would earn a long-term capital gain of $23.5 million. **********Similarly, banks in Houston and Chicago have recently earned big profits by turning real estate assets into financial ones. And in New York two years ago, the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company sold its building for an $80 million profit and bought the Union Carbide Building. **********In addition, Wall Street sources said Citicorp was considering selling its 39-story Park Avenue headquarters. The structure, not to be confused with the newer Citicorp Center on Lexington Avenue that is shown in the company's advertising, was completed in 1961 for about $50 million. It is now worth more than $350 million. A spokesman for the bank said it had no plans to sell the building, but declined to discuss whether it might be a future option. **********''I think you are going to see a lot of banks getting rid of their major office buildings,'' said John B. Bailey, vice chairman of Landauer Associates, a New York-based real estate consulting firm that advises several banks. ''I think it's going to be a big trend.'' **********Making Use of Real Estate **********Proponents of this trend say it allows banks to use previously unrealized profits to strengthen basic businesses. They note that for every dollar that a bank adds to its regulatory net worth from real estate earnings, it can made an additional $20 in loans. **********Critics, however, say some banks are using building sales to hype earnings at the expense of long-term health. **********Because most major lending institutions are based in high-quality buildings in downtown sites - properties that appreciated considerably with the high inflation of the last decade - their buildings are worth far more than the depreciated book value. For some banks, office buildings have emerged as their most lucrative investment. **********Daniel Costello, the Bank of America's executive vice president for real estate, said the bank could sell its five or six largest office buildings for a total of $2 billion, and earn a $1.2 billion pretax profit over several years. **********Building Worth $500 Million **********The bank's prominent San Francisco headquarters, which has a book value of less than $50 million, could be sold for more than $500 million, Mr. Costello said. **********''If you have a lot of value in a building, it doesn't do you any good if it's locked up,'' said David Lovejoy, Security Pacific's executive vice president and treasurer. ''If you've had very large gains, you have to consider taking advantage of them.'' **********Most securities analysts think banks should act quickly to capitalize on their property holdings. J. Richard Fredericks, a banking analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said: ''More banks should be looking at their real estate as a way to bolster their capital.'' **********But others say banks can benefit more from holding onto valuable real estate. They say that a bank that owns its office buildings can keep expenses low because it pays only the cost of operating the building. Banks that sell generally agree to pay much higher market rates of rent to their new landlords. **********An Increase in Rent **********For instance, Union Bank's annual rent increased to $6.3 million, from $1.7 million, after Standard Charter Bank Ltd., its parent, sold the building, according to real estate sources. In fact, it was the increase in the building's rental income that allowed the British banking concern to earn a large profit from the sale. **********Standard Charter, which bought the building in 1982 for $90 million, sold it 18 months later for more than $171 million. **********In analyzing whether a sale makes sense over the long term, a bank must determine whether the after-tax profits from the building's sale - plus the return it could earn from investing the profits - would be greater than the increased rental payments. **********Mr. Costello of Bank of America conceded that Samuel H. Armacost, the bank's chairman and chief executive, would like to reap huge windfall real estate profits, but he said such a move would not be beneficial to the bank. ''Our earnings are not great, and Sam would have preferred it if we said it made sense to sell,'' Mr. Costello said. ''But we analyzed it, and we just can't make it make sense.'' **********''We have plenty of money,'' he added. ''Our problem is lending it out.'' **********Loan Losses a Motivation **********Some of the banks that have sold were probably motivated by loan losses that impaired their capital base, he said. **********In fact, the Seattle-based Seafirst Bank, which has recently suffered large losses, sold its headquarters building soon after it was acquired by Bank of America last year. The building, sold for $123 million, represented a gain of $40 million, according to Mr. Costello, who said the money was added to Seafirst's capital base. **********Crocker, which lost $120.8 million in the first quarter of this year, expects to sell its San Francisco headquarters complex for more than $400 million. The property includes its 38-story headquarters and the glass-domed Galleria Shopping Center. **********In addition, a Crocker spokesman said the bank planned either to sell or refinance its 40 percent interest in the 2.2 million-square-foot Crocker Center in Los Angeles. Its share is worth more than $300 million, according to the spokesman. **********Crocker Liquidates Holdings **********Frank V. Cahouet, Crocker's new chairman and chief executive, decided to liquidate some of the bank's real estate holdings soon after he was hired away from Security Pacific, where he was a vice chairman. ''Cahouet told us he wants the biggest possible gain; he can put a lot of bad loans behind him'' with profits from the sales, said a real estate executive familiar with Crocker's strategy. **********In Houston, where lending institutions have been hurt by the energy industry's downturn, two banks recently sold their headquarters. Allied Bancshares sold its 27-story Esperson Building for $20 million. A bank official said Allied would realize a $17 million gain from the sale. **********And last December, the Bank of the Southwest sold its headquarters, which it built for $16 million in 1956, for $81 million. The bank had operating earnings of $2.8 million in 1983, but with the building sale, it was able to report $39.8 million in total earnings for the year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/02/business/finance-new-issues-gearhart-reports-debenture-sale.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 203, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": ";  Gearhart Reports Debenture Sale", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; ;  Gearhart Reports Debenture Sale", "body_text": " **********Gearhart Industries., which is being sought by Smith International Inc., sold $98.7 million of 10-year senior subordinated debentures and five- year warrants to purchase 2,961,000 common shares at $33 each to several financial institutions, through Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. **********The company, which provides services to the oil and gas industries, said it would receive proceeds of $73 million. **********The debentures bear interest at 8 5/8 percent a year and may be used to pay for the exercise of warrants at the amortized price plus accrued interest or, in certain circumstances, at their principal face amount, it said. **********Gearhart said the circumstances include the ownership of 5.4 million of its common shares by any party without the approval of the board, proxy contests, the start of a tender not recommended by the board, which could result in the offer or acquiring over 5.4 million shares or merger transactions.

But he insisted that the final decision would be made ''in Bonn and not in Jerusalem.'' **********Last weekend in West Berlin, Mayor Koch of New York asserted that ''Germany is once again embarked on a program to destroy my people.'' And in the United States last month, the A.F.L.- C.I.O. deplored what it called West Germany's intent ''to develop a close military relationship with Saudi Arabia'' and urged the Reagan Administration to help reverse the decision.   Politics and Economics **********Mr. Kohl, who met informally with American journalists in Bonn this week, has indicated that he does not expect the Reagan Administration to come to Bonn's assistance on this issue, particularly in an election year. But in his conversations in Washington he is expected to develop the argument that Bonn shares a responsibility with its NATO allies for strengthening moderate Arab regimes in the oil-producing Gulf region. **********The Chancellor is less likely to note, however, that, at a time of stubbornly high unemployment, West German arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other developing nations could become an important new export market. **********One of the Chancellor's closest advisers predicted that the Israeli argument that West Germans do not have the moral right to sell weapons to the Arabs might boomerang among many Germans who no longer feel directly responsible for Hitler's crimes. **********''I am afraid,'' this adviser said, ''that this could turn out negatively for Israel. This could foment anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli feeling in the Federal Republic.''  'This Is Not About Weapons' **********Another Bonn official, who is involved in forming Middle Eastern policy, said the Israelis were aware that the weapons that West Germany might sell to Saudi Arabia, such as antiaircraft tanks and armored personnel carriers, do not in themselves constitute a qualitative military threat. Although details of the deal with the Saudis remain unsettled, Mr. Kohl has ruled out selling them Leopard 2 tanks. **********''This is not about weapons,'' the official said. ''It is about the development of special relations to an Arab country. That is the point. This, for Israel, means the loss of a privileged relationship with us. But, unfortunately, the Israelis, like the Germans, have a tendency to exaggerate. And a lot of people will become mean and sour when propaganda is exaggerated.'' **********Alois Mertes, a minister of state in the Foreign Ministry, made a paper available this week in which he cited a need for consultations among the United States, Britain, France and West Germany over arms deliveries to the Middle East. **********Mr. Mertes noted that Israel's supporters had at times opposed arms sales to Arab nations by West Germany's NATO allies.

''This does not mean that we, or Washington, London and Paris, are obliged to accept their conclusions.''  Opponents of the Deal **********Mr. Mertes, a Christian Democrat with traditionally close ties to Israel, said that in West Germany the campaign against weapons sales to Saudi Arabia was being conducted by the opposition Social Democratic and Green parties as well as by ''committed friends of Israel from all sides and pacifist opponents of any arms exports.'' **********But he neglected to mention the most consequential domestic foe of the Saudi weapons deal.

Concern Over 'Flying Voters' **********There has been great concern in recent weeks about ''flying voters,'' people who are registered in more than one district. To control the problem, indelible ink was flown in from California. After voting, a person will be required to dab his or her thumb in the ink. But it turns out that the ink can be removed by rubbing-alcohol. **********There are recent reports of poor people being paid $2 to $7 to hand over their voter registration certificates, which someone else can use to vote for them. Again, such tactics are by no means necessarily limited to the governing party. **********''Marcos is going to win this election not by fair means but by foul,'' said Jaime V. Ongpin, a leading businessman in the opposition camp. ''He has never taken chances in the past when he doesn't have to, and he won't now.'' Yet Mr. Ongpin, like many who oppose Mr. Marcos, believes that voting is important, however imperfect the elections may be. Tony Alano, a spokesman for the United Nationalist Democratic Organization, a federation of opposition parties, said, ''We think that participating is the only way to bring change, to eventually replace Marcos without bloodshed.''  Assembly Called Meaningless **********But leaders of the boycott movement reply that the elections are futile. ''We are boycotting this election because it is electing members to a meaningless legislature,'' said Agapito Aquino, brother of the slain opposition leader and one of the heads of the boycott group. **********Under the sixth amendment to the Constitution, Mr. Marcos has decree- making powers enabling him to bypass the legislature. After Mr. Aquino was killed, opposition leaders said they would participate in the Assembly elections if President Marcos acceded to a few demands, the key one of which was giving up his decree-making powers. Mr. Marcos refused and the opposition split between those who advocate participation and the boycotters. **********Support for the boycott is hard to measure. Some estimates place the number of sympathizers at three million, while the movement's leaders say that 40 percent of the roughly 24 million eligible voters will either stay away from the polling places or simply write ''boycott'' on their ballots.   Farmers Puzzled **********Despite efforts to broaden support for the boycott, its appeal seems to be mostly in urban areas. At the rally in San Jose, a few of the curious farmers thought that ''boycott'' was a political party and the speakers were trying to get elected. **********Several foreign diplomats and opposition figures said the boycott was a mistake because the National Assembly, despite its weaknesses, will provide a forum for dissent. After the election, Mr. Marcos, who suffers from a kidney disorder, will face pressure from not only the opposition but also New Society members jockeying for position in the post-Marcos era and foreign creditors worried about their $25.6 billion in loans to the Philippines. **********''There will be significant opportunities in the National Assembly,'' one foreign diplomat said, ''and the boycott people have made themselves irrelevant to the post-election developments.'' **********bite as needed"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/27/business/credit-markets-bond-prices-move-up-sharply.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1984-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 710, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS ; Bond Prices Move Up Sharply", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS ; Bond Prices Move Up Sharply", "body_text": " **********Bond prices rose sharply for the second consecutive day, as investors and speculators became more convinced that inflation will stay low, and that the Federal Reserve will not raise short-term interest rates. **********Although government securities dealers' assesments of investor buying during the last two days ranged from light to substantial, there was widespread agreement that investors and big speculators have not been willing to sell notes and bonds, even at a substantial profit. Including gains of about 1 1/4 point point yesterday, prices of Treasury issues due in 10 years and more have increased nearly 3 points, or $30 per $1000, in the past two days - and as much as 6 points since the July 5 auction of 20- year Treasury bonds. **********All of yesterday's gains occurred before the Federal Reserve announced a $100 million decline, to $546.6 billion, in the nation's basic money supply for the week of July 16. The decline was a mild suprise to the the market, where most forecasts called for a small increase. But the weekly change was not major enough to prompt noticeable changes in short-or long-term interest rates. **********'Good for the Market' ''The money supply data was good for the market, but prices had already run up so much,'' said Edward J. Sawicz, an economist at the Discount Corporation of New York. **********The small drop in the basic money supply measure points toward a growth rate this month for M-1 of only 2 or 3 percent, Mr. Sawicz said, down from 11.3 percent in June and 12.8 percent in May. Slower money supply growth ''improves the prospects that the Federal Reserve will not change policy before the election,'' he said. **********The M-1 measure, which includes currency plus all kinds of checking accounts, is well within the 1984 growth target set by the Fed. Since the fourth quarter of 1983 it has grown at a 6.9 percent rate, compared with a target of 4 to 8 percent. **********Among actively traded Treasury issues, the new 12 5/8 percent notes due in two years were offered at 100 6/32 to yield 12.51 percent, up from an average price of about 99 7/8 at Wednesday's auction. Among longer issues, the 13 1/4 percent bonds due in 2014 were offered at 103 3/4, up nearly 1 1/2 points, to yield 12.75 percent. The Treasury's new 13 3/4 percent bonds due in 2004 were offered at 106, to yield about 12.90 percent, up from 99 27/32 when that issue was auctioned July 5 with an average yield of 13.76 percent. **********Unemployment Claims Cited **********Some analysts said bond prices were bolstered slightly by data for unemployment claims during the July 14 week. At 384,000 claims, the level is noticeably higher than the 350,000 claims per week that prevailed during the first half of the year. If unemployment claims remain at recent levels it ''would be rather convincing evidence that the rate of economic expansion is slowing'' said analysts. **********Market participants also said some buyers were encouraged by rumors that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might be disbanded, and oil prices would drop. **********Short-term interest rates fell slightly yesterday, but have not declined nearly as much as long-term rates in the last week. The rate on six-month Treasury bills is about the same as a week ago, while yields on notes and bonds due in seven years or more have fallen by nearly 3/8 of a percentage point. **********Fed Funds at 11 1/4% **********One reason for the stability of short-term rates has been trading in the Federal funds market, where overnight bank loans have remained well above 11 percent. Yesterday, Federal funds traded around 11 1/4 percent. **********While prices of Treasury notes and bonds continued to rise sharply, and long-term yields fell to around 12 7/8 percent from a recent peak of about 14 percent, many economists said the expanding economy and growing credit demands could still put upward pressure on short-term rates. So long as short-term rates are trending upward, the potential for lower bond yields is limited, they said. **********Other data published yesterday by the Fed showed that business loans at 10 large New York City banks rose by $292 million, while commercial paper outstanding rose by $727 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/11/world/rebel-assails-us-over-south-africa.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 656, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REBEL ASSAILS U.S. OVER SOUTH AFRICA", "print_headline": "REBEL ASSAILS U.S. OVER SOUTH AFRICA", "body_text": " **********The leader of the most prominent exiled group fighting white minority rule in South Africa criticized United States policy in the region today, saying the Reagan Administration had given South Africa a license to attack its neighbors. **********The comments by the leader, Oliver Tambo, at a news conference here, reflected a profound disaffection by black activists inside and outside South Africa with the United States policy called ''constructive engagement.''

The carelessness of those who planted the bomb, he said in a tacit admission of incompetence on the part of his fighters, was ''inexcusable.'' **********''This has the effect of distorting our purpose, our policy,'' he said. ''We have made it clear that this is becoming intolerable, the failure to take proper precautions and hitting people who are not intended to be hit.'' **********In a reflection of his organization's plight after the March 16 agreement and other agreements South Africa has made with black-ruled neighbors to curb the African National Congress, Mr. Tambo assailed the Organization of African Unity for failing to ''give southern Africa the priority which this region demands and deserves.'' **********The nationalist leader is in Zimbabwe to attend, as an observer, a congress of Prime Minister Robert Mugabe's ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union.

Commitment Is Cited **********Mr. Smyser, in his letter, asserted that daily newspapers ''have made the greatest commitment to full-time coverage of the Department of Defense.'' He contended that the daily press corps included experienced military reporters and that ''this resource of experience and ability must be used to the fullest toward our mutual objective to serve the public.'' **********The issue of news coverage of military operations has been in dispute since the Defense Department prohibited on-the-scene coverage of the invasion of Grenada last year, citing the need for mission security. **********After protests from news organizations, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., convened a panel of military officers and correspondents, who recommended, among other things, a pool of reporters to cover military contingencies. **********The Defense Department, however, initially planned that the pool - under which correspondents would share information with news outlets not included in the pool - would include representatives of news agencies, television, radio and news magazines, but not newspapers. **********That drew further protests from newspaper executives, and the Pentagon reversed itself. Defense Department officials later asserted that accounts of the initial decision were premature. Those accounts, however, were confirmed by public affairs officials before being published.   Prompt Coverage Urged **********Mr. Johnson said in his letter that news executives and Pentagon officials who took part in the Nov. 15 meeting agreed that ''U.S. military operations, with very few exceptions, should be covered promptly by U.S. reporters.'' **********They also agreed that ''coverage can be achieved in ways which preserve mission security and personnel safety.'' They also agreed that ''pools may be necessary sometimes, particularly in the early hours of some military operations,'' when limited transportation and the battle itself would permit only a few reporters on the scene. **********'No One Can Know' **********''We both agreed that no one can know exactly in advance what size pool may be possible in some specific, future contingency,'' Mr. Johnson wrote. He noted that Mr. Burch said the Pentagon could not determine the composition of a pool before an operation was planned.

The drop was twice as large as expected. **********But the announcement had only a slight impact in the credit markets, where interest rates fell modestly. **********Declining rates were most pronounced in the note and bond market, where prices for outstanding Treasury issues rose as much as 7/8 point. **********Most of the gains came at the opening, when traders learned that retail sales in March were weaker than expected. The 2.2 percent drop in retail sales, the largest in 10 years, helped revive hopes that economic growth in coming months might be slow enough to reduce the upward pressure on interest rates and inflation. **********Many analysts concluded that the large decline in the M-1 money supply measure, plus the modest growth in more broadly defined money supply measures in March, which were also announced yesterday, could make the Fed less likely to aggressively tighten monetary policy and thus drive interest rates up. **********Notoriously Erratic They added, however, that in recent months the Fed has paid more attention to the economy than to money supply data. Weekly money supply figures are notoriously erratic, and may be particularly unreliable during April, when individual income tax payments and refunds make it hard for Fed officials to adjust the weekly data. **********''The behavior of M-1 does not argue for futher tightening by the Fed,'' said Paul Boltz, an economist at T. Rowe Price Associatets, a Baltimore-based manager of mutual funds. ''But recent history shows that changes in M-1 do not correlate very well with changes in Fed policy.'' **********The $5 billion decline for M-1 puts that measure at $533.2 billion, or about $2.2 billion above the bottom of the Fed's 1984 growth target of 4 to 8 percent, and $5.5 billion below the top of the target. M-1 consists of currency plus all kinds of checking deposits. More broadly defined measures of the money supply, which are published monthly, remain within the 1984 growth targets set by the Fed. **********M-2 Up $6.4 Billion **********M-2, consisting of M-1 plus money market funds held by the public, money market bank accounts, small savings and certain bank borrowings, increased by $6.4 billion, a 3.6 percent annual rate, and is now only $3 billion above the bottom of the Fed's 6 to 9 percent annual growth target. M-3, which is M-2 plus large time deposits, certain bank borrowings and institutional money market funds, grew by $19.2 billion in March, an 8.4 percent annual rate, and is now $2.6 billion below the upper limit of the Fed's growth target of 6 to 9 percent. **********Other data reported by the Fed showed that reserves have become scarcer in the banking system. For the two weeks ended Wednesday, borrowings by banks and financial institutions from the Fed averaged $1.277 billion, excluding extended credits to troubled institions. At the same time, excess reserves averaged $430 million, producing a net borrowed reserve position of $847 million. **********The increasing scarcity of bank reserves is widely cited by analsyts as a sign that the Fed is not supplying all the reserves that banks need to sustain the rapid growth in lending which has accompanied the strong economy in the first quarter. In the two weeks ended March 14, for example, borrowings from the Fed averaged $668 million, while excess reserves of $770 million led to a free reserve position of $102 million. **********Along with increasing scarcity of bank reserves, the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market has increased to an average of 10.27 percent in the two weeks ended April 11, up from about 9 3/4 percent for the two weeks ended March 14. **********Bellwether Bond Rises **********Following the money supply announcement, the bellwether 12 percent Treasury bond due in 2013 rose about 1/4 point, while Treasury bill rates fell by about five hundredths of a percentage point. By late in the day, the 12 percent bond was at 97, up 7/8 point, to yield 12.37 percent. **********In the Treasury bill market, rates fell by a few hundredths of a percentage point on the day, with the three- month issue was bid late in the day at 9.62 percent, down from 9.66 percent before the money supply announcement. New one-year Treasury bills sold at an average rate of 9.86 percent, up from 9.68 percent at auction four weeks ago. **********Amid rising prices for outstanding Treasury and corporate bonds, underwriters announced interest rates for some high-grade, fixed-rate issues, which have been in short supply recently. The Digital Equipment Corporation's $100 million of 12 5/8 percent notes due in 1994 are offered today at 99.6 to yield 12.70 percent, while a $100 million issue of 13 percent debentures due in 2014 was offered at 99 5/8 to yield 13.05 percent.

It will lead to the polarization and radicalization of Honduran society. Reinforcement of the extreme right now will lead to development of the extreme left later.''  U.S. Ties Backed **********But the chief of the armed forces, Gen. Gustavo Alvarez Martinez, who is considered by many Hondurans to be the nation's most powerful figure, has urged an even deeper United States involvement and called for a formal security commitment to Honduras. **********Since mid-1982, when the Reagan Administration signed a base access and construction agreement with Honduras, the United States has spent $13 million to lengthen the runway and install other facilities at Palmerola air base near Tegucigalpa. The base has served as command center for up to 4,500 American troops involved in Big Pine II, the joint exercises that began last August and end Wednesday. **********Military officers here say the Pentagon has proposed to Congress that $6 million more be spent at Palmerola to build an ammunition storage depot for the United States Air Force and permanent barracks and support facilities for 100 United States personnel who are to be stationed there during future exercises. The next two, Grenadier I and Big Pine III, are planned for this summer and fall. **********In addition, during the last two years the United States has helped finance the improvement and expansion of air bases at San Lorenzo, Trujillo, Aguacate, San Pedro Sula and Puerto Lempira. It has also installed radar facilities at Tiger Island and Amapala in the Gulf of Fonseca near the Nicaraguan coast and at Cerro de Hule, about 20 miles from Tegucigalpa, all manned by Americans.   Questions by Senator **********Moreover, the Pentagon wants to spend $8 million to improve the Honduran air base at La Ceiba and $3 million on an ammunition storage depot for the American Army at San Lorenzo on the Pacific Coast near Nicaragua. The Pentagon also plans improvements at airfields at Jamastran and Cucuagua in connection with the military exercises this fall. **********This extensive construction has come under sharp attack from Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on military construction. Mr. Sasser has charged the Pentagon with circumventing a Congressional demand for the Defense Department to present a comprehensive plan for its construction program in Honduras. In the absence of such a plan, Congress has blocked the $8 million for La Ceiba. **********''My concern is that we are backing into another problem area here without thinking where we are going and without any public discussion,'' Mr. Sasser said at a news conference here Sunday. **********''We have no clear sense of what the Administration intends here, no clear policy,'' Mr. Sasser said. ''There's a military infrastructure here that exceeds what is necessary for the exercises. Clearly, these facilities are being built for contingency purposes. I don't know what the contingencies are.'' **********He also voiced concern at being informed by the American military commander at Palmerola, Col. Arnie Schlossberg, that the Pentagon had plans for American military exercises in Honduras running through 1988.   Envoy Defends Exercises **********The United States Ambassador, John Negroponte, who has fended off Honduran appeals for a formal security treaty, defends the military exercises and the American military presence as a less formal way of giving Hondurans reassurance against what the Honduran Government sees as a serious long- term military threat from Nicaragua. **********''These are not going to be bases for us because we aren't planning to station large contingents of U.S. forces at them,'' the Ambassador said in an interview Monday. ''The facilities are there for contingency use. They're available for us. We've made the improvements and if some contingency arose and we wanted to use them, a lot of the preparatory work would have been done.'' **********He also backed the idea of building a joint United States-Honduran naval aid station at Puerto Castilla as an important element in the overall American strategy in the defense of the Central American region. President Suazo, who has pushed the idea privately with the embassy for some time, promoted it publicly at a news conference last Saturday.  ''Such a base would help us greatly in training our naval forces,'' he said. ''It would also serve as a warning to any foreign country contemplating trampling our sovereignty.''  'President Is in Charge' **********Ambassador Negroponte said he felt the idea ''ought to be seriously considered'' by the United States, but added that it would require much more planning as well as negotiations with Honduras for base access rights. **********More broadly, he took issue with domestic criticism that the United States involvement here was promoting the political ascendency of the military establishment and General Alvarez in particular. **********''I don't think the society is being militarized,'' Mr. Negroponte said. ''The President is in charge and General Alvarez has been committed to the constitutional process. The real test is going to be having two elections in a row. **********''This country has a habit of having one election and then something happening. The election of 1985 is an important test. My first priority here is encouraging the constitutional process.''  Attitude Is Questioned **********But independent newspapers like El Tiempo and many politicians take issue with his view, though only a few have so far spoken out publicly. **********An opinion poll conducted by Gaither International of Stamford, Conn., found that 63 percent of those questioned felt the Honduran military has ''more influence over what happens in the country'' than the Government. Only 26 percent said the Government was more influential than the military. **********Carlos Roberto Reina, a lawyer and an influential member of the Liberal Party's left wing, said in an interview that he and others were fearful that the current crisis atmosphere and American military presence would influence the 1985 Honduran presidential election. **********''Senator Sasser said the U.S. will have military operations until 1988,'' he said. ''That worries me greatly because I don't think we can have elections with the presence of foreign troops here. We are in the eye of a hurricane, between Nicaragua and Salvador. I am very much afraid of a Vietnamization, of East-West tensions clashing in our country.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/28/business/financial-units-in-michigan-deal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Financial Units In Michigan Deal", "print_headline": "Financial Units In Michigan Deal", "body_text": " **********First Federal of Michigan said it had agreed in principle to sell 16 metropolitan Detroit branch offices to First Federal Savings Bank and Trust of Pontiac, Mich., in a deal expected to add $58 million to First Federal of Michigan's capital. **********The agreement calls for First Federal Savings to buy the branch buildings and equipment and assume about $600 million in deposit liabilities, the company said. **********It added that the transaction requires the approval of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and exeucution of a definitive agreement.

Among them is Mr. Lee's 32-year- old son, Lee Hsein Loong, who left his post as second in command of Singapore's armed forces to take up politics, raising opposition charges that a dynasty was being established. **********''This election will decide once and for all whether Singapore will continue on the road to democracy or whether it will take a step backward into one- party rule,'' J.

He says Mr. Lee's sweep of his party's old guard indicates that the same message is reaching him.   Variety of Challenges **********Mr. Lee's party is being challenged in 49 constituencies by three independent candidates, the Workers' Party and seven smaller parties - the Singapore United Front, the United People's Front, Barisan Sosialis (a major opposition party until it withdrew from Parliament in 1966 and boycotted the 1968 election), the Singapore Democratic Party, the Singapore Justice Party, the Islamic Movement and the Singapore National Malay Organization. The Peoples Action Party is not being challenged for the 30 other seats. **********The opposition parties are concentrating on matters that appear to be small issues, but that are important at the grass-roots level: Government changes in the education system that are thought to reward the brightest at the expense of other children, Government incentives to college-educated women to marry and have more children and a proposed raising of the age - to 65 from 55 - at which Singaporeans can begin to withdraw money from compulsory retirement accounts. **********Opposition parties were not permitted to campaign until after the filing of nominations on Dec. 12, the minimum 10 days required before voting.

This is a largely Roman Catholic region, and about 80,000 people, the largest crowd to attend any of the events of his tour, gave the Pope the warmest reaction of his trip. During the mass, the Pope ordained nine priests. **********Dissident Rejects Ecumenism **********Archbishop Lefebvre heads the traditionalist, or integrist, movement that rejects many of the teachings of the Second Vatican Council, which closed in 1965. In particular, the movement rejects the liturgical innovations of celebrating mass in the vernacular, with the priest facing the faithful, and the impetus given by the Council to the ecumenical movement, which seeks to heal the splits between the Christian faiths. **********Because a bishop cannot be stripped of his hierarchical rank without church trial on such charges as heresy, Archbishop Lefebvre has continued, despite Pope Paul's injunction, to ordain priests at his principal seminary near here, as well as at others that he has founded in the United States and West Germany. The Vatican must recognize them as duly ordained, but does not accredit the priestly acts that they perform any more than it accredits those of their leader. **********Vatican officials and those who follow Vatican affairs believe that Paul VI and his successors have preferred to leave Archbishop Lefebvre's actions in an ecclesiastical twilight zone rather than enhance their importance by seeking to have him declared heretical or schismatic. But they say that the Vatican takes a serious and worried view of the movement, and even before the Swiss trip they expected that the Pope would not ignore Archbishop Lefebvre in his speeches.   Obedience Emphasized **********A priest fulfills his functions ''as a collaborator of the bishop who, for his part, is united with the successor of Peter,'' the Pope said. ''By being obedient to these two, the priest lives in community with the whole church.'' **********He warned priests not ''to dispose of the gifts of God'' in an arbitrary manner and cited St. Paul, who said a priest must be trustworthy as an ''administrator of the mysteries of God.'' **********John Paul reminded priests that they ''must love the church and feel and think with the church.'' **********He continued: ''Not only the church of the past nor a church that does not yet exist, but the concrete, actual church, whose wrinkles and spots should be removed also through his humble assistance.'' **********Departing somewhat from the earnest and largely ecclesiastical character of earlier speeches during the trip, John Paul took time out for a nostalgic reminiscence as he blessed a skiers' flag.   Reflections on Ecology **********''I am pleased to be among the mountain dwellers and sportsmen that you are, because, doubtless you know, I liked to climb the mountains of my country and to practice skiing on occasions,'' the Pope said. **********As on earlier occasions during the trip, the beauty of the Swiss landscape elicited reflections about ecology that was considered a new note in Roman Catholic attitudes, which ecologists have criticized as concentrating on man to the disregard of nature. **********''God, the creator of all things, You entrusted this earth to us, its riches and its beauty,'' a special prayer for the skiers said. ''Help us to respect them and make us serve them for the good of all men.'' **********On Saturday in Lucerne, the Pope made an even more pointed appeal. He said: ''How intensely we all hear this groaning, from our own heart and from the person at our side, even from the whole creation, from mishandled, exploited nature, from the plants and animals struggling for air and a place to live.'' **********The Pope boarded his plane for the return to Rome late this afternoon.

If convicted, each would face a sentence of 30 years imprisonment, the maximum penalty permitted by Nicaraguan law. **********'To Show the World' **********Several lawyers involved in the trials of absent insurgent leaders said they believed they were intended principally for foreign consumption. **********''The trials are to show the world who is perpetrating the aggression we are suffering,'' said Juan Carcache Alguera, who was named to defend Eden Pastora Gomez. Mr. Pastora, leader of the Revolutionary Democratic Alliance, is recuperating in Venezuela from an assassination attempt.  Omar Cortez, the senior judge in the trial of the 27, said justice demanded such proceedings. ''Even if we cannot find and arrest these defendants,'' he said, ''the Government wants to respond to the demands of people who have been injured.'' **********Mr. Carcache said he doubted that he could make any substantial defense against charges that Mr. Pastora was involved in attacks on Government outposts. Mr. Pastora and his group have taken responsibility for various attacks in southern Nicaragua. **********''His background and activities are well known within Nicaragua and abroad,'' Mr. Carcache said. ''For me he is a confessed criminal.'' **********The defendants named in court documents include most leaders of the anti- Sandinista insurgency. Among them are Alfonso Robelo Callejas, a former Sandinista junta member who is now co-director with Mr. Pastora of the Insurgent Revolutionary Democratic Alliance, and Adolfo Calero Portocarrero, who heads the largest rebel group, the Nicaraguan Democratic Force.   One Rebel Leader Unconcerned **********Mr. Calero said in a recent telephone interview that he was not concerned about the prospect of being tried in absentia by the Sandinistas. ''The judgment of people who have no judgment is worthless,'' he said. ''They themselves showed that the way tyrannies are overthrown is with arms in hand.'' **********All 27 defendants are being tried in the Anti-Somozist People's Tribunal rather than in regular criminal courts. The tribunal was established 13 months ago to weigh cases of captured rebel soldiers, accused civilian collaborators and others said to favor re-establishing the four-decade dictatorship of the Somoza family. **********The three judges who preside over the tribunal have traveled to remote parts of the country to interview witnesses and gather evidence, according to the senior judge, Mr. Cortez. **********The cases were filed in March and April by a Government prosecutor. Under tribunal procedure, the trials have proceeded in writing and without oral argument. Nine private lawyers have been named as defense attorneys, but none has filed any papers on behalf of clients, officials said. **********In interviews, court-appointed lawyers said they did not believe any effective defense was possible. They ruled out using what one called ''an ideological defense,'' in which the defendants would be portrayed as patriots and the Sandinistas as usurpers.   Called 'Too Hot a Job' **********''I don't see how it could be said that Eden Pastora represents the real Sandinista revolution and that he only wants liberty for Nicaragua,'' said Mr. Carcache of his client. Defending Mr. Pastora, he said, was ''too hot a job for any Nicaraguan lawyer.'' **********Another court-appointed defender, Socorro Medrano Reyes, said she did not feel able to argue on behalf of her client, Enrique Bermudez, a former colonel in the deposed National Guard who is now the top strategist for the Nicaraguan Democratic Force. **********''I cannot talk to him, because the mere fact of being in contact with him would create suspicion that I was conspiring,'' she said. ''It is a somewhat absurd situation for a lawyer.'' **********Some foreign and domestic critics of the Government have said the tribunal lacks fair legal procedures.

While the company's top executives acknowledge a hunger to own more broadcast properties, they say television stations may have become too expensive to meet the company's demands for high profitability. **********''They will buy only if the price and the property are right,'' said Warren E. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., an Omaha concern with significant holdings in several companies, not including Capital Cities. ''It's like watching Ted Williams hit.'' **********Indeed, analysts say, Capital Cities has a history of waiting for the right pitch and then smashing a home run. The company's taste for purchasing properties in lucrative markets, often at a bargain price, has propelled Capital Cities into one of the most profitable companies in the nation's highly profitable communications industry.   Sharp Stock Rise **********Although the company pays virtually no dividends, consistently high earnings have pushed the price of its stock from about $18 in 1974, after adjusting for a stock split, to $166.75 at yesterday's close. **********In 1983, the company's net income was $114.7 million, or $8.53 a share, on revenues of $762 million. This result was fueled by profit margins of nearly 48 percent from the broadcast division, which includes top-ranked television stations in Philadelphia and Houston. **********In the industry, the average profit margin for television stations is about 35 percent, said R. Joseph Fuchs, a media analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company. He estimated that the Capital Cities television stations had profits of about 52 percent in 1983, with radio profits somewhat less. **********The company's publishing division had a profit margin of nearly 23 percent, which analysts also applaud. The division includes Fairchild Publications, the parent of such trade publications as Women's Wear Daily. Newspapers such as The Kansas City Star and The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, analysts say, also contribute significantly to the publishing operation's revenue and profit figures. **********This year's numbers are expected to show a substantial improvement over those for 1983, and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, an investment firm, forecasts a 25 percent rise in earnings per share, to $10.65.  Decentralized Management **********One reason that Capital Cities earns such abundant profits, according to Thomas S. Murphy, the company's chairman and chief executive officer, is its hallmark: decentralized management, coupled with a rigorous budgeting process. Although some news media analysts consider Capital Cities to be among the best- managed companies in the industry, the company's culture is almost one of nonmanagement, compared with most companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. **********''We just get the brightest people we can find to run our operations, and let them do their jobs,'' Mr. Murphy said. **********While many large companies make similar claims, the reality is often different. But some news media analysts say that Capital Cities gives an exceptional degree of entrepreneurial independence to the people who operate its 7 television stations, 12 radio stations, 10 daily newspapers, more than 30 trade publications and various other communications-related ventures. **********Gilbert E. Kaplan, who announced on July 31 that he would sell Institutional Investor to Capital Cities for a price thought to be about $72 million, called the company's hands-off attitude a big factor in his decision to sell. **********''They assured the editorial independence of Institutional Investor, and I trust Capital Cities,'' said Mr. Kaplan, who will continue as editor of the monthly financial magazine.  Small Headquarters **********Mr. Murphy, who is 59 years old and was hired away from a marketing job at Lever Brothers to manage Capital Cities' first television station, takes a maverick's delight in comparing his company's pint-sized corporate headquarters with the sprawling central offices of most other public companies. **********Fewer than 35 people occupy the Capital Cities home office, which is tucked into a lovingly restored landmark building across from St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York. The late Lowell Thomas, who was one of the backers when Capital Cities was founded in 1954, made radio broadcasts from one of the company's mahogany-paneled offices. **********''There's no public relations department, no legal department, no corporate personnel office,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''The New York office does n't make any money, we just spend money.'' **********But at Capital Cities, which got its name because its first two television stations were in Albany and in Raleigh, N.C. - both capital cities - spending money is done with the utmost care.  'Tight-Fisted' **********''It's a very, very cost-oriented company,'' said Jay Nelson, manager of the research department for Brown Brothers Harriman, a private bank. ''They are tight-fisted.'' **********The company's attention to keeping operations lean has made it vulnerable to charges that its publications and broadcast stations suffer in quality. Following acquisitions by Capital Cities, there were strikes at The Kansas City Star and The Oakland Press in Pontiac, Mich., which have led to accusations of union-busting tactics from editorial employees. **********The company's most serious mistake, according to analysts, was the purchase of The Times Leader, an all-day newspaper in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., where the company lost about $2 million in 1983. Within months of the acquisition in 1978, most of the news staff went on strike over work rule changes and work force reductions and soon began publishing a rival daily that still competes, making The Times Leader one of the company's few newspapers not in a monopoly market. **********Mr. Murphy denied that Capital Cities busts unions and that the company demands profits at the expense of excellence. ''We were blind-sided in Wilkes-Barre,'' he said. ''There is not necessarily a correlation between high profit margins and low quality. We just don't have more people than we need.''  Pulitzers Won **********Mr. Murphy pointed out that in recent years both the Kansas City and Fort Worth newspapers have won Pulitzer Prizes, and he added that Capital Cities had approved the spending of $65 million to upgrade the printing operation in Fort Worth. Local news shows of the company's six network- affiliated television stations are all ranked either first or second in their markets, Mr. Murphy adds. **********Capital Cities was founded as a broadcasting company, but within a few years found itself near the limit of 7 television stations and 7 AM and 7 FM radio stations that the Federal Communications Commission allows under its 7-7-7 rule. **********In search of growth, the company branched out into newspapers and trade magazines, and has more recently acquired several cable television franchises and direct mail operations, which Mr. Murphy said would probably be expanded. **********Certainly, Capital Cities has the means to expand. Last year, it sold $200 million of 30-year subordinated debentures and has the money ready for acquisitions. **********Daniel B. Burke, the company's president and chief operating officer, said the company's cash reserves and large cash flow had essentially covered this year's purchases of Institutional Investor and an independent UHF television station in Tampa, Fla., for $30 million. Profits Up This Year **********Although its publishing division provided more than 60 percent of the company's revenues and broadcasting only 31 percent in 1983, the profits from the two are almost equal. For the first half of 1984, Capital Cities' net income jumped 24 percent, to $66.5 million from $53.6 million, and revenue increased 24 percent, to $450.4 million. **********Strong advertising sales pushed up both broadcasting and publishing profits. Earnings in the publishing sector were especially helped by lower-than-expected newsprint prices and the successful introduction of new publications, such as M, a consumer fashion magazine for men that is a companion for W, a similar publication for women. **********If the F.C.C.'s 7-7-7 rule is amended to allow companies to own more than 7 television stations, as is scheduled for next spring, Mr. Burke and Mr. Murphy say that Capital Cities will look for reasonably priced television stations. But they complain that both television stations and newspapers are overpriced. **********Some analysts say that Capital Cities is likely to expand its cable television and direct-mail holdings and enter the cellular telephone market. Capital Cities has frequently invested in its own stock when attractive acquisitions were not available, and analysts say this has increased the company's earnings per share."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/13/world/around-the-world-us-japan-accord-on-whales-is-reported.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-11-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 203, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S.-Japan Accord On Whales Is Reported", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; U.S.-Japan Accord On Whales Is Reported", "body_text": " **********Negotiators for the United States and Japan have reportedly reached tentative agreement on a plan to allow the Japanese to catch sperm whales for three more years without facing penalties. **********An agreement was reportedly reached Saturday, but the terms were not made public. **********Greenpeace, the conservation group, said today that the United States had told a Japanese delegation here that it would not enforce the Packwood-Magnuson Amendment if Japan agreed to end all sperm whaling after 1987. **********The amendment requires that fishing quotas in United States territorial waters be reduced by at least 50 percent for any nation that violates agreements by the International Whaling Commission. **********The commission has barred all taking of sperm whales. **********Government spokesmen said today that they could not comment on the negotiations and added that any agreement must be approved at the highest levels of both Governments.

And Poles, Czechoslovaks and other refugees from Eastern Europe keep arriving as well. **********Package Tours to Asylum **********On special discount fares from Aeroflot, the Soviet airline, and Lot, the Polish airline, the travelers from underdeveloped third world nations fly in groups into East Berlin's Sch\"onefeld Airport and, without visas, are admitted to East Germany. **********In a matter of hours, they take the subway to West Berlin - an open city - where they report to the police, seeking political asylum. **********The thousands who reach West Berlin, with an automatic claim on the indulgence of the West German welfare state, are but one current of a wider flow of poor, hungry and persecuted immigrants who are crashing the gates of Western Europe. **********Number of Aliens Unknown **********As in the United States, the police and immigration officials have no precise idea of how many illegal aliens filter yearly into Western Europe and take up residence. **********With the possible exception of Britain, which as an island has a certain advantage, the countries of Western Europe have not been particularly successful in closing the doors on illegal immigrants. **********Until the European economies went into slump, cheap foreign labor had been welcome. **********''Things have changed, and what was perfectly acceptable in the past is now a burden,'' commented Jan van Hoogstraten, who heads the Bonn office of the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration. ''But in Europe we haven't reached the situation in the United States. There's no comparison with that 1,000-a-day across the southern borders of the United States.'' **********The main entryways to Western Europe are its airports, which yearly draw thousands of ''tourists'' from the third world, who overstay their visas, find menial jobs and settle into precarious existences. **********Charter flights bring people in bulk. Last year, after 1,000 Iranians arrived in one day at Madrid's airport, the Spanish Government enacted a regulation requiring Iranians to have visas, choking off one easy entry point to Western Europe. **********A minority of illegals arrive by more exotic and arduous routes. Many Moroccan workers start in Gibraltar and find their way north through Spain. Christian Assyrians often flee Iraq by foot across Turkey and slip into Greece over the Evros River. Indians sometimes jump ship in Rotterdam. Professional human smugglers frequently slip Zairians who have landed in Brussels across the French border at night. **********Once in Western Europe, the immigrants tend to move from south to north, from the poorer and more tolerant Mediterranean countries to more prosperous welfare states like West Germany and France, which also happen to be the places where the outsiders have become especially resented. In France, the 11 percent showing of the extreme right-wing National Front in last month's European elections was partly attributed to a growing antipathy for foreigners. **********One of the easiest accesses to Western Europe is West Berlin, which is surrounded by Communist East Germany, 110 miles from the West German frontier. Its status as a free and open city under the protection of the United States, France and Britain means that West Berlin cannot shut its doors to anyone coming from East Germany.   East Germans Turn Blind Eye **********Making an exception to its strict entry procedures, the East German authorities turn a blind eye to the thousands of third world travelers who land in Sch\"onefeld en route to West Berlin, knowing they will become an extra burden on the city's capitalist system. **********By demanding asylum from political persecution, however dubious their cases may be, the new arrivals guarantee themselves lodging in hostels, three meals a day, pocket money and, usually, a protracted stay while the courts resolve their claims. **********''Everything is O.K. Everything is very good,'' beamed Balendran Thillaibalam, a newly-arrived 52-year-old Tamil from Sri Lanka, taking his lunch with two compatriots at a refugee hostel here. ''They are very kindly giving us clothes and they are serving us very well. We like this hotel.'' **********Mr. Thillaibalam, who said he had worked as a printer in Jaffna, maintained that his reason for leaving his homeland was ''political, political.'' But he had difficulty explaining why the Sri Lanka Government's purported persecution had not extended to his wife and three children, whom he left behind. **********West Berlin's Interior Ministry, asserting that 90 percent of those seeking political asylum make fraudulant claims, takes a dim view of its population of 18,000 asylum-seekers. Officials say that networks in places like Ghana and Sri Lanka orchestrate the flow of immigrants seeking asylum, swelling the city's prostitute and drug-dealing underworld.   Tighten Immigration Laws **********Like other countries, West Germany has tightened its laws on political asylum and now bans immigrants seeking asylum from obtaining work permits during their first two years in the country. These measures produced a drop in the number of applicants for asylum from 107,818 in 1980 to 19,773 last year, 5,198 of whom were allowed to stay. **********But court appeals, independent court rulings and a longstanding policy of not expelling anyone from an East European Communist country mean that only about 70 percent of those denied asylum are actually deported, according to the Interior Ministry in Bonn. The ministry estimates that some 200,000 candidates turned down in their request for asylum now live permanently in West Germany. **********In January, to the consternation of the Interior Ministry, a court in M\"unster ruled that ''collective state persecution'' of Tamils existed in Sri Lanka, implying that none could be denied asylum. In a matter of months, some 1,200 Tamils arrived at Sch\"onefeld, and took the subway to West Berlin.  From West Berlin, officials say, immigrants seeking asylum have little difficulty obtaining forged passports, enabling them to travel to West Germany. Once inside West Europe, they move easily from country to country. ''There are no borders in Europe anymore,'' said an official in France.   France Offered Amnesty **********In the summer of 1981 President Francois Mitterrand's Government sought to regulate the situation of the estimated 400,000 illegal aliens in France by offering an amnesty to illegal immigrants. **********Some 150,000 responded to the Government's offer - most of them from France's former colonies in northern Africa - and 131,000 were accepted as legal residents. The rest remained underground. **********France requires all residents to carry identity papers with them, permitting police to make spot checks in subways and other public places. Visitors from northern Africa must fill out a two-page immigration document - one half to be reurned on their departure. Fines have been stiffened from $695 to $2,780 for companies that hire illegal immigrants. **********With the toughest legislation in Western Europe and stringent airport screening procedures, Britain has made a determined and largely successful effort to halt illegal immigration, while at the same time stepping up deportations and tightening entry requirements even for some of its own nationals.   Five Categories of Citizens **********The British Nationality Act, which came into force last year, created five categories of British citizen - only one of which has the automatic and permanent right to live in the country. There are 57 million of these British citizens, and all but two million of them are white. **********Excluded from the right to settle are Hong Kong's largely nonwhite population of 2.5 million and some 1.5 million ''overseas citizens'' - Indians, Malaysians and others - who had become United Kingdom citizens when their homelands gained independence. A sharp crackdown last year dropped the number of immigrants accepted for settlement to 53,500, the lowest figure since controls on Commonwealth immigration were first imposed in 1962. **********In London, Fiona Mactaggart, general secretary of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said that in the last 12 months more than half of husbands and fiances applying from the Indian subcontinent to join their wives or future wives in Britain have been refused entry. **********''You've got women and children alone without any prospects of the husbands getting here,'' said Mrs. Mactaggart. ''And a woman from the city here would not have much of a life chasing cows in rural India.''  Mediterranean Less Attractive **********Further south, higher rates of unemployment and less generous welfare systems have made West Europe's Mediterranean countries less attractive to illegal immigrants. In the 1970's, for example, some 60,000 Pakistanis were thought to be working in Greece. Officials now put the figure at no more 300. **********In Italy, Ethiopians, Somalians and Tunisians predominate in an illegal alien population thought to number between 700,000 and 800,000. But many others, like East Europeans seeking asylum, regard the country only as a stopping place on their way to the United States or other destinations. **********Some southern European ''guest workers'' have started drifting home after years of employment in Scandinavia and West Germany. But there have been no major shifts - in contrast to the 100,000 Turkish ''guest workers'' who this year are expected to take cash incentives to leave West Germany for home."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/10/world/desertion-unsettles-green-party-in-bonn.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 654, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DESERTION UNSETTLES GREEN PARTY IN BONN", "print_headline": "DESERTION UNSETTLES GREEN PARTY IN BONN", "body_text": " **********West Germany's Green Party was jolted today when one of its most respected legislators resigned from the party in protest over ''intrigues and power struggles'' and what he said was the growing influence of the party's Marxist-Leninist faction. **********The legislator, Gert Bastian, a 60- year-old retired general who left the West German Army to protest the planned deployment of American medium-range missiles in Germany, quit after complaining of bitter infighting and ''a strong anti-American undertow'' in the party's foreign policy. **********Mr. Bastian's decision to leave the party but to stay in Parliament as an independent reduces the Greens' parliamentary group to 27 members. Should one more lawmaker quit, the Green Party would lose its standing as a parliamentary group, and its government subsidies and right to speak in debates would be reduced. **********The departure of the former general, who had lent weight and expertise to the young party's emotional and neutralist foreign policy formulations, comes in the midst of a triangular power struggle involving the party's Marxist-Leninists, the group called the fundamentalists and the advocates of collaboration with the big Social Democratic party. Antimissile Movement **********The disorder in the Green party has also weakened the West German antimissile movement, which appears to have run out of steam since the arrival of the first American Pershing 2 missiles in November. **********A close friend of Petra Kelly, the American-educated founder of the ecology-minded party, Mr. Bastian was considered a member of her fundamentalist wing, which says the Greens must preserve their identity as an ''antiparty party'' and avoid alliances with the Social Democrats. **********His grievances centered on the chaos and backbiting that has poisoned the working atmosphere in the party's parliamentary group, sloppy distribution of state funds to its regional branches and the shortage of staff assistance for its overworked legislators. **********In a pointed letter to his fellow party members last month, Mr. Bastian complained of ''the regrettable absence of harmony and solidarity'' among the 28 Green party lawmakers, and demanded change.   Marxist-Leninist Strength **********Mr. Bastian also deplored the seizure of key party positions by former members of the Marxist-Leninist Communist League, a seizure he said had undercut the party's commitment to nonviolence and an evenhanded stand between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The Marxist-Leninists, he said, had generated ''a strong anti-American undertow.'' **********In an interview, Miss Kelly predicted: ''If we continue like we have in the last ten months, we are a finished as a party in four years. That's for sure. We are losing someone very capable in defense matters. People are just thrown away. And the guillotine is running.'' **********In her office, piled with stacks of documents and correspondence, Miss Kelly echoed the departing lawmaker's complaints about the ascendancy of the Greens' Marxist-Leninist faction, saying that at a recent gathering it had spurned her motion criticizing the Sandinista Government in Nicaragua for postponing election preparations. **********Miss Kelly said the party leftists had also criticized her and Mr. Bastian for staging miniature antimissile demonstrations in East Berlin and Moscow. **********The strains inside the Green Party have been accentuated by the decision of the party's Hesse organization to strike a working arrangement with the local Social Democrats, who emerged from last September's state election there as the largest single party but fell short of a majority. **********The Hesse compromise, which is not exactly a coalition but which will permit the Social Democrats to pass key legislation, has been attacked by both the Kelly and the Marxist-Leninist factions as a betrayal of the Greens' ideals. **********''I think a lot of Greens do not have enough self-confidence,'' said Otto Schily, a lawmaker who advocates collaboration with the Social Democrats, also known by the initials S.P.D.

But some linguists contend that it is rounding into a perfectly valid and respectable entity of its own. Actually, they mean South Asian English, the link language of the 25 million most influential people in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, and the operational language of the region's modern, leading edge. English and Hindi are the official national languages for Government use. **********'Standard Variety' Evolves It is now clear, says Dr. Braj B. Kachru, a Kashmiri linguist teaching at the University of Illinois, ''that a standard variety of South Asian English has evolved,'' on its own, without the prop of British colonial enforcement. Dr. Kachru recently published a book on the subject and wants to compile a dictionary of Indian English, **********Shaped by local social conditions in response to local needs, and altered by the adoption of forms, constructions and vocabulary from indigenous languages, Indian English appears to be here to stay, adding a strong, increasingly distinct flavor to the planetary babel. **********This is how a typical telephone conversation might sound: **********''That's Mr. Sharma, is it?'' **********''Yeah, yeah. May I speak to Mr. Kapur?'' **********''He is not sitting in his seat. You must be knowing that he is taking tea at this hour, isn't it?'' **********''But I have intimated to him that the matter is very urgent.'' **********''No problem. I will put up your case, and I am sure he will do the needful. May I know your number? He will call you back after half an hour.''  Tendency Toward 'Latinity' **********The conversation is fictional, but its phrasing and vocabulary are authentic, and it takes place in many variations countless times a day, often between a bureaucrat's assistant, called a babu, and a citizen who wants something done. **********If the official gets angry and wants to punish a supplicant, he might dismiss him with the ultimate bureaucratic putdown, delivered with classic, quintessential Indian phrasing: ''Whatever you are wanting, I am not giving.'' **********Among the distinguishing characteristics of Indian English, linguists say, is a pronounced tendency toward what is called Latinity.  ''Demise'' is preferred to ''death.'' Critics are always finding ''lacunae'' in the ''schemes'' of government planners. People are felicitated on their birthdays and condoled in sorrow.  A car is not mortgaged to the bank, it is hypothecated. **********Diction is polite, and the tone somewhat formal and bookish, with the result that spoken Indian English often tends not to sound conversational to American or English ears. To some linguists, such as Akhileshwar Jha of Delhi University, this is a sign that Indian English has not yet matured; that many Indians still try to imitate British and American English rather than internalize the language with confidence and let it flow naturally.   British Flavor Is Strong **********The British flavor remains very strong. ''In the hospital'' becomes ''in hospital.'' ''Can't'' is pronounced ''cahn't.'' Politicians are ''keen'' to gather votes. The last letter of the alphabet is pronounced ''zed.'' **********But many more characteristics stem from the influence of constructions and words from Indian languages, particularly Hindi.  One such usage is ''isn't it?'' as with the French ''n'est-ce-pas?'' But in this case, it can be traced to the Hindi ''hai- neh?'' **********Other examples are the use of ''you must be knowing'' for ''you must know,'' ''what is your native place?'' a common ice-breaker, ''the driver is absconding'' for ''the driver absconded,'' and the phrase ''tea-coffee, please?'' from a waiter bearing both. **********A well-disposed person will ask, ''How is your good self?'' And a clerk filling out a form inquires, ''What is your good name?''  Doubling Up on Words **********Many north Indian languages have no provision for double consonants at the beginning of a word, such as the ''sk'' sound in ''school.'' So you hear ''ess-kool'' and ''ess-tation.'' Kashmiris tend to put in an extra syllable, as in ''sa-peech'' for ''speech.'' **********In another carry-over from Hindi, English speakers tend to double up on some words, as in, ''If I have told him five-five, ten-ten times, I've told him a hundred.'' A simple yes becomes ''yeah yeah.'' **********In yet another carry-over, certain prepositions are dropped and phrases thereby shortened. A bunch of keys becomes a key-bunch. **********The papers, perhaps above all, reflect the gradual fusion of English and Hindi. Journalists use a number of distinctive but essentially non-Indian cliches. Criminals are either miscreants or bad characters or antisocial elements. Public officials do not fly from place to place, they airdash. **********But far more numerous are the Hindi words that pepper the news columns.  You see headlines like, ''Gram, urad and moong fall sharply in Delhi.'' Gram, urad and moong are lentils in the commodities market.   The Octroi Can Hurt **********An octroi is not a seafood delicacy with tentacles, but a road tax. Khuds and nullahs are ravines into which buses often fall, killing 20 or 30 people at a stroke. Rabi and kharif are not two of the 40 thieves, but the spring and fall grain-crop seasons. A gurdwara is a Sikh temple, a dacoit a robber. **********It is difficult, if not impossible, to follow Indian public affairs in the English-language press without knowing that a gherao is when protesters surround a building and won't let anyone in or out; that both a hartal and a bandh are general strikes; that a lakh means 100,000 and a crore 10 million; that a goonda is a hoodlum, a panchayat a village council, a jawan a soldier, and that jhuggis are colonies of squatters' shacks. **********Such words may never gain the currency among speakers of British- American-Australian English that others have gained in the past. Imagine American speech, for example, without dungaree, bungalow, bandana, calico, khaki, sandal, thug, yoga, seersucker, loot, verandah and pajamas, to name just a few Indian transplants. **********But in time the newcomer from other English-speaking lands adopts lakh and crore, bandh and dacoit, khuds and nullahs as his own. Not to mention such everyday terms as dhobi (laundryman), mali (gardener), charpoy (string bed) and chowkidar (nightwatchman)."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/21/business/stocks-in-wide-retreat-dow-off-6.91-to-1259.11.html": {"writer_name": "Alexander Hammer", "pub_date": "1984-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 564, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DOW OFF 6.91, TO 1,259.11", "print_headline": "STOCKS IN WIDE RETREAT; DOW OFF 6.91, TO 1,259.11", "body_text": " **********Stock prices, which have been mostly declining in the last two weeks, fell broadly yesterday in continued active trading. **********Reflecting the weakness, issues that fell on the New York Stock Exchange outscored those that rose by 1,027 to 578.

Libya normally severely restricts entry by journalists, but 100 were invited to visit the country for the ceremony and 60 showed up. **********The guests were flown in chartered planes 650 miles southeast from Tripoli, and then driven almost an hour into the desert in 105-degree heat, to witness what Colonel Qaddafi on Tuesday dubbed Libya's ''new miracle, the eighth wonder of the world.'' **********The project is described as one of the largest single construction programs in the world. But it has raised financial and political concerns. Egypt and the Sudan fear that the tapping of vast aquifers about 170 feet below the Libyan desert will affect their water supplies, and some experts have questioned not only its technical feasibility but also Libya's ability to finance the operation.   Total Cost Uncertain **********Its cost is subject to debate. Some businessmen and diplomats here estimated that at least $11 billion, and perhaps as much as $27 billion, would be required. Libyan officials said Tuesday that the first stage alone would cost $3.5 billion. **********Politically, Colonel Qaddafi has been eager to begin a national project that would galvanize his people and mask growing domestic opposition to his economic and social policies, the analysts said. **********In his speech Tuesday, Colonel Qaddafi likened the new project to the construction of the pyramids in Egypt. **********''This great work will create a new society in Libya while politically it will dwarf its neighbors and cut them down to size,'' he asserted. **********Colonel Qaddafi's monument is being built not by North Africans, however, but by South Koreans, Americans and other foreigners. **********Despite poor relations between the United States and Libya, the British office of Brown & Root Inc., a Houston- based engineering company, has a $100 million contract for project management and preliminary engineering. Price Brothers Company, an American concern based in Dayton, Ohio, is acting as technical consultant.   Korean Company to Provide Pipes **********The Dong-A Construction Company of South Korea has begun building two plants that are to manufacture the 1,233 miles of steel and concrete pipes intended to carry almost eight million cubic yards of water a day from 270 desert wells through two pipelines to the coastal cities of Benghazi, Sirte and Tripoli. **********The pipeline system, which is to be buried six and a half feet in the desert sand, is designed to collect water from aquifers of two major fields, Sarir and Tazerbo, north of Kufra in the Libyan desert, and transport it to a holding reservoir at Ajdabiya, near the coast. From the reservoir one pipeline will carry water to Benghazi; another will go to Sirte and Tripoli. The water will also be available for irrigation along the coastal region. **********The pipes, 12 feet in diameter, will be big enough for a large van to pass through. **********The first stage of the project is scheduled for completion by 1989. At its peak, the project is expected to employ some 8,000 South Korean workers here. **********Representatives of the American contractors who were at the opening ceremony said they saw no conflict between their company's participation in the venture and President Reagan's appeal in 1981 for all Americans to leave Libya.   American Sees 'Great Oportunity' **********Gayle Price Jr., chairman of Price Brothers, said his company would employ Europeans and other foreigners, not Americans, to work in Libya. The project, he said, is a ''great opportunity'' for his company, which has never had a major contract in the Middle East. **********Moreover, the United States Government has approved all the export licenses required for the venture, which Mr. Price described as ''humanitarian, not military.'' **********''We think the American Government is behind us,'' Mr. Price asserted. **********W. Bernard Pieper, senior executive vice president of operations for Brown & Root, said that most of the engineering work on the project was being done in Houston, not in Libya. **********''Besides,'' he said, ''this is a kind of project Libya should be spending its money on. It's better than buying weapons.'' **********In his speech Tuesday night, Colonel Qaddafi attacked both Egypt and the Sudan as lackeys of the United States and Israel. He said he had invited Egypt and the Sudan to join him in exploiting the underground reservoirs to transform their joint deserts into a ''Garden of Eden.'' **********''But Egypt's will has been taken away from it, and so has its resources,'' the declared.   Egypt Called a 'Nanny Goat' **********''Egypt has become a hostage to Israel and the Americans,'' Colonel Qaddafi continued, according to an unofficial translation of his remarks. ''It has been transformed into a nanny goat feeding their children while Egypt's people starve.'' **********He called upon the Egyptian people to ''liberate themselves'' and join Libya in making ''an irrigation network stretching from the eternal Nile to the great artificial river.'' **********He also appealed to the Sudanese to rid themselves of their ''sick lying leader,'' an allusion to President Gaafar al-Nimeiry of the Sudan, which has also rejected the Libyan leader's calls for political union and joint economic development. **********Both the Sudan and Egypt have expressed concern that the tapping of the aquifer in the Libyan desert will lower their countries' water tables. **********In Tripoli, several Arab and Western experts expressed doubt that Libya would be able to afford its dream of making the desert bloom. Financial sources said that the American companies had already been paid, but Dong-A officials declined comment on whether their company had been fully compensated to date. **********Because of the world oil surplus and the drop in oil prices, Libya's revenues, based almost entirely on the production of 1.1 million barrels of oil a day, have plummeted. The sources said that oil revenues had dropped from some $22 billion in 1980 to less than $10 billion last year.   Quest for Loans Reported **********The sources said that Libya had sought loans from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates for the water project, but that so far, no Persian Gulf country had been forthcoming. Saudi Arabia agreed in principle a few months ago to assist the project, but Libya has been unable to get a specific commitment, one source said. **********Another foreign resident said the Libyan Government had withheld one month's salary from military and civil service paychecks to help finance the water project. **********Libya is already deeply in debt to the Soviet Union, its major source of weapons, and to Italy, its major trading partner. **********Last month Libya and Italy agreed on a plan to settle Libya's $600 million debt by bartering oil. Italy's oil company agreed to buy up to 40,000 barrels of oil a day at the price of $30 a barrel set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. These funds would then be used to pay foreign companies for their work here.   Loss for the Italians **********The oil is now selling at about $26 a barrel, so Italy will suffer a loss of about 10 percent of the money it is due, but at least Italian companies will recoup most of their investment, according to one authoritative description of the deal. **********In his speech Tuesday, handwritten on a white memo pad, Colonel Quaddafi read a list of Libyans who he said had sent contributions to the project. To cheers and applause, he said he was returning the money because it was not needed. **********After his speech he drove under the water geyser in a convertible jeep, and his supporters ran behind him, applauding and cheering."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/21/world/around-the-world-french-troops-prepare-to-withdraw-from-chad.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 124, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "French Troops Prepare To Withdraw From Chad", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; French Troops Prepare To Withdraw From Chad", "body_text": " **********French troops have ceased all military operations in Chad and have begun preparing for a withdrawal scheduled to start next week under an agreement with Libya, French military sources said today. **********France and Libya jointly announced on Monday the gradual withdrawal of more than 3,000 French soldiers, who support the Government in N'Djamena, and of 3,500 Libyan troopers, who support Chadian rebels in the north. **********The phased withdrawal is to start with a pullback of 1,600 troopers in the northwest and northeast of the nation to headquarters in interior towns, the military sources said.

It said the United States would leave it to the Arabs to find a substitute formula for achieving the same results. **********The announcement made by the Lebanese Government came as no surprise. It had been anticipated for weeks, ever since President Amin Gemayel decided to yield to Syrian pressure in order to bring about a cease-fire in Lebanon. The Syrians had demanded the cancellation of the accord, which was signed last May 17 by Lebanon and Israel, with the United States as observers. **********Under the agreement, Israel was to pull its troops out of Lebanon over a three-month period. In return, Israel was to receive certain security guarantees in southern Lebanon and some political and economic gestures by the Lebanese, such as a formal renunciation of the state of war and a promise for normalization talks to start after the withdrawal was completed.   Unpublished 'Side Letter' **********But in an unpublished ''side letter'' signed by the United States and Israel, the Israeli withdrawal did not have to start until Syria and the Palestine Libration Organization were also ready to pull their troops out in the same time period. **********United States officials have said they felt the May 17 agreement was crucial if there was to be an independent Lebanon. But Syria refused to discuss pulling its troops out in the context of the Israeli-Lebanese accord, even though, at one time, Syria had said it would leave if Israel did. **********''That proposed agreement,'' John Hughes, the State Department spokesman, said of the May 17 accord, ''still represents the only agreed formula for insuring both Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon and Israel's legitimate security interests, in a manner consistent with Lebanese sovereignty. **********''Those who were responsible for the rejection of the agreement,'' he said, ''must now bear the responsibility for finding an alternative negotiated formula to bring about Israeli withdrawal.'' **********Mr. Hughes also said that although the United States ''does not intend to abandon'' Lebanon, decisions on future American military and economic assistance ''will be taken as the situation unfolds.''  No U.S. Decisions for Now **********He said that the United States remained ready in principle to provide aid, but that in the current confused situation it was impossible to make decisions now. **********''What this means,'' a State Department official said, ''is that we are watching the situation in Lebanon and will decide what to do depending on what happens. Clearly, if some Syrian puppet state emerges, we're not going to foot the bills for it.'' The Administration's Middle East experts say that for the near future they see no alternative to an indefinite partition for Lebanon, with the Israelis in the south and the Syrians in the east and north. **********Mr. Hughes said for the record, however, that ''we oppose the partition of Lebanon which could only lead to greater instability.'' **********As to the decision by Lebanon to scrap the May 17 agreement, Mr. Hughes said, ''The United States regrets this decision.''  Envoy Staying Home for Now **********There appear to be no plans for the special Middle East envoy, Donald Rumsfeld, to return to the Middle East. Some officials say they believe he will soon return to private business, given the lack of opportunities for progress. **********The Sixth Fleet still has warships off the Lebanese shore, and Mr. Hughes said, ''We will continue to take all appropriate measures to insure that United States personnel and property are fully protected.'' **********Other officials said they anticipated that American firepower would be used only if there was a direct threat to the American Ambassador's residence in East Beirut. **********Another official said he expected that American involvement in Lebanon would be largely passive for the time being. Consultations with the Israelis will be stepped up, he said, to coordinate political actions more closely. **********Mr. Hughes, in answer to a question, said Secretary of State George P. Shultz did not regard the cancellation of the May 17 accord, which Mr. Shultz helped negotiate, as a personal failure. **********He said Mr. Shultz felt ''it was a worthy thing to do'' to try to help out a country ''that has torn itself apart for many years and to try and bring about peace.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/12/world/temple-raid-puts-sikhs-in-a-very-foul-mood.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1317, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TEMPLE RAID PUTS SIKHS 'IN A VERY FOUL MOOD'", "print_headline": "TEMPLE RAID PUTS SIKHS 'IN A VERY FOUL MOOD'", "body_text": " **********A light rain today, harbinger of the coming monsoon, soaked the woven jute carpets leading to the golden-domed Bangla Sahib gurdwara, or Sikh temple, here. **********But the rain did not cool the tempers of the knots of turbaned Sikh men, who in agitated tones discussed the assault on their holiest shrine, the Golden Temple in Amritsar, last week. **********''If Christ's temple were destroyed, what would Christians say?'' asked Jagjit Singh, a doctor, as a crowd of Sikhs nodded in angry assent. **********''What has happened is not tolerable to the Sikh community,'' he added.   'This is Hindu Democracy' **********A younger Sikh with intense brown eyes interjected bitterly: ''This is not democracy. This is Hindu democracy.'' **********He said that most Sikhs had denounced the occasional killings of Hindus in Punjab by Sikh extremists, but that Hindus rejoiced, ''celebrating it, distributing sweets,'' when Indian Army troops violently flushed the militants from the Golden Temple. **********''I want to make clear that before this attack on the Golden Temple there was not one person in favor of Khalistan,'' the young man continued, referring to the political vision of an independent Sikh state carved out of the fertile state of Punjab. ''Now, almost 99 percent of Sikhs are in favor.'' **********The Sikhs of India - as reports of scattered small-scale mutinies of Sikh troops have underscored - are aroused. But they are also in a predicament, caught between religious outrage and rational interest, between the tug of the heart and the tug of the pocketbook.   Breadbasket of India **********Some 80 percent of India's 14 million Sikhs live in Punjab, which with great diligence and sturdy hybrid strains of wheat they have converted into the nation's breadbasket. **********But others - often from families who fled to India from what became Pakistan in 1947 - have thrived as entrepreneurs, mechanics and shopkeepers in New Delhi, Bombay, Patna and Calcutta. And some 100,000 serve in the Indian military, making up about 10 percent of the force in a nation where Sikhs are 2 percent of the population. **********For the Sikhs, who practice a religion that has fused elements of Hinduism and Islam, both the geographic isolation of their homeland and the dispersal of wealthy - and potentially vulnerable - communities across India make ''Khalistan'' a dangerous dream. **********Although renowned for their moments of exaltation - and anger - the Sikhs, too, are famous for their business sense and practicality.   Detention of Opposition Leaders **********The occupation of Punjab by the Indian Army, which has sealed the province off from the rest of the country, has led to the detention of several Sikh leaders from the faction-ridden opposition Akali Dal Party and put great strains on Sikhs in Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's ruling Congress-I Party. **********Two days ago, Amarinder Singh, a Sikh Member of Parliament and a confidant of Mrs. Gandhi's son Rajiv, announced that he had resigned his seat in the lower house in protest over the storming of the Golden Temple, which he said ''would injure the sentiments of Sikhs living all over the world and embitter the existing, delicate ties between the two communities living in the state.'' A second Sikh deputy resigned today. **********These resignations followed a similar gesture of protest by Khushwant Singh, a well-known Sikh historian and journalist, who returned one of the country's highest honors, the Padma Bhushan, to President Giani Zail Singh, who is himself a Sikh. **********Mr. Zail Singh has come under stinging pressure from Sikh groups to resign his office, particularly after he seemed to sanction the seizing of the Golden Temple by inspecting it - wearing a red rose in his lapel.   Denounced Militant Leader **********Khushwant Singh stood out among Sikhs by having earlier denounced Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the Sikh holy man and militant chieftain, as a ''madman,'' earning the historian a prominent place on the terrorists' list of people to be assassinated. **********Mr. Bhindranwale died in the army assault - whether by suicide or soldiers' bullets is not clear - and has in the intervening days been transmuted for some Sikhs from a wild-eyed militant to a martyr. **********''The vast majority of Sikhs are not interested in politics or Bhindranwale,'' said Khushwant Singh, the historian, chatting in his book-lined den here. ''But this has hurt their feelings. They are in in a bloody mood. They are in a very foul mood.'' **********Mr. Singh argued that, instead of attacking Mr. Bhindranwale and his well-armed followers in the Golden Temple, the army should have surrounded the sprawling complex ''and starved them to death.''  Emotional Pilgrimage Predicted **********He predicted that once the army withdrew from Punjab, thousands of Sikhs living outside the province would set off on an emotional pilgrimage to the shrine and low-level terrorism would resume. **********Indra Gujral, a leading Hindu opposition politician from Punjab and a former Ambassador to Moscow, said the Gandhi Government had alienated and humiliated many Sikhs by portraying the storming of the Golden Temple as ''a great victory.'' **********''This is not a victory,'' said Mr. Gujral, who like many upper-class Punjabi Hindus has many close Sikh relatives by marriage. ''But if this is a defeat, we have all lost.'' **********The Sikh soldiers who have reportedly deserted from a handful of outlying garrisons are most likely relatives of the Sikh peasants of the Jat caste, who were most suspectible to Mr. Bhindranwale's message of a spartan and purified Sikhism.   Tirades at Landowners **********Mr. Bhindranwale's tirades included occasional barbed attacks on major Sikh landowners, who have prospered the most from Punjab's Green Revolution. **********Few well-informed Sikhs in New Delhi appear to expect the disaffection to spread to many of the large number of Sikhs who have risen to top command positions in the military, where they have distinguished themselves in the four wars India has fought since independence in 1947. **********But several retired Sikh officers, including a former commander of the Indian Air Force, are known to have been involved in quiet discussions in New Delhi among moderate Sikhs concerned about healing wounds opened by the Punjab upheaval. **********Even Sikhs in Mrs. Gandhi's camp acknowledge that the Prime Minister waited for a long time before ordering the crackdown on Mr. Bhindranwale's armed faction. ''Why did she have to wait so long?'' asked Rajindar Singh Sparrow, a retired army major general who is now a Congress deputy in Parliament. ''She's a big-hearted person. A long rope - you can call it - was given, and very rightly.''  Reasons for Delay **********But others less kindly disposed to the Prime Minister attribute the delay - which enabled Mr. Bhindranwale's followers to build up an apparently formidable arsenal - to her own vacillation, factionalism in the opposition Akali Dal, which was inhibited and intimidated by the militants' campaign, and a certain ambivalence within the Congress-I Party toward the militant holy man. **********Politicians with a long memory recall that President Zail Singh, a former chief minister in the Punjab, had years ago built up the obscure Mr. Bhindranwale as a counterweight to the Akali Dal and other foes. **********The crackdown, most politicians in New Delhi concur, has ruined the Congress-I Party's chances in the Punjab for the elections that Mrs. Gandhi is constitutionally bound to hold in January - but inproved them in the Hindi-speaking belt of northern India. **********The sense of a Hindu backlash against their cause has left even moderate Sikhs feeling morose and isolated. **********''The sense of alienation which the Sikhs feel today is very serious,'' said Haji Malik, a Sikh journalist.

Hoffa became a secret partner in an ill-fated buyout of a network of debt- ridden coal companies. **********Although the deal has been the subject of litigation for several years, no one to this day knows for sure what motivated the former labor leader to enter into it. **********Indeed, as analyzed by Federal District Judge Malcolm Muir, who is expected to issue a final ruling soon on several issues in the case, the deal was so hemmed in by financing stipulations that neither Mr. Hoffa nor his public partner could ever have hoped to reap a legitimate profit. **********Whatever the outcome of the case, it will no doubt amount to little more than a footnote to Mr. Hoffa's controversial career as a teamsters' union leader with purported links to organized crime. All the same, it does throw some light on the otherwise murky final chapter of his life. **********Pledging of Assets **********A key part of the complicated transaction was a pledging of the companies' own assets to finance the purchase and gain control of property that included Pennsylvania land containing more than $750 million worth of coal. According to Judge Muir, the deal constituted a fraudulent transfer of property. **********The judge's ruling could throw the land - 25,000 acres scattered in Luzerne and Lackawanna Counties - open to new purchasers to satisfy debts totaling more than $20 million. **********The case was filed by the Justice Department, seeking about $8 million in overdue taxes and penalties, and later joined by John Doran and Robert Norwallis as lawyers for the trustee of one of the coal companies, which is now in bankruptcy. **********As shown in records of protracted proceedings in Judge Muir's courtroom in Williamsport, Pa., as well as in two interim opinions and interviews with lawyers, the case is a tortured saga that led to losses of several million dollars by a publicly owned company that provided financing and to aborted tax sales of land owned by another of the coal companies. **********It all began in the early 1970's when the companies were losing money from mining operations and piling up debts. **********The principal companies were the Raymond Colliery Company of Scranton and its string of subsidiaries, including the Blue Coal Company of Wilkes-Barre. At the time, those companies together were among the country's largest anthracite mining operations. **********At some point before November 1973, two families that owned the stock of the companies were approached and were offered a profitable way out of their financial problems. James Durkin Sr., an investor from the Wilkes-Barre area, gave them $500,000 for an option to buy their stock, in a deal for which they eventually received $6.7 million in payments and notes for $500,000 more. **********Financing Arrangement **********Through an intermediary, a man named Hyman Green, described by the judge as ''a wealthy entrepreneur,'' the partners obtained financing for the purchase from Institutional Investors Trust, a real estate investment company based in Boston, but the money was funneled to them and eventually to the original owners through a complex arrangement. **********Ostensibly the money was borrowed, at five points over the prime rate, by Raymond Colliery and the subsidiaries, which the judge called ''the Raymond group.'' But those companies in turn lent the money to a new holding company, the Great American Coal Company, owned by Mr. Hoffa, as a secret partner represented by a St. Louis lawyer, Gene M. Zafft, and Mr. Durkin. **********The lending company took a series of mortgages totaling $8.5 million, but advanced only $7.2 million, retaining the rest as a guarantee of early payments and interest. **********The purchasers' plan was to sell land and assets to pay off the mortgages and other company debts. But as the financing contract was set up, Judge Muir noted, most of the proceeds of each sale would go to repay the financing company. Not enough would be left to Great American even to pay Federal taxes on the proceeds. **********Another stipulation eventually placed Mr. Hoffa's interest in jeopardy. According to Judge Muir, rumors had circulated at the lending company that Mr. Hoffa might be one of the interests involved. **********In response to Institutional Investors' ''concern that an undisclosed principal was involved, the stock of Great American was agreed to be issued solely in the names of Green and Durkin,'' the judge said. **********The lender also stipulated that the stock could not be transferred without its approval. Meanwhile, to protect Mr. Hoffa's interests, Mr. Green and Mr. Durkin gave Mr. Zafft, as Mr. Hoffa's agent, an option to buy half of the stock. **********But when Mr. Zafft attempted to exercise the option - shortly before Mr. Hoffa's disappearance in mid- 1975 - the lender refused. **********Not long after that development, a group of creditors of Blue Coal filed suit through Mr. Doran, a Wilkes- Barre lawyer, in an action that forced Blue Coal into bankruptcy in December 1976. **********At about the same time, the original lender sold its mortgages to a group of local investors at a discount, for $3.6 million. **********During the same period, those local investors gained title to several parcels of Raymond Colliery's Lackawanna County land at tax sales. **********Partly because the entire series of transactions never benefited the Raymond group, Judge Muir said in an interim ruling last May, ''We are of the view that those I.I.T. loan proceeds that were funnelled out of the Raymond group and applied to the purchase price of Raymond Colliery's stock constituted a fraudulent conveyance.'' **********The judge also ruled that acceptance of the money by the original owners ''in payment of the purchase price of Raymond Colliery stock from corporate assets was a breach of their obligation to the Raymond group's creditors.'' **********And in further rulings last September, the judge held that the local investors who bought the mortgages should have known that the mortgage instruments ''were fraudulent conveyances.'' He also held that their purchases of land at the tax sales were invalid because notice of the sales had not been properly posted. **********To remove themselves from liability in the case, members of the original owners' families have subsequently turned over substantial portions of the money they received to the Government and to the trustee in the Blue Coal bankruptcy. Mr. Durkin had already transferred his interest to Mr. Green. **********Judge Muir, in his upcoming ruling, will determine the status of all the parties and any possible further claim by the local investors."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/02/business/piper-aviation-will-shut-2-plants.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Piper Aviation Will Shut 2 Plants", "print_headline": "Piper Aviation Will Shut 2 Plants", "body_text": " **********Piper Aviation will close two plants in Pennsylvania in August, putting 850 people out of work, Piper's parent, Lear Siegler Inc., said. **********The plants are in Lock Haven and Quehanna. **********About 650 people are employed at Lock Haven, which produces the Cheyenne IIXL and IA, the TI-040 commuter turboprop and the Mojave pressurized-piston twin-engine aircraft.

In return, South Africa agreed to stop backing guerrillas fighting Mr. Machel's Government in Mozambique. **********The West European tour is depicted by some South African commentators as a kind of endorsement of these moves, although it is widely acknowledged that, alone, they do not satisfy outside demands for South Africa to grant its black majority a meaningful political role. **********At a political meeting Saturday night, Mr. Botha told his audience that his Government was ''contemplating a meaningful solution to achieve accord'' with those blacks not assigned to nominally independent ''homelands'' within South Africa's traditional frontiers. He did not elaborate, but said it was time for South Africans to face the realities of the world beyond its borders. **********Few Details on Topics **********South African officials have given few details about the likely contents of his discussions with European leaders, including Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany. Both these nations have been involved in efforts to achieve a settlement of South- West Africa's guerrilla war. South Africa occupies the former German colony in defiance of the United Nations and has been fighting insurgents there for over 17 years. **********Unlike Britain and West Germany, France has not agreed to receive Mr. Botha officially. He will, however, lay the foundation stone at a war cemetery commemorating South Africa's war dead, and a French junior minister is scheduled to attend the ceremony. **********In Portugal, Mr. Botha has more specific issues to discuss. Some 600,000 Portuguese speakers live in South Africa and South African officials have said they believe Portuguese technicians and others who fled Angola and Mozambique at independence in 1975 could play a useful role if they returned. **********In Britain, which has strong trade and historic links with South Africa, Mr. Botha's talks with Mrs. Thatcher could turn out to be what diplomats describe as frank. **********South African officials have hinted that their Government is displeased with the fact that Britain permits the African National Congress to maintain its European headquarters in London. They have compared their unease with Britain's likely reaction to South Africa allowing the Irish Republican Army to open an office in Pretoria."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/22/business/atlantic-airline-wins-approval.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 102, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Atlantic Airline Wins Approval", "print_headline": "Atlantic Airline Wins Approval", "body_text": " **********Britain's fledgling Virgin Atlantic Airways said today that it had received final approval from British authorities to start its low-cost daily service between London and Newark. **********The Civil Aviation Authority granted an air operator's certificate to the company's leased Boeing 747 that will take off on the inaugural $159 flight Friday at 4:15 P.M.

Shultz said yesterday that the results of a mission to the Middle East by a high-ranking State Department official last week showed that there was ''a long way to go'' before an agreement on Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon could be achieved. **********Mr. Shultz said Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy's mission had not progressed enough to allow the United States to mediate between Israel and the Syrians and Lebanese. **********Mr. Shultz spoke at a luncheon at the United Nations Plaza Hotel in New York in honor of the Gulf Cooperation Council. **********There have been press reports from Lebanon about a purported American plan for bringing about Israel's withdrawal. But after consulting with Mr. Murphy on Sunday morning shortly after his return to Washington, Mr. Shultz said yesterday that ''he reports, insofar as our problems are concerned, that there is undoubtedly a long way to go before we can get what we all would like to see there.'' **********In Washington, Alan Romberg, a State Department spokesman, said Mr. Murphy ''presented no plan and is not acting as a mediator.'' **********''It remains to be seen if the United States can play a role,'' he said. ''We have indicated that we would not enter into such a role without the agreements of the parties. Whether or not we can be helpful depends on circumstances which have not taken place yet.'' **********Privately, top aides to Mr. Shultz said he was very reluctant to see the United States drawn into another mediation role in the Middle East unless there was virtual certainty that Syria and Lebanon would support the effort and be forthcoming toward the Israelis. **********In May 1983, Mr. Shultz, after extensive shuttling back and forth between Beirut and Jerusalem, worked out an agreement on the terms for Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon. It was contingent, however, on Syria's also agreeing to a timetable for pulling its troops out of Lebanon. The Syrians angrily rejected the Shultz agreement and pressed the Lebanese Government to reject the pact. Last March, President Amin Gemayel finally yielded and abandoned the accord. **********Mr. Shultz said then that it was up to the Arabs to come up with a plan to replace the one he had worked out. **********''We were burned once,'' and aide to Mr. Shultz said, ''and we're in no rush to repeat.'' **********Mr. Shultz, in addition to meeting at lunch with the Gulf Cooperation Council, which consists of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, also conferred privately with Prince Saud, the Saudi Foreign Minister, and Yitzhak Shamir, the Israel Foreign Minister. He also met with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq.   Israel's Suggestion **********Mr. Shamir, before coming to the United States for the United Nations General Assembly, had said that Israel intended to ask the United States to be an intermediary with Syria and Lebanon on working out security guarantees for Israel that would let Israel withdraw. **********The new Israeli Government has altered its position on a troop withdrawal since 1983. Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Mr. Shamir have said they will no longer demand a simultaneous Syrian withdrawal but will be satisfied with security guarantees. **********A State Department official with Mr. Shultz said, however, that ''there were considerable differences'' between the Israeli and Lebanese and Syrian positions. Mr. Shultz will be meeting with Israeli and Arab officials in coming weeks to assess whether there is any likelihood of the differences being sufficiently narrowed to warrent an American initiative. **********It is also unlikely, the official said, that the Reagan Administration will do anything before the Presidential election on Nov. 6. ''There is no sense beginning anything like this unless everyone sees we're back for four more years,'' he said. **********Mr. Shamir's hourlong meeting with Mr. Shultz was largely to set the stage for Mr. Peres's visit to Washington next week, Israeli and American officials said. Mr. Shamir told reporters he had not asked the United States to become a mediator because the issue required more study.   Some Progress in Last Year **********Mr. Shultz told the gulf states that there had been some advances in the situation in the last year. **********He said, ''There is now no question about the fact that Israel wants to withdraw as promptly as it can, that it makes that withdrawal not contingent on Syrian withdrawal, as at one time had been the case, and that both Israel and Syria, as well as Lebanon, are talking in terms of an expanded Unifil mandate, although just what that means and what role it would play is part of the problem here.'' **********In the meeting with Mr. Shamir, Mr. Shultz said, according to an aide, that some people had suggested that terrorism against American installations would end if the United States changed its policy toward the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********Mr. Shultz promised, the aide said, that there would be no change in the American policy toward the P.L.O. and there would never be any change in American policy ''through coercion.'' **********The United States has said that it will not recognize or negotiate with the P.L.O. until it recognizes Israel's right to exist and accepts United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 of 1967 and 338 of 1973, which form the basis for negotiations in the Middle East."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/29/world/sri-lanka-s-crisis-hurts-indian-ties.html": {"writer_name": "William Stevens", "pub_date": "1984-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 896, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SRI LANKA'S CRISIS HURTS INDIAN TIES", "print_headline": "SRI LANKA'S CRISIS HURTS INDIAN TIES", "body_text": " **********Relations between India and Sri Lanka have turned increasingly sour because of what Colombo sees as Indian involvement in this country's domestic strife. **********The most serious evidence of such involement, from Sri Lanka's point of view, was a report in India Today, one of India's more aggressive investigative journals, that guerrilla insurgents from Sri Lanka were being trained in camps in southern India. The Indian Government has denied the report. **********It is only 30 miles, less than two hours by motorboat, across the Palk Strait from northern Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon, to the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. On both sides of the strait live large concentrations of ethnic Tamils. **********Tamils in Sri Lanka, where ethnic Sinhalese are in the majority, have mounted a guerrilla campaign for a separate Tamil state, and Tamils of India have put pressure on Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to support the Tamil cause. **********This is an election year in India, and Mrs. Gandhi faces electoral pressures on all sides. She badly needs support from Tamil Nadu, and Government officials and Western diplomats say she might, in some circumstances, be tempted to intervene in Sri Lanka.   Indian Effort to Help On the other hand, India has been deeply involved in a constructive way in the Sri Lanka crisis. It provided its good offices as a mediator to set up talks on accommodating the Tamils' demands for greater political autonomy. The talks are to resume May 9 at India's urging, but they are generally given only slim chances for success. **********The overall worsening in relations prompted one of Sri Lanka's most powerful ministers, Lalith Athulathmudali, to acccept an invitation from Mrs. Gandhi to visit New Delhi. Mr. Athulathmudali, who as the Minister of National Security is in charge of coping with the Tamil guerrillas, told Parliament here afterward that Mrs. Gandhi and other Indian officials ''again and again reiterated their commitment to respect our unity, integrity and sovereignty.'' **********He said also that he had ''placed on record in India our views on the existance of terrorist training camps in south India'' and that he had proposed joint inspection of areas where the camps are said to be operating. He did not report India's response. **********According to India Today's report, underground and Indian intelligence sources estimated that nearly 2,000 armed Tamil insurgents are ready for action as a result of training in India and that 2,000 to 3,000 more are trained and awaiting arms. **********The report said arms were to be provided by foreign guerrilla groups such as the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was said to have trained a handful of Tamil terrorists.   Diplomats Endorse Report **********The article said that the insurgents' arms included Kalashnikov rifles, that there were dozens of training camps in Tamil Nadu and that Indian Tamils retired from service in the Indian Army had been hired by the Sri Lanka insurgents to give the training. **********Western diplomats said that while some details of the report were open to dispute, it was basically accurate. **********There has been much talk here of the possibility of an Indian invasion. It might come, Government officials and some Western diplomats believe, if there was more rioting such as that in July 1983, when about 600 people, most of them Tamils, were killed and hundreds of Tamil homes, businesses and factories were burned by Sinhalese in retaliation for killings of Sinhalese by Tamil guerrillas. **********According to a Western diplomat familiar with the matter, Indian airborne units moved to Madras, capital of Tamil Nadu, during those riots. **********The riots were contained after six days, but they laid bare the Government's inability to solve the Tamil problem and, at times, to control its own troops and policemen. Many Sinhalese troops and policemen are reported to have joined the anti-Tamil rioting, both last summer and again during violence in April this year.   New Violence in Tamil Area **********The latest outbreak, the most serious since last July, resulted in the deaths of 50 people, according to Government estimates. Unofficial reports say 200 died. The killing was confined this time to the northern city of Jaffna, where Tamils are in the majority. Nationwide, Tamils constitute 12 percent of the population. **********Most of the deaths occurred when Sinhalese Government forces retaliated for attacks on soldiers, policemen and civil servants by Tamil guerrillas. Tamil extremists are suspected of trying to provoke islandwide retaliation by Sinhalese against Tamils, as happened in July, in hopes of putting more pressure on India to intervene. **********On the basis of his talks in New Delhi, Mr. Athulathmudali told Parliament that terrorists should keep India's commitment not to intervene well in mind and ''remember that they will be unable to drag the Government of India to support their efforts.'' **********''This is not India's problem,'' he said, ''although the terrorists would like to make it so.'' **********In New Delhi, there is considerable skepticism that India would intervene militarily. Mrs. Gandhi, as head of the group of nations espousing nonalignment, has consistently preached the ideal of noninterference in any country's affairs by another.

In 1973, the business was shipping packages overnight. Three years later, it pushed into overnight documents. Then in 1981 came overnight letters. Now the company, flush with confidence from its success so far, is turning to electronic mail. **********But electronic mail may be one of its riskiest ventures yet, analysts say. Federal Express plans to invest as much as $1.2 billion over the next decade in electronic mail, nearly the amount it has spent to date on airplanes and trucks for its regular service. The risk, experts say, is that the electronic mail technology it has chosen - facsimile machines - may make quick profits for the Memphis- based company now, but leave it out of future competition when most offices are computerized. **********The company, as ever, is confident. It expects that over the next two years, the service, which it has named Zapmail, will replace as much as 30 percent of its existing document and urgent letter traffic, which, at 180,000 pieces a night, now accounts for about a third of its revenues and more than half its package shipments. By 1988, the company has said, Zapmail could be generating $1.33 billion in sales, or about a third of Federal Express's expected overall revenues, up from about $35 million this year. **********A Different Approach **********Introduced in early July, Zapmail differs from traditional electronic mail now being offered by the MCI Communications Corporation, the Western Union Corporation and a raft of other competitors. **********Aiming at customers who would rather have an actual document in hand, Federal Express is using facsimile machines to send documents in as little as an hour in 80 percent of the territory it serves. The other companies offer computer-based correspondence transmission, or so-called computer mailbox service. **********''We're of the opinion that this will coexist with high-speed data transmission; we've never looked at MCI as a competitor,'' said Thomas R. Oliver, senior vice president for marketing and customer service at Federal Express. **********Analysts, on the other hand, expect most of the long-term growth to be in computer mailboxes, currently the smallest segment of the business, as offices of the future incorporate computers, copiers, work stations and other computerized peripherals into one network. Federal Express, however, believes such developments will be slow to come and that managers will continue to need paper copies. **********''They're right on target for today's market, but to dismiss computer communications out of hand could be very shortsighted,'' said H. Paris Burstyn, an analyst for Arthur D. Little Inc., a research concern. ''Is the paperless office going to be a long time in coming, so that Mr. Oliver can make money? Or is it going to happen very fast, so that by not even entering the electronic mailbox business, they are cutting themselves out of the growth market?'' **********To succeed, Federal Express must now convince managers of the need to get documents almost immediately. But the company has thrived on using marketing muscle to create business. **********A 'C' Idea Works Out **********Frederick W. Smith, the company's chairman, proposed the idea of shipping high-priority packages by air in a class paper at Yale University, where he studied economics in the mid-1960's. He got a ''C'' for his effort. **********But once the idea got off the ground, Mr. Smith succeeded in convincing American executives that they ''absolutely, positively'' had to receive important documents by noon the next day. Zapmail merely compresses the delivery time. Now Mr. Smith is telling businesses to use Zapmail ''when there's no tommorrow.'' **********The technology is not new - the ITT Corporation has been offering an in-office facsimile service, Faxpak, since 1979 - but the marketing angle is. **********Federal Express began seriously studying facsimile mail service about four years ago, to meet the challenge of electronic mail to its overnight document and letter delivery service. **********A Decision to 'Attack' **********''We could either consider it to be a threat, or we could attack,'' Mr. Oliver said. **********Marketing research studies showed that the company would face little customer resistance in making the shift. ''They perceived that this was the same Federal Express that they already knew, except that it shipped with electronics rather than airplanes,'' Mr. Oliver said. **********In 1982, Federal Express began installing prototype computerized dispatch terminals for the service. With traditional overnight document and letter delivery, Federal Express couriers have much more leeway in picking up and delivering documents and packages. The only requirement is to get the package delivered by 10:30 A.M. the next day. The typical cost of an overnight letter is $12.50. **********With the new service, Federal Express promises to pick up the message, deliver it to a nearby base station, where it will be ''faxed'' to a base station near its destination and finally delivered, all within two hours. The cost is $35 for up to five pages. If the customer brings the document to a Federal Express office, the company charges $25 and promises delivery within an hour. **********A $100 Million Outlay, So Far **********Federal Express has invested about $100 million in the venture so far, mostly for installing the newest- generation facsimile machines, designed specially by the NEC Corporation of Japan, and computer dispatch systems in about 50 key stations. It plans to spend about $25 million in its fiscal year 1985 to promote Zapmail. **********The outlays are depressing short- term profits, but Federal Express expects a big payoff in two or three years. Zapmail eliminates much of the labor-intensive sorting and transportation costs associated with the regular overnight service, which is expected to continue flourishing. **********Moreover, the company is counting on productivity improvements, because it believes most Zapmail will be picked up, transmitted and delivered during the lull between 10:30 A.M., when regular deliveries are finished, and 2 P.M. or 3 P.M., when pickups begin in volume. **********The company plans to increase savings further by leasing facsimile machines to high-volume customers, probably early next year, reducing transportation expenses even more. Any company that transmits more than 10 to 20 documents a month will probably find it cheaper to install a leased facsimile machine in house, Mr. Oliver said. **********Satellite Link Envisioned **********Longer term, the company intends to transmit most of Zapmail messages by satellite instead of through more expensive telephone lines now leased from long-distance carriers. The company is seeking permission from Federal regulators to launch two satellites in early 1988. **********''We think that the operating margins will be better in this than in the express business,'' Mr. Oliver said. He added that Federal Express expects to turn a profit in Zapmail, which is handling about 1,000 messages a day, by its fiscal fourth quarter, which ends May 31. **********Only DHL Worldwide Courier Express, the largest international priority package carrier, is challenging Federal Express in the facsimile services. The privately held company, which began its push into the American package market last year, hopes to test its network next year. **********For now, Mr. Oliver said, Federal Express is staying out of the electronic mailbox segment of the market that has attracted a swarm of competitors. ''We wouldn't bring anything to the party,'' he said. **********The electonic mailbox suppliers use mainly computers to transmit text, either to a personal computer or to printers, where it is delivered by the Postal Service or private couriers. **********A 'First-Class' Target **********The players generally are hoping to capture correspondence that would otherwise travel by slower, first-class mail, such as multiple memos to corporate field offices or, in the printout letter segment of the industry, marketing and political mailings. Analysts estimate the demand for such service at about $150 million this year, growing to more than $1 billion by the end of the decade. **********''None of that stuff is in Federal's market,'' said J. Robert Harcharik, president of the MCI Digital Information Services Corporation, which began its electronic mail service, MCI Mail, last September. **********MCI subscribers pay $1 to send messages of up to 7,500 words to another subscriber's computer. To nonsubscibers, members can send printed messages one of three ways: for usual next-day delivery by regular mail for $2; by noon the next day for $6, via Purolater Courier, and within four hours the same day via Purolator for $25. Mr. Harcharik said the company delivered 700,000 messages in June. **********Mr. Oliver said Federal Express expects plenty of demand for its facsimile copies, even if the office of the future arrives sooner than expected. But competitors and analysts, noting the company's satellite network plans, are not counting Federal Express out of electronic mailbox contention yet. **********''I don't think Federal Express is going to stop where they are by any stretch of the imagination,'' Mr. Harcharik said. ''I think, in the long haul, they will have a system like ours. I would, if I were them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/25/business/honeywell-system.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 54, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Honeywell System", "print_headline": "Honeywell System", "body_text": " **********Honeywell Inc. said its Commercial division had developed the first high- technology central energy management and temperature control system for small- to medium-size buildings.

In recent months it has conducted forums for the President of El Salvador, Jose Napoleon Duarte, and for the coordinator of the Sandinista junta in Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega Saavedra. **********Founded in 1959 **********The Center was founded in Santa Barbara, Calif., in 1959 by Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchins, who was one of America's most distinguished educators and had become the president of the University of Chicago by the age of 30. Blossoming at the end of the era of McCarthyism, it quickly gained a reputation as a spawning ground of liberal thinking. Its cadre of full- time and visiting fellows was set up to engage in ''dialogue'' with some of the best minds in the world on the fundamental issues facing a democratic society. They did this freed of the distractions of teaching or research or the intrusion of daily events. **********The Center has conducted examinations of such issues as the law of the seas, the ethical problems of immigration, nuclear policy and the environment, and these sessions have had significant influence on public policy debate. They took place in the splendid Spanish-flavored Southern California setting of a former mansion, on a hill with a sea view, that the fellows dubbed ''El Parthenon.'' But in the 1970's the Center fell on financial hard times. After the death of Dr. Hutchins in 1977, it seemed to many to lose direction.   Affiliation With University **********After several years of uncertainty, the Center in 1979 forged an affiliation with the University of California at Santa Barbara, whose chancellor, Robert A. Huttenback, was taking steps to add to the academic distinction of a campus that was outside the top rank of scholarship within the University of California system. **********Last March, Dr. Huttenback hired Mr. Weinstein from a post he held as acting president of the newly-formed, nonprofit National Endowment for Democracy. Dr. Huttenback said in an interview that the qualities that had initially attracted him to Mr. Weinberg were that ''he's extremely imaginative and well-connected politically.'' **********Mr. Weinstein, a Democrat who describes himself as a supporter of President Reagan, has set out to transform the institute into what he has called a ''centrist'' platform for the airing of competing views. Some liberal intellectuals have maintained that it is to be turned instead into a conservative institution, perhaps on the lines of the American Enterprise Institute, but its supporters dispute that.   'Moved to the Center ' **********''There were a great many people who thought it had leaned too far to the left,'' Dr. Huttenback said. ''Since the university has taken it over, we've moved to the center.'' He noted that the Center's new board members include Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., chairman of the Republican National Committee; Charles T. Manatt, chairman of the Democratic National Committee; and W. Glenn Campbell, the director of the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University - ''who,'' Dr. Huttenback said, ''is very much a Republican, so I think we have proved our bona fides in terms of being centrist.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/04/world/pakistan-flogs-2-men.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 29, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pakistan Flogs 2 Men", "print_headline": "Pakistan Flogs 2 Men", "body_text": " **********Two men were strapped to triangular frames in separate towns today and publicly flogged, one for drinking and the other for fornication, witnesses said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/11/business/briefs-238891.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 352, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** American Medi-Dent Inc.  of Anaheim, Calif., which provides dental health care services, said it had entered into a letter of intent to buy the assets of a southern California-based company engaged in a related field for $6 million. *********** Caterpillar Tractor Co.  of Peoria, Ill., said it had decided to proceed with plans to close its plant in Edgerton, Wis., because of a need to restructure manufacturing operations to reduce excess manufacturing space and capacity. *********** Fortune Federal Savings and Loan Association of Clearwater, Fla., said its stockholders had approved the formation of a new savings and loan holding company, Fortune Financial Group Inc. *********** Kane-Miller Corp.  of Tarrytown, N.Y., said it would close the Racine Avenue hog slaughtering plant in Chicago and take a $2.2 million after-tax charge against 1983 results. *********** National Starch and Chemical Corporation , a starch and chemicals manufacturer based in Bridgewater, N.J., said it had acquired Microlife Technics Inc. and its subsidiary, Microlife Genetics Inc.

It has become India's favorite drink by far, from the fancy restaurants in big hotels to the poorest villages and the meanest stalls in the most raffish bazaars. **********Tea, introduced by the British nearly two centuries ago as a cash crop, has truly become India's national drink in recent years. As a result, this country has become not only the world's largest producer of tea but also its largest consumer. Indians are expected to consume 188 million pounds of the beverage this year, compared with 173 million in 1983. **********Indeed, consumption has been rising so rapidly that India has decided to limit its tea exports so as to accommodate domestic demand. And that decision has led to a sharp and continuing rise in world tea prices, for which no early end is seen. **********Prices Set Record Highs **********Current tea prices on the London auction market are at record highs, ranging in the neighborhood of 350 pence, or $4.40, a kilogram, which is about 2.2 pounds, compared with 280 to 290 pence a year ago. **********For the American consumer, this translates into a sharp rise. No industrywide figures are available, but according to Twinings, the British tea merchants, the retail cost of its tea in the United States has increased as much as 18 percent over two years ago. **********Despite a record tea crop that is estimated at 285 million pounds this year, consumption in India has grown so rapidly - 36 percent between 1977 and 1983 - that the Government fears a domestic shortage and thus higher prices. In this election year, soaring prices for the country's staple drink would hardly win votes for Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party. **********Unusual Ceiling on Exports **********Consequently, the Government has taken the unusual step of putting an outright ceiling on tea exports so that domestic demand can be fulfilled and domestic prices contained. Overall tea exports - mostly involving the variety of blackened tea called C.T.C., for crush-tear-curl - are to be limited to 97.5 million pounds in 1984. Further, the Government is considering permanent export controls. **********Counterbalanced against domestic needs is the fact that tea exports have long been one of India's main foreign- exchange earners. Last year the sale of tea abroad brought some $500 million into India. This year, with the increase in world prices, the figure is expected to soar to about $750 million. **********Officials give a number of reasons for the steady but sharp rise in tea consumption. ''The most important thing,'' said R.K. Tripathy, the Calcutta-based deputy chairman of the National Tea Board, which regulates the industry, ''is that it's the cheapest drink of all.'' A soft drink in India costs the equivalent of 15 to 20 cents, a cup of tea only 3 or 4 cents. **********Easy to Find Everywhere **********Moreover, tea is universally available and easy to find. Coffee is not plentiful and, to the taste of many, not as good. Rapid urbanization, a rising standard of living and population growth have also fueled demand. **********In recent years India has accounted for about 28 percent of the world tea trade, but some people familiar with the situation suggest that, because of the swelling of domestic demand, the improbable day is coming when India will become a net importer of tea. **********Mr. Tripathy does not share that view. ''In my opinion,'' he said, ''it's certainly not in prospect in the near future.'' A number of efforts are aimed at further developing and expanding the productive capacity of the country's tea gardens, most of which are in the rainy Darjeeling area of the northeast, and Mr. Tripathy said this should have a sufficient long-term effect. **********Nation's Production Goal **********Government planners say that India must produce at least 345 million pounds a year within five years if it is to meet domestic demand and still be able to export at least 90 million pounds annually. **********Whether the investment needed for this expansion will be forthcoming under the new five-year development plan that begins next year is uncertain. In addition, many tea gardens have been taken over by state governments under land-reform programs. Some of these, various analysts say, would have to be returned to tea growers before significant expansion could take place. **********On the other hand, the boom in world tea prices has brought large profits to many tea growers, and the expectation is that some of these earnings will be reinvested in improved production."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/19/business/finance-new-issues-ge-credit-signs-deal-with-baldwin.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 164, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.E.

The latest car-bomb attack, which heavily damaged the embassy annex in East Beirut, occurred on Sept. 20. Two Americans were killed, along with at least 12 Lebanese, according to the department. **********Mrs. Levin said she had learned of the planned attack from George Malouf, a Lebanese-American who had gone to Beirut to try to negotiate the release of her husband. Mr. Malouf, who is a Washington architect, said in an interview today that he had met in Beirut with representatives of the Hezballah, or Party of God, a militant Moslem group that United States intelligence agencies believe was responsible for last month's embassy bombing. He said members of the group bragged to him they would deliver ''a gift- wrapped package'' to the embassy ''around Sept. 20 to 22.''

''The State Department has suggested I'll get Jerry killed by speaking out.'' **********Later in the interview, she grew angry about the Administration's refusal to discuss her husband's detention. **********Mrs. Levin said she had ''solid information'' that her husband is being held in a building in West Beirut with two other kidnapped Americans: William Buckley, the political officer of the embassy, and the Rev. Benjamin Weir, a Presbyterian minister. **********''Why aren't we talking about these hostages?'' she asked heatedly. ''We have got our priorities mixed up. Why is it allowed to stand when Ronald Reagan says America won't have hostages again? We have these four. Are we bored with hostages now? Does America not care anymore? If this is a cover- up, why are we covering it up?''  Presidential Election Cited **********Asked why she was speaking out at this time, Mrs. Levin said she wanted to ''influence the dialogue'' in the Presidential election campaign. **********Mr. Malouf is a 37-year-old Christian who was born in Lebanon but has lived in the United States for 14 years, now in suburban Maryland. **********Mr. Malouf said he was put in touch with Mrs. Levin in March, about two weeks after Mr. Levin was kidnapped, and agreed to help her gain her husband's release. Through friends and contacts in Lebanon and in Iran, he said, he learned by July that Mr. Levin was being held in West Beirut. **********Once in Lebanon, Mr. Malouf said, he was able to meet with Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, a Shiite fundamentalist cleric who is regarded as the head of the Party of God. Sheik Fadlallah put him in touch with the group holding Mr. Levin, he said. **********He declined to identify the group, except to say that it is a militant faction of the Party of God. In a series of meetings in Beirut in the first two weeks in August, Mr. Malouf said, his contact in this group bragged repeatedly that they would mount another attack on the American Embassy. United States intelligence officials believe the Party of God was also involved in the attacks last year against the American Embassy and the Marine barracks.   'We'll Hit Them Again' **********''He said his group would prove that America was a giant with feet of clay,'' Mr. Malouf said. ''He told me: 'We'll hit them again, where they don't expect it. If they think they're safe in East Beirut, they're not.' '' **********Mr. Malouf said he concluded that the next target would be the embassy annex in East Beirut, where American diplomats moved on July 31. He said he also deduced that the attack would take place between Sept. 20 and 22. **********Returning to Washington on Aug. 15, Mr. Malouf reported to Mrs. Levin. At the State Department on Aug. 16, they conferred with Terrell E. Arnold, the deputy director of the Office for Combating Terrorism, and William A. Stanton, the Lebanon-desk officer. Neither man was available for comment today. **********Mr. Malouf said he had passed along the substance of his conversations in Beirut with the Party of God, including the specific threats against the embassy.

It was the third successive monthly decline. **********For the first 10 months of 1984, the index rose by a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.5 percent. That pace was more than the 1983 rise of six-tenths of 1 percent but still short of the acceleration many economists expected for the second year of the business-cycle upswing. For the 12 months through October, the index was up 1.4 percent. **********''It's good news for consumers,'' said Prof. Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at Georgia State University in Atlanta. ''But it means that producers can't pass their costs on.'' **********Pressures From Imports **********He and other economists said that much of the price softness reflected competitive pressures from imports. **********Craig Howell, a Labor Department economist, said that cars and trucks were largely responsible for the October drop, He explained that this was the result of a seasonal adjustment made to take into account the introduction of 1985 models. **********This adjustment, which smooths out changes that tend to happen the same time every year and highlights underlying change, produced a 1.2 percent decline in the cars and trucks component of the index. This was because actual vehicle prices in the month rose only 5.5 percent, whereas the average September-to-October price change in recent years has been 6.7 percent. **********A Bit Misleading **********However, Labor Department economists cautioned that the seasonal adjustments might be a bit misleading now that the industry was moving to year-round introduction of new models and price rises no longer come mainly in autumn. This means, the analysts said, that there could be price rises that push up the index in the months to come. **********Without cars and trucks, the index would have shown no change. Prices for finished consumer goods other than foods and energy moved down five- tenths of 1 percent. Foods rose by one- tenth of 1 percent. Prices for both gasoline and home heating oil turned up after four months of decline. **********Economists generally welcomed the price report as still further indication of the deceleration of inflation, but cautioned that it also reflected the slowdown in economic growth. Some linked the slowing economic momentum with what has been virtually no growth in the money supply since June. **********''Should this trend continue much longer, economic growth could slow dramatically in 1985,'' said Richard W. Rahn, chief economist of the United States Chamber of Commerce. **********The drop was part of the longest monthly string of monthly declines in the Producer Price Index since one of six months' duration that ended after the first quarter of 1967. In that quarter economic growth was only five- tenths of 1 percent. But it picked up later in the year. **********'We Don't Expect a Recession' **********''The index is telling us that outside the service sector, where labor costs are significant, there has been no increase in inflation in the last seven months,'' said Gordon B. Pye, senior vice president of the Irving Trust Company. He added that, despite recent slowing of economic growth, ''we don't expect a recession; there's plenty of room for interest rates to fall and provide new economic stimulus.'' **********John M. Albertine, president of the American Business Conference, an orgnization of companies that have grown rapidly, echoed this theme, saying that low inflation ''will allow the Federal Reserve to loosen its hold on the monetary reins significantly over the next few months.'' **********''The inflationary spiral has been tied in a knot,'' added Mr. Albertine, who has been mentioned as a possible candidate for the chairmanship of the Council of Economic Advisers in the second Reagan term. The position is now vacant. **********Noting that business executives were finding markets ''too soft to raise prices,'' Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers, said it was ''unlikely that inflation will accelerate in 1985.'' **********Near Tripling of Prices **********The index of finished goods, which measures the price of finished goods on which manufacturing is complete, stood at 290.9 in October, based on a starting point of 100 in 1967. It means that goods selling for $100 in 1967 sold for $290.90 in October, a near tripling of prices over the period. **********The decline from the September index of 291.4 before rounding was actually 0.17159 percent, which was rounded to 0.2. **********Two other producer price indexes, for intermediate goods and for crude goods, also pointed to an absence of new cost pressures. The Index for Intermediate Materials, Supplies and Components edged up one-tenth of 1 percent after declining in the previous three months. Intermediate materials are those that need further processing. They include such semifinished materials as flour, cotton yarns, steel mill products and vehicle parts. **********The index for crude goods dropped nine-tenths of 1 percent, its third decline in a row and its seventh this year. Such goods include scrap materials, grain. livestock, crude petroleum and other products that are about to move into a manufacturing cycle."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/08/business/company-s-six-turbulent-months.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 377, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY'S SIX TURBULENT MONTHS", "print_headline": "COMPANY'S SIX TURBULENT MONTHS", "body_text": " **********-year-old son of Disney's co-founder, resigned as a director, citing personal reasons for his departure. **********March 29: The Reliance Financial Services Corporation, a unit of Reliance Group Holding Inc., controlled by Saul P.

All 582 cockpit crew members have been run through tightened screening procedures, and some were demoted or transferred, according to K.A.L. officials and industry analysts here. **********The airline said that one pilot became so angry after being told to resign that he punched a senior officer. **********Airline officials insist the changes do not suggest that pilot screening had been lax. ''Our standards were high, but now we're getting tougher,'' said the new president, Cho Choong Kun, an exuberant 51-year-old with a penchant for American slang and a nickname of Charlie. **********Mr. Cho took over on Feb. 24 from his 64-year-old brother, Cho Choong Hoon, known as Harry. The brothers head a diversified transportation company called the Hanjin Group, which took over K.A.L. 15 years ago when it was an unprofitable government operation with one jet and seven propeller planes. While K.A.L. still struggles to stay out of the red, it now has 38 aircraft and revenues last year of $1.15 billion. **********Trying to Improve Image **********The airline has set out to improve its image overseas, where many people regard it as something of an airborne discount house, its main attraction being rock-bottom fares. **********K.A.L. must also contend with a sense among some foreigners that its pilots, all former fliers in the South Korean Air Force, take too many risks. Mr. Cho says the reputation is undeserved. **********But he concedes that for several months some passengers thought twice about taking his airline after K.A.L.'s Flight 007, scheduled to fly from New York to Seoul, veered off course and was shot down by Soviet missiles near Sakhalin Island. Mr. Cho would not say how long passengers remained wary, and he would not disclose the percentage of empty seats on K.A.L. flights. **********And, although the Russians may not have been justified in downing the plane, Mr. Cho acknowledged that Flight 007 was clearly flying where it should not have been. Since the tragedy, the airline says it has altered its route so that planes fly farther from Russian-occupied Sakhalin. Crews have also received extra navigation training. **********Two Other Incidents **********But in a separate incident in December, a K.A.L. DC-10 cargo jet went down a wrong runway in Anchorage and collided with a 12-seat plane. Seven people were injured. A month later another K.A.L. plane, landing at Seoul's Kimpo International Airport, skidded off an icy runway. That time no one was hurt.  It was the Anchorage collision, more than the 007 tragedy, that spurred the training and crew changes, Mr. Cho said. **********Mr. Cho insisted, however, that other changes, including shifts of several senior executives, had nothing to do with last year's disasters and were part of a normal turnover intended to reinvigorate the company. His older brother, Choong Hoon, remains as Hanjin Group chairman. **********Nevertheless, one industry analyst in Seoul said, ''They're having a clear shake-up.'' **********A Profitable Year **********By many standards, 1983 was not a bad year for K.A.L. It showed a profit of $3.2 million, half the earnings of 1982 but better than the previous two years, when losses were recorded in good part because of the low-fare policy. Revenues on cargo operations rose 15 percent in 1983 over the previous year, and the number of passengers carried, 4.8 million, was 11 percent higher than the year before. **********But nearly all of the airline's passenger growth came on domestic routes, where K.A.L. has a monopoly. The number of travelers on the 130 weekly international flights held steady, which analysts said may suggest tougher times ahead. **********Air industry analysts here believe that passenger skittishness about K.A.L. is only part of the problem, and perhaps not the most important. New Government restrictions on overseas travel by South Koreans have hurt, as has Pan American World Airways, which joined K.A.L. and Northwest Orient Airlines last summer in flying to the United States from Korea. **********And a falloff in construction in the Middle East has pinched many South Korean companies, K.A.L. among them. Companies based in South Korea do a considerable amount of construction work abroad, and it is estimated that as much as 50 percent of the South Koreans aboard K.A.L. overseas flights are contractors, engineers and laborers. **********Planning Ahead **********Still, the airline is pushing forward. It is renegotiating its agreement with the United States in an attempt to open routes to Oakland, Calif., and Chicago in 1985, adding to its present flights to New York, Los Angeles and Anchorage. **********In addition, K.A.L. has bought two Boeing 747 ''stretch'' planes for $230 million, one of which will replace the airliner shot down. The purchases, however, increase the company's already significant debt, which totaled more than $1 billion at the end of 1983. The debt level will make it hard, according to air officials, for K.A.L. to find foreign backing for expansion. **********K.A.L. is also offering $100,000 in compensation and so-called condolence money to the families of Flight 007 victims. So far, payments have gone to the relatives of 49 passengers - 43 South Koreans, 5 Taiwanese and a Filipino. **********And more basic types of public relations have not been ignored. In one cosmetic change that has received little notice, K.A.L. planes that travel from New York to Seoul no longer carry the designation Flight 007. It is Flight 017 these days."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/15/world/finnish-curb-on-policy-briefings-is-extended.html": {"writer_name": "Werner Wiskari", "pub_date": "1984-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 644, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINNISH CURB ON POLICY BRIEFINGS IS EXTENDED", "print_headline": "FINNISH CURB ON POLICY BRIEFINGS IS EXTENDED", "body_text": " **********President Mauno Koivisto of Finland, who recently vowed that the Finnish press would never again get any official explanation of his ''way of thinking,'' has extended this restriction to reporters around the world. **********He has directed Finnish diplomats to refrain from giving journalists interpretations of his remarks. **********''The statements of the President of the Republic are to be read just as they are,'' according to a Foreign Ministry directive. ''Explaining would be an indication that the original text was unclear or misleading.'' **********The directive said diplomats could discuss the general subjects of the President's remarks or the principles of Finland's foreign policy. **********The directive marks another step by President Koivisto toward trying to limit the trend toward freer discussion of national issues that he himself encouraged on taking office two years ago. In the process there has been a relaxation of much of the self-censorship practiced by the Finnish press during the more authoritarian era of Mr. Koivisto's predecessor, Urho Kekkonen, on issues related to Finland's relations with the Soviet Union. **********Finnish presidents do not hold news conferences and, if Mr. Koivisto persists in his decision, he will no longer follow his practice of giving interviews to explain his policies and will not allow officials to interpret them.  His extension of this restriction to diplomats appears aimed at cutting off another source used by Finnish newspapers, which often reprint or quote from articles that appear abroad, particularly in Sweden. **********President Koivisto has made it clear over the last year that he feels Finns have gone too far in exercising the greater freedom of discussion. **********Last spring he went before Parliament to denounce a professor and other commentators as ''gypsy fortunetellers'' who should leave foreign policy pronouncements to the President. The speech followed a speculative paper delivered in February at an international conference by Prof. Raimo Vayrynen on whether nuclear weapons could be based on Finnish soil. **********A high official said later that the President's denunciation had ben prompted by press comment that such speculation could not have occurred during mr. kekkonen's tenure. **********In November Mr. Koivisto sent a confidential letter to 30 newspaper editors asking them to handle foreign policy issues ''more responsibly'' and complaining about the Vayrynen incident and others. He reportedly mentioned the frequent questioning in the press over whether he was pursuing a consistent neutrality policy. He also mentioned published complaints that he did not explain himself clearly enough. **********The content of the letter was communicated to papers in Sweden and then the Finnish press began a discussion based on the Swedish reports. This discussion led Mr. Koivisto to say in an interview published Jan. 3 in the Finnish Swedish-language newspaper Abo Underrattelser of Turku: **********''From now on, I shall see to it that no one will explain my way of thinking, and that includes myself.'' **********In his directive to the diplomats, he took note of fears expressed by some editors that his policies might be leading toward thought control. **********''Naturally,'' the directive said, ''the President of the Republic does not want to direct nor limit the public discussion of foreign policy nor does he want to prevent criticism of the leader of that policy.'' **********But at the same time, the President said he, too, had a right to criticize. **********The directive was disclosed on Friday by the Finnish newspaper Uusi Suomi and confirmed by Finnish officials in Washington and New York. **********The Finnish Foreign Ministry declined a request by Uusi Suomi to explain the directive. **********''I have heard this instruction has been sent,'' said Mika Tapaninen, the head of the ministry's press section.

They will also elect a 90- member Central Committee to be led by a 15-member Politburo as its supreme executive organ. **********Currently, the leadership is based on a Central Committee with 26 members, many of whom will lose their power and patronage under the new political structure. Thus, as the time for the congress has approached there has been bitter political infighting for senior positions, centering on personality and tribe rather than ideological inclination. **********''It could be compared to the barons of the Middle Ages,'' a university professor with long experience in southern Africa said. ''What is being fought for now is a position in perpetuity to reap the spoils of independence. Previous experience in African countries has shown us that, once the elite is entrenched, it rarely changes constitutionally.'' **********Mr. Mugabe and his powerful deputy, Simon Muzenda, have already been selected unopposed for the top two Politiburo positions and, under the party's new constitution, they will form themselves into a commission to choose the other 13.   'The Securing of Power' **********The Zimbabwean leader, once viewed as struggling for control of his ever-fractious party, seems thus to have maneuvered himself into a position of virtually unassailable power, Western diplomats said. ''The congress,'' an African diplomat said, ''is about the securing of power.'' **********In a long opening review of his party's 21 years of existence, Mr. Mugabe seemed to qualify some of the constitution's Marxist aspirations by saying that while his goal was ''a socialist, egalitarian and fully democratic society,'' such transformation ''is not a mechanical process, nor can it take place overnight.'' **********The party's first congress was held in 1964 and committed the movement to war against the white minority. Now that the war is won, the second congress is supposed to set out guidelines for running an independent country, including a leadership code to curb flourishing official corruption and proposals for land redistribution, women's rights and the formal avowal of Marxist- Leninist economic and political principles. **********The opening today was attended by 300 foreign delegates, including Presidents Quett Masire of Botswana, Samora Machel of Mozambique and Kenneth D. Kaunda of Zambia.   Scant Reference to Nkomo **********Mr. Mugabe's speech ranged over the party's history as a nationalist movement and as the principal enemy of the white minority in the guerrilla war that led to majority rule on April 18, 1980. He made only scant reference, however, to Joshua Nkomo, the patriarch of Zimbabwean nationalism who led a separate, Soviet-backed guerrilla army in the same war but whose political fortunes have faltered since independence. **********Mr. Nkomo was not present at the congress,underlining the profound and long-standing rift between him and his Ndebele followers and the majority Shona-speaking people who provide Mr. Mugabe's power base. **********For those who had known the Borrowdale racecourse during the days when Rhodesia was an international pariah because of its declaration of independence under white rule in 1965, the congress opening presented incongruities: the Soviet hammer-and-sickle was one of the flags that fluttered over the turf that once was part of a leisured colonial life- style.   Cool Relations With Moscow **********Mr. Mugabe's relationship with the Russians has generally been cool because Moscow backed Mr. Nkomo during the seven-year guerrilla war and refused to supply arms to Mr. Mugabe's numerically superior guerrillas. In his speech today, Mr. Mugabe pointedly made refence to the Soviet Union toward the end of a list of ''friendly'' countries, but acknowledged ''the material aid and training assistance given to the people of Zimbabwe to help them free themselves.'' **********Mr. Mugabe assumed the effective leadership of his party in 1976, when it was bitterly divided between the clans that make up the Shona group - Zezurus, Karangas, Manicas and others - and whose feudings still provide part of the dynamics of party politics. **********He became Zimbabwe's first Prime Minister after independence and has moved since then to neutralize opposition from outside his party from both the Ndebele and the residual white minority, now estimated to number 120,000. **********The new party constitution is viewed by many Western diplomats as the seal of his power within his own party, affording him a position to purge the ranks of those he considers inept or corrupt and surround himself with loyalists who will not challenge his brand of slow-burning Marxism.   Multiparty System Until 1990 **********However, many restraints remain. Under the national Constitution drawn up at independence, Zimbabwe is committed to retaining a multiparty system until 1990. Parliament, made up of 80 seats for blacks and 20 for whites, must give 100 percent support for any change in the Constitution before 1987, and 70 percent support between 1987 and 1990. **********Thus, the party has transformed itself into the ''vanguard'' enunciated in one-party theory at a time when, constitutionally, it is committed to operating within a multiparty system. **********A debate on how to establish one- party rule is expected to erupt at the congress, pitting youthful radicals seeking immediate one-party rule against those prepared to wait a few years. **********In the pre-independence elections of 1980, Mr. Mugabe's party won 57 of the 100 seats, giving him a mandate to carry out his party's policies in the face of any oppositon, and thus to run a country dominated by a single party. **********The next elections are due before February, 1985, and, unlike the last British-organized vote, they will not be supervised by outsiders. The party strategy, some Western diplomats believe, is to use next year's voting to further erode opposition and to present it as a referendum on the desirability of one-party rule."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/10/world/opposition-pulls-out-of-sandinista-council.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-03-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 149, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Opposition Pulls Out Of Sandinista Council", "print_headline": "Opposition Pulls Out Of Sandinista Council", "body_text": " **********Three more opposition parties and a labor union withdrew from the Sandinista-dominated Council of State today. **********All four opposition parties now have left the council, an appointed legislature that advises the ruling junta. **********Forty of its 51 members support the leftist Sandinista junta. **********Spokesmen for the parties said they oppose the council's discussion of a law that sets rules for election of a president, vice president and 90-member legislative assembly instead of first providing for the election of an assembly to write a new constitution. **********The Government announced in February that the election would be Nov. 4. **********The Social Christian Party withdrew from the discussion Thursday night, and the Social Democrats, Conservative Democrats and Constitutionalist Liberals and the Labor Unification Confederation withdrew tonight. **********There was no official Government reaction to the opposition pullout."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/14/business/market-place-stock-sleuth-uses-reports.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1984-09-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 824, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STOCK SLEUTH USES REPORTS", "print_headline": "MARKET PLACE; STOCK SLEUTH USES REPORTS", "body_text": " **********ROBERT A. OLSTEIN manages client accounts in the White Plains office of Shearson Lehman/American Express Inc. But when he talks about the stock market, Mr. Olstein does not sound like a typical broker. **********''I consider myself a detective of corporate balance sheets and income statements,'' he said in explaining his investment approach. ''I'm always looking between the numbers for signs of positive and negative potential.'' **********Mr. Olstein once worked as a staff auditor at the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen & Company. Later he was co-author of The Quality of Earnings Report, a service that - fittingly enough - examined balance sheets and income statements for managers of institutional money. **********This technique requires a considerable amount of reading, from annual reports and quarterly reports to the 10-K and 10-Q documents issued by companies. Mr. Olstein is a devoted fan of the corporate literature genre. ''You can learn more about the substance of a company by spending time with the numbers in these reports than by talking to top management,'' he declared. **********His basic approach to the market involves two steps. ''First, you must avoid the losers, or those potential disaster stocks that can ruin an investor's long-term performance,'' he said. ''For example, when you find nonrecurring items added to a company's earnings, that can be a warning sign, since it means the company must work harder in the ensuing year in order for profits to keep pace. **********''Another possible early warning sign contained in financial statements can be actuarial changes that decrease a company's pension expenses.'' **********Once he has screened financial statements for potential problems and placed these stocks on a list to avoid, Mr. Olstein begins to ''play offense,'' as he expresses the second phase of his strategy. **********He looks for companies that generate excess cash flow - after covering capital expenditures and working capital needs. In his view, companies enjoying excess cash flow, in effect, possess an umbrella for possible rainy weather. ''These companies are in a position to raise dividends, make timely acquisitions and repurchase their own shares,'' he said. ''Indeed, they also may qualify as acquisition candidates by other companies.'' **********After the test of excess cash flow is passed, Mr. Olstein analyzes company statements for such things as hidden assets, understated profits and rates of return, in order to establish, by his own formula, the ''private market value'' on the basis of a theoretical leveraged buyout. **********''What I seek is a significant deviation - that is, 25 percent or greater - between private market value and the current market value of the stock,'' the broker said. ''In addition, there must be what, in my opinion, is the opportunity for a 50 percent appreciation in the price of the stock over the next 18 to 24 months. Most issues meeting these criteria usually are experiencing recurring earnings problems, cyclical downturns or else have fallen, at least temporarily, from investor favor. And that creates the opportunity to purchase the stocks at a discount.'' **********The issues that currently qualify for Mr. Olstein's ''buy'' list: the Stride Rite Corporation and National Presto Industries, both listed on the Big Board, and the La-Z-Boy Chair Company and Deb Shops Inc., which trade over-the-counter. **********Stride Rite, a leading producer of children's shoes, certainly qualifies as a company whose stock has fallen from favor. Yesterday, the stock closed at 14 5/8, up 1/8. It reached a record high of 43 1/2 in June 1983, after a run that began at 8 3/8 in January 1982. ''Because of problems in the Ked's shoe division, I expect earnings to decline to around $1.60 a share from last year's $2.35,'' Mr. Olstein said. ''But I calculate the company's private market value in excess of $26 a share.'' **********Shares of National Presto, a maker of small appliances, fell 1/2, to 22 3/4. They sold at a record price of 32 1/2, also in June of last year. ''Earnings have been fluctuating in the range of $2 to $2.70 a share for the past few years, with the peak profit occurring in 1981,'' according to Mr. Olstein. ''The company generates excess cash of $15 million a year, holds $115 million in cash and I believe its private market value is $32 a share.'' **********He considers La-Z-Boy Chair to represent a similar situation and calculates the private market value at $48 a share. The stock, which traded at a high of 48 1/2 in January, gained 1/2, to 30 1/2. **********Shares of Deb Shops, which operates a chain of junior sportswear stores, were unchanged at 19. Its high in mid-1983 was 32 1/4. Mr. Olstein said profits are rising and the company turns over its inventory ''an amazing 10 times a year.'' He estimates the private market value at $25.50 a share. **********'These companies are in a position to raise dividends, make timely acquisitions and repurchase their own shares.'"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/20/world/libyan-asserts-tripoli-warned-britain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 599, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LIBYAN ASSERTS TRIPOLI WARNED BRITAIN", "print_headline": "LIBYAN ASSERTS TRIPOLI WARNED BRITAIN", "body_text": " **********Libya's Foreign Minister said today that his Government had warned British officials well before Tuesday's shooting incident at the Libyan Embassy in London that ''anti-revolution forces'' would try to disrupt relations between the two countries. **********''But, in fact, we did not receive any positive responses,'' the Foreign Minister, Ali Abdel Salam Turayki, said.

In the export-producing plants, the credo has become: Automate or emigrate. **********For more than a year, the Caterpillar Tractor Company has been hanging on, waiting for the dollar to break and begin its slide. **********In the meantime, Caterpillar has allowed its profit margins on exports to become razor thin and, what may be worse, it has swallowed losses in an effort to maintain its overseas market share. Its thinking has been that once the dollar dropped and Caterpillar products became relatively cheaper overseas, export sales - and margins - would swell. **********But the dollar refuses to fall. Now Caterpillar executives are beginning to ask whether the super-strong dollar is here to stay. If so, the next question is whether Caterpillar's price-cutting approach, intended to hold on to its market share, will ever work. **********Profit Kept Low **********''We've sacrificed profit to maintain market share, but you can't keep that up forever,'' said Donald V. Fites, a Caterpillar vice president in charge of forecasting, pricing and product sourcing. As evidence that the Peoria, Ill., company cannot keep up its overseas price-cutting forever, Mr. Fites noted that Caterpillar has lost money in seven of the last eight quarters, in large part because of the strong dollar. **********Indeed, Caterpillar reported this week that its losses could extend to the end of the year, and its stock was battered by rumors that the board would vote next week to cut the company's 37 1/2 cent quarterly dividend. **********The dollar's steep rise against Europe's leading currencies in the last two months - and in particular its resilience in the face of efforts by the West German central bank to rein it in - is driving home to more and more executives the realization that the dollar's strength may be a fixture that must be taken into account in long-range planning. **********As a result, companies such as Cater pillar are seeking new ways of becoming more competitive with foreign manufacturers, which many American companies say have gained a 35 percent cost advantage by the dollar's rise. And the American companies are finding that the best ways are to become more efficient at home or to buy or produce their products overseas. **********''Our manufacturing people keep saying, 'We have to automate or emigrate,' '' said Mr. Fites of Caterpillar.  In many instances, the answer has been to emigrate. **********Production Transferred Overseas **********For instance, Mr. Fites said. Caterpillar had transferred production of its D4 tractor from Aurora, Ill., to a joint venture in Japan. In addition, just as the General Motors Corporation has turned to Daewoo of South Korea to manufacture subcompact automobiles more cheaply, Caterpillar is now marketing lift trucks made by Daewoo. **********''We have to source from Europe for the Africa and Middle East market,'' Mr. Fites said. ''We can no longer sell competitively in those areas models made in the United States.'' **********He said Caterpillar has just 16,000 employees in jobs directly tied to exports, down from 31,000 three years ago. In addition, exports have dropped from nearly half of Caterpillar's sales three years ago to barely a third last year. **********Taking an approach that parallels that of Caterpillar, the Monsanto Company, the St. Louis-based chemical manufacturer, has recently approved construction of a silicon wafer plant north of London. **********Francis J. Mootz, controller of Monsanto International, said, ''It's almost impossible to introduce efficiencies here that can offset the run- up of the dollar.'' **********Job Loss Cited **********Economists at the Washington- based Institute for International Economics estimate that the competitive disadvantages created by the strong dollar have resulted in a loss of three million jobs in export-oriented American industries and in American industries that compete with imports. **********''Each 1 percent of appreciation of the dollar causes a decline of $2 billion to $2.5 billion in exports annually,'' said William R. Cline, a senior fellow at the institute. **********Indeed, according to the Department of Commerce, total exports dropped 7.2 percent in August, to $18.02 billion, from $19.44 billion in July. **********According to Lynn O. Michaelis, the chief economist for the Weyerhaeuser Company, the dollar's recent run-up has caused linerboard export volume to be flat in tonnage terms and pushed it down in dollar terms. **********''We've had to drop our prices overseas to keep up with our competitors,'' he said. ''It's certainly hurting our margins. We've spent a great deal of time in the 1970's developing a market in Japan, and we don't want to abandon that market lightly.'' **********Nevertheless, Mr. Michaelis said, Weyerhaeuser has been forced to rethink some its ''cling-to-our-markets'' strategy as the dollar remains strong. Mr. Michaelis, who estimated that the dollar is 35 percent to 40 percent overvalued against European currencies, predicted that the dollar would remain strong as long as the Federal budget deficit and real interest rates remain high. **********Some Dangers Involved **********But relying too much on emigration has its dangers, too. In addition to injuring American companies that rely on exports, the strong dollar also hurts American corporations that have foreign plants and hefty overseas sales of those foreign-made products. An American company that makes money on sales from its plants in Europe will see its profits diminished when it converts them to American currency. **********For instance, the Upjohn Company, a pharmaceutical concern based in Kalamazoo, Mich., took a $3.6 million foreign exchange loss in the second quarter as a result of the strong dollar. Thirty-five percent of its sales are overseas, and the bulk of that comes from merchandise manufactured abroad. **********''We expect the strong dollar to continue to have a negative impact,'' said Robert D. LaRue, Upjohn's manager of financial communications. **********Export-oriented executives differ with those economists who maintain that the strong dollar will help American industry in the long run by putting pressure on it to become more competitive vis- a-vis foreign producers. The idea is that once the dollar slides, the leaner, more efficient American companies will overwhelm the competition. **********''Yes, the dollar forces you to sharpen competitively,'' said Richard E. Burket, vice president and assistant to the chairman of the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, a grain processor based in Decatur, Ill. ''But the downside is it holds an umbrella up for the competition. It helps them establish themselves in markets that were once ours.'' **********Once foreign competition supplants American industry in an overseas market, Mr. Burket explained, it might prove hard and perhaps impossible to recapture that market. He said it would be difficult, for example, to root Brazil and Argentina from the soybean market they captured in Japan when they took advantage of the strong dollar and the repeated American grain embargoes. **********And even if automation or emigration is successful, there is no guarantee that such steps will improve a company's prospects. **********''One glass manufacturer told me he is making glass as efficiently as any Japanese producer,'' said William C. Freund, chief economist at the New York Stock Exchange. ''He said he couldn't offset the rise in the dollar by becoming more technically proficient. We ought not to fix the competitiveness of American industry by policies that don't address the basic ailment: the deficits and high interest rates'' that he said are keeping the dollar high."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/26/world/ss-22-reported-in-east-germany.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 379, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SS-22 REPORTED IN EAST GERMANY", "print_headline": "SS-22 REPORTED IN EAST GERMANY", "body_text": " **********A new, more accurate Soviet medium- range nuclear missile that could pose a wider threat to Western Europe has been spotted in East Germany for the first time, United States intelligence sources said today. **********The sighting of the new missile, the SS-22, could mark the start of the weapon's deployment on Soviet allied territory in response to placement of new United States intermediate-range missiles in Western Europe, said the sources, who spoke only on condition they remain anonymous. **********The 560-mile-range SS-22, developed to replace old SS-12 missiles, has never before been deployed outside the Soviet Union, the sources said. **********The SS-22 was seen at Bernsdorf, East Germany, about 33 miles west of the Polish border, they said.

Over the past three months, in the Ayacucho region, numerous mass graves have been uncovered containing some corpses ''identified as individuals who were reportedly arrested by the security forces,'' the report said. **********U.S. Also Criticized **********The report also criticized the Reagan Administration for what it said was its failure to issue a public condemnation of human rights violations in Peru while stepping up assistance to the armed forces considered responsible for many of the abuses. **********(There was no immediate comment from Peruvian officials in Lima. In Washington, a State Department spokesman said the department would have no immediate response.) **********''The present human rights situation in Peru is bleak and it has the potential to get far worse,'' the report said, with an added warning: ''All the evidence suggests that, far from crushing Sendero Luminoso, the tactics of the armed forces and the police have been counterproductive.

The report also includes more recent information provided by researchers in Peru. **********The report noted that the Peruvian President, Fernando Belaunde Terry, had strongly resented earlier criticism of human rights violations by such outside groups as Amnesty International, and that many Peruvians feared that such criticism could undermine the elected Government and bring on a new military coup. **********The report added: ''The last thing we want to do is contribute to any effort to undermine democratic rule and pave the way for what could be far worse. At the same time, we believe that it is a great mistake to remain silent about the gross abuses taking place in Peru.'' **********Americas Watch conceded that ''the country would require extraordinary leadership deeply committed to human rights to wage an effective fight against Sendero's terror without resorting to counterterror.'' **********''Unfortunately, the democratically elected Government has not provided such leadership,'' the report went on. ''Indeed, it has abdicated authority.'' **********In 13 provinces, responsibility for combating the insurgents has been passed entirely to the armed forces since last July, the report said, adding that the results have included not only a weakening of civilian authorities but also a sharp rise in official violence. **********It described a two-part approach involving distribution of food and seeds to ''friendly'' villages, and fierce reprisals against villages thought to sympathize with the guerrillas. **********Americas Watch said there were also confirmed reports of executions and murders carried out by Sendero Luminoso, but it said the authorities routinely blamed most acts of violence in the Ayacucho region on the guerrillas and information was often difficult to corroborate independently."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/16/business/reliance-steel.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 69, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reliance Steel", "print_headline": "Reliance Steel", "body_text": " **********The Reliance Steel and Aluminum Company said it had closed its Houston metals-service facility because of the continuing slump in the oil industry.

At Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood, according to the ''National Law Journal Directory,'' only 1 percent of the young lawyers that joined the firm in 1973 and 1974 became partners. Of the New York firms listed, the second-hardest place to make partner seems to be Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, where 9 percent of the first-year associates hired in 1973 became partners. **********(This can't be used as a definitive guide, not only because the information is a year old, but also because some law firms known for their choosiness - including Cravath, Swaine & Moore - simply did not provide the relevant figures on how many of their first-year associates ultimately became partners in the firm.) **********But some of New York's big firms seem to offer a much better shot at making partner, especially Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, where the directory says 60 percent of the first-year associates were promoted to partnership; Coudert Brothers, with 44 percent; Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler, with 45 percent, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, with 47 percent. **********For those who really care about making partner, though, the best advice is probably to get out of New York. In Chicago, for example, more than half the first-year associates at Winston & Strawn; Mayer, Brown & Platt; Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather & Geraldson; and McDermott, Will & Emery, were promoted to partner. And at Jenner & Block, it's a full 74 percent. (The big firm to watch for in Chicago seems to be Sidley & Austin, where only 18 percent of the first-year associates became partner, a close to average rate for New York, but unusually low for Chicago.) **********Dallas is a good bet, too: At Jenkens & Gilchrist, 92 percent of the first- year associates that came to the firm between 1973 and 1977 made partner. Not far behind are Johnson & Swanson and Strasburger & Price, both of which had partnership rates of 76 percent. **********How long it takes before a lawyer is considered for partnership varies from firm to firm, but the average is five to eight years. A few firms - such as Cleveland's Squire, Sanders & Dempsey, where it is eight to ten years - take more time. And a few others - such as Los Angeles's Munger, Tolles & Rickershauser, where it is three to five years - take less."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/15/business/article-054594-no-title.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1984-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 907, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Article 054594 -- No Title", "print_headline": "Article 054594 -- No Title", "body_text": " **********The Senate Finance Committee, shifting from its effort to raise taxes and cut spending to trim the Government's budget deficits, approved tax cuts today that would total $6.1 billion over four years. **********The package includes the phasing- in over six years of President Reagan's proposed increase in Individual Retirement Accounts for nonworking spouses, the Administration's jobs credit proposal and its enterprise zone plan to encourage investment in cities. In addition, the committee approved new tax benefits for research and development, some energy tax credits and an increase in the tax break for alcohol used in motor fuels. **********''We're losing about as fast as we are taking in today,'' said Senator Bob Dole, the Kansas Republican who heads the committee. **********All the proposals were approved on condition that the committee approve other tax increases that would offset the tax cuts. Before today's action, the committee had raised taxes by about $47.6 billion. **********It was not clear whether the committee could finish its work by the end of the week, which is Senator Dole's goal. **********The committee also approved an exchange of tax data between the Internal Revenue Service and the City of New York. This proposal was made by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York. **********Better Enforcement Sought **********The idea is to stiffen enforcement against taxpayers who may not be paying as much as they should to either or both governmental entities. The Senator's staff estimated that the plan would raise about $100 million over two years for the Federal Government and about $25 million for the city. **********Leading Senate Republicans conferred for an hour and a half with President Reagan today, but they failed to reach agreement on a budget for the fiscal year 1985, beginning next Oct. 1. White House officials said the stumbling block continued to be military spending. **********Senator Pete V. Domenici, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, has proposed a 5 percent increase in military spending for the next year, while the Administration has proposed 13 percent. **********A White House official said the disagreement related to what next year's spending level would imply for spending in the subsequent two years. Specifically, the Administration favors cuts in operations and maintenance, while Mr. Domenici favors cuts in weapons procurement, the official said. **********Baker Expresses Optimism **********After the meeting, Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., the Senate majority leader, told reporters he was ''reasonably optimistic that we'll be able to work out our differences and have something we can support.'' **********Senator Baker said there might be further consultations Thursday between the Senate Republicans and White House aides. A White House aide said no meeting was scheduled with Mr. Reagan. **********Senator Dole removed from today's Finance Committee agenda a proposal dealing with the taxation of interest-free loans to family members. The Supreme Court, after years of litigation, recently ruled that such loans are subject to tax. But it appeared that the committee was leaning toward approving a proposal that would prevent the I.R.S. from being able to collect retroactively. **********Current tax law provides that $250 a year can be contributed to an I.R.A. for a nonworking spouse, while the working spouse can put in as much as $2,000. Both amounts are deductible from taxable income. A two-earner couple may contribute up to $2,000 each. **********A $2,000 Maximum by 1990 **********President Reagan's I.R.A. proposal was approved by the Finance Committee, 12 to 5. It would increase the $250 maximum for the nonworking spouse by $500 for 1985-86, by another $500 for 1987-88 and by $500 again in 1989, followed by a $250 increase in 1990. These increases, plus the current $250 allowance, would bring the limit to $2,000. Over the next three years, this step would reduce the Treasury's tax revenues by about $900 milliom. **********There was some opposition from Senators who contended that the plan favored high-income families. **********The Moynihan proposal for exchanging tax information affects both individuals and corporations. Other cities with a population of more than two million and a local income tax could also exchange information with the I.R.S. The exchange is subject to a veto by the service if it decides it cannot protect the confidentiality of the data. **********The Internal Revenue Service already exchanges tax information with state tax departments. The proposal made by Mr. Moynihan was requested by New York City, his staff said. **********Tax Credit for Research **********After long debate, the committee voted a permanent extension of the tax credit for research and experimentation, which would reduce revenue by $2.1 billion over four years. The tax credit is 25 percent of the amount spent on new research each year above a set base. **********Another major tax cut was a two- year extension of the targeted jobs credit, which is for employers who hire disadvantaged youths between ages 18 and 24 and Vietnam War veterans. **********The enterprise zone proposal, which Congress has repeatedly failed to pass, would give extra tax credits to businesses that open production and distribution facilities in designated high-unemployment areas. **********Near the end of the session this evening, the committee approved a proposal that would allow taxpayers to check off on their tax form a contribution to send American atheletes to the Olympics. The contribution would come from the taxpayer's earnings, not from taxes owed, so there would be no loss of revenue.

Most of the singles asked for advice on how to reduce taxes, said Michael Cheaham, who ran the Merrill Lynch booth.

The service's booth had singles - mainly women - lined up for hours to get their palms read for free. **********The singles were buying, too.

His current whereabouts is unknown. For whom he was working, if anyone, at the time of the blast has not been determined. It is not known whether he acted alone or with the help of others. **********The bomb, which went off at a crowded news conference in Nicaragua near the Costa Rican border, killed four people - three journalists and an anti-Sandinista rebel - and wounded more than two dozen other people, including Mr. Pastora. At the same time, it introduced a new and less predictable type of terrorism into the long- running conflict in Central America and sharply increased tension among and within the opposing factions. **********The investigation has been hampered by false leads, conflicting political interests and the fact that the bombing took place in a rebel-controlled area that the Costa Ricans have no jurisdiction to enter and the Nicaraguans have no ability to enter. Various investigations and interested parties have concentrated on different possible motives for the attack, generally in line with their political orientation.   A False Lead Is Abandoned **********Costa Rican Government investigators spent days pursuing a lead that the mysterious photographer, who went by the name of Per Anker Hansen, was actually Jose Miguel Lujua Gorostiola, a member of the Basque separatist group E.T.A. While the two men bear some facial similarities, this lead was abandoned when the French authorities told Costa Rica that Mr. Lujua Gorostiola was under a form of house arrest in France and had not been out of the country in several months. **********A Uruguayan exile in Sweden said Monday that he recognized the key suspect as a fellow Uruguayan with whom he engaged in leftist political activities in the late 1960's and early 1970's. The exile, who asked not to be identified for security reasons, said in a telephone interview that the man was now living in Venezuela. He said the man's name had been turned over to Interpol, the international police cooperative organization. **********The motives for the bombing remain a matter of speculation. The explosion took place at a time of heavy pressure from the Central Intelligence Agency on the two major groups fighting the Sandinista Government - the Democratic Revolutionary Alliance based in Costa Rica and the Honduran-based Nicaraguan Democratic Force. The C.I.A. has sought to consolidate their forces, a move that Mr. Pastora strongly opposes unless the group based in Honduras expels some leaders who were in the national guard of Anastasio Somoza Debayle when he was Nicaragua's dictator. The bombing came as well at a time when the Nicaraguan Government appears to feel increasing pressure from armed and unarmed opponents.   Pastora's View Wavers **********Mr. Pastora has wavered between blaming the C.I.A., the Honduran-based rebels and the Sandinistas. ''For several months, the C.I.A. has been preparing the ground, mounting a campaign against me, saying I am the only obstacle to unification with the Nicaraguan Democratic Force,'' he said shortly before being flown to Caracas for medical treatment. ''This attack is punishment for not yielding.'' **********United States officials have promoted the idea that the Sandinistas were to blame, possibly acting through the Basque separatist group. A State Department spokesman said today, however, that the United States had ''no independent confirmation of who might be responsible.'' The idea has been strongly pursued by the Costa Rican Government with little result. **********Ambassador Curtin Winsor Jr., speaking of the Sandinistas, said: ''There's nobody else I can think of who would have the motive. The C.I.A. doesn't do this kind of thing.'' **********Despite the initial failure to establish a link to E.T.A., Costa Rica is still looking for an E.T.A. role, according to an official involved in the investigation. ''The E.T.A. was launched on the streets to cause confusion,'' he said of rumors about E.T.A. involvement, adding that it was his belief that as a result, the Costa Rican investigation ''will come to nothing.''  Rebels Check 2 Possibilities **********Meanwhile, investigators from the rebel group based in Costa Rica, which is known by its initials in Spanish as ARDE, are looking more closely at two possibilities. One is that the attack could have been the result of increased friction in its own ranks because the majority of its people are said to be willing to consolidate with the Honduran forces. The other possibility is that the attack might have been an effort by the Honduran-based rebel group to eliminate Mr. Pastora and therefore the obstacles to consolidation. **********For the Sandinistas, an ARDE investigator said, ''the fact is that it is politically more convenient to have him alive and causing divisions.'' Of the C.I.A., he said, ''It's not their style.'' **********Little is known about the key suspect in the bombing. **********The imposter had been in the region since at least February and perhaps since October, according to Costa Rican investigators, and had entered and left the country at least six times on trips to Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and Mexico. He said he was representing a Paris-based photo agency called Europe 7, which does not appear to exist. He used the Danish passport of Per Anker Hansen, a young architect who later said his passport was stolen in a robbery about four years ago.   Few Details on Imposter **********In the month before the bombing, the imposter traveled with a Swedish journalist and television producer, Peter Torbiornsson, who has been working on a documentary on Central America, and his Bolivian assistant, Luis Fernando Prado. According to Mr. Prado and Mr. Torbiornsson, they met in early May at the Hotel Gran Via, a modern but somewhat rundown hotel in downtown San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica. **********Mr. Prado, in an interview Saturday in San Jose's Hospital Mexico, where he is recovering from wounds received in the blast, also mentioned that the supposed Danish journalist appeared to be familiar with Uruguay. **********''We were talking one night about where would be the best place to be,'' he recalled. ''I said the Obelisk in Buenos Aires at midnight. He said the Port of Montevideo at 10:30, or something like that.'' **********Mr. Prado said the supposed Dane spoke little Danish, a fact that both he and Mr. Torbiornsson said struck them as odd only after press reports began linking the imposter to the bombing. He said they talked with the imposter mostly in English and that ''his Spanish was forced,'' as if he was trying to disguise an accent. He also said that the imposter ''knew idioms from a lot of places.'' **********The three men made two trips together to rebel territory. The first was from May 17 to 22, according to Mr. Prado, when they visited rebel camps and tried without success to find Mr. Pastora. The second was on May 30, the day of the bombing.   Camera Case Is Suspect **********Although he used only three cameras - a Pentax, a Nikon and a Polaroid, according to Mr. Prado - the man carried a bulky aluminum camera case on both trips. The authorities now believe, based on metal fragments found at the site and in the victims, that this case contained the bomb used in the attack. **********The bomb exploded at 7:20 P.M., just as a group of journalists had gathered around Mr. Pastora to hear him explain his reasons for refusing to ally his forces with the Honduras-based rebels. The man who called himself Per Anker Hansen had left the room only moments before, according to witnesses. **********Photographs taken just after the blast show him looking dazed but relatively unharmed, lying against a group of barrels outside the stilted building where the news conference was taking place, not far from the stairs leading to the entrance. Although he was practically unscathed, he was the first, other reporters said, to board the boats that took the wounded to a hospital in Ciudad Quesada, in northern Costa Rica. **********At the hospital, where he was found to have only minor cuts, the imposter gave an interview to a local radio station in which he described himself as ''really lucky.'' Speaking in nearly flawless and unaccented Spanish, he said he ''was on the stairs and fell to the floor'' when the explosion took place.   The Trail Ends **********The imposter left the hospital early the next morning with Mr. Torbiornsson, and they returned to the capital by taxi. Hours later he told Mr. Torbiornsson he was leaving the country and, in what officials now concede was a major flaw in their investigation, he apparently was able to do so. **********Early reports said he boarded an Air Florida plane for a direct flight to Miami, but the name of Per Anker Hansen does not appear on the flight roster or in Costa Rican immigration records. A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Miami said Monday that the agency was trying to determine whether he had entered the United States, but it had been unable to do so. **********A Costa Rican investigator said the authorities established that the imposter had headed for the airport, stopping along the way to change money, but did not know whether he had boarded a flight. He said the imposter was believed to have changed money from dollars into Costa Rican colons, which could indicate that he intended to travel by land or even remain in the country. The authorities have been unable to trace him beyond that point."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/27/business/advertising-floral-account-moves.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-11-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 60, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Floral Account Moves", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Floral Account Moves", "body_text": " **********The 800-Flowers organization, which is on its way to becoming a national flowers-by-phone operation, has given its advertising account to its Dallas neighbor, the Bloom Agency.

Early in the year, when we warned that it might hit, we encountered an understandable degree of puzzlement and skepticism. But now the evidence of a recession spans three consecutive months of predominantly bad economic news. **********The volume of housing construction, a bellwether of the economy, peaked in the first half and has been sliding rapidly. Business reduced its orders for new capital equipment three months in a row, and has scaled down its plans for investment in new plant and equipment during the rest of 1984. **********Retail sales declined during the summer. The spurt of back-to-school business was late and short-lived. Inventories, already excessive for many companies, have been rising faster than sales, and efforts are underway to reduce stocks. Industrial production barely increased in August. Employment is decelerating, claims for unemployment benefits are rising and help-wanted ad volume is falling. **********Why has the recovery ended? In our profit-driven economy, recessions occur when business profits fall - companies cannot sell as much as they expected to sell at the prices they expected to receive. Weaker business conditions cause businesses to cut back on production and employment, accelerating the decline. **********One need not make exhaustive computations and projections of individual companies' revenues and expenses to see that total corporate profits are falling. The aggregate profits of all corporations ultimately depend on several types of transactions, or ''sources of profits.'' These profit sources account for the difference between aggregate revenues and aggregate expenses. Decreases in the sources are responsible for the new recession. **********Home building, a major profit source, is falling. Expenditures for new housing encouraged by declining interest rates gave the recent recovery an early impetus. Housing starts reached a peak of 2.25 million units - on an annualized basis - last February. They have fallen to 1.5 million and the reports of lending institutions on the recent dearth of home sales and mortgage applications suggest that the decline in residential construction has a way to go. **********Even more essential to the strength of the over-all economy is business investment in non-residential buildings and equipment. During the past year, the real growth of capital outlays set records and was a major propellant of the recovery. Business capital expenditures usually lag the business cycle, yet they are already showing unsettling signs of weakness. Orders for business equipment are falling and plans for new plant and equipment outlays are shrinking. **********Business almost always gives itself an important boost during periods of expansion by stocking up on materials, parts and finished goods. A record surge in inventory investment made a major contribution to business sales and profits in the first half of this year. Popular measures of inventory levels suggest that stocks are low relative to sales and that business will continue to build them. **********Not so. Some of the inventory sales data are badly distorted. The evidence actually indicates that business wants lower, not higher, inventories relative to sales. Almost all goods are readily available for prompt delivery and a great many companies have clearly expressed their intentions to cut stocks. The low rate of inflation - indeed, prices for many industrial materials are declining - is encouraging purchasers to carry smaller inventories. That is a marked change from the 1970's, when companies often bought ahead to beat price increases. **********PROFITS also suffer when consumers refrain from spending. Consumers spent freely in 1983; their saving rate was at a 30- year low. In 1984 the saving rate has been moving up and the receipts of retailers and other consumer product firms have suffered accordingly. In the first half of this year consumers were still borrowing and spending eagerly, but in the second half mounting debts and high interest rates are dictating prudence. Less willing buyers are causing tougher competition and shrinking profit margins. **********The developing malaise of our economy is not being helped by the trend of the Federal deficit, which powered the recovery during its early stages. The deficit has been stable or shrinking during the past year. While a declining deficit would ordinarily be desirable, right now it would contribute to the economic contraction. **********The villain most responsible for the deterioration of the recovery is the U.S. foreign trade deficit. During the past three months it ran at an average annual rate of $130 billion. In July it climbed to an annual rate of nearly $170 billion. Many commentators wrongly shrug off the seriousness of this drain on our economy. Just as skimming the cream off milk takes away a great portion of the butter fat but leaves most of the total liquid, a trade deficit removes a large share of profits while affecting only a small share of sales. **********Here is an illustration of why. Suppose that American consumers have $110 billion a month to spend and that American business has goods for sale that had cost it $100 billion to bring to market. If consumers spend all of their $110 billion on American goods, the nation's enterprises will have a $10 billion profit. But say that consumers spend $10 billion for foreign goods and only $100 billion on domestic products. American businesses' pre-tax profits would be reduced by as much as $6 billion. **********The trade deficit has another insidious effect on American prosperity. As domestic industry loses sales to foreign enterprises, its idle capacity increases and its receipts decline. It has less need for and less ability to pay for inventories, new plant or equipment. **********Thus, a number of forces are combining to push profits lower, a process that will snowball as business begins to retrench. Indeed, the drop in profits will likely be the most severe of any postwar recession. **********This recession would be bad news no matter when it occurred. Yet in salient ways its timing is especially unfortunate. It is the third contraction in only five years, and it is hitting an economy that has not satisfactorily recovered from the two previous setbacks. True, many industries - for example, automobile manufacturing - have returned to robust health. But many others, such as steel and machine tools, are still sick. Farmers trapped between declining prices and high interest rates are struggling to remain solvent, and thousands have already succumbed. Several million people found work since the bottom of the 1981-82 recession, but eight million are still unemployed. Millions of families - particularly those supported by non-supervisory workers - have less purchasing power and savings than in the late 1970's. **********The nation's financial system is also vulnerable. The difficulties of banks in Chicago that have recently come to light are not isolated instances of trouble. Banking officials speak **********sotto voce **********for fear of disturbing already frail financial institutions, but they are worried. **********David and S.

Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, who were demonstrating outside the embassy on April 17. **********Tonight, the Libyans were reported to have received a vociferous welcome in Tripoli, the Libyan capital.  In a carefully synchronized move, the remaining British officials in Libya hauled down the Union Jack over their embassy, and all but two of them then left for home. (Page 3.) **********Weapon Is Presumed Gone **********A Libyan air freighter, laden with diplomatic bags, furniture and other gear, returned to Tripoli earlier in the day, and the police said the weapon used to fire at the people outside the embassy was presumably on board.  The police lined up the 30 occupants of the embassy against a wall and searched them, finding no firearms, but protocol forbade examination of any of the baggage. **********The body of Miss Fletcher was cremated this afternoon after a funeral in the 13th-century cathedral at Salisbury, not far from her home in the tiny Wiltshire hamlet of Semley. Leon Brittan, the Home Secretary, who coordinated British actions during the crisis, and hundreds of police officers from throughout the country were there to pay tribute to the woman who fulfilled a childhood dream to serve on the force although, at 5 feet 2 1/2 inches, she was too short to qualify. **********On top of her coffin was her uniform cap, which had lain where she fell, tossed by the wind, for more than 10 days until a young patrolman decided to retrieve it late last night. **********''Life today holds many terrors,'' said the Bishop of Salisbury, the Rev. John Austin Baker. ''As each new act of corruption is reported, we slip too easily into saying of the perpetrators, 'They must be mad.' **********''But the problem is not madness. It is wickedness.''  Evacuation Timed Exactly **********The evacuation of the embassy came more than 48 hours before the Sunday midnight deadline set by the British when they broke diplomatic relations with Libya. The evacuation followed a precise timetable worked out in the middle of the night in negotiations between the two countries, and it was witnessed by observers from the Turkish, Saudi Arabian and Syrian Embassies in London. **********Two British second secretaries, George Anderson and Redmond Norton, stayed in Tripoli, where they are to form a British Interests Section in the Italian Embassy. Two Libyans, whose names were not given, remained here to set up a similar office in the Saudi Embassy. **********A spokesman for the Home Office said the police would not search the Libyan Embassy until after Sunday midnight, when the break in relations becomes official. **********The day's drama began before dawn, when an armored police Range-Rover entered St. James's Square, just south of Piccadilly Circus. It cleared from the front of the embassy, which the Libyans call a People's Bureau, two vehicles that were left there in the confusion after the shooting 11 days ago.   7 Men Enter the Square **********Then, at 8:47 A.M., seven men walked into the square from its eastern side, down Charles II Street. They were the three diplomatic observers, two Libyans who have been serving as intermediaries during the drawn-out negotiations and two other Libyans sent here this week by Colonel Qaddafi to deal with the logistics of closing the embassy. **********Nearby streets were closed. Fire engines, ambulances, police reinforcements and seven green police vans with their windows blackened went into position. Marksmen atop surrounding buildings peered intently through their sights. **********At 9:26 a somewhat battered white van bearing diplomatic license tags backed up to the embassy. It was loaded with 4 white diplomatic sacks like the 18 taken away on Thursday and about 50 pieces of hand luggage, then it drove away. Nothing was searched. **********A momentary lull followed, the square silent except for the chirping of birds and the muffled sound of a red- and-white police helicopter hovering nearby, as hundreds of policemen fidgeted tensely. **********Finally at 9:50 a first group of five Libyans walked out, led by Muftah Fitouri, one of the intermediaries. The five walked slowly along, in single file, about three or four yards apart, and climbed into one of the green vans in adjacent Jermyn Street, which is lined with smart shops. **********Five other groups of five followed, each escorted by Mr. Fitouri, the last at 11 A.M. The name of each was checked off a list. All 30 were men, and most of them wore business suits.   The Motorcade Leaves **********When all were in the vans, a motorcade set off to the west, led by six police motorcycles with blue lights flashing, with police cars, the green vans and diplomatic limousines behind them. Only then did a police spokesman tell waiting reporters, ''The siege has ended.'' **********One of the two men sent by Colonel Qaddafi remained at the embassy, preparing to hand over the premises to the Saudis sometime soon. **********At the ''safe house,'' the Home Office spokesman said, the Libyans were ''invited to contribute any knowledge that they have concerning the shooting of Miss Fletcher'' and told to fill out routine customs and immigration forms. The questioning took place at the Civil Service College at Sunningdale, Berkshire, 16 miles southwest of London, near Windsor and lasted more than six hours. **********Early in the evening they were taken to Heathrow Airport, 12 miles away, where they boarded their flight. It took off at 7:48 P.M. **********Matooq Matooq, the final member of the four-man ''revolutionary committee'' that took over the People's Bureau in February, was deported a few hours after the embassy was cleared. He was not inside when the siege began and was arrested on Tuesday.

With the Lehman acquisition, it would move into second place, just ahead of Salomon in terms of total capital. The acquisition would also shore up two of Shearson's perceived weaknesses: investment banking and fixed-income trading. **********''The industry has evolved and continues to evolve towards firms that can provide both the investment banking and the distribution capability under one roof, and in order to have that you have to have capital resources and the expertise,'' Peter A. Cohen, chairman and chief executive of Shearson/American Express, said in an interview. ''That's the beauty of this deal. We have the capital resources and the distribution, and Lehman has the expertise in investment banking and trading. So it's very, very complementary.'' **********Analysts also viewed the acquisition as a favorable step to round out Shearson's investment services in the face of growing diversification among many financial institutions. **********''If you want a national presence and really want to serve a national market with a broad range of financial services, then you have to have everything in-house,'' said Charles Vincent, an analyst at the Provident National Bank in Philadelphia. ''If you're going to be effective in this business, you have to have strengths right across the board.'' **********Investment banking, a prestigious and often- lucrative part of the securities business, has been one area where Shearson has been perceived on Wall Street to be short on strength and short on the kind of prestige that Lehman Brothers had developed.  Shearson's $386 million in revenues last year from investment banking operations were only about half of the $747 million earned by Merrill Lynch's investment banking activities, according to Lipper Analytical Distributors. At the same time, Shearson's fixed-income trading and arbitrage activities, considered a risky but essential adjunct to investment banking, were virtually ''nonexistent,'' said Perrin Long, an analyst at Lipper. **********''There's no question Lehman's investment banking would be an asset to Shearson, assuming the people responsible for investment banking at Lehman move over to the new company,'' Mr. Long said. ''Obviously on the trading side, Shearson would become a prime Government securities dealer.'' **********Mr. Cohen asserted that he was now ready to expand into the riskier trading areas. ''I think we clearly wouldn't have bought Lehman if we weren't willing to invest in the trading areas where they had expertise,'' he said. **********Some analysts expressed concern that numerous Lehman partners might move elsewhere and take their clients along. They noted that, unlike the merger between Phibro and Salomon Brothers, which combined a commodities firm with an investment banking firm, some Lehman partners might be less willing to move into a situation where two investment firms were being combined. But Mr. Cohen said that as a condition of the transaction, ''more than a majority'' of Lehman partners would be signing employment contracts. **********Large Network of Offices **********James Stradtner, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons, said Shearson's large network of offices around the country provided an established system for distributing securities underwritten by the investment banking operation to retail customers. **********But some overlap is expected in such areas as back-office operations and research, which would likely lead to personnel displacements. **********Some analysts believe more investment banking firms may eventually succumb to takeover offers like Shearson's because of the need for capital in a trading environment that has grown riskier with the volatile swings in the financial markets in recent years. **********''You need a much larger capital base to stomach some of the losses these days,'' said Roger Lister, director of regional financial services at Chase Econometrics, a consulting and forecasting firm. ''The potential risks that exist now are much greater than they were before.'' **********But Arnold W. Sametz, director of the Salomon Brothers Center for the Study of Financial Institutions at New York University, discounts the need at many of the prestigious firms to become part of a bigger and more diversified operation. **********''There's no reason why they can't survive alone,'' he said. ''If you're good enough, I don't think you want to merge with anybody. **********Mr. Cohen, however, said, ''You can't differentiate anymore in our business between investment bankers and non-investment bankers; I think everybody's converging to provide a full range of services.'' **********Nevertheless, Professor Sametz said there was no evidence to date that any of the financial industry mergers that had created bigger and more diverse institutions had proved profitable beyond what they would have earned on their own, including the 1981 merger of Shearson into American Express."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/15/business/bank-of-boston-selling-building.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-11-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 189, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bank of Boston Selling Building", "print_headline": "Bank of Boston Selling Building", "body_text": " **********The Bank of Boston Corporation said it had reached an agreement to sell its 37-story headquarters for $365 million. **********Wayne Taylor, a spokesman for the bank, declined to identify the buyers of the 13-year- old building, saying only that they are two American institutional investors. **********''They will be named when the final agreement is signed,'' he said. **********Mr. Taylor said the distinctive gray skyscraper, which will keep its name as the Bank of Boston building, will be leased back to the bank and continue to serve as its headquarters.

Miesnieks, an analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, speculated that the Jacobs group might bring in the same investors that were set to team up with Mr. Steinberg. **********They included Fisher Finance and Development, a large Manhattan real estate developer interested in Disney's undeveloped property in California and Florida, and Kirk Kerkorian, majority owner of the MGM / UA Entertainment Company. He has expressed interest in Disney's movie studio and film library. **********Other Possible Purchasers **********At least four companies have also been mentioned as possible purchasers of Disney: the Anheuser-Busch Companies, the Coca-Cola Corporation, the Marriott Corporation and the McDonald's Corporation. **********The Jacobs group ''tests the resolve of the board of directors to maintain the independent status of the company,'' said R. Joseph Fuchs, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company. ''Clearly, the purchase and breakup of the company remains an attractive prospect.'' **********He noted that the company has a ''supermajority'' provision in its by- laws that requires 80 percent of the shareholders to approve a takeover if the board does not approve. The Jacobs group controls the company's biggest block of stock. Following it are the Bass Brothers of Texas, with 5.49 percent, and Roy Disney, Walt Disney's nephew, with 5.2 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/12/world/around-the-world-palau-votes-for-compact-of-association-with-us.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Palau Votes for Compact Of Association With U.S.", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Palau Votes for Compact Of Association With U.S.", "body_text": " **********Voters in the Pacific republic of Palau have approved a compact of free association with the United States. **********The results of voting Sept. 4, made public Monday, showed 4,209 votes, or 66 percent, in favor and 2,013 opposed the compact, which grants the United States authority to control military activities in return for aid. **********The islands are in the western Pacific, 1,765 miles south of Japan. **********The compact must still be accepted by a majority of the people and by both houses of the Palauan Congress. **********If the compact takes effect, the United States is expected to give Palau $500 million in the next five years, with aid reaching $1 billion over the next 15 years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/21/business/market-place-new-hopes-stir-for-rca.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Blumstein", "pub_date": "1984-03-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 753, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; New Hopes Stir for RCA", "print_headline": "Market Place; New Hopes Stir for RCA", "body_text": " **********IN the late 1920's, Wall Street called it ''Radio'' **********and the stock was the darling of the investment **********world. In more recent years, however, the RCA Corporation has brought little more than disappointment in the form of erratic earnings, paltry dividends and, naturally enough, unimpressive stock action. **********The latest blow came earlier this month, when RCA said it would seek shareholder approval for measures to make a takeover of the company more difficult. The shares took another battering, immediately plunging 1 3/4, to 30. **********Since then, the stock, which yields 2.9 percent, has moved up slightly, closing yesterday at 31, down 1/4 for the day. But some analysts are again saying that RCA may be poised for its long-awaited turnaround. And with disappointed takeover speculators having withdrawn some of their money, they say, now could be the time to buy. **********In a recent report, James I. Magid of L. F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin wrote: ''The underlying value of RCA's properties is closer to the $60 per share area, now that operations are improving and present RCA management still has a strong incentive to enhance shareholder values and the price of the stock while the sharks are busy with other prey.'' **********If the company's fortunes and stock price do not improve, the analyst added in a telephone interview, management may find ''outside help'' offering a hand, antitakeover provisions or not. **********What makes analysts somewhat sanguine is that most of RCA's units, including the previously struggling NBC and Hertz, are generating profits. In addition, Thornton F. Bradshaw, who took the helm in July 1981 as the fourth chairman in six years, seems to have brought some badly needed management stability, and has started to narrow the focus of the widely diversified company to electronics, communications and entertainment. **********If last year's results are any indication, earnings certainly seem to be headed in the right direction. Net income in 1983 was $240.8 million, or $2.10 a share, up 8.2 percent from 1982. Fourth-quarter profits were $78.4 million, or 75 cents a share, up 45.2 percent from a year earlier. The company said that NBC, though still third in the ratings, had its highest pretax earnings ever in the fourth quarter. And Hertz, taken off the auction block last August, saw its profits improve in the second half, when the car-rental industry ended all the expensive gift giveaways. **********As for its other businesses, RCA is still a leader in consumer electronics, and its television set and video cassette recorder sales have been strong, with the past year's burst of consumer spending. A serious problem in this area, however, is the company's $100 million-a-year losses from videodisks, a technology yet to catch on. Prerecorded videodisks sell for less than prerecorded video cassettes, but disks cannot be used for home-recording, and many cassettes are rented, not purchased, anyway. **********Also encouraging to analysts is RCA's growing military business. Last year, RCA won a $303 million contract to build systems for the Navy's 8th, 9th and 10th Aegis guided-missile cruisers. **********''There's no part of the company that isn't doing well at the moment,'' said J. Kendrick Noble Jr., an analyst with Paine Webber Inc. **********Analysts' forecasts for 1984 earnings range from $2.80 to $3.25 a share, a spread that might be narrowed when analysts meet with RCA's management on April 5. It will be the first formal meeting in seven years. **********One question likely to be posed is how RCA will deploy its new-found wealth. The company, in an effort to pull in its horns, has agreed to sell its C.I.T. Financial subsidiary, a large financing corporation. The Manufacturers Hanover Corporation is offering $1.5 billion. Federal Reserve Board approval is still needed. **********The antitakeover provisions, although they shook the market, do not disturb analysts to any great degree because they are not particularly restrictive. One provision calls for staggered board terms, making it hard for dissidents to get a foot in the door. But another provision seeks only to assure all shareholders the same price if the company is sold. ''That's in shareholders' best interests,'' said Mr. Magid of L. F. Rothschild. **********Charles K. Ryan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., said now is an appropriate time to buy, because the ''premium for speculation'' has been knocked out of the stock. Indeed, the shares are down from their 1984 high of 38 3/8, and the Minneapolis financier Irwin L. Jacobs has reportedly sold the major block that he held."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/15/business/rouge-contract.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 97, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rouge Contract", "print_headline": "Rouge Contract", "body_text": " **********The Rouge Steel Corporation, a unit of the Ford Motor Company, said it had awarded a contract for a continuous- slab casting plant outside Detroit to a consortium headed by the Mitsubishi International Corporation of Japan.

Watson cut her next year's profit estimate for CBS to $9.20 a share, from $9.50. The analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company said the acquisition would dilute CBS earnings. **********Last week, CBS announced another deal. It agreed to acquire for $57 million various interests in four regional pay-cable sports channels operated by the Sportschannel. Joint owners of Sportschannel are the Washington Post Company and Cablevision's Rainbow Program Enterprises. **********This caused Miss Watson to lower her 1985 earnings estimate for CBS once again, ''to a maximum of $9 a share.'' **********In the past, the analyst said, she had been ''neutral to positive'' on the outlook for the company's stock. But, in light of the twin acquisitions, she described her opinion now as ''neutral to negative,'' adding that shares of CBS next year are likely, at best, to be only an average market performer. **********CBS earned $6.31 a share in 1983. Its stock sold as low as 33 3/8 in June 1982, and then rose to a record of 87 3/4 in August this year. It closed Friday at 71 1/4, down 3 3/4 for the week. **********Miss Watson acknowledged that the company has a strong lead in prime-time TV ratings, and that its record business has shown a good recovery. But she stressed that the two acquisitions ''should have the effect of cutting down the company's earnings momentum substantially.'' She also had expressed the view that the Ziff-Davis purchase would ''preclude any near-term share repurchases, which CBS had hinted at recently.'' **********Now, the analyst added, she is not recommending any broadcast stocks because of ''difficult year-to-year earnings comparisons'' envisaged for most companies in the first six months of 1985. **********40% in Stocks, but No Oils **********Martin D. Sass is president of M. D. Sass Investors Inc., which manages $1.5 billion for clients ranging from corporate pension funds to public employee benefit funds, along with some individual accounts. His firm must be doing something right, since it had $1.1 billion under management at the start of 1984. **********Mr. Sass expects a volatile year for securities prices in 1985. Therefore, his recommended mix for a typical client portfolio calls for 45 percent in bonds with five-year maturities, 40 percent in equities and 15 percent in Treasury bills and other money market instruments. **********He was asked to select five stocks believed capable of outperforming the general market next year on a total return basis - price appreciation plus dividends. He picked Gulf and Western Industries, NI Industries (formerly Norris Industries), Bank of New York, the Lockheed Corporation and Matsushita Electric Industrial, a Japanese company whose shares also trade on the Big Board. **********As for suggested areas to avoid: ''We don't own a single domestic oil stock.'' Mr. Sass says the price of crude could drop further next spring. **********Humana's Heart Investment **********Humana Inc., a major investor-owned hospital chain, has figured prominently in the news lately. On Nov. 25, surgeons at Humana Heart Institute International in Louisville, Ky., implanted a permanent artificial heart in a human for only the second time. The recipient was 52-year-old William J. Schroeder. **********Humana's corporate headquarters are in Louisville and the company has pledged to pay for 100 such mechanical heart transplants at a potential cost of $25 million to $30 million. David A. Jones, Humana's chairman and chief executive, has said that while the company cannot hope to profit financially from the implants, it expects to benefit in other ways. ''Because our business is health,'' he said, ''it is a wise investment.'' **********Last week, Humana's stock dropped 1 point, to 23 1/2, in line with the overall retreat in equity prices. In August, the shares sold as high as 33. Wall Street analysts said that hospital management stocks have been affected by more restrictive Medicare reimbursement. **********Another Market Reversal **********The stock market hit the skids last week. One factor, according to analysts, was the Treasury Department's tax simplification plan announced Wednesday. It evidently created uncertainty. **********Elsewhere, signs of a slowing economy appeared to be equally disquieting. On Thursday, the Commerce Department said its index of leading economic indicators dropped seven-tenths of 1 percent in October, marking the third decline in the last five months. Prior to these declines, the index had increased 21 months in a row. **********Another depressant upon equity prices was the unexpectedly large jump of $6.7 billion in the nation's basic money supply for the week ended Nov. 19, announced after the close of trading Thursday. **********These developments combined to send the Dow Jones industrial average down 31.36 points, to 1,188.94.

Last January, in the United States International meet in Austin, Tex., Miss Strauss, barely 15 years old, defeated Tiffany Cohen, America's best distance freestyler, in three finals. **********Men's Swimming - Not at the same level as women's swimming, but still strong. The best are Jorg Woithe, the 1982 world champion in the 100-meter freestyle, and Dirk Richter, a potential Olympic medalist in the 100-meter freestyle and the 100-meter and 200-meter backstroke events. In the 200-meter backstroke in January's meet in Austin, Richter defeated Rick Carey of Mount Kisco, N.Y., the Olympic favorite in both backstroke races. Women's Track and Field - The East Germans are stronger now than in 1980, when they won 5 of the 14 Olympic gold medals. Their potential winners in Los Angeles, where 17 gold medals will be awarded, would have included Marlies G\"ohr in the 100- meter dash, Marita Koch in the 200- meter dash and Ilona Slupianek in the shot-put. Miss Koch has been a world record-holder since 1979, Mrs. Slupianek since 1980. Mrs. Gohr held the 100- meter record most of the time between 1977 and 1983. Men's Track and Field - Not as potent as the women's team, but a factor nevertheless. Udo Beyer is the world record-holder in the shot-put, Waldemar Cierpinski the Olympic marathon champion in 1976 and 1980, Werner Schildhauer the second fastest in the world last year at 10,000 meters and Hansjorg Kunze the second fastest in the world last year at 5,000 meters. Gymnastics - Maxi Gnauck, having recovered from elbow surgery, ranked among the Olympic favorites in the all-round, the uneven parallel bars and the vault. She has won 9 gold and 14 total medals in Olympic, world championship and World Cup competition, more than any other active female gymnast. Cycling - Uwe Raab, the 1983 world amateur champion in men's road racing, was one of three East Germans capable of winning an Olympic gold medal in that event. Lutz Hesslich, the world amateur sprint champion, would have been a major obstacle for Mark Gorski or Nelson Vails, potential medalists from the United States. Rowing - In the 1980 Olympics, East Germans won seven of the eight events for men and four of the six for women. East German women won four of the six events in last year's world championships. Jutta Kampe, one of those champions, was an Olympic favorite in single sculls. Canoeing - East Germans won 4 of the 11 gold medals in 1980 and seemed capable of doing better this time.

The British company has been in receivership since February 1982. **********British officials have complained about both the antitrust investigation and the penalties that its carriers could suffer as a result of a civil suit brought by Laker's receiver, which is continuing. **********One effect of today's decision is likely to be resumed sales by British Airways, Pan American World Airways and other carriers of low-priced tickets between most American gateway cities and London this winter. The fares, as low as $378 round trip, were the subject of a dispute between the two countries, and the British Government announced on Oct. 18 that they would not be approved. **********''This would seem to give the fares a new lease on life,'' Wallace C. Stefany, a spokesman for the Civil Aeronautics Board, said this afternoon. **********Laker, which was founded by the entrepreneur Frederick A. Laker in the late 1940's with a few war-surplus planes, was a successful charter company but came to worldwide prominence when, in September 1977, it began offering its no-frills Skytrain service between New York and London. Westbound flights then cost $:59, about $102, and eastbound flights, $135. **********Although other carriers were forced into drastic price reductions to compete, Laker thrived and expanded the service to the London-Los Angeles route as well. Mr. Laker was later knighted for successfully battling the established carriers on behalf of price-conscious passengers. **********Planned to Expand Service **********At one time Sir Freddie's line was carrying one of every five trans-Atlantic passengers and he was proposing to expand cut-fare service throughout Europe. **********Mr. Sheehan strongly suggested today that Justice Department lawyers sought to continue the investigation and that it was the State Department that inspired President Reagan to overrule them. ''If the Justice Department had thought the investigation should be closed on purely legal grounds, the question would not have gone to the President in the first place,'' Mr. Sheehan said. ''There was not complete agreement between the agencies as to which considerations were paramount - legal or foreign relations considerations.'' **********He said he could not recall the last time a President ordered an end to such an inquiry, but noted that this might have occurred without his knowledge. Mr. Sheehan also said that ''there was no quid pro quo involved'' in today's decision and that it was not tied to fare negotiations between the two countries. ''We have never discussed'' the two subjects together,'' he added. **********Part of Inquiry Was Ended **********On May 10 the department announced that it had closed part of its investigation by declaring that a group of European airlines had not engaged in anticompetitive action designed to destroy Laker. It had been charged that various carriers had put pressure on the McDonnell Douglas Corporation and the General Electric Company in 1982 not to help the line refinance its debt. **********Lufthansa German Airlines and Swissair acknowledged in July 1983, in connection with a billion-dollar antitrust suit brought by Sir Freddie, that they threatened reprisals against the equipment makers but denied that their action had contributed to Laker's collapse. **********Between May 10 and today's announcement of the end of the investigation, the grand jury was thought to be inquiring into whether Laker's competitors had colluded to cut fares in order to drive it out of business."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/30/business/advertising-seat-belt-campaign-and-law.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 517, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Seat Belt Campaign And Law", "print_headline": "Advertising; Seat Belt Campaign And Law", "body_text": " **********THE people producing advertising to educate the public about **********wearing seat belts have always been well stocked with horrifying statistics on the number of deaths among those who did not use belts.

They sort of explain themselves. **********When the agency was selected, at the suggestion of Harvey Cohen, senior deputy commissioner in the State Department of Commerce, it was supplied with a batch of statistics and told to use a love theme and incorporate Governor Cuomo's thinking on ''a sense of family of New York State.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/07/business/personal-finance-using-children-to-cut-family-taxes.html": {"writer_name": "Deborah Rankin", "pub_date": "1984-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1193, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "USING CHILDREN TO CUT FAMILY TAXES", "print_headline": "PERSONAL FINANCE; USING CHILDREN TO CUT FAMILY TAXES", "body_text": " **********BACK in the good old days (for that, read the days before the Tax Reform Act of 1984) interest-free loans from parents to children were among the most popular means of lowering family taxes. But this summer Congress dropped the ax on such loans, giving parents until Sept. 16 to wind them down - or pay the tax consequences. **********Now tax experts, looking for new ways to help clients cut taxes by transferring income to children, are dusting off their files on Clifford trusts, and starting new ones on spousal remainder trusts. The two types of trusts have traditionally appealed to people with six-digit incomes who transfer $100,000 or $200,000 at a shot, but now they have grown attractive to those in less lofty circumstances as well. Indeed, the two trusts are ''filling the vacuum left by the demise of interest-free loans,'' said Kim Oster, a senior staff attorney with Ayco-American Express, financial consultants. **********The Clifford trust is the more common of the two arrangements. It lets parents place cash, high- yielding stocks or other assets in trust for a child for a minimum period of 10 years and a day. During that time, all the income produced by the assets goes to the child, and is taxed at the child's tax rate. At the end of the period, the property in the trust returns to the donor. **********For those in the 50 percent bracket, Mr. Oster points out, the tax savings can be quite hefty. For example, say $50,000 was put into a Clifford trust, and the trust earns 10 percent a year. That would produce annual income of $5,000. If the child has no other income, he or she would only pay about $500 in taxes, leaving a net income of $4,500. If the the money was invested in the adult's name, the tax bite would be half the income, leaving only $2,500. **********The seeming bonanza is not without pitfalls. If a substantial amount of assets is put into a Clifford trust, the donor will become subject to a gift tax on at least part of the transfer. According to the Unified Gift and Estate Tax Credit provisions of the tax laws, a large trust will likely reduce the amount of the estate that can be passed on to heirs on a tax- free basis. **********The amounts qualifying for gift tax exemption have not changed, but the Internal Revenue Service's method of valuing the income stream produced by trusts has changed, indeed. Single parents can still give up to $10,000 a year per recipient without running into a gift tax, and married couples can give joint gifts of as much as $20,000 per recipient without gift tax problems. **********Until last year, the I.R.S. assumed a 6 percent annual interest income on trusts. That meant that a married couple, for example, could put as much as $45,000 in a 10-year trust before worrying that the accrued interest would trigger the gift tax. Now the tax agency has upped its assumption of interest income to 10 percent. Thus, a married couple can only put about $32,500 into a Clifford trust before gift-tax headaches begin. **********And donors should not forget that with a Clifford trust, the property must be transferred for at least a decade. For many parents, that is too long a period - especially if their child is a high school senior who only needs the trust income to get through college. **********IF those drawbacks are a problem, the spousal remainder trust may be a better bet. The tax code **********does not insist on a 10-year-plus term for a trust if the property does not revert back to the parent who set it up in the first place. And the gift tax on spousal remainder trusts can be quite low. **********To set up a spousal remainder trust, one member of a parental couple sets up a trust fund for the child for whatever period of time he or she chooses. Interest earned by the trust, however invested, goes to the child. When the designated period - typically, four or five years - ends, the property goes to the other spouse. **********Technically, therefore, a spousal remainder trust involves two gifts: one to the child, of the trust's income interest (arrived at by assuming a 10 percent return on the trust) and another to the spouse, of the principal remaining after the income interest is subtracted. Only the income interest to the child is subject to a gift tax, since the so-called unlimited marital deduction permits spouses to make unlimited transfers of funds to each other without gift tax consequences. **********Spousal remainder trusts have really taken off of late. ''Theoretically, spousal remainder trusts have been around a long time, but in practice they were not being used extensively because they had been overshadowed by the interest-free loan,'' said David K. Carlson, a tax partner with accountants Arthur Andersen & Company. **********But these trusts, too, have their drawbacks. Remember that the transfer of the trust's assets to a spouse at the end of the trust period is irrevocable. That can turn into a thorny problem if there is a divorce in the interim. In that case, warned Francis J. Grey, a tax partner with Coopers & Lybrand, ''you may find you have made an unintended alimony settlement.'' **********It is not cheap to set up either a Clifford or spousal remainder trust. Indeed, if parents are planning to put just a small amount - say, less than $10,000 - in the trust, it may not be worth the trouble. Attorneys charge an average of $400 to draft the trust agreement. And parents will have to file fiduciary tax returns with the I.R.S. for each year that the trust is in existence, which can lead to extra accountant's fees. **********Still, tax experts say that, in most cases, the tax benefits provided by the trusts outweigh the administrative drawbacks. In fact, many say that it even makes sense to borrow money to fund a trust. Parents can always deduct the borrowing costs from their taxes, leaving, in effect, a cheap source of money to invest in a fund whose income will be taxed at the child's low tax rate. **********In fact, the funds need not only be used for children. Many accountants recommend their use for supporting aged parents. ''If you're spending $10,000 a year to support your widowed mother, you can either pay the nursing home bills out of after- tax dollars or set up a trust,'' said Mr. Carlson of Arthur Andersen. **********In some ways the trusts sound too good to be true - and there is always a chance that Congress will decide that they are. Spousal remainder trusts represent ''a loophole that really isn't intended,'' said Deborah Walker, a senior tax manager with Peat Marwick Mitchell & Co. ''As soon as it's used extensively, there will probably be legislation.'' **********Moreover, Miss Walker has picked up signals that the I.R.S. may ask Congress to give Clifford trusts some closer legislative scrutiny, too. ''There is an undercurrent within the service these days,'' she warned. ''They just don't like Clifford trusts.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/22/business/hershey-bites-off-new-markets.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 3156, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HERSHEY BITES OFF NEW MARKETS", "print_headline": "HERSHEY BITES OFF NEW MARKETS", "body_text": " **********HERSHEY, PA. **********There's no mistaking that this **********is Chocolate Town, U.S.A. Street **********lamps on Chocolate Avenue, the main thoroughfare, are shaped like Hershey Kisses. At the Hotel Hershey or the Hershey Lodge, guests are handed a room key and a Hershey bar, and each evening, two Hershey Kisses are left on night stands. Then, of course, there's the smell. The unmistakable, overpowering aroma of chocolate is just about everywhere. **********No wonder. The Hershey Foods Corporation is king here. Hershey bars built the town and Hershey bars still spark its economy. ''Sometimes,'' one long-time resident noted, ''you have to wonder if the streets are paved with chocolate. I have the suspicion that some of the people are made of chocolate.'' **********There seems to be an other-worldly calm about Chocolate Town. But the outer peace belies considerable shifts in emphasis at the candy empire spawned by Milton S. Hershey nearly a century ago. A key spur of growth for Hershey these days is its Friendly Ice Cream parlors. Hershey is into pasta, too; in fact, only C.F. Mueller makes more macaroni than Hershey. And candy tastes have shifted.  Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, not the famous Hershey bars, are now the company's best seller, and new sweets containing wafers and granola are mounting their own challenge. The most disquieting change of all for this town, though, is the fact that Hershey isn't even king of candy land anymore. Mars, the other superpower of candy bars, sells more candy than Hershey. **********The people who run Hershey today think differently than Milton Hershey did. Richard Zimmerman, the president and chief executive, says his ambition is to help Hershey ''to become a major diversified food concern.'' He gets edgy when he thinks about all those vats of chocolate that Hershey is processing at its candy factory down the street from headquarters. Chocolate, after all, comes from cocoa beans - and their price is about as predictable as the weather. **********''It's also all of your eggs in one basket,'' says Mr. Zimmerman. ''I know of nothing that is a health problem in chocolate, despite all sorts of claims. But suppose there would be a threat to the business. We know of no threat, but we're going to diversify.'' **********Not that Hershey has had its fill of the dark brown stuff that made it famous. Hershey has concocted a blizzard of new bars - though with less chocolate than the old candy - at the same time that it has discovered surprising vitality in some of its warhorses. Hershey Kisses, which have been around since 1907, are selling better now than they have in decades. **********From early on, Milton Hershey wanted to make candy. He just couldn't seem to make a go of it. His education ended at fourth grade. As a teenager, he worked as an apprentice to a confectioner in Lancaster, Pa., near here. When he was 19, he set out on his own to make penny candy in Philadelphia. He went bust. He failed in Chicago making caramels. He failed in New York. But he had spunk. He gave it another whirl and finally had some success back in Lancaster, where he started the Lancaster Caramel Company, which, by 1894, boasted the world's largest caramel factory. **********When he went to the World's Exposition in Chicago in 1893, however, he got a peek at some chocolate-making equipment. A light bulb went on. At that time, only the rich enjoyed chocolate and it was Mr. Hershey's conviction that the country was ready for a cheap candy bar. He thought caramels were just a fad, but chocolate, because of its rich taste, had to be big. In 1894, he turned out the first Hershey bar, which was made of solid chocolate and sold for a nickel. **********In 1904, he built a factory in the middle of cornfields in Derry Church, Pa., now called Hershey, not far from where he was born. Today the plant remains the world's biggest chocolate factory. **********Milton Hershey built more than a company. He built an odd little town. Nestled in the lush dairy country of central Pennsylvania, about 15 miles from Harrisburg, the town owes virtually everything in it to one man. **********Mr. Hershey used to liken the company, the town and its 10,000 inhabitants to a large farm, with him as the owner. If residents wanted something - like a bank - they asked him and he built it. Among other things, he started two hotels - Hotel Hershey and the Hershey Lodge - an airport, a sports arena, a half-dozen golf courses, an amusement park, a zoo, a huge public garden, a monorail and a professional hockey team, the Hershey Bears, which locals often call the Hershey Bars. **********Hershey's corporate headquarters today are contained in Highpoint, a stately mansion built in 1908 as the residence of Milton and Catherine Hershey. It overlooks the Hershey Country Club and perches close enough to some of the holes that an errant ball could, without too much difficulty, find itself on a corporate officer's desk. At headquarters, and at the nearby chocolate factory, there are bowls of candy that employees are free to - and do - gobble up; the one rule is that goodies must be eaten on the premises. People seem to enjoy working at Hershey. All the corporate officers, when they're in town, gather for lunch at a big round table in Highpoint's dining room, passing the time regaling each other with stories and cracking jokes. **********In 1973, the price of cocoa beans skyrocketed and changed life in Hershey. Earnings fell 30 percent. Another sharp run-up in prices jolted the company in 1976 and 1977. By 1976, a grand strategic plan was fashioned. Diversification was the message. **********Hershey was already in the pasta business, but began to add companies to its stake. Now it makes the San Giorgio, Delmonico, Procino-Rossi and Skinner brands. Its big plunge was its purchase of the Friendly Ice Cream Corporation in 1979 for $164 million. Since then, Hershey has encouraged Friendly, a chain of family restaurants started in 1935 by two brothers, to expand from its Northeast and Middle West settings. Next year, for example, it plans to move into Florida. It has been adding 40 or 50 restaurants a year to the network, which now totals 680 restaurants. **********''We have tried to strengthen the conviction of what we want Friendly to be,'' Mr. Zimmerman said. ''Friendly has something special: the fourth meal. Everyone else has breakfast, lunch and dinner. We have the snack portion. We do a lot of business after eight o'clock at night, and it's not hamburgers, it's ice cream.'' Indeed, its ice cream and dessert menu is a thing unto itself, with numerous choices tailored to America's sweet tooth. Hershey has also dished up sundaes for Friendly containing Hershey offerings. And Friendly restaurants now offer Hershey candies - and only Hershey candies - at checkout counters. **********Candy is still about 68 percent of Hershey's sales and 80 percent of profits. Friendly accounts for 22 percent of sales and 18 percent of profits. Ten percent of sales - and 2 percent of profits - come from pasta and other ventures such as its troubled Cory Food Services, which leases and services coffee brewers to businesses, and has been muddling along in the last few years. **********Mr. Zimmerman wants to add more - he thinks Hershey can sell anything you might find in a food store - but he doesn't see chocolate falling below 50 percent of sales. **********Indeed, despite operating in a world that has an aging population with fewer sweet teeth, Hershey is finding surprising life in candy. In number of bars sold, candy is growing only 1 or 2 percent a year, and consumption is down from the good- eating days. In the late 1960's, candy consumption in the United States hit a peak of 20 pounds a year per person. Factors such as price rises (the nickel candy bar went by the boards in 1969), a dearth of new products and an awakened concern for bulging waistlines combined to cause consumption to diminish to about 16 pounds in 1982. Since then, it has crept up to 16.7 pounds. **********''As people get older, they tend to eat less candy,'' said Jay Carr, Hershey Chocolate's marketing director. ''That has had a dampening effect on the candy business. But there's another baby-boom spiral.'' **********The company, he added, has not ignored the aging population. It has heavily promoted its Hershey Kisses, to adults, for example, and has introduced what it calls ''premium bars,'' which he describes as ''a bigger piece of chocolate, designed to appeal to the high-income portion of the market.'' **********Moreover, Hershey thinks Americans are bound to eat more chocolate. ''Our per-capita consumption of chocolate is only about half of what it is in England and Western Europe, so we think there is considerable opportunity for growth,'' remarks Earl Spangler, president of the Hershey Chocolate Company. **********Nobody at Hershey Chocolate has forgotten that Mars powered past Hershey in the late 1960's. It is painfully clear to Hershey people that 6 of the 10 top-selling candy bars are made by Mars; Hershey makes the other four. According to tabulations of the DEBS Report, a trade survey, the two biggest sellers are Mars products: Snickers and M & M Peanut Chocolate-Covered Candies. Third is Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, a business Hershey acquired from the Reese family in 1963. Hershey also holds down fifth wih Kit Kat, seventh with the Hershey Almond bar and tenth with the trusty Hershey bar. **********To battle Mars, Hershey has been regularly adding new sweets, chiefly chocolate-enrobed products such as nuts or wafers coated with chocolate. They cost less to make and their lighter, more diverse taste seems to have greater appeal to consumers.  Hershey has rolled out Skor, a butter-toffee bar that is directed at the adult population; New Trail, a granola bar for the health-conscious snack lover; Take Five, a wafer bar also positioned at adult munchers, and Reese's Pieces Peanut, a sibling to Reese's Pieces, which boomed after their part in the movie ''E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial.'' Last year, Hershey made a promising entry into the packaged beverage market with premixed chocolate milk. **********In the last five years, new products have surged from 7 percent of the chocolate company's sales to nearly 20 percent. Jerry Prescott, publisher of the DEBS Report, says that Skor is already in 23d place among candy bars, and that Take Five, in less than a year of regional sales, is doing well. Hershey's one notable flop was a cake-mix topping called Frostin' that was dumped last year. Also, Whatchamacallit, a chocolate-coated rice bar introduced five years ago, has been losing its momentum. **********Still, Mr. Zimmerman expects to beat last year's record results of $100.1 million in income and $1.7 billion in sales, but he does not say by how much. **********And Wall Street has responded favorably to the company's move away from chocolate and into new markets. Hershey stock, which traded as low as $8.625 in 1979, now trades around $34 on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Hershey, at least, is feeling better than it did in 1976, when, in candy sales through foodstores, it lagged a whopping 14 market share points behind Mars. Now the gap is smaller - Mars, for example, holds about 39 percent of the total candy bar market, ahead of Hershey's 35 percent - and Hershey people talk of someday overtaking their foe. **********One of the reasons Mars steamrolled over Hershey had to do with advertising. In its latest foray, Mars is spending millions touting Snickers and M & M's as the official snack foods of the Olympic Games. Hershey, by contrast, never ran an ad in its first 66 years. It didn't even have a marketing department until 1967. Milton Hershey didn't believe in ads; he felt it was enough to deliver quality. Moreover, the huge chocolate factory in Hershey was open to visitors and some 10 million people a year wandered through it. (The plant tour was stopped in 1973, when Hershey built Chocolate World for tourists.) **********In 1970, Hershey saw how successful Mars had become and started advertising. In the last few years, ad dollars have started to flow. Only in 1980, for instance, did Hershey start advertising Kisses, which two years ago rose to become Hershey's second- biggest seller. **********''Hershey has increased its marketing and advertising pretty significantly recently,'' said Len Teitelbaum, an analyst who follows Hershey at Merrill Lynch. ''They realize that they have to play the game and get their name before the public.'' **********Ads matter because a precept in the candy world is that there is no brand loyalty. Hershey people like to point out that candy is not like cigarettes. Few people will walk a mile for a Milky Way if there's a Mr. Goodbar down the block. So what Hershey hopes for is to get its candies onto what it calls a consumer's ''menu,'' a roster of 10 or 12 candies that the person likes enough to buy. ''All the things on the menu are acceptable to you,'' Mr. Zimmerman explained. ''But when it comes time to buy, it's who reinforced you last and most effectively that you're going to buy.'' **********A lot of things are peculiar about Hershey. What other major company, for example, has an orphanage as its major shareholder? Milton and Catherine Hershey were unable to have children, so in 1909 Mr. Hershey founded the Milton Hershey School for orphan boys. (Girls have since been admitted). In 1918, he donated the entire business to the school. The company sold about 20 percent of its stock to the public in 1927, but the orphanage, through the Hershey Trust, still owns 50.1 percent of the corporation. Dividends from Hershey stock are its biggest source of income. **********It is often thought that everything in Hershey belongs to Hershey Foods. Hardly. When Hershey went public, Mr. Hershey thought investors might chuckle at a company that owned things like a zoo and a hockey team. So he set up a separate company, the Hershey Entertainment and Resort Company (known here as Herco), which owns the amusement park, the  hotels and the hockey team, among other properties; it used to even run the local water, power and phone companies. Herco is owned entirely by the Hershey Trust but has no legal ties to Hershey Foods. **********One might wonder about having an orphanage control as much clout as it does at Hershey. As a Hershey officer admitted, ''That place is sitting there with the power to remove all the directors of this company if it wanted to. It could do whatever it wants.'' **********But the orphanage has never wanted to do much of anything other than to collect its quarterly checks and educate children. It has never traded its stock. It helps, no doubt, that Hershey's chairman and president sit on the trust's board. And so Hershey Foods people tend to look on the school not as some sleeping demon but as a gentle giant. **********''The fact that we are mostly owned by an orphanage has an effect on the undertones of this place,'' said Kenneth Wolfe, Hershey's chief financial officer. ''It sort of gives you a warm feeling. I don't think of it in terms of sheer economic power. I think of it as sort of nice. When I drive to work, I drive through the school and I see the kids out on the football field and running about and I like it.'' **********One should not think, however, that the Hershey School, given its connections, believes that it owes its graduates more than a good education. Hershey Foods prefers not to hire the school's graduates: That, it reasons, would give them the impression that life is too easy. **********But that is not to say that an orphan could not somehow make it big at the chocolate factory. William Dearden was born in Philadelphia in 1923. His mother died when he was 12. For the next nine months, his father tried to take care of him, but it was during the Depression and he was unable to find work. In 1935, the elder Mr. Dearden sent his son to the Milton Hershey School. Among other things, he hoed corn, milked cows, cleaned manure pits and made hay. **********After a stint in the military and a job with Dun & Bradstreet, in 1953, he was asked by the school if he wanted to join its staff as director of student placement. Whether to return to Hershey or not was an easy decision to make. ''I always felt I had a debt I wanted to repay here,'' he said. **********A few years later, he joined the chocolate company. He did well. In 1976 he became vice chairman and chief executive officer. Now he is chairman. He has risen to the top of the chocolate world. Milton Hershey couldn't have planned it better. **********IN THE LABS, THEYTINKER WITH TASTE **********In the fickle world of candy, it's never enough to keep the taste of a candy bar as good as ever. The trick is to make it better. So Hershey invests a considerable amount of money and energy in finding ways to make Kit Kat or Mr. Goodbar even tastier. **********For the last five years, the company has owned an experimental cocoa plantation in the Central American nation of Belize. It does not expect the crop from its Hummingbird Farm to pose any threat to cocoa growers. Rather, it is searching for ways to improve the yields and quality of cocoa trees. Hershey, for example, is examining what effect different fertilizers have on chocolate's flavor. **********The company also has a technical center in Hershey, Pa., where it conducts research and development and has members of its taste panel munch products and assess the taste. It is important to Hershey that its products retain their flavor on grocery shelves for at least six months, so bars are tried at various intervals to see how they stand up. **********The company is immersed in a wide array of basic research. It does a substantial amount of research with animals - especially rats - to find out how chocolate, once ingested, is broken down by the body. And a few years ago, Hershey developed a high-protein macaroni for the Federal school-lunch program. **********Ten years ago, Hershey began a program to determine what the basic chocolate flavor is. Figuring out the key components could help Hershey tinker with fermentation and roasting processes, which are key to producing a good chocolate flavor. A decade might seem like a long enough time to come up with that answer, but it has proved to be quite complex. Researchers have already identified some 400 chemical components of chocolate flavor, and they reckon that there may be as many as 2,000 of them.

Another group of analysts, however, predict the Fed will keep policy unchanged until it has a clearer picture of the economy's health. **********Since the Fed began fostering lower interest rates in September and reduced the discount rate on Nov. 21 to 8 1/2 percent, from 9 percent, there has been evidence of stronger growth in the economy and the nation's money supply. **********But the statistics - especially those for November, when the presence of three holidays in four weeks may have distorted money supply and retail sales data - have been ambiguous. As a result, economists disagree about the need for an immediate move by the Fed to provide more economic stimulus in the form of lower interest rates. **********Henry Kaufman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Inc., said the ''mixed and uncertain signals'' from the economy ''will probably cause the Federal Reserve to err on the side of further accommodation.'' **********Risk of Political Fallout **********In the latest issue of Comments on Credit, Mr. Kaufman added that if the central bank does not succeed in stimulating faster economic growth, there is ''the risk of an unwanted political fallout that might ultimately compromise the Fed's independence.'' **********Ross M. Starr, a professor of economics at the University of California at San Diego, said, ''the Fed will be cautious about adapting a more expansionary policy'' and will not immediately push for lower interest rates. **********''There is no particular danger to the economy if the Fed waits another six weeks or so before loosening policy,'' he said. **********Analysts at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company concluded in the latest issue of Credit Market Comment that the Fed would hold policy unchanged at tomorrow's meeting. Although recent economic data point toward less-than-satisfactory growth, they said, ''recession fears have diminished.'' Money supply growth has also increased, they said, in contrast to the June-through-October period when the basic money supply measure declined slightly. **********Slide in Short-Term Rates **********In the marketplace meanwhile, a recent drop in short-term rates is a sign that traders have already anticipated a more generous monetary policy. Three-month Treasury bills, for example, were bid at 8.15 percent last Friday, down from 8.38 percent Dec. 10 and 8.52 percent Dec. 3. **********Much of the decline in bill rates was in sympathy with a decline in the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market to less than 8 1/2 percent on Thursday and Friday - a drop that some analysts said was proof of an easier Fed policy, while others saw a temporary aberration. **********In the long-term Treasury bond market, where prices are less affected by the overnight Federal funds rate, 30-year-bond yields have been relatively stable at around 11.60 percent. Government securities dealers said the chance of an easier monetary policy has been offset by the absence of strong investor demand. **********Fed May Change Its Reasons **********If the Fed officials who sit on the Open Market Committee decide to promote lower interest rates, the reasons could be different than those mentioned by the central bank on Nov. 21, when it announced a cut in the discount rate to 8 1/2 percent, from 9 percent. At that time the Fed cited sluggish growth of the nation's money supply, slower economic activity, stable inflation and the strength of the dollar in the foreign exchange markets. **********Concern about the economy may be allayed by data such as the strong 1.8 percent rise in retail sales for November, strong car sales in the first 10 days of December and a healthy gain of 303,000 workers on nonfarm payrolls during November. But according to some analysts, the outlook for low inflation and the need for a decline in the value of the dollar are powerful reasons why the Fed can lower interest rates so long as the economy is not booming. **********''If the economic statistics permit it, the Fed will undoubtedly keep easing policy,'' said Samuel Thorne, senior vice president at Scudder, Stevens & Clark, an investment management concern. A drop in interest rates could help reduce the value of the dollar in foreign exchange markets - ''a development that would be to everybody's benefit and would improve the outlook for the world economy,'' he said. **********Downward pressure on oil prices is a good sign, Mr. Thorne said, that ''the pendulum has swung so far away from inflation that a move to lower interest rates would not be inflationary.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/01/world/around-the-world-hundreds-of-afghans-reported-killed-in-month.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 143, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hundreds of Afghans Reported Killed in Month", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Hundreds of Afghans Reported Killed in Month", "body_text": " **********Western diplomats said today that Soviet- led forces in Afghanistan killed hundreds of civilians this month in bombing raids on villages north of Kabul, the capital. **********The reports could not be independently confirmed. **********Diplomats said the attacks on Afghanistan's Shomali Valley began on Jan. 19 and lasted through Friday, the same day that Afghan MIG's reportedly killed 42 people in a raid on the village of Angur Adda, in northwestern Pakistan. **********''Heavy bombing and shelling of villages with some ground action by Soviet and Afghan regime troops'' focused on the village of Ghaza, north of Kabul, one diplomat said. **********''According to multiple sources, civilian deaths have run in the hundreds,'' another diplomat said.

First they passed the drive-in window. It was closed. Then they tried the night depository box. A sign read ''Out of Order.'' **********Finally they walked into the Niggle Cafe across the street. ''It was jammed in there with people,'' Mr. Agrimson said. ''The fish was gone. The chicken was gone. The story was going around that savings accounts were O.K. but checking accounts were gone.'' **********A month has done little to dissipate the rumors - and the sense of confusion and betrayal - that have swept this town of 1,478 people in southeastern Minnesota. **********First National, with $20 million in deposits, was the 24th bank of 35 that have failed this year. In all of last year, 48 banks across the country were declared insolvent. The failure rate this year is rising, and many of the banks are as small as First National, in towns as small as Rushford. **********Banking analysts say the rate is not alarming as long as most of the failed banks are small. Large bank failures may shake confidence in the banking system or affect international loans, and so Government agencies step in. Nonetheless, a small bank failure may be devastating to a small town. **********In small towns like Rushford, bankers and customers are also neighbors and friends. Loan officers may allow farmers busy with the spring planting a few days' grace on their payments. But the very intimacy that makes small- town banking so personal may leave it open to abuses. Bankers who bend the rules for their customers may also bend the rules for themselves. **********People wonder which farmers will lose their land because they were lent more than they can repay. And they wonder why the Government chooses to help large banks in trouble, such as the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company in Chicago, and not to rescue their small bank. They also wonder whether to believe published reports attributing the bank's failure to fraudulent loans, dummy corporations and profiteering by bank officers. **********Failure Brings Distrust and Fear **********In Rushford, where no one locks his door, where people grew up together and go to church together, where a bank president receives almost as much respect as the local pastor, the bank failure has injected a new element of distrust, even of fear. **********Because the First National Bank was acquired by another Minnesota bank, none of its customers lost any of their deposits - including their checking accounts. Nevertheless, residents fear farm and business foreclosures, depressed land prices and tighter local credit. **********Some who are behind in loan payments have already seen their assets frozen, and others also behind have received form letters telling them they must pay up or face foreclosure within the month. And there is talk of improprieties. **********These notices come from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which steps in when a bank fails. The F.D.I.C. insures deposits in member banks up to $100,000. After a bank collapses, the agency usually arranges to sell it to another bank. **********It replaces the bank's problem assets with cash and usually holds on to the failed bank's commercial and real estate loans. The purchasing bank has 30 days to decide whether to buy back any of these loans. To recover the money it gives out, the F.D.I.C. is charged by law to collect on any leftover loans. **********'We Should Have Been Closed Down' **********Beverly and Darrel Olson have raised hogs for five years on a farm purchased with a large loan from First National. But the recession and low market prices for pork have hurt the Olsons, and Mrs. Olson worries that they will lose their farm. **********''I try not to think about it,'' she said. ''We're in a desperate situation. We should have been closed down for our own good a long time ago.'' Mrs. Olson said she had often urged her husband to sell out, but the bank kept offering credit extensions. **********Why are banks like the one in Rushford collapsing at an increasing rate? Federal bank officials and analysts attribute the failures to the continuing effects of the 1981-82 recession, as well as bank deregulation. Increasing competitive pressures have also induced bankers to to take more risks, said David C. Cates, president of Cates Consulting Analysts Inc., a New York City firm that analyzes bank performance. **********''I'm convinced the rising tide of bank failures can be explained in terms of the rising level of risk,'' he said. ''The classic banker of 30 years ago avoided risk. A banker of today welcomes risk, and some of them don't know where to stop.'' **********Federal officials and bank analysts agreed that the most common reason that banks failed was poor - and occasionally fraudulent - management of these risks. **********Officials from the F.D.I.C., the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are examining the causes of the Rushford bank failure and would not comment on the inquiry. **********But bank records, a Federal bank examiner's report and interviews with townspeople and a former bank official indicate that the Rushford bank, already hurt by the continuing agricultural recession, was also a victim of bad lending practices and insider abuses. **********2d Bank in Town Remains Healthy **********Rushford also has another bank - the Rushford State Bank - which stayed healthy despite the recession because of a more conservative loan policy, according to its executive vice president, Ted Roberton Jr. **********The trouble in Rushford began with the climb in inflation. For many years the value of farm land here soared. Using their land as collateral, farmers borrowed to expand their operations, encouraged by farm journals that urged them to borrow money and repay in cheaper dollars. **********Then came the 1981-82 recession. Costs skyrocketed and crop prices stayed low. Thousands of farmers throughout the Middle West who could not meet their payments lost their farms. **********In Rushford, some farms went under, along with agricultural cooperatives and a machinery dealer. And when First National tried to recover some loans, it found that the land held as collateral was worth far less than it had thought. **********Bank mismanagement compounded these loan losses, according to James Cady, a former bank director, and a Federal bank examiner's report published in The Minneapolis Tribune. **********Bank officers lent money to businesses in which they were silent partners, made real estate loans for deals in which they received commmissions, exceeded the bank's lending limits, inflated their appraisals of collateral and failed to recover overdue loans, Mr. Cady and the report said. **********Town Is Split Over Accusations **********The accusations have divided the town into two camps: One that believes the bank officers were venal, and one that argues they were just trying to help neighbors suffering from hard times. **********The bank's former president, Morris Anderson, and its loan officer, Albert Spande, refused to comment on the allegations. No charges have been brought against them. Mr. Anderson resigned in September during a Federal examination of the bank; Mr. Spande resigned a month later.  Mr. Cady, who became the bank's primary stockholder, said he believed he would lose the fish farm he owns with his son, Bruce, as well as about $1.5 million in cash because they put their assets up as collateral for additional financing in an effort to save the bank. **********Federally chartered banks are examined at least once a year by the Comptroller of the Currency, but insider or risky loans can be hidden if bank officers camouflage their own interest or inflate the value of the collateral put up. **********The Federal report published in The Minneapolis Tribune, details of which Mr. Cady confirmed in an interview, charged that Rushford bank officers did just that. The report said examiners had uncovered several violations of banking regulations or Federal law, including these: **********- Twelve unapproved extensions of credit of more than $25,000 to the HAW Company, a real estate partnership that included Mr. Anderson. **********- A $50,000 loan authorized by Mr. Spande to a ranch he partly owned. The loan was repaid during the examination. **********- Failure to disclose loans to bank officers from First National's corresponding banks, including a $130,000 loan to Mr. Anderson from the Winona National Savings Bank for use by a mobile home park he partly owned. **********Discrepancies Seen In Collateral Report **********Bruce Cady said that when bank examiners checked collateral behind loans, they often found discrepancies. ''One house was listed as a lakeshore home,'' he said. ''But when we went to look at it, it should have been condemned 10 years ago, and it was only lakeshore if you climbed on top of a TV tower and looked.'' **********James Cady said he believed that 70 to 80 percent of the bad loans were insider loans, while 10 to 20 percent were uncollectible because of the continuing agricultural recession. **********More than half of First National's loans are agricultural - $8.5 million out of a total loan portfolio of $16.4 million in May, said R. Scott Jones, president of the Goodhue County National Bank of Red Wing, which acquired the First National Bank last month. The balance are commercial, real estate and individual loans. **********Bank customers said they had long suspected that the bank's lending practices were lenient. **********Edward McManimon, whose family has operated the same hog and dairy farm for more than a century, banked with First National because it had been the only bank to lend his father money during the Depression. He is one of the largest depositors. **********''They were giving out loans to people we knew weren't able to pay them back,'' he said. ''We often marveled why the people giving out the money wouldn't know that if we did.'' **********Equity Capital Steadily Declined **********On May 4, when the bank was closed, it had written off at least $4.2 million of the $16.4 million in loans, and an additional $3.5 million was rated substandard, Mr. Cady said. As loan losses mounted, the bank's equity capital declined - from $1.9 million in 1982, to $802,000 in 1983 and to $244,000 at the end of March 1984. The bank finally was closed when it could not cover its loan losses. **********The bank's precarious finances were evident in a 1983 performance report compiled by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, which analyzes bank reports to the F.D.I.C. **********Of the bank's total of $17.6 million in loans at the end of 1983, 5.9 percent were classified as losses. Other banks of comparable size lost less than 1 percent of their loans. In addition, 9.75 percent of the bank's loans were classified as ''nonperforming'' - 90 days past due, not accruing interest or renegotiated. Comparable banks had an average of 2.4 percent. **********Federal bank examiners ask banks to maintain a capital to assets ratio of between 5 percent and 6 percent. Rushford's was a healthy 9.1 percent in 1982, but as examiners found more bad loans, the ratio dropped to 1 percent in March 1984. **********The Rushford bank was particularly vulnerable to loan losses because so much of its assets were in loans - 74.9 percent, compared with a national average of 48 percent for small rural banks. Its other assets included securities, bankers' acceptances, real estate holdings, and overnight loans from banks. **********Questionable Loans Found by Examiners **********For a long time, Rushford bank customers and even some of its officers believed the bank was in good condition. The first hint of trouble came in June 1983, when Mr. Cady said a Federal bank examination turned up questionable loans. **********Bank officers were called to Minneapolis, where they signed an agreement promising to tighten loan policies and infuse capital into the bank from whatever source they could find. **********In July Federal examiners arrived in Rushford. By mid-August, Mr. Cady said, they told him they had uncovered widespread violations of banking regulations and that the bank was in serious trouble. **********Shortly afterward, Mr. Cady said, Mr. Anderson, who bought the bank 10 years earlier from the daughter of the man who ran it for 30 years, was called into a meeting with Federal bank examiners and then resigned. A month later, Mr. Cady said, a bank examiner told him to ask for Mr. Spande's resignation. In the next few months, as rumors spread, Mr. Cady and a new management team tried to prevent a run. Mr. Cady called on large depositors like Mr. McManimon, the hog and dairy farmer, who said he had threatened to pull out all his money unless he was told what was happening. **********Meanwhile, the bank began to collect many of its loans. It took over about 15 tracts of land and held machinery and real estate auctions, Mr. Cady said. The efforts created some bad feelings around town, but they did not bring in enough money to offset the outflow of capital. **********On May 3, the day before the bank was closed, F.D.I.C. officials called Mr. Jones of the Goodhue County bank, which then had $70 million in assets, and asked him if he wanted to bid on a bank in trouble. Mr. Jones worked through the night and came up with a price of $1.05 million. **********The F.D.I.C. provided more than $15 million to cover the bank's deposits and balance its books. **********Efforts Are Made To Assure Customers **********On Saturday morning, May 5, in a bank filled with more than 40 F.D.I.C. staff members and bank employees, Mr. Jones began taking steps to reassure the bank's shocked customers and to tell them that he, too, believed in personal, small-town banking. Over the weekend bank officers traveled door to door, handing out a letter assuring customers that the bank was now in safe hands. **********By Monday morning, the bank was set to open, with coffee, cookies and flowers in the lobby, and, Mr. Jones recalled ''some anxious moments.'' About 600 people crowded into the bank that day, asking questions. By closing time, only two depositors had withdrawn their money, he said. **********But the rescue of the deposits was no balm for the pain the bank's collapse caused here. Townspeople who relied on the local bankers' understanding of the vicissitudes of farming now say they have to justify their late loan payments to outsiders. And the failure has left a legacy of suspicion, both of the government and of the town's own bankers. **********Farmers and businessmen who owe money are waiting to hear which loans Mr. Jones's bank will buy from the F.D.I.C. Mr. Jones said he had mailed letters to buy $6 million of the $16.4 million in loans, and was considering buying more. **********Mr. Roberton of the Rushford State Bank foresees additional hardships as these loans come due. **********''Some of the situations are people who are overextended, but given enough time could be salvaged,'' he said. ''It appears that they may not get the time. There are going to be some real personal tragedies. '' **********'There'll Be Some Liquidations' **********Craig Rice, who heads the F.D.I.C.  team in Rushford, said the agency would give some borrowers as long as as 18 months to repay. But he said, ''There'll be some liquidations.'' **********Some residents criticize the F.D.I.C. as impersonal and bureaucratic, careless of the trauma the bank failure has created. **********James Hoiness owns the IGA Foodliner, the local grocery store. His six- month loan was due in April and was supposed to be extended, but was overlooked in the chaotic days before the bank was closed. He returned from a trip to find his personal assets frozen, although he said his payments were current. **********Rumors flew concerning his financial condition, he said. Clerks in his store asked if they should report for work the next day. He cleared up the misunderstanding, and the Goodhue County bank accepted the loans, he said, but he is angry at the F.D.I.C. **********''I don't think they should treat all customers of the bank as if the bank failure is their fault,'' he said. **********Mr. Rice defended the practice as routine and said he unfroze assets of many customers who visited the office. **********Many Rushford residents are asking why the same F.D.I.C. that may foreclose on their property helped save the Continental Illinois bank in Chicago. **********''Why should the stockholders and depositors of Continental Illinois be spared this pain, and small banks and small communities have to go through this?'' Mr. Cady asked. **********Townspeople also expressed disappointment in their community leaders. **********Clifford Heiden and his son, Kerry, own a hog farm. The other day they sat around their kitchen table eating freshly baked coffee cake and talking in spare, reticent phrases of the bank failure. A bank president, Kerry Heiden said, is held in nearly the same respect as a pastor here. **********His father said: ''We expected them to set the example. It does lower your confidence in people you put trust in. They kind of let you down.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/04/business/the-robot-makers-stub-their-toes.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1984-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2216, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE ROBOT MAKERS STUB THEIR TOES", "print_headline": "THE ROBOT MAKERS STUB THEIR TOES", "body_text": " **********THE American robot industry was to be a star of the 80's, even the savior of smokestack America. The advanced billing attracted an avalanche of companies over the last five years, newcomers that hoped to make money by building machines that could do some of the dangerous, dirty and dreary jobs now done by humans. **********But the industry has failed to deliver on its promise. Robot sales have been far below expectations and the resulting competition has produced ferocious price cuts and the start of a sharp shakeout. **********Only one American company, Prab Robotics Inc., based in this community 150 miles from Detroit, made money in robotics in 1983, according to the first extensive industry study, conducted by the United States International Trade Commission. Losses for the industry amounted to 49 percent of sales last year, or about $83 million on sales of $169 million. The industry has been losing money since 1979, according to the I.T.C. **********As if that were not gloomy enough, the future could be worse. American robot makers now face an invasion by what appear to be the most successful and aggressive robot manufacturers in the world: the Japanese. **********The Robot Institute of America estimates that 65 percent of all operating robots in the world are made and operating in Japan. The I.T.C. found that sales by domestic companies increased by 10 percent last year, while imports, mainly from Japan, but also to a far lesser extent from West Germany, Norway and Sweden, rose 92 percent. **********Optimists say the industry's current turmoil is part of an inevitable shakeout. ''We're in a consolidation phase,'' said Laura C. Conigliaro, a widely followed analyst with Prudential Bache Securities. ''The first phase was during the 1960's to the mid-1970's and it was lackluster dull,'' she continued. ''Then we had the high growth period of the late 70's and early 80's when everybody said, 'Let's enter the industry and make lots of money.' Then the recession came along and they fell flat on their faces.'' **********Like many analysts, however, she predicts a bright future for the survivors. ''Some companies are going to develop real bottom line margins this year,'' Mrs. Conigliaro said. ''I'd hate to try to say who owns the future, becuse I think we are in for some surprises, but the future looks good.'' **********But there are some whose optimism is decidedly subdued. Walter K. Weisel, president of both Prab and the Robot Institute of America, said, ''We're in danger of losing the infant robotics industry before it comes off the bottle.'' **********If so, it all apparently began when an American company passed the technology to Japan. Unimation Inc.'s licensing of its robot technology to Kawasaki Heavy Industries in 1967 is generally considered the starting point for the development of Japanese robotics.  The Japanese industry developed quickly because there was a labor shortage in some rapidly growing industries such as automobiles, a receptive atmosphere for new technology and important assistance from the Government in the form of accelerated depreciation allowances and subsidized research and development. The result has been a generation of relatively inexpensive, reliable robots that have become much sought-after in other countries. **********There are about 250 robot makers throughout Japan, with the largest being Matsushita Electric, Hitachi and Kawasaki Heavy Industries. The problem for American producers, as the I.T.C. noted, is that demand for robots appears to have peaked in Japan. ''Japanese robot producers usually look to export markets when sales in their domestic market fail to grow,'' said the report. **********That move is well under way. A joint venture between General Motors and Japan's Fujitsu Fanuc Inc., for example, has produced GMF Robots, now the third-largest robotics company in the United States behind Cincinnati Milacron and Westinghouse Electric's Unimation operation. ''Some of the largest firms in the United States have taken a shortcut to get into the business and have gone into offshore licenses, manufacturing agreements, joint ventures, etc.,'' said the I.T.C. **********According to Jack Thornton, editor of the Robot Insider newsletter, major deals that have been struck with the Japanese so far, besides General Motors-Fanuc, include General Electric, which sells Hitachi robots, and International Business Machines, which imports robots from the Sanko Seiki Manufacturing Company. **********Industry analysts expect an increase in such joint ventures along with the withdrawal or failure of many American companies that rushed into an industry they did not fully understand. **********''There are about 70 active participants in the business now and I would not be surprised to see that cut in half by the time this is all over,'' said Gerald Michael, a robotics specialist with the Arthur D. Little management consulting company. **********AMERICAN robot manufacturers, not surprisingly, see the rise of joint ventures with the Japanese as an ominous development, arguing that they tend to close off big markets at companies like General Motors to domestic robot makers. ''If G.M. buys 1,000 machines from GMF, that's 1,000 orders for Fanuc in Japan,'' said Mr. Weisel, whose company's robots are largely designed for use in the auto industry. **********So far, American industry seems to be more captivated by the prospect of selling robots than by the idea of using them - lured perhaps by the widespread prediction that robots would be a $2 billion-a-year business in this country by the end of the decade. Even the United States Commerce Department has overshot the mark, estimating domestic sales of $270 million for 1983, while the actual total reached only $137 million. **********The I.T.C. and even industry optimists are highly skeptical of the $2 billion prediction for 1989. Nonetheless, the Robot Institute, the leading industry trade group, has swollen from 50 members in 1979 to 287 currently, an indication of the intense interest in the field. **********And this flood of entrants has produced a bruising scramble for sales, price cutting - the average price for a spot welding robot has declined from $94,000 in 1981 to $78,000 last year - and mounting losses, despite sales increases that continued even through the recession. **********The consequences have been failures and consolidation. One industry leader, Unimation, for example, was acquired by Westinghouse in 1982. **********In recent months the Copperweld Corporation, a Pittsburgh-based producer of specialty steels, announced that it would close its Copperweld Robotics subsidiary and sell its electronic vision system, which has been working on ways to give robots sight. In another instance, the Allied Corporation's Bendix subsidiary stopped manufacturing robots in this country, and early last month it announced that its Bendix Automations Systems group would be sold to the Cross & Trecker Corporation, the machine tool manufacturer. **********Copperweld's experience is apparently typical of many companies that misjudged the market. The company acquired an existing robot manufacturer called Autoplace in 1979 because it saw an opportunity for rapid growth, according to Duncan Morrison, a company vice president. **********''We found there was quite a difference between successfully managing a specialty steel company and managing a high-tech company in an emerging industry,'' he said. ''In the end we found that the fit wasn't right.'' **********THE auto industry has 50 to 60 percent of the approximately 10,000 robots at work in the United States and some operations, such as welding at most new or renovated auto plants, is almost completely automated. **********''I have three criteria for buying robots,'' said Richard Dauch, Chrysler's executive vice president for assembly operations. ''First, if it helps me improve quality. Second, if it improves the employee environment by eliminating a dirty or dangerous job. And third, if it helps me to be more competitive on costs.'' **********Consider, for example, the machines called ''Samson'' and ''Goliath'' by their co-workers. They are on the job 16 hours a day at Chrysler's Windsor plant here, lifting 13-foot- long, 500-pound steel mini-van floors from one assembly line to another. **********There are 125 robots at the plant, installed as part of an extensive renovation last year for the production of mini-vans. The machines are welding, spray painting and moving materials. There are even two that apply adhesive to windshields so they can be glued to the van body. **********Without Samson and Goliath, both Prab Model FB's, Mr. Dauch said, a crew of two or three workers, each paid $24 an hour, would be needed on each of two shifts to wrestle with the heavy, awkward mini-van floors. With humans doing the job there would be a high possibility of injury to workers and damage to the floor pans themselves. **********Other industries have been slower to adapt robots to their production processes, but robots are beginning to turn up in the aircraft industry for specialized applications like drilling holes, and in the home appliance industry for many of the same applications as in auto plants. Scattered robot installations have also been made in the plastics, machine tool, chemical and industrial equipment industries. **********Prices for robots range from about $10,000 for simple, small materials- handling units to over $150,000 for vary large units and those that must go through sophisticated routines. **********While one of the major fears of factory workers has been that robots would take away their jobs, most robot installations until recently have been in the kinds of hot, dirty and dangerous jobs that workers would not be likely to resist handing over to a machine. **********The companies that have been the most successful in introducing robots have been the ones that have informed workers well in advance of the machines' arrival, and that have provided assurances against layoffs. ''In the end it is people who make robots work,'' write Fred K. Foulks and Jeffrey L. Hirsch in the current Harvard Business Review. ''Effective decision making on the use of robotics could make the difference between success and failure to both the company and its employees.'' **********Spot welding robots have been the industry's best seller, largely due to the auto industry's desire to produce rattle-free cars by having the right welds in the right place every time. Of the 6,300 robots in operation in this country at the end of 1982, 2,453 were involved in welding. Following that were materials-handling robots, with 1,300 in operation; those loading and unloading machines, 1,060; those associated with casting operations, 875; painting and coating, 490, and assembly, 72. **********Companies that do not have the auto industry's experience with robots have found that there is more to automating than buying a robot and turning it on. According to the I.T.C. study, the cost of installing and debugging a robot and modifying other equipment to work with it typically runs from one and three quarters to five times the cost of the robot. **********''The most important thing to do, if you are going to replace old Joe who loads and unloads a die casting machine with a robot, is talk to Joe about what he actually does, '' said Prab's Mr. Weisel. **********Although robots can lift productivity, they do only what they are programmed to do, Mr. Weisel said. ''Say you put a robot in front of that machine and pretty soon you are running scrap,'' he said. ''So you start asking Joe questions and you find out that he has been babying the machine for years, adjusting the cooling as the day goes on to keep it running. There's nothing like a robot to teach you how your process really works.'' **********REGARDLESS of who leads the industry, the next generation of robots will be a lot smarter than its predecessors and easier to use. Today's machines reach out blindly to a programmed point in space and go through their operation, regardless of whether there is anything there to work on. This has forced manufacturers to develop new and expensive carriers and assembly lines to position objects precisely for robot processing. **********Just around the technological corner are robots with sensory capabilities, according to Robert Atkin, associate dean of Carnegie-Mellon University's school of industrial administration. A robot that can ''see'' by means of a television camera or a laser beam or that can reach out a sensitive probe to locate objects would lessen the need for precise positioning. Several robot makers are already offering units with vision capabilities, including a television system from ASEA Robotics Inc. that is a $30,000 add-on to a $60,000 assembly robot. **********Mrs. Conigliaro said robots will be seen in the future less as a stand- alone technology and more as a component in flexible manufacturing systems that will be integrated by computers. The successful robot companies, she predicts, will be those that can put together entire systems for customers. **********Still, for the short and medium term, the I.T.C. predicts the major growth market will be ''simple machines which integrate human operators into the system.'' It notes that ''research and development in the United States is largely directed at the design of more complex devices.'' And it concludes: ''These machines, when developed, are likely to be expensive and serve a more limited market because of their price.'' **********And who, according to the I.T.C., is in the best position to capture the growing market for simple, efficient, reliable and less expensive robots? The Japanese."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/23/business/the-pros-and-cons-of-computer-commuting-the-trend-builds-the-problems-increase.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1984-09-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 511, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE TREND BUILDS, THE PROBLEMS INCREASE", "print_headline": "THE PROS AND CONS OF 'COMPUTER COMMUTING'; THE TREND BUILDS, THE PROBLEMS INCREASE", "body_text": " **********THE advantages of computer commuting - a bucolic lifestyle, reduced traveling time, and closer family ties - have been widely noted. The drawbacks are only beginning to appear. But social scientists say that ways of handling those drawbacks will be critical. **********''The linking of professionals by computer is increasing at a very rapid rate - these are not abstract issues,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor analyst who is studying the phenomenon at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''There are possibilities for more productivy, because there can be less distraction. But there could also be a drop in productivity because there is little cross-fertilization with other workers.'' **********Few businesses have had to worry about motivating home workers yet, mainly because most of the computer commuters are successful professionals who have long been self-starters. Many, in fact, continue to maintain the outer trappings of a work environment, even at home. **********They set aside specific areas of their homes as offices - or rent office space at a location near, but not in, their rural residences. And, noted Sherry Turkle, a sociology professor at M.I.T., many continue to wear office attire, even if their office doubles as their own dining room at night. **********Still, both Miss Turkle and Mr. Shaiken warn that no amount of fancy dressing can create the atmosphere of idea interchange that an office provides. Nor can information conveyed by computer approach the depth of that passed on in person. **********''Computers can narrow your vision and serve as blinders, excluding the peripheral information that is often necessary,'' said Mr. Shaiken. He compared a worker who depended on computers for information to an executive who does not even skim a newspaper, but instead receives only ''relevant'' articles from a clipping service. ''A computer can extend your abilities, but when it becomes a way of life, it warps your visions about what is taking place,'' he said. **********Teleconferencing, which enables professionals at different geographic locations to ''meet'' via telephone and computer, can help a bit. But such conferences are not spontaneous, and will never replace the chance encounters that often result in lively and productive conversations. **********Problems of a different sort may crop up if the trend toward computer commuting spreads to clerical workers. Many people in this category do not derive their motivation from within, and benefit a good deal from the presence of a supervisor. **********Despite all the caveats, few analysts expect the trend toward computer commuting to end. **********Still, it is unlikely that traditional offices will become obsolete any time soon. Too many people do not see the convenience of at-home work as worth the isolation. **********''We were asking the same questions five years ago about computers and schools - is this the end of schools?'' said Miss Turkle. ''We found that kids don't just go to school to learn to read, they go to school to learn to be a kid. Well, people go to work for a lot of other reasons than earning a living.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/19/world/house-panel-finds-failure-in-world-drug-control.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Brinkley", "pub_date": "1984-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 533, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HOUSE PANEL FINDS FAILURE IN WORLD DRUG CONTROL", "print_headline": "HOUSE PANEL FINDS FAILURE IN WORLD DRUG CONTROL", "body_text": " **********A House committee has concluded in a detailed report on international drug enforcement that efforts to reduce illegal drug production in most Asian and Latin American countries are failing. **********A State Department official involved in drug-control efforts said that increases in drug production did not necessarily mean an increase in the amount of drugs entering the United States and added that the amount of heroin entering the country had remained stable for five years. **********Senior Reagan Administration officials, however, have recently conceded that the Government is not seizing significant percentages of most drugs being smuggled into the United States.

Gustavo Alvarez Martinez, had resigned at the request of fellow officers. Americans Appear Surprised **********The development appeared to take American officials by surprise. It came as the United States was preparing new joint military exercises in Honduras. In Washington, some officials have said privately that the exercises are part of an effort to intimidate Nicaragua and the Salvadoran insurgents. **********At present, the United States has 2,000 soldiers in Honduras and provides $40 million a year in military aid and $101 million in economic aid. **********An American official, who reporters said seemed shaken by the events, said: ''We have been advised that, as to the question concerning military cooperation with the U.S., it will be business as usual. We do not have anything to do with these developments. This is an internal Honduran matter.'' **********A Honduran communique announcing the ouster of General Alvarez was one of four issued today by the Ministry of the Presidency.

Daniel Bali Castillo, head of security forces. **********A Western diplomat who briefed reporters in Honduras said he understood that General Alvarez had been asked to resign because military and civilian leaders resented his style and his involvement in political matters. **********''They were sick of his arrogance,'' another Western diplomat said.

Negroponte, who was a friend of General Alvarez, was told about the resignation this morning by Mr. Suazo Cordova. General Alvarez later left for Costa Rica aboard a Honduran jet. **********The general, who was named commander in 1982, was known to have problems with older military officers but had tried to consolidate his support among younger officers. **********Several times in the last week, President Suazo Cordova said that the cause of turmoil in Central America was the military's involvement in politics.  Some Hondurans had become upset about General Alvarez's ties with the United States that had resulted in militarization of Honduras and tension with Nicaragua.

General Alvarez supported this plan. **********But Guatemala said recently that it could co-exist with Nicaragua. And General Alvarez has been criticized by Honduran officials for permitting the United States to base its anti-Nicaraguan operations in Honduras. **********With the general's approval, the United States also began training Salvadoran soldiers in Honduras, which is still involved in border disputes with El Salvador. Honduran officials felt it unwise to train Salvadorans who might some day fight against Honduras. **********Some military officials have also been unhappy with the prospect of inviting Salvadoran soldiers to participate in the Granadero exercise. **********U.S. Sees No Harm to Interests **********WASHINGTON, March 31 - Senior officials said here today that the resignation of General Alvarez would not harm United States interests.

''People are truly nervous.'' **********The price increases follow months of stagnation and statements by analysts as late as Tuesday afternoon that the market was not responding to tanker attacks in the Persian Gulf because it seemed unlikely that oil supplies would be disrupted.

The document was translated from the Spanish by the Congressional Research Service at the request of the House Select Committee on Intelligence. **********Armed Propaganda Teams are formed through a careful selection of persuasive and highly motivated guerrillas who move about within the population, encouraging the people to support the guerrillas and put up resistance against the enemy. It combines a high degree of political awareness and the 'armed' propaganda ability of the guerrillas toward a planned, programmed and controlled effort. **********The combatant propagandist guerrillas are the result of a continuous program of indoctrination and motivation. They will have the mission of showing the people how great and fair our movement is in the eyes of all Nicaraguans and the world. Identifying themselves with our people, they will increase the sympathy toward our movement, which will result in greater support of the population for the freedom commandos, reducing support for the regime in power. **********Armed propaganda will extend this identification process of the people with the Christian guerrillas, providing converging points against the Sandinista regime.   Eyes and Ears' of Movement **********The Armed Propaganda Teams provide a multistage program of persuasive planning in guerrilla warfare. These teams are also the ''eyes and ears'' of our movement. **********The development and control of the cover organizations in guerrilla warfare will give our movement the ability to create a ''whiplash'' effect within the population, when the order for fusion is given. When infiltration and internal subjective control have developed in a manner parallel to other guerrilla activities, a commandante of ours will literally be able to shake up the Sandinista structure, and replace it. **********Group discussions raise the spirit and increase the unity of thought in small guerrilla groups and exercise social pressure on the weakest members to better carry out their mission in training and future combat actions. **********These group discussions will give special emphasis to creating a favorable opinion of our movement. Through local and national history, make it clear that the Sandinista regime is ''foreignizing,'' ''repressive,'' and ''imperialistic,'' and that, even though there are some Nicaraguans within the Government, they are ''puppets'' of the power of the Soviets and Cubans, i.e., of foreign power.   Live and Eat With the People' **********To insure popular support, essential for the good development of guerrilla warfare, the leaders should induce a positive interaction between civilians and guerrillas, through the principle of ''live, eat and work with the people,'' and maintain control of their activities. In group discussions, the leaders and political cadres should give emphasis to positively identifying themselves with the people. **********It is not recommendable to speak of military tactical plans in discussions with civilians. The Communist enemy should be portrayed mainly as the enemy of the people, and only as a secondary threat to our guerrilla forces. **********During patrols and other operations around or in the midst of villages, each guerrilla should be respectful and courteous with the people. In addition he should move with care and always be prepared to fight, if necessary. But he should not view all the people as enemies, with suspicions or hostility. Even in war, it is possible to smile, laugh or greet people. The cause of our revolutionary base, the reason why we are struggling is our people. We must be respectful of them on all occasions that present themselves.   Instruction in Use of Arms **********In places and situations wherever possible, e.g. when they are resting during the march, the guerrillas can explain the operation of weapons to youths and young men. They can show them an unloaded rifle so that they will learn to load it and unload it, their use, and aiming at imaginary targets. **********The guerrillas should always be prepared with simple slogans to explain to the people, whether in an intentional form or by chance, the reason for the weapons: **********''The weapons will be for winning freedom; they are for you.'' **********''With weapons we can impose demands such as hospitals, schools, better roads and social services for the people, for you.'' **********''Our weapons are, in truth, the weapons of the people, yours.'' **********''With weapons we can change the Sandino-Communist regime and return to the people a true democracy so that we will all have economic oppportunities.''  Identification With the People **********All of this should be designed to create an identification of the people with the weapons and the guerrillas who carry them. Finally, we should make the people feel that we are thinking of them and that the weapons are the people's, to help them and protect them from a Communist, totalitarian, imperialist regime, indifferent to the needs of the population. **********A guerrilla armed force always involves implicit terror because the population, without saying it aloud, fears that the weapons may be used against them. However, if the terror does not become explicit, positive results can be expected. **********In a revolution, the individual lives under a constant threat of physical harm. If the Government police cannot put an end to the guerrilla activities, the population will lose confidence in the Government, which has the inherent mission of guaranteeing the safety of citizens. However, the guerrillas should be careful not to become an explicit terror, because this would result in a loss of popular support.   Instructions of Final Statement **********When a meeting is held, conclude it with a statement to the effect that people can reveal everything about this visit of our commandos, because we are not afraid of anything or anyone, neither the Soviets nor the Cubans. Emphasize that we are Nicaraguans, that we are fighting for the freedom of Nicaragua and to establish a genuinely Nicaraguan Government. **********Armed propaganda in populated areas should not give the impression that weapons are the power of the guerrillas over the people, but rather that the weapons are the strength of the people against a regime of repression. **********Whenever it is necessary to use armed force in an occupation or visit to a town or village, guerrillas should emphasize that: **********- This is being done to protect them, the people, and not the guerrillas themselves. **********- The action, though not desirable, is necessary because the final objective of the insurrection is a free and democratic society, where acts of force will no longer be necessary. **********- The force of weapons is a necessity caused by the oppressive system, and will cease to exist when the ''forces of justice'' of our movement assume control.   How to Explain a Shooting **********If, for example, it should be necessary for one of the advance posts to have to fire on a citizen who was trying to leave the town or city in which the guerrillas are carrying out armed propaganda or political proselitism, the following is recommended: **********- Explain that if that citizen had managed to escape, he would have alerted the enemy that is near the town or city, and they would carry out acts of reprisal such as rapes, pillage, destruction, captures, etc., in this way terrorizing the inhabitants of the place for having given attention and hospitality to the guerrillas. **********- If a guerrilla fires at an individual, make the town see that he was an enemy of the people, and that they shot him because the guerrillas recognized as their first duty the protection of citizens. **********- Make the population see that it was the repressive system of the regime that was the cause of this situation, what really killed the informer, and that the weapon fired was one recovered in combat against the Sandinista regime.   How to Neutralize Targets **********It is possible to neutralize carefully selected and planned targets, such as court judges, police and state security officials, etc. For psychological purposes, it is necessary to take extreme precautions, and it is absolutely necessary to gather together the population affected, so that they will be present, take part in the act, and formulate accusations against the oppressor. **********The target or person should be chosen on the basis of: **********- The spontaneous hostility that the majority of the population feels toward the target. **********- Rejection or potential hatred by the majority of the population toward the target, stirring up the population and making them see all the negative and hostile actions of the individual against the people. **********If the majority of the people give their support or backing to the target or subject, do not try to change these sentiments through provocation.   After Removal of Target **********The mission to replace the individual should be followed by: **********- Extensive explanation within the population affected of the reason why it was necessary for the good of the people. **********- An explanation that Sandinista retaliation is unjust, indiscriminate and, above all, a justification for the execution of this mission. **********- Infiltration of guerrilla cadres (whether a member of our movement or outside element) in workers unions, student groups, peasant organizations, etc., preconditioning these groups for behavior within the masses, where they will have to carry out proselitism for the insurrectional struggle in a clandestine manner. **********Our psychological war team should prepare in advance a hostile mental attitude among the target groups, so that at the decisive moment they can turn their furor into violence, demanding their rights that have been trampled upon by the regime.   The Preconditioning Campaigns **********These preconditioning campaigns must be aimed at the political parties, professional organizations, students, laborers, the masses of the unemployed, the ethnic minorities and any other sector of society that is vulnerable or recruitable; this also includes the popular masses and sympathizers of our movement. **********Make it plain to people that they have become slaves, that they are being exploited by privileged military and political groups. **********The foreign advisers and their counseling programs are in reality ''interventionists'' in our homeland who direct the exploition of the nation in accordance with the objectives of the Russian and Cuban imperialists, in order to turn our people into slaves of the hammer and sickle. **********When the mass uprising is being developed, our covert cadres should make partial demands, initially demanding, e.g., ''We want food. We want freedom of worship. We want union freedom,'' steps that will lead us toward the realization of the goals of our movement, which are: God, homeland and democracy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/16/business/an-offer-for-levitz-is-made-by-alger.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 312, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "An Offer for Levitz Is Made by Alger", "print_headline": "An Offer for Levitz Is Made by Alger", "body_text": " **********The Levitz Furniture Corporation, already the object of an acquisition offer by the Pritzker family of Chicago, received a competing bid yesterday from Alger Associates Inc. of New York. **********Alger is a holding company for Fred Alger & Company, a member firm of the New York Stock Exchange, and Fred Alger Management, a registered investment adviser with about $2 billion under management. **********Robert M.

Another, in a cemetery just outside of town, was conducted by the leftist followers of Maurice Bishop, the Prime Minister who was slain after a coup by a hard-line Marxist faction that took control of the Government here a few days before the Americans landed. The leftists denounced the American invaders and laid wreaths on an unmarked spot where they said 13 soldiers of the People's Rvolutionary Army, killed in the action, had been buried. **********The third event was a ceremony at Grenada's soon-to-be-opened second airport to mark the graduation of a group of Grenadian police recruits. And at the fourth, here in town, worshipers gathered for an ecumenical church service. **********At the American headquarters, the Grenada Beach Hotel on Grand Anse Beach, there were prayers and hymns, and a sergeant in dark-green fatigue uniform and red beret called the roll. **********The first three soldiers whose names were called replied, ''Here, First Sergeant!'' For the next 19 names there was no response. They were the dead, mostly victims of accidents in the four days it took 7,000 troops to secure the island. Forty-four Grenadians and 24 Cubans also died.   300 Stand to Attention **********Two buglers softly played taps as the gathering of some 300 people stood at attention before a simple monument to the dead: an upright M-16 rifle with its bayonet stuck into a black shrouded box, a camouflaged steel helmet hung on the rifle's butt and an empty pair of jungle boots. **********At midday the head of the appointed interim government and the highest- ranking United States military and political officials on the island, as well as Rear Adm. Ralph R. Hedges, commander of the United States forces in the Caribbean, went to a small parade field near the new airport. There they watched the graduation of the second group of Grenadian police recruits to complete a four-week training course given by United States soldiers. **********They are to receive eight more weeks of training from the British. Finally, about 90 of a total of 550 Grenadian policemen will be trained by the Americans to form a paramilitary unit. **********In response to an appeal from the Chamber of Commerce most of the shops in the capital were closed today and the town was unusually quiet. **********In one of the courts, Chief Justice Archibald Nedd was hearing arguments on whether the court that is trying the 19 people accused of murdering Mr. Bishop was legally established. The revolutionaries on trial, some of whom helped create the court by proclamation, want their action ruled invalid so that they can be tried under an earlier system that provides for a higher level of appeal. **********As the ceremony was under way at the United States military headquarters, the cruise ship Victoria slipped through the gray mist and tied up in the St. George's harbor with hundreds of American tourists aboard. **********Rita and Edward Hendricks of Skokie, Ill., and three of their children made their way through the narrow streets to the Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, where ministers of several faiths were marking the invasion with an ecumenical service. **********''It was a nice service,'' said Mrs. Hendricks.

The ministers said the wishes of Gibraltar's 30,000 residents would be respected in the talks. **********Sir Geoffrey said this amounted to a restatement of Britain's position and did not mean Britain was willing to give up sovereignty against the wishes of Gibraltar's residents. But Mr. Moran said at a news conference in Brussels that the explicit recognition that Spain's longstanding claim to the two-and- a-half-square-mile peninsula would be a subject of negotiation represented a major diplomatic victory for his country. **********''The end of the Gibraltar problem means the reintegration of Gibraltar into Spain,'' he said.   Need to Protect Interests **********Spain has suggested that some undefined special status for Gibraltar might be the key to its return to Spanish sovereignty. Both sides are eager to reach a solution that does not jeopardize interests elsewhere. Spain is concerned about the future of Ceuta and Melilla, Spanish enclaves across the straits of Gibraltar that are claimed by Morocco. Britain is worried that concessions on Gibraltar might weaken its position in negotiations with Argentina over the future of the Falkland Islands. **********Gibraltar was occupied by Britain in 1704 during the War of the Spanish Succession, and Spain was forced to cede sovereignty nine years later in the Treaty of Utrecht. Since then, Spain has resorted to periodic military, diplomatic and economic campaigns in an effort to reclaim the fortified port that guards the passage between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. **********Although Gibraltar was used as a staging ground in the Falkland campaign and is a prime monitoring point for submarine traffic into the Mediterranean, its strategic importance to Britain has declined with the advent of modern weapons and security systems. **********The border has been shut by Spain since 1969, despite an agreement negotiated in Lisbon in 1980 to reopen it. Several disputes, including the use of Gibraltar in the Falkland conflict, sank efforts to carry out the agreement as planned in 1982, although the border was opened to pedestrians. **********The deep feelings in Spain about Gibraltar were highlighted when King Juan Carlos refused to attend the marriage of Prince Charles to Lady Diana Spencer because the couple were to start their honeymoon by flying to a royal yacht anchored there.   Benefits of an Accord **********The opening of the only closed border in Western Europe is expected to pay both short-term and long-term dividends to all concerned. In the short term, it should make it easier for Britain and Spain to cooperate on a wide range of issues related to Spain's application to join the European Economic Community by 1986. Spain needs British support for its agricultural interests in negotiations over terms of entry with Italy and France and the two countries face potential conflicts over Spanish fishing rights in northern European waters. **********Free movement across the border is also expected to stimulate tourism on both sides, to ease real-estate pressures on Gibraltar, and to give a much- needed economic lift to unemployment-ridden La Linea, the Spanish city across the border. **********Gibraltar has always been Spanish- speaking, but the combination of foreign occupation and attempts by Spain to isolate it have created a situation where only a small minority of the population considers itself to be Spanish. In 1967, Gibraltarians voted, 12,762 to 44, to retain links with Britain rather than becoming a part of Spain."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/08/business/bank-urges-stronger-yen.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 103, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bank Urges Stronger Yen", "print_headline": "Bank Urges Stronger Yen", "body_text": " **********Strengthening the yen on currency markets is the best way to increase imports, the Bank of Japan said today. **********In a report, the central bank also endorsed continued efforts to open Japan's markets and expand domestic demand as a way to increase imports and reduce trade frictions.

On leave from his position as a New York University finance professor, he was beginning his first full-time job with an investment banking firm. **********The two professors are leading figures in the high-tech world of modern financial theory. Mr. Black, 46 years old, helped develop the widely used Black-Scholes formula for pricing stock options; Mr. Silber, 42, is co-author of a best-selling textbook on financial markets. Now they are the latest, and most prominent, of a small but growing band of academics who have left the ivory tower for the ''real world'' of Wall Street. **********The importance of the dozen or so new recruits from academia far outweighs their numbers, since they represent Wall Street's widening acceptance of the applications of modern financial theory. Some analysts speculate that eventually each major investment banking firm will have a niche for a full-time academic adviser on the payroll. **********The recruits are answering Wall Street's call for help in dealing with the increasingly complicated financial instruments that have proliferated in the past few years. The belief is growing in the financial district that expert advice on how to trade and value the instruments - some of which were developed by the professors themselves - could have a dramatic impact on profits at investment banking concerns that regularly invest billions of dollars. **********For their part, the professors are drawn by compensation packages that are estimated to reach $200,000 and more - many times the salaries they are normally paid. But the teachers - most of whom are approaching middle age and are restless after long campus careers - are lured as well by a chance to apply their theories in a high-stakes setting. **********The movement to Wall Street began in the late 1970's, picking up speed in the last year or two, and it is still too early to tell how long-lasting it will be. But with talk of the Street's high salaries making the rounds of faculty lounges - and with the departure of such stars as Fischer Black and William Silber - the nation's business school deans are getting edgy and are beginning to think about ways to make academic life more attractive. **********There are uncertainties on both sides of the new alliance, however. Investment bankers worry that academics won't be able to take the pressure and hectic pace of Wall Street, and that their attempts to quantify the vagaries of trading often do not take into account the imponderables of an imperfect world. The academics already on Wall Street fret over giving up the freedom to pursue their own interests. Some wonder if they will still be in demand once their new employers have learned what the professors have to teach, and several have taken advantage of the two-year leaves of absence normally provided to tenured faculty to try out their new careers. **********Despite the reservations, the professors and investment banking firms have been busily pairing up. Last October, Morgan Stanley & Company hired Alden L. Toevs, 35, an economics professor at the University of Oregon. Shortly afterward, Kidder, Peabody & Company hired Frank Jones, 45, formerly a business professor at San Jose State University. Since leaving academia in 1978, Mr. Jones had also done research for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the New York Futures Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. Besides hiring Mr. Silber, Lehman Brothers brought in Steven W. Kohlhagen, 36, a professor of international finance at the University of California at Berkeley. **********COMMERCIAL banks have also gotten into the act. In 1982, Bankers Trust hired Kenneth Garbade, 37, a professor of finance at N.Y.U. Mr. Garbade's academic leave runs out this fall and he is leaning toward staying at the bank. And the Wells Fargo Bank has been drawing on junior faculty, hiring, among others, Jeffrey Skelton, 34, a finance professor from Berkeley. **********In recent months, headhunters acting on behalf of a number of major investment banking firms and commercial banks have been prospecting among the faculties at such top business schools as Stanford, Harvard and M.I.T. **********''We go after the ones with the biggest names,'' said Barry Nathanson, president of Richards Consultants Ltd., an executive search firm. Mr. Nathanson said the current heightened interest in academics was ''not there a year ago,'' but today he is looking for scholars to fill three Wall Street jobs, and he would not be surprised to fill 20 in the next two years. **********''When a person as good as Fischer Black goes to Wall Street, that makes it a little more . . . fashionable,'' said Myron Scholes, a finance professor at Stanford who was Mr. Black's partner in developing the option pricing model. Mr. Scholes, 42, recently turned away a headhunter who tried to interest him in a position with a major firm. **********Those professors who accept the call generally are hired to devise intricate strategies for hedging against risk. To do this they draw on the enormous variety of exotic financial instruments now on the market, the more complicated of which - options contracts on financial index futures and on stock indexes - first appeared in the past half decade. Employing a sophisticated mathematical analysis, the professors recommend ways to use combinations of these instruments to tailor risk to fit the case at hand. **********Mr. Silber, for example, is working on ways to measure and coordinate the risk exposure of Lehman's various departments. Mr. Jones is developing new ways for Kidder, Peabody to use options on Treasury bond futures and fixed-income instruments. **********The current fever of high-tech analysis dates back to the inception of modern portfolio theory in 1952, when Harry Markowitz, then an economics student at the University of Chicago and now a finance professor at the City University of New York, postulated that the two critical factors in determining the value of a portfolio were risk and return. That insight ''was the opening gun for the high- tech approach to finance,'' explained Merton Miller, a finance professor at Chicago. The tricky business of measuring risk and return led to the flood of statistical techniques with which academics have tried to describe and predict the market's behavior. **********In applying their expertise to practical problems on Wall Street, many academics are, in a sense, servicing their own creations. Ten and 15 years ago, they taught the theories and terminology of modern finance to students who are now partners at investment banking concerns or are their clients. These former students have helped bring about the current wide acceptance of modern finance techniques on Wall Street. **********Now the ex-students are turning to their old professors for further guidance to give them a competitive edge. Some of the professors even helped concoct the instruments they work with. For example, Mr. Jones helped design the Standard & Poor's 500 futures contract for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. **********The professors offer an expertise that younger, and less well-paid, researchers are not often able to provide. Robert E. Rubin, the Goldman, Sachs partner who recruited Mr. Black to the firm and who is now his boss, said the professor ''had thought his way through a lot of problems that a younger person wouldn't have.'' **********The Black-Scholes model, for example, is designed to determine the most appropriate price for an option. It employs a mathematical formula based on such factors as the volatility of a stock's price and an option's expiration date. **********Steven R. Fenster, 41, managing director of Lehman Brothers, said it is worth looking for academics with the most sophisticated backgrounds because ''if they're going to have an impact, they'll be affecting the movement of billions of dollars. It makes a difference if they're right or not.'' **********The professors, especially those who were senior faculty, command impressive salaries and bonuses on the Street, with most estimates placing them in the $200,000 to $600,000 range. This compares with the roughly $50,000 that new business school graduates can expect to be paid. **********The high salaries paid former colleagues have generated intense interest among those left behind on the campuses, where senior professors earn about $65,000 to $75,000. ''It comes up about every other day over lunch,'' says Max Hartwell, a visiting economic historian at the University of Chicago. **********The big salaries are worrisome to some business school administrators, including Abraham J. Siegel, dean of M.I.T.'s Alfred P. Sloan School of Management, who is nervous about further raids on his faculty. ''There's no way I can compete with the salary Goldman, Sachs will pay Fischer Black,'' he said. **********Mr. Siegel added that business schools will have to compete in other ways, such as offering professors more time to do outside consulting work and making sure they get ''psychic income from working at what they want to do.'' **********SALARY is not the only allure of a **********job on Wall Street, however. **********Many senior professors have long had lucrative consulting arrangements. Some augment their teaching income in other ways. Mr. Silber, for example, was a floor trader on the New York Futures Exchange while a professor at N.Y.U. Mr. Black published a newsletter on options. **********Some of the motivation to leave academia is attributed instead to a growing sense of frustration among finance scholars. After a spate of exciting breakthroughs in the 1950's and 1960's involving portfolio valuation, securities pricing and corporate debt and equity structure, the last heady moment came with the development of the Black-Scholes option model in the early 70's. **********''There has been no stimulating big breakthrough in the last couple of years. We're all sort of chewing around the edges,'' said Terry Marsh, a junior finance professor at M.I.T. **********Indeed, both academics and investment bankers hope that a sort of cross-fertilization of ideas will result from professors spending time in the real world. **********''If you want to know something about trading costs, do it,'' said Eugene Fama, 45, a University of Chicago finance professor who is one of the leading figures in the empirical branch of modern financial theory. This approach involves the testing of theoretical models by examining vast quantities of data about financial instruments. **********Since last summer, Mr. Fama has been trading fixed-income instruments part-time for Dimensional Fund Advisors, an investment management company. He said his work in the real world has inspired him to write four academic papers, and given him ideas for four or five more. **********Whether the road from academia to Wall Street will become a well-traveled one is still an open question, however. Mr. Black said he thinks there is a limit to the number of academics Wall Street can absorb. **********Many investment bankers agree.  Henry Kaufman, a managing director of Salomon Brothers, says academics don't always fit in because they like to talk about perfect financial markets, while Wall Street looks for imperfect markets that offer profit opportunities. ''The one problem all academic people have in the world of finance on Wall Street,'' said Mr. Kaufman, ''is that we have to take imperfect information and make perfect decisions.'' **********The academics, though, seem to be rolling with the punches. **********Mr. Kohlhagen, who came to Lehman Brothers last year, recalled that on his second day on the job, he was asked by a colleague to analyze the selling price for a new product. He worked on the problem for four days, and when he came back with the answer, the colleague had long since forgotten the question. Mr. Kohlhagen says that he has since adapted to Wall Street's pace. **********Last week, Lehman Brothers agreed to be acquired by Shearson/ American Express. Although both Mr. Silber and Mr. Kohlhagen said they expect to stay on, the world around them is reeling. **********''I came here to learn about the management of financial organizations,'' Mr. Kohlhagen said, ''and I'm learning about it.'' **********Leaving the Classroom: A Taste of the Real World **********In recent interviews, Fischer Black and William L. Silber described their reactions to working in investment banking after long careers in academia. Mr. Black, on leave as a finance professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is now with Goldman, Sachs & Company. Mr. Silber, also on leave from a similar position at New York University, is at Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc. The following are excerpts from those interviews. *********** Fischer Black: ''I'm nervous about whether I can do the job . . . that I will end up being relative to these people the way I thought some of my colleagues were relative to me in the academic world - too abstract and academic . . . . **********''One of the things I will specialize in is ways of hedging risk. If you have a position in a stock, you can hedge by selling the stock, by selling calls, by buying puts or by selling futures contracts. I've been spending a fair amount of time looking at those alternatives and the advantages or disadvantages of situations in which you would do one rather than the other . . . . **********''I don't know exactly what the cause of it is, but 10 years ago I was patient with spending long hours doing mathematical derivations. I would make a lot of errors, and I would redo them and redo them and go up blind alleys and start over again on another track. I don't have as much patience with that any more. I tend to think younger professors do more of that than older professors do . . . . **********''A lot of my colleagues, if they wanted to know how things worked, would gather some numbers and do statistical analysis to find out, say, why corporate executives act in some particular way. Toward the end of my academic career I used to say if you want to find out why they act that way, ask them. Not all of them will know why they're doing it exactly, or be able to express it clearly, but some will. In this job I'll have a chance to ask them.'' *********** William L. Silber: ''I was brought in primarily to look at the risk exposure of the firm's trading positions. A trading firm winds up holding securities in the process of making a market; you're there to provide liquidity services to customers. It's possible to view this whole operation as one big portfolio of securities, and one of the most interesting jobs laid out for me is to measure the risk exposure of the firm's trading positions. It's basically a simple extension of portfolio theory . . . . **********''Academics have a funny way of thinking about things at times. When you think about things in a different way, you can sometimes generate an interesting idea, an idea for a new product. Academics usually ask 'why?' rather than 'what?' A trader will ask 'Where's the market?' 'What's the price?' An academic will look at why the price is so high. And if you understand why, sometimes you can structure a problem, or structure a product, in a very different way that most people would not think of.'' **********For example, ''most people view equities as a claim on the payment stream of a particular corporation. It has long been recognized by option theorists that equities can also be thought of as an option to sell the whole company to the bond holders. The way you do it is you default, and then the bond holders own the company. That's a very strange perspective, isn't it? And yet it's perfectly appropriate to value equities as including that option. You never know whether that perspective will spark a line of thinking that will lead to a new product, or an enhancement of an existing product, although it's not practical at the moment . . . . **********''Everybody recognizes that markets have become more price-sensitive and less of the old-boy network. There's more of 'What's the price?' 'What's the risk?' 'How best to do it?' And anytime you bring how best to do it to the table, that involves clear, creative thinking, and academics will be drawn into the marketplace.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/21/business/states-seek-business-in-japan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 781, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STATES SEEK BUSINESS IN JAPAN", "print_headline": "STATES SEEK BUSINESS IN JAPAN", "body_text": " **********In the Tokyo telephone book, under ''embassy,'' there is a listing for the State of New York. **********The three-person, $200,000-a-year mission, on the second floor of a downtown building next to a beauty parlor, will answer prospective tourists' questions or hand out ''I H New York'' bumper stickers. But its main reason for being here is to try to persuade Japanese companies to spend money in New York State. **********When New York opened the office in 1967, it was joining only one other state, Alaska. Now, 19 states have Tokyo offices, while several others, including New Jersey, court business through representatives of their port authorities. And three more states - Utah, New Mexico and Oregon - plan to set up here later this year. Connecticut is not represented. While the offices concentrate on Japanese investment, many are also active elsewhere in the Far East. **********To maintain representation in Japan is an expensive undertaking. Start-up costs are large, and annual budgets can run as high as $500,000, a figure that does not take into account the time put in by support staff back home. **********'Presence' and 'Access' **********As the state representatives describe it, that money is buying such things as ''presence'' and ''access,'' which perhaps will make the difference in a Japanese company's decision to invest in one state or another. **********''The legislatures wouldn't have them over here if they didn't think the offices were worthwhile,'' said Richard A. Bush, Asia director for the State of Washington. But no state, said several of the representatives, has tried to figure out exactly how much business its office has brought home. **********According to John E. Marquardt, whose title is Far Eastern representative for New York's Department of Commerce, there were 350 Japanese companies with offices in New York when he took over the Tokyo office in 1973; today, he said, there are 700. **********However, when asked how much of that investment would have been made if the state had not maintained its office here, he answered, ''Who knows?'' **********Some of the representatives also help American companies that are trying to crack the Japanese market. **********Effect on Decisions **********Privately, several representatives agreed that they were not likely to have any great influence on investment decisions made by big companies like Sony or Honda, which have huge research staffs of their own. (Such companies are fought over nonetheless, with officials back home able to offer a variety of concessions - ranging from improving local services to waiving property taxes - to attract their business.) **********With smaller companies that lack the time or resources to investigate the United States, the representatives here said, a good state director can make a difference. **********Many states, including New York, decided to open Tokyo offices because similar offices already established in Europe were judged successful. However, other states have come here and left, including California, which has huge trade links with Asia. Its office was scrapped in 1967 at the urging of then Gov. Ronald Reagan. **********The Local Approach **********Tsugio Kusajima, a director of the semi-governmental Japan External Trade Organization, questioned whether the states' representatives were really worth the cost. ''Why not hire a Japanese who knows about Japan?'' he said. ''If he is asked about the water supply at a potential site or local tax laws, he can find out by making a quick call back to the United States.'' **********Some states follow that theory. While an office may have as many as seven staff members, as is the case with Alaska's, a few simply involve arrangements with Japanese consultants who spend a few hours a week trying to dig up business for the state or answering phone calls. **********Mr. Marquardt is critical of that approach. ''Knowing the state is more important than knowing Japan,'' he said, ''because the state is the product a director is trying to sell. If somebody wants to know about the labor situation in Binghamton or flights out of Syracuse, I can tell them right away.'' **********Roughly half of the full-time representatives are native-born Americans, although few are actually natives of the state they represent. The other half are Japanese citizens who have spent considerable time in the United States. **********Many of the lesser-known states are kept busy just trying to explain where they are located and why they would be the right choice for investment. New York's problem is a little bit different. **********''When you say New York, people over here always think of mid-Manhattan,'' said Mr. Marquardt. ''Yes, Virginia, there is a New York state - that's been my burden for 11 years.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/24/business/thailand-s-prices-rise.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-11-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 51, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Thailand's Prices Rise", "print_headline": "Thailand's Prices Rise", "body_text": " **********Rising food and housing prices were largely responsible for increasing consumer prices in Thailand by three-tenths of 1 percent in October from September, the Department of Business Economics said today.

Getty might be congratulating himself, at last, for the outcome of his latest whirlwind encounter with the Getty Oil Company. **********Early Sunday morning, Mr. Getty signed the papers approving Texaco Inc.'s purchase of the 40.2 percent of Getty family stock controlled by Mr. Getty for nearly $4 billion. **********Although a Justice Department review and legal challenges remain, the signing at Manhattan's Pierre Hotel appeared to bring to an end a corporate struggle involving heirs to one of America's largest family fortunes that ended up in the largest takeover in corporate history - altogether worth $9.9 billion. **********''He was very happy,'' a close associate said. **********Trust's Value Almost Doubled **********A week ago, Mr. Getty expected to be a buyer of Getty Oil, which he considered poorly managed, in partnership with the Pennzoil Company at $112 a share. Yet, the hastily prepared Texaco bid brought him in one stroke the payoff of nearly doubling the value of the family trust that he, as its sole trustee, had been seeking for more than seven months. Texaco agreed to pay $125 a share, in a combination of cash, stock and notes. **********For Mr. Getty, who received $28 million a year in dividends from the Sarah C. Getty Trust, the windfall will further help support a private life as both a patron and occasional participant in opera and anthropology, in addition to commercial real estate investment on the West Coast. **********A resident with his wife, Ann, and their four sons in the prosperous Pacific Heights enclave of San Francisco, Mr. Getty is a major benefactor of the San Francisco Opera and reportedly underwrites a new production a year for $250,000 or more. **********Mr. Getty rarely attends the lavish parties at which his wife is host, at their hillside mansion, preferring to listen to music in a soundproof room overlooking San Francisco Bay, watch television or sleep. **********But when opera is the theme, the shy and soft-spoken Mr. Getty, who friends have described as ''a regular guy,'' is an engaging host, often joining in song with cast members and honored guests. They have included Placido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Leontyne Price. **********Getty Composition Performed **********Nearly three weeks before his 50th birthday last Dec. 20, Mr. Getty escorted a coterie of friends from San Francisco to the Alice Tully Hall for the first recital concert by Mignon Dunn of the Metropolitan Opera House and a rare New York performance of a Getty composition. **********Miss Dunn's selections included 18 songs composed by Mr. Getty, a cycle called ''The White Election,'' which he wrote to accompany a series of poems by Emily Dickinson. **********The concert played to close to a full house of more than 1,000 people. However, in his unenthusiastic review, Bernard Holland of The New York Times, wrote, ''Many of the songs avoid melody altogether and replace it with chanted text and single line accompaniments.'' **********Mr. Getty is also a working chairman of the L.S.B. Leakey Foundation, in Pasadena, Calif., one of the country's most prominent anthropological organizations. Although not a frequent contributor to the literature of the field, Mr. Getty is listed in anthropoligical journals as a specialist in the antiquities, archaeology and culture of Indians of the American Southwest. **********Mr. Getty's mother, Ann Rork Light, was the fourth of J. Paul Getty's five wives, from 1932 to 1935, and Mr. Getty is the youngest of the late billionaire's three surviving sons. **********He was raised in Pacific Heights with his mother, who now lives in Palm Beach, and two brothers, J. Paul Getty 2d, a recluse who now lives alone in London, and Ronald Getty. His mother's fourth husband, the late Dr. Rudolph Alvin Light, was a grandson and heir of the founder of the W. H. Upjohn Company. **********Stint in Saudi Arabia **********After graduating from the University of San Francisco with a bachelor's degree in literature, Mr. Getty worked as a ''consultant'' in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait during 1958-59 for the Getty Oil Company. He tried again later in the mid-1960's and early 1970's, but, according to associates, his heart was never in the business. **********These failed efforts to please his difficult father, they said, drew a series of harsh criticisms from the elder Mr. Getty. ''It was devastating,'' one lawyer familiar with the company said. ''The old man wrote scathing letters to him.'' **********A stepbrother, George F. Getty, rose quickly through the ranks at Getty Oil and it was on him, not Gordon, that J. Paul counted to carry the family name in the oil business, as he had done for his father, George Frankling Getty. **********However, George died unexpectedly in 1973 at a point where he had risen to executive vice president and chief operating officer of Getty Oil. Some suspected a suicide, but coroners ruled the death accidental. **********Gordon Getty returned to the business in 1976, taking his father's chair as a Getty director following J. Paul Getty's death, at age 83, in London that July. Mr. Getty did not take an active role in the company until a co- trustee of the family trust, C. Lansing Hays Jr., died in 1982. Mr. Hays had been a powerful ally of his late father, and associates said Gordon Getty deferred to his judgment on corporate matters. **********With sole control of the family's 40.2 percent of the company stock, Gordon Getty began exploring with investment bankers ways to raise the company's sagging market value. **********In the process, he repeatedly locked horns with Getty executives, led by Sidney R. Petersen, chairman and chief executive. When Mr. Getty's campaign began a year ago, Getty stock sold for less than $50 a share. Today, it closed at $118.50, up $14.125.  - **********$3.5 Million for Options **********If, as expected, Texaco Inc. is successful in its offer to buy the Getty Oil Company for $125 a share, or $10 billion, 22 Getty executives will get what amounts to tax-free windfalls totaling nearly $3.5 million, documents filed by Texaco showed yesterday. **********Based on papers filed earlier by Getty, Mr. Petersen, chairman of Getty, has options to buy 10,000 shares at $70 each, and thus would collect $550,000, tax-free. **********Texaco told the Securities and Exchange Commission in its papers that just before the two companies merged, Getty would pay the executives twice the difference between $70 and $125, or $110 a share, for their stock options."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/15/business/rates-are-mostly-unchanged.html": {"writer_name": "Yla Eason", "pub_date": "1984-02-15", "snippet": "Interest rates ended mostly unchanged in the Government securities market yesterday, after rising a bit in response to a Commerce Department report of strong retail sales in January and a Federal Reserve Board report of a record gain in consumer c...", "word_count": 814, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RATES ARE MOSTLY UNCHANGED", "print_headline": "RATES ARE MOSTLY UNCHANGED", "body_text": " **********Interest rates ended mostly unchanged in the Government securities market yesterday, after rising a bit in response to a Commerce Department report of strong retail sales in January and a Federal Reserve Board report of a record gain in consumer credit in December. **********In the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills, which had been delayed because of the Lincoln's Birthday holiday on Monday, the three-month bill rate was slightly lower than in the previous week, while the six-month bill rate was the highest since Jan. 3. **********The average discount rate on the three-month bill was 9.04 percent, down from 9.08 percent at last week's auction.

''Basically, the market had already anticipated very strong economic numbers to be relesed this week,'' she said. ''And even though we did receive strong retail sales and consumer credit figures, for the most part it has already been discounted in the current price structure.'' **********Prices were mostly unchanged among the issues sold last week.

The 12 percent bonds due in 2013 were offered at 100 20/32 to yield 11.92 percent, unchanged. **********Robert H. Parks of Robert H. Parks & Associates, an investment firm, said he was concerned about the strong sales and consumer credit figures, however. He believes ''the negative side of this development is the expanding economy propelled by monetary, military and nonmilitary spending will reignite inflation and send interest rates sharply higher.'' **********''Consumer and business credit spending is speeding along at a 20 percent annualized growth rate,'' he said. ''And as you inject this adrenaline into the system, you're already beginning to compete with huge Treasury borrowing.'' Therefore, he believes that ''the first wave of the interest rate rise is already with us.'' **********9% Inflation Forecast **********Mr. Parks said that by late this year and early next year he expects inflation to be as high as 9 percent.

If the claims are tried here, therefore, the lawyers stand to make a lot of money. **********In India, however, such contingency fees are not allowed. And if the cases end up there, most of the American lawyers will probably vanish from the scene. **********''There have been a number of cases, mostly involving airplane crashes in foreign countries, in which American lawyers have signed on to the case, but when the United States courts sent the cases back to the country where the accident happened, where there were no contingency fees, the American lawyers faded away,'' said Lee Kreindler, a New York personal-injury lawyer.   Jurisdiction Is a Question **********Mr. Kreindler and other specialists in personal-injury law who do not have clients in Bhopal believe that the American courts have no reason to get involved in evaluating individual Indian claims. **********''There will be cases filed all over the place,'' said Lawrence Charfoos, a personal-injury lawyer in Detroit, ''but after this all settles down, the Federal judiciary will decide that India has an overwhelming interest in these claims, that the United States has no dominant interest in them and that the Indian legal system is perfectly capable of handling them.'' **********The only circumstance in which it would make sense for the American courts to become involved, said Mr. Kreindler, would be in a ''genuinely representational'' class action in which the central question was Union Carbide's liability for actions or procedures developed in this country.   'Enormously Expensive' **********''It would be enormously expensive and inefficient to bring all the injured people over here to testify, along with all the eyewitnesses, all the hospital records and so on,'' he said. ''To the extent that the focus of the litigation is on American activities such as the design of the plant, the safety regulations or the manufacture of the valve, there's a reasonable chance that the litigation may stay here, with the personal-injury questions referred back to India.'' **********United States courts have a great deal of discretion in deciding whether they are the appropriate forum for a claim. **********However, in a 1981 case involving an airplane crash in Scotland, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the likelihood that an American court would award higher damages was not a sufficient reason to hear the case in this country rather than in the country where the accident happened. **********Although American courts generally reject cases in which foreign victims seek damages arising from disasters on foreign soil, an exception was made for a claim growing out of an airplane crash near Bombay. In that case, now pending in Seattle, the courts ruled that the trials should be held in this country because the time limit for filing claims in India had expired and the victims could get no relief there.   Bombay Case Is Cited **********The American lawyers who have taken on Bhopal clients say the Union Carbide situation resembles that in Bombay more than that in Scotland because, they maintain, the victims of the gas leak would get a fair hearing only in this country. **********They say the Bhopal victims could not get justice in India because of the high filing fees required there; because there is no provision there for lawyers to handle cases on a contingency basis, with the attorneys paying all costs until a recovery is won, and because under Indian law the victims would have to prove negligence to collect, while under the American doctrine of strict liability they would simply have to show that they had been injured by a defective product. In addition, many states have a doctrine of absolute liability covering damage caused by a substance that escapes its usual bounds and encroaches onto other property. **********Arthur Murphy, a Columbia University law professor who lived in India for several years, thinks the personal-injury claims should be tried in India, but he agrees that poor people do not have much access to the courts there. As a result, he says, the claims may have to be brought by the Government on behalf of the victims.   'The Lowest Rung of the Ladder' **********''Poor people don't get into court very much in India, and I understand that those who were killed or injured in Bhopal were on the lowest rung of the economic ladder,'' he said. ''My guess is that what is going to happen is that the Government of India or the Government of the state of Madhya Pradesh will step in to take the cases. I think there will be a tremendous receptivity on the part of the Indian courts to some jerry-built Government intervention scheme, even if it's a little unusual.'' **********Indeed, most legal experts agree that wherever the Bhopal cases are tried, they are likely to be handled jointly, as a class action, with the Indian Government playing an important role in the litigation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/10/business/the-importance-of-freeing-the-yen-few-immediate-rewards-for-the-us.html": {"writer_name": "Jeffrey Garten", "pub_date": "1984-06-10", "snippet": "THE negotiations were stormy.\n\n Washington warned Japan that\n\nfailure to accommodate American desires would unleash a protectionist Congress.

It threatened retaliation against Japanese banks in the United States. It even blocked Japan's promotion to the No. 2 voting spot in the World Bank. **********Late last month, however, Tokyo gave in and agreed to remove a substantial number of restrictions on the use of its currency, thereby making the yen more widely available to overseas borrowers and investors. In addition, Japan allowed American banks and securities firms to play a larger role in managing Japanese funds. No longer would negotiations be confined to oranges and autos. **********The Reagan Administration was jubilant. Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan billed the negotiation as a major breakthrough for the United States, Japan and world economy. But how significant is this accord? In the long run, there are some potential benefits, to be sure. But there will be few immediate rewards for the United States and the agreement should not be oversold. **********As the theory goes, within several years, companies, central banks and investors outside of Japan should get accustomed to using yen instead of dollars for financing trade and managing investments. The more international demand there is for the yen, the higher its value. This will make Japanese products more expensive in world markets and blunt Tokyo's unrelentless export drive. **********But right now, the agreement means something very different. The yen will fall relative to the dollar. This spells more, not less, import pressure on the United States at a time when we are headed for a record $120 billion trade deficit. **********Why will this happen? It will be a long time before a sizable proportion of world trade is billed in yen - only about 5 percent is done so now - and most customers would prefer dollars. International companies may be attracted to tapping Japanese funds by selling yen-denominated debt issues, which will represent a new source of low-cost financing. But after obtaining yen, they will exchange them for dollars, decreasing demand for Japan's money and putting more upward pressure on the dollar. **********Initially, it will also be easier for the Japanese to invest their yen outside of Japan than for foreigners to find an equal number of attractive yen investments in the Tokyo market, where heavy regulation limits opportunities. The resulting net outflow of funds from Tokyo, which would temporarily flood the international market, could also weaken the yen. **********Moreover, the financial agreement can never be fully effective unless the United States seriously addresses its budget deficit and tight monetary policy, which together raise interest rates and keep the dollar sky high. On the other hand, action would also be necessary concerning Japan's tight budget and loose money, which keep rates low and depress the yen. Without policy changes in Washington and Tokyo, forget about a realistic dollar- yen relationship. **********IN addition, the problem of international monetary instability remains, now helped by Washington's refusal to buy and sell foreign exchange actively to maintain some order in currency markets. **********In some cases, the agreement is partial. Although Japanese companies will be allowed to sell yen bonds abroad in the so-called Euroyen market, purchasers of those bonds will have to pay a withholding tax on the interest they earn, greatly reducing the attractiveness of Euroyen bonds. In addition, Japan is taking only very limited steps to deregulate its very low domestic interest rates, the most basic component of any meaningful financial liberalization. **********It is doubtful, furthermore, that open Japanese financial markets will substantially reduce trade frictions, even if the yen appreciates. Japan's auto sales will not be affected since Washington already regulates supply through import quotas that Tokyo can fill at almost any price. Pressure on American steel will not subside, given our labor rates and our outdated equipment. America's efforts in genetics, fiber optics, artificial intelligence will still face pressure from Japan, as its programs for research and development and long- term financing will still press against our disorganized high-tech efforts. **********There will be no letup in Japan's acquisition of American industries, where the prime motivation is fear of being shut out by our import barriers. Look for more deals like Toyota's joint venture with General Motors, especially if the yen's value does rise, making American assets cheaper for Japanese investors.  Nor will the United States gain much help in its efforts to penetrate Japan's markets. A more expensive yen may mean a cheaper dollar, making American products more affordable in Japan. However, our major handicap is not price, but Japan's R.& D. cartels, exclusive leasing arrangements, regional subsidies and targeted tax benefits, not to mention the lackluster efforts of our own companies to compete internationally. **********The new financial agreement, in short, is a small victory for the future, but only one battle among many more to come with Japan. The United States should keep up its pressure on Tokyo. It would help, too, if part of the enormous energy that Washington is devoting to the search for foreign scapegoats were directed at our own policy shortcomings. **********Jeffrey E.

Reed, an engineer by training and a consumer marketing executive by experience, to succeed Walter B. Wriston as chairman and chief executive, according to sources within the bank. **********Mr. Wriston, who has been responsible for much of the dramatic change that has taken place in the banking industry over the past decade, is to retire at the end of August. **********The 45-year-old Mr. Reed, who has been vice chairman in charge of Citicorp's consumer-banking activities, has had practically no experience in the traditional commercial-banking activities of lending to giant corporations. He joined Citicorp in 1965 and has been in charge of its consumer business for 10 years. **********Victory Over Two Others **********''The horse race is over,'' said Thomas H. Hanley, chief bank-stock analyst for Salomon Brothers, the investment banking firm. ''I can't believe it. I'm shaking. I'm in shock.'' **********The decision reportedly was made at a meeting of the board yesterday. But last night, the bank declined to confirm the news, saying that it wanted first to inform its officers around the world, many in distant time zones. **********''At about 1:30 in the afternoon people were being called out of meetings throughout the bank, and everyone knew that the decision had been made,'' said a Citibank officer. **********The other contenders in the three- man race were Thomas O. Theobald, 47, who heads the Citicorp's business with corporations, governments and other financial institutions, and Hans H. Angermueller, 59, who is in charge of the bank's legal and lobbying activities. Like Mr. Reed, both are vice chairmen. Last year, each of the three earned $703,153, compared with Mr.  Wriston's $1.2 million - the highest pay of any commercial banker in the United States. **********Because of Citicorp's tremendous influence, the financial industry has speculated for years over who would succeed Mr. Wriston. If Mr. Reed attains Mr. Wriston's stature, what he does at Citicorp will affect the industry and its customers across the world.  That is partly because Citicorp is by far the largest banking organization in the United States. At year end, it had assets of $134.7 billion, far ahead of the No. 2-ranked BankAmerica Corporation, which reported assets of $121.2 billion. **********But Citicorp's impact has been far greater than even its size would indicate.  Under Mr. Wriston's leadership, it aggressively challenged banking laws and regulations and pushed into new fields. **********It has blanketed the New York City area with hundreds of 24-hour automated teller machines, and has used its lobbying power to open markets across the United States. It has become one of the biggest issuers of credit cards, with about 5 million Mastercard and Visa cards outstanding. It also has bought Diner's Club and Carte Blanche. **********In addition, Citicorp has found loopholes that enabled it to enter the hotel business, despite laws that confine banking companies to businesses that are ''closely related'' to banking. **********Especially in its consumer-banking activities, it lobbied vigorously to change laws around throughout the country that stood in the way of its goals and its profits. It often dangled the promise of jobs before state legislatures if they would enact legislation favorable to Citicorp. And it would play one state against another. **********It was in that way that Citicorp succeeded in ridding the nation of most of its usury laws, which had limited the amount of interest that banks could charge on loans to consumers and, in some cases, prohibited the imposition of annual fees on credit cards. **********Most of these changes were most helpful to Mr. Reed, whose activities had been losing about $150 million a year before the usury laws were lifted, and until he got thecredit-card losses under control. **********Critical Time in Industry **********Mr. Reed's appointment comes at a critical time in the banking industry.  Confidence in the industry has been waning as the result of unusually high problem loans and the recent collapse of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, the nation's eighth-largest banking organization. **********Much of the troubles reflect the high level of loans to financially troubled countries in Latin America, and Citicorp is one of the biggest lenders to those countries. Mr. Theobald was in charge of those loans. **********Many analysts said the choice of Mr. Reed indicated that Citicorp would continue along its current course, placing emphasis on the development of its business with consumers, rather than with big corporations and governments. **********''The future of Citicorp obviously lies in the consumer business,'' said Lawrence W. Cohn, first vice president and senior bank analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. **********''The appointment of John Reed embodied the technological and retail thrust of the bank,'' said James J. McDermott Jr., senior vice president of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a securities firm that specializes in bank stocks. **********Most analysts expect Mr. Theobald and perhaps Mr. Angermueller to leave the bank. Citicorp is known for intense internal competition and the tradition has been for losers to find jobs elsewhere. **********''Theobald walks, that's a given,'' said Mr. Hanley of Salomon Brothers. **********Analysts also said the decision could unsettle many officers who had been allied with the losers. ''There are factions within the bank behind each of them, it could be very interesting,'' said one analyst. **********Tension Among Officers **********For some time, Mr. Reed's activities had cost the bank hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of credit card losses and unfavorable interest rate trends. He had been bitterly resented by officers elsewhere in the bank, whose annual bonuses were sharply cut or eliminated because of the losses stemming from his group. **********But within the last year, the consumer business moved smartly into the black, vindicating Mr. Reed, and, even more importantly, Mr. Wriston, who staunchly supported him throughout. **********Indeed, some analysts said that the appointment of Mr. Reed by Citicorp's board represented the final approval of the directors of Mr. Wriston's gamble into the consumer business. **********According to the sources, Mr. Reed's victory over the two other leading contenders was complete. Despite hints by Mr. Wriston that Citicorp might create an unusual management structure designed to keep all three contenders, sources within the bank said Mr. Reed's power would be total, and that he would be able to pick his own president. Currently, that job is vacant."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/25/world/9-from-us-among-17-dead-in-philippine-fire.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 482, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "9 FROM U.S. AMONG 17 DEAD IN PHILIPPINE FIRE", "print_headline": "9 FROM U.S. AMONG 17 DEAD IN PHILIPPINE FIRE", "body_text": " **********The authorities today retrieved the bodies of more victims of a blaze that swept through a luxury hotel and killed 17 people, nine of them Americans visiting for the 40th anniversary of Gen.

It has recently renewed its contract with the Hearst Corporation to print Hearst magazines and won a new contract with Rolling Stone to print that magazine, beginning next January. **********The size of expenditures for magazine advertising is a major economic factor governing the magazine printing business, but nearly 75 percent of World Color Press's work is done on multiyear contracts, reducing sensitivity to economic ups and downs. **********Kenneth G.

But if it occurred, most experts agree, the result would be far less damaging than the two oil ''shocks'' of the 1970's. **********Because of conservation, increased oil production outside the Middle East, the stockpiling of vast petroleum reserves in most consuming nations and a sharp reduction in imports, most of the industrialized world has become far less dependent on the oil-rich nations surrounding the Persian Gulf. **********''The arithmetic shows that the world could weather a cutoff for some time without any real shortages developing,'' said John H. Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. **********Even with sufficient worldwide supplies of crude, however, many analysts expect that hoarding of crude, and panic buying on the greatly expanded international spot, or noncontract, market, would temporarily drive prices up.  ''The arithmetic looks all right, but the psychology of the oil market raises different questions,'' said James Schlesinger, the former Secretary of Energy under President Carter and now a senior adviser to the investment banking firm Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb. **********Position of United States **********Of all the major oil-consuming nations, the United States is now the least dependent on the Persian Gulf for its supplies. During five years of almost steadily declining oil demand, the nation's biggest oil companies have increased their imports from Mexico, Canada, Britain and other non-Middle Eastern nations. At the same time, the companies have sharply cut their purchases from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. **********Those Middle Eastern oil producers ship 7.5 million barrels of crude a day through the Strait of Hormuz, a 50- mile-wide opening at the bottom of the Persian Gulf. The United States accounts for 500,000 barrels a day of that figure. Oil shipped through the strait represents 18 percent of the world's daily crude consumption. **********Daily imports by the United States from these Persian Gulf producers, now less than a quarter of what they were in 1979, could easily be made up by larger purchases elsewhere. No shortages would be expected, even on a regional basis, analysts said. **********Aramco Purchases **********The analysts maintain that most of the Persian Gulf imports are now Saudi Arabian crude purchased by the four minority partners in the Arabian American Oil Company. These Aramco partners - the Exxon Corporation, the Mobil Corporation, Texaco Inc. and the Standard Oil Company of California - have continued to honor long-term contracts to buy Saudi oil even though it is priced higher than comparable crude on the spot market. **********If Saudi shipments were disrupted, the analysts say, the Aramco partners would simply replace them with increased purchases from other producing nations, and there would be no supply disruption in this country. **********Japan and Western Europe **********Japan and Western Europe, the largest customers of Persian Gulf oil, are each importing more than 2 million barrels of crude a day through the Strait of Hormuz. More than half of Japan's oil supplies come from the region, while nearly a third of Western Europe's oil is from there. Japanese and Western European consumers, therefore, might be the first to experience shortages. **********But for shortages to occur, most analysts agree, exports from the Persian Gulf would have to be cut off entirely for months. And since both he United States and Britain have pledged to use military force, if necessary, to keep the strait open, any cutoff of supplies would not be expected to last that long. **********Contributing to the general sense of confidence on Wall Street is the surplus production capacity in several nations. William F. Randol, an analyst for the First Boston Corporation, estimated that an additional 3 million barrels of oil a day could be brought onto the world market if Mexico, Venezuela, Nigeria, Indonesia and Libya began producing all they could. All five nations ''would like nothing better than to pump up their production levels,'' he added. **********Saudi Pipeline **********At the same time, Saudi Arabia, which exports most of its crude oil through the strait, could bypass that route with a large volume of oil. The Saudis' two-year-old pipeline connecting their oilfields to the Red Sea is now transporting only 600,000 barrels daily. It is capable of transporting 1.6 million barrels a day. **********Thus, by combining the surplus production capacity of several nations with the oil that could be transported through the Saudi pipeline, more than half the oil lost if the Persian Gulf were closed could readily be made up, the experts said. **********Stockpiled oil would further cushion the blow. The Saudis, in what analysts regard as a defensive measure that anticipates Iranian action to block the Gulf, have stored more than 50 million barrels of oil in supertankers. Most of the oil is now sitting idle in ports and at sea off Japan and other Far Eastern nations. **********90-Day Supply Seen **********More importantly, since the Iranian revolution, most major consuming nations have developed emergency reserves. In this country, and in Japan and Europe, the reserves are large enough to cover 90 days without any oil imports. **********''What it all means is that unless there is a complete, unexpected catastrophe in the Gulf, crude oil supply should not be a problem,'' said Andrew Lebow, an analyst for Shearson/American Express. **********A major question confronting the oil market, however, is how the spot market would respond to a move by Iran to block the Gulf. This market, where oil is traded internationally by telephone and where prices are negotiated on the basis of immediate supply and demand, now accounts for more than 25 percent of the crude oil traded worldwide.  The volatility of the spot market, and futures market in crude oil and petroleum products, was demonstrated on Monday, when prices rose rapidly in response to reports of an attack on Iran's Persian Gulf oil terminal, Prices fell back yesterday, however, with Texas intermediate crude, an abundant United States oil, dropping 25 cents, to $30.50 a barrel."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/12/business/business-people-yet-another-promotion-for-beatrice-executive.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 286, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yet Another Promotion For Beatrice Executive", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Yet Another Promotion For Beatrice Executive", "body_text": " **********When Anthony Luiso, 40, was named to the ''office of the chairman'' of the Beatrice Companies in March, it was a big step up for the president of Beatrice's international division and corporate senior vice president.

Roman Catholic reaction was restrained and cautious. (Page A4.) **********Californian Picked to Be Envoy **********President Reagan announced that he would nominate William A. Wilson, a California industrialist and real estate developer, to serve as the United States Ambassador to the Holy See. Mr. Wilson, a longtime friend of the President, has been serving as the President's personal representative to the Vatican since 1981. **********The Vatican's representative in Washington, Archbishop Pio Laghi, serves as an apostolic delegate, the envoy of the Pope in foreign countries with which the Vatican has no diplomatic relations. Under the action taken today, he or his successor would serve as a papal nuncio. **********Establishment of full diplomatic ties with the Vatican was made possible by a move by Congress last year lifting a prohibition on diplomatic relations enacted in 1867.

Roosevelt, some Presidents have sent personal representatives to the Holy See, but attempts to upgrade the diplomatic contact have been opposed. In November, however, when Congress repealed the 1867 ban, there was no debate in either the House or the Senate, and therefore there was little public attention. **********A spokesman for Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., Republican of Tennessee, the Senate majority leader, said it was too early to tell whether there would be any strong opposition to the Administration's move today. Such opposition could take shape either in the appropriations process or in the confirmation proceedings for Mr. Wilson. **********Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina and and a candidate for his party's Presidential nomination, said he would oppose elevating the special representative to the rank of ambassador.

This was also the view of the office of Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, who led the effort to permit the establishment of diplomatic relations. **********In defending the action today, Administration officials noted that 106 other countries have full diplomatic relations with the Vatican. Two years ago, Britain established diplomatic ties on the eve of the first visit by a Pope to Britain since King Henry VIII broke with the church in the 16th century. **********Both Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, and John Hughes, the State Department spokesman, said there was no violation of the separation of church and state because the United States was recognizing the Holy See, rather than the Roman Catholic Church itself.   Pope Held 'in High Esteem' **********''The United States holds Pope John Paul II in high esteem,'' Mr. Speakes said. ''We respect the great moral and political influence which he and the Vatican exercise throughout the world. We admire the courageous stands he takes in defense of Western values.'' **********Mr. Reagan, who is a member of the Christian Church-Disciples of Christ, issued no public comment on today's action. **********For all its historical importance, the announcement today was made in a somewhat low-key manner. It came after several weeks of discussion between the Vatican and American representatives and came at Mr. Hughes's regular daily briefing, at which he read a statement: **********''The United States of America and the Holy See, in the desire to further promote the existing mutual friendly relations, have decided by common agreement to establish diplomatic relations between them at the level of embassy on the part of the United States of America, and nunciature on the part of the Holy See, as of today, Jan. 10, 1984.'' **********A nearly identical announcement was issued at the Vatican this morning: **********''The Holy See and the United States of Amerca, desiring to develop the mutual friendly relations already existing, have decided by common accord to establish diplomatic relations at the level of apostolic nunciature on the side of the Holy See and of embassy on the side of the United States beginning today, Jan. 10, 1984.''  May Help Win Catholic Support **********Several White House and Republican political strategists said today that they thought the move by Mr. Reagan would help win support among Roman Catholic voters, although they emphasized their view that this was not Mr. Reagan's motive. **********Some questioned, however, whether this support would be undermined by defections among Protestant or Jewish groups opposed to the action today. **********''There was no real hue and cry up here for this,'' a Republican aide in the Senate said. ''I think you're going to hear some grumbling and grousing, rekindling some of the religious bigotry that's still within this country.'' **********But a key White House official said public reaction to Mr. Reagan's move was likely to be favorable. **********''I would say it's a positive,'' said the official, Faith Ryan Whittlesey, assistant to the President for public liaison.

They suggested that Continental was not an attractive takeover target for most American banks because it lacks the kind of major retail base that, for example, made the ailing Seafirst in Seattle such an attractive takeover for Bank of America, which instantly gained a substantial market in the Northwest. **********By contrast, Continental is principally a corporate and international bank, which would create overlaps for the few American buyers that could afford to buy a bank the size of Continental. **********''It's easier to see a foreign bank interested because there would be overlaps for most big American banks,'' said Stephen Berman, an analyst at L. F. Rothschild, Unterberg Towbin. **********Nonetheless, First National of Chicago was mentioned as a potential acquiror; it could thus end up with a virtual monopoly in the Middle West.   Potential Suitors Cited **********Banking sources also suggested Security Pacific in Los Angeles and Chemical Bank of New York may be potential suitors because they are not as deeply involved in big corporate business as Continental is. **********Gaining access to Continental's corporate clients in the Chicago market was not seen as a particular benefit. Charles Vincent, an analyst at Provident National Bank, said major banks could gain cheaper access, as most have already done, through loan production offices, without having to pay such a high price to buy Continental and absorb the bank's portfolio of problem loans. **********The actual cost of acquiring Continental is incalculable. By the simplest measure, it would take about $411 million to buy all Continental's stock, assuming that all the bank's shares could be bought at yesterday's closing price of $10.25. **********But no one - not even the regulators - know Continental's real worth. On its books, it has a net worth of $2.2 billion. Thus, the purchaser at yesterday's stock price would be getting a real bargain. **********But Continental also reports problem loans of more than $2.3 billion, and no one knows how much of that will have to be written off. If it were the entire amount - which is extremely unlikely - this would wipe out the bank's net worth. **********The buyer then would have to restore the bank's capital position, requiring about $2 billion. **********These are the questions that will have to be answered as the authorities and potential buyers rummage through Continental's assets over the next few weeks.

He generally ruled out the large Japanese and European banks, because most of them already have subsidiaries in the United States. **********But even foreign bankers might find Continental unattractive because of its Chicago location. ''Your foreign banks that want access in all probability would rather have it done through New York,'' Mr. Vincent said. **********Another drawback for any suitor is Continental's lack of a branch system in Illinois, where branch banking is prohibited by statute. **********Bankers and analysts generally agreed that the infusion of capital by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the expanded credit line from banks and assurances from the Federal Reserve for support alleviated immediate fear that Continental might fail. But they asserted that the unprecedented commitment by the banks of $5.5 billion in lines of credit would not necessarily last the years it might take for Continental to rebuild its soundness and that a merger was the more likely route."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/19/business/l-letters-renting-to-mom-144625.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 244, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LETTERS ; Renting to Mom", "print_headline": "LETTERS ; Renting to Mom", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********In a discussion of the potential tax advantages of renting a residence to one's parents (''Helping to Support Mom and Dad,'' Personal Finance, July 15), a statement was made that, if followed literally, will result in loss of the tax benefit discussed.

It sounds rather like a new type of self-service laundry. But real estate developers and lawyers say it may become an increasingly common word in the lexicon of apartment ownership terms. **********Condops, or condominium/cooperatives, feature a combination of co-op and condominium characteristics, and are usually formed when a landlord divides a mixed-use commercial and residential building into several large condominiums, then subdivides one condominium into a residential cooperative. **********Such plans, still relatively rare, have been used to escape the so- called 80/20 rule, which prevents a cooperative from receiving more than 20 percent of its income from commercial renters, upon pain of the co-op's owners losing their standard homeowner income tax deductions. **********Condominiums, which are not covered by such restrictions, differ from co-ops in that tenants directly own their apartments rather than owning shares in a corporation that owns all the apartments in a building. **********One of the first such conversion projects in New York City, started nearly five years ago, is scheduled for a closing next month, after complex negotiations between lawyers and state and city regulatory officials. **********The project, at the corner of 82d Street and Madison Avenue, involves two connected five-story buildings at 24 and 26 East 82d Street. The sponsor, the Kreisel Company, which is primarily involved in real estate management in Manhattan, purchased the buildings in 1979 with Odyssey Partners, a New York investment concern. **********Upon the closing, Kreisel will have converted the two buildings - a total of 15 apartments and six commercial spaces - into seven condominium units. Each of the commercial spaces, occupied by a bookstore, an art gallery, a coffee shop, an antique store and a jewelry store (one is vacant), consists of one unit, while the seventh unit contains all 15 of the apartments. **********The residential units are on the second, third, fourth and fifth floors, while the commercial units - except for the art gallery, on the second floor of the building at 26 East 82d - are all on the street level. **********A completed conversion in this case means that the cooperative corporation owned by the purchasing tenants will own the residential condominium that contains the apartments, and the commercial tenants will own their stores. **********For the developer, as well as the tenants, it was a complicated business. For example, it involved filing two prospectuses with the State Attorney General's office: one for the co-op offering and one for the condominium offering. **********Moreover, the blurring of distinctions in the residential part of the building (it is only the residential units that are condops; the commercial spaces are pure condominiums) has led to some legal questions that have delayed the closing.  This spring, for example, the New York City tax assessor's office demanded a finer measurement of the apartments in the building. The city argued that the individual apartments were condominiums, and would thus have to be accurately measured for tax purposes. The developer argued, however, that the whole residential section of the two buildings formed one condominium unit, and thus the key dimension was the total of the residential space and not the individual units. **********Neil J. Kreisel, the 39-year-old president of Kreisel, said that although the apartments were remeasured, the city has indicated it would probably accept his company's original definition of the space. **********Within the residential condominium, the apartments were converted to a cooperative under a non-eviction plan, and so far, 10 of the apartments have been sold at an insider discount of about 50 percent. **********Insider prices ranged from about $200,000 for a six-room, two-bath apartment, to about $82,500 for a small, one-bedroom apartment. **********According to Mr. Kreisel, one of the problems that buyers of condop units face is negotiating a loan. ''Usually, when a bank lends, they get a clear- cut security,'' he said. ''Here it's a hybrid. The security consists of a share in a co-op corporation that in turn owns a condominium.'' At the 82d Street project, he added, the problem was eliminated by a blanket commitment of $1.5 million by Citibank to cover both the building mortgage and the individual buyers' loans. **********Todd S. Pickard, a partner in the law firm of Kronish, Lieb, Shainswit, Weiner & Hellman, which represented Kreisel, said that although conversions like that at the Kreisel property had become a bit more common, a more often-used method was still the so-called sandwich lease. **********Under that kind of plan, a landlord agrees to lease the commercial space from a cooperative and pay the corporation the maximum 20 percent of its total income allowed by law. The landlord then rents out the commercial space at market rates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/07/business/small-investors-adopt-wait-and-see-attitude.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1984-08-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 665, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SMALL INVESTORS ADOPT WAIT-AND-SEE ATTITUDE", "print_headline": "SMALL INVESTORS ADOPT WAIT-AND-SEE ATTITUDE", "body_text": " **********At T.

The line waiting to use a stock quotation machine extended out the door. **********Not since the bull market that began in August 1982 have small investors been so fascinated with stocks. The record volume and runup in share prices that began early last week, which culminated Friday with a 36-point increase in the Dow Jones industrial average, have spurred a wave of small-investor interest. **********Small Investors on Sidelines **********So far, however, that interest, on the Big Board at least, has been confined to just that, Wall Street experts say. Although some small investors have bought stocks heavily in recent days, these experts say the recent rally has been fueled almost totally by institutions, with individuals either selling their stocks or remaining on the sidelines. **********''Our individual customers have been moderate sellers of stock in the last week,'' reported Richard T. McCabe, a vice president for market analysis at Merrill Lynch. **********Brokerages said a lot of the calls they received yesterday were from small investors seeking information, not a transaction. **********Some theorize that small investors are shunning larger issues on the Big Board and instead are buying heavily into smaller, lesser-known and less- expensive issues on the American Stock Exchange and in the over-the- counter market. Indeed, both exchanges reported extremely heavy trading yesterday: Amex volume of 114.7 million shares was its fifth-highest ever and the highest this year; Nasdaq trading, which had a record volume of 122.2 million Friday, cooled a bit, to 115.1 million shares. **********Wall Street firms are still trying to determine what part of last week's trading involved individuals, as opposed to institutions such as banks, insurance companies and pension funds. Some preliminary reports, however, estimate that up to 90 percent of the trading was confined to bigger organizations. **********Although a number of big investment companies said they have experienced a sudden transfer of dollars from money market mutual funds into stocks, most suspect that the funds are being transferred primarily by institutions rather than small savers. T. Rowe Price, for instance, says its stock funds grew by $47 million last Wednesday and Thursday combined. But Steven E. Norwitz, a spokesman for the group, said, ''We suspect that practically all of that movement was by professional money managers and advisers.'' **********Not Yet Convinced **********Just why individual investors have chosen to remain spectators in the current Big Board rally is difficult to say, largely because there are millions of investors each making investment choices for different reasons. **********It appears, however, that many are not yet convinced that last week's rally - and the continued furious pace of trading yesterday - truly constitutes a bull market that will last. Of 12 small investors interviewed late yesterday, for example, only one said he believed the rally would be long-lived. The remaining 11 said they will take a wait-and-see attitude before plunging into stocks. **********Michael H. Kardish, for example, a service engineer for the Digital Equipment Corporation, spent more than 30 minutes watching Merrill Lynch's Grand Central Station ticker yesterday. But citing the persistence of high interest rates and the possibility of a renewed bout of inflation, Mr. Kardish said he doubts the rally will endure. He thus has refused to buy heavily into the stock market. **********Frank G. Pidoto, an insurance auditor, voiced similar skepticism about the rally's longevity. Waiting during yesterday's lunch hour to punch a ticker symbol into a price quotation machine, Mr. Pidoto said, ''I'm going to wait a week to see if the high volume keeps up.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/18/world/mt-fuji-sacred-scenic-and-now-crumbling.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1984-09-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1166, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MT.

But rock and sand slides believed to have begun 10 centuries ago occur steadily now, and engineers say they fear Fuji could one day lose its nearly perfect conical shape. **********The erosion is obvious all around the mountain, which is classified by the Japanese as an active volcano, although it has not erupted since 1707. **********Nowhere is the problem more serious than on a southwestern wall facing this city nine miles away. An enormous crevice straddles a dry riverbed, and it keeps getting wider, stretching the length of six football fields in places and forming a valley more than 100 yards deep. If nothing is done, Government officials say, the mountain may well split in the next 100 years from its foot to its summit, 12,385 feet up. **********Government Has a Plan **********So the Construction Ministry, after 10 years of studying the problem, intends to patch up Fuji by building a barrier in the hope it will arrest the cascade that tears away some 300,000 tons of mountainside a year. **********Starting late this month, the ministry will put up a concrete wall at a point 7,200 feet high, where deterioration is especially severe along the winding bed of the Osawa River. **********The wall is supposed to be 10 feet thick, 16 feet tall and 55 feet long - a cement Band-Aid, really. Fuji is so large that the construction should be invisible from a distance. Nevertheless, the ministry says it believes it will be enough to stop the slides, or at least slow them. **********''If we do nothing, the part of the mountain below the wall we are building would deteriorate further,'' said a project supervisor, Noboru Miyamoto. ''The valley would get wider and wider. Sand and stones would keep coming down, and Fujinomiya City could even face danger one day.'' **********'Test Wall' Seems to Work **********A smaller ''test wall'' was built in 1982 not far from the new construction site, and it seemed to work. So did concrete barriers that were constructed north of Fujinomiya 12 years ago to hold back approaching rock slides from another section of mountain. **********Concern for Fujinomiya's welfare aside, it would be impossible for the Government to sit by idly as Fuji deteriorates. It is hardly just another mountain. **********Long ago, most Japanese considered it a sacred place. While that is no longer so, there are some 200 groups that continue to worship Fuji as part of a religious discipline with Buddhist and Shinto elements. **********''The mountain itself is God,'' said Kiyoshige Ida, 68 years old, a sendatsu, or guide, for one such group. At least twice a year, dressed in traditional white robes and rice-straw sandals, Mr. Ida leads pilgrims to the peak, where a Shinto shrine stands. **********''All year round,'' Mr. Ida said, ''I feel Fuji calling me.'' **********Still a Marvel **********Most Japanese understand. Even for the majority who do not think of the mountain as sacred, it remains a beckoning symbol that reminds them they are Japanese. Here in Fujinomiya, the mountain is a familiar neighbor, but people still marvel on crisp winter nights when the snow- topped peak glistens under the moon. **********This summer, a man whose legs were paralyzed pushed himself to the top on his arms. Last year, a 98-year- old man made the ascent. A group of 16 blind people also did it, as did a man in a wheelchair. **********Foreigners fall under the spell, too. It is hard to imagine anyone, save those with deadened souls, who can look at the graceful slopes from afar and not feel the heart leap. **********Can Be Seen From Tokyo **********On clear days, Fuji can be seen from Tokyo, 60 miles northeast, and beyond. Unfortunately, much of the year it is not so much a mountain as an allegation, obscured by clouds and industrial haze. No matter. People find it as irresistible as did Basho, a 17th-century poet who wrote:    Rain obscures the scene; But Fuji still exerts a charm Even when unseen. **********Up close, along its trails of sand and porous volcanic rock, Fuji is the ravishing beauty who turns out to be all pocked and scarred. It is dishearteningly filthy in places, a dumping ground for visitors who somehow could not carry their trash back down. **********In the last official climbing season in July and August, 1.1 million people made it to the halfway point, reachable by road, and 160,000 more went on foot to the top - a rate of more than 100 every hour of the day. Many wait until nighttime to begin, so they can watch the rising sun near the summit.   It Can Be Dangerous **********For all its appeal, the mountain is dangerous. In 1980, 12 people were crushed to death when boulders up to six feet in diameter came sliding suddenly down a popular trail. The local prefectural government is talking now about building protective concrete shelters along the route. **********Air turbulence around Fuji is a constant hazard for planes whose pilots sometimes get too close trying to give passengers a good view. That is what was assumed to have happened in 1966 to a British airliner that broke up as it approached the mountain, killing all 124 people aboard. **********There is always speculation about when the long-dormant volcano will explode again. Masatoshi Sagara, a meteorologist, wrote a best-selling book predicting an eruption in September 1983. Enough people believed him to flee the area for a while. But they are back, and at last look the mountain was still there. **********Now, the Construction Ministry says, a bigger threat is the more mundane erosion.   Project to Take 5 Years **********It will not be an easy task to shore up the mountain, according to the ministry's Mr. Miyamoto. The project is expected to take five years because weather is too severe except in summer. Slides will probably hinder workers, who were briefly forced in 1982 to abandon the test-wall site when boulders fell on them. **********Moreover, the only land access is along a narrow, winding mountain path favored by Mr. Ida and other visitors. It cannot possibly accommodate construction material, so all supplies will have to be dropped in by helicopter. **********The inevitable larger question is whether success can be guaranteed. Mr. Miyamoto's response was a candid ''I don't know.'' **********And Mr. Ida, who has climbed the mountain more than 140 times, was more skeptical. **********''If construction can stop the decay, I am willing to accept concrete walls,'' he said. ''We want Fuji to be safe. But actually, I am not convinced that even modern scientific technology can do anything to stop the work of nature.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/05/business/loan-for-korean-bank.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 79, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Loan for Korean Bank", "print_headline": "Loan for Korean Bank", "body_text": " **********A group of foreign banks is scheduled to sign an agreement on April 12 in New York to lend the state-run Korea Exchange Bank $600 million, the bank said today.

Long frowned on by Englishmen who fancied themselves ''determined amateurs,'' as one educator put it, graduate-level management education is only a relatively recent phenomenon in the British business world. **********Even now, as American business schools churn out 60,000 M.B.A.'s a year, British management education is far from established - or accepted - in either academic or business circles. Only a handful of universities offer business courses, producing - by the most generous of estimates - 1,500 master's graduates a year, many of them students from Europe or America, where an M.B.A. has a higher value. **********Indeed, most British educators and businessmen indicate that management education here is still struggling to attain the legitimacy attached to M.B.A. programs in other countries. ''One of the failings of our system is the belief that management isn't something you have to be taught, that you learn it by the seat of your pants - something in which the American, Japanese and Germans have proven us wrong,'' observed Michael Brandon-Bravo, assistant provost of the City of London Polytechnic, one of Britain's largest centers of undergraduate business training. ''Management education here is well behind almost everywhere in the world.'' The M.B.A. must overcome deep-seated resistance at several levels. Among academics, notes Professor Keith Thurley of the London School of Economics, ''the quality of business studies has been seen as very doubtful. There are many who see business studies as really quite boring, and applicants as lower-quality people who are not proper academics.'' **********More important is a general distrust of management schools and their graduates by the British business establishment. Informal systems of apprenticeship and working one's way up from the bottom are still widely cherished practices, and many firms in the City, London's financial district, prefer an ''Oxbridge'' graduate untrained in management practices to the postgraduate with formal business education. A spokesman for Barclay's Bank argued the case of many employers: ''Someone coming along with a degree doesn't really give them a right to a job, does it?'' **********At the same time, employers seem to question both the scope and the quality of Britain's management education, in which course work ranges from 10 months to two years. ''In terms of M.B.A. programs, I believe too much of what they're doing is a sort of warmed-over American practice,'' said John Egan, chief operating officer of Jaguar Cars and one of the first graduates of the London Business School. ''There are some absolutely real basics of our industry that they largely ignore.'' **********But some experts see real progress in Britain's business schools. The London and Manchester Business Schools are cited most often for attracting both students and faculty of increasingly higher quality, and a survey by the Manchester Business School of its 1973 graduates found that 44 percent held senior management positions in their companies, and 47 percent sat on corporate boards. The Cranfield School of Management, said to be the most demanding of Britain's programs, is often compared with M.I.T.'s Sloane School of Management because of its connections with the Cranfield Insititute of Technology. But its educational approach is actually closer to Harvard's, with case studies dominating the teaching. **********Separately, undergraduate business programs at Britain's 60-odd polytechnic institutes have witnessed a dramatic surge in popularity over the last decade, and short executive courses at universities are gaining more attention - and funding - from corporations. Brian Griffiths, dean of the City University Business School, credits Margaret Thatcher's conservative Government with cultivating private enterprise and, thus, an environment more receptive to business education. **********Even Oxford University, traditionally a center of anti-business sentiment, has discovered management education. The Oxford Centre for Management Studies, an autonomous institution, grants a master's of philosophy through the university; this autumn, through a $4.6 million gift from American financier John Templeton, the center will become a college in its own right, with about 15 to 20 students of its own. **********In the end, what British business schools may need most is to dissociate themselves from the American business schools after which most were modeled (most British schools still require applicants to take the American Graduate Management Aptitude Test, even though, one expert observed, ''Europeans find it impossible''). A survey by the London Business School found that businessmen rated the executive education courses at the London and Manchester schools relatively highly - but rated the Harvard Business School much higher. ''The hard fact,'' said Professor Thurley of the London School of Economics, ''is that if you produce a local version, it never has the prestige of a Harvard or a Stanford.'' **********Below, a look at some of Britain's top management schools."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/24/business/business-digest-143825.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 608, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********TUESDAY, APRIL 24, 1984 **********Companies **********Partners in the Seabrook nuclear project moved to take over financial management of the plant after its lead utility, Public Service of New Hampshire, defaulted Friday on its 35.5 percent share of expenses, according to executives of two of the partners.

Should the military be found responsible for Mr. Aquino's death, he said, those named would be immediately suspended from duty and then court-martialed. **********Mr. Marcos's comment was widely seen here as an effort to put some distance between himself and the military's position, which has been challenged by witnesses who testified before a panel of inquiry into the August 1983 slaying.

It said: **********''Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales was safely delivered of a son at 4:20 P.M. today. Her Royal Highness and child are both well.'' **********The child was delivered by the royal gynecologist, George Pinker, who also delivered Prince William and seven other royal children. **********Prince Charles left the hospital early this evening, telling the crowds outside that his new son had pale blue eyes and hair of ''an indeterminate color.'' **********The Prince, an avid sportsman, commented that ''we have nearly got a full polo team now.'' **********He added: ''My wife is very well. The delivery couldn't have been better. It was much quicker this time than last time.''  Difficult Pregnancy **********The Princess had a difficult pregnancy, complaining of almost continuous morning sickness, but she kept her public engagements until six weeks ago. For most of the summer, she rested in the seclusion of her stately home in Gloucestershire, Highgrove, about 90 minutes northwest of London. **********The Princess has often expressed resentment about the intense attention she and the Prince have received. But the press and the public were kept well back from the hospital today. **********To the crowds waiting outside, the news was broken by a town crier, Julian Shepherd, who stood in red Georgian regalia and rang a bell before making the announcement. But he was there in no official capacity; he had been hired earlier today by a Japanese film crew. **********Earl Spencer, the 23-year-old Princess's ebullient father, greeted the news by hoisting the family standard above Althorp, the stately home near Northampton where Spencers have lived for more than 500 years. **********''All went very well,'' he said. ''I think the person who will be very pleased will be Prince William, because it will be wonderful for him to have a little companion and a playmate.'' **********The Princess is expected to spend a day or so resting in her private room in the Lindo Wing of the hospital. Rooms there cost about $175 a day but are plainly furnished, with only a bed, a single overstuffed armchair and a small color television set.   Brother May Visit **********Prince William, who was born in the hospital on June 21, 1982, may be taken there to see his brother within 48 hours. Joanna Finn, a unit administrator, said that ''it is generally encouraged to introduce young children to the new baby to help bonding.'' **********Congratulations began arriving only minutes after the birth. Buckingham Palace said the Queen and the royal family were ''delighted.'' **********William Hill, the bookmakers, immediately began taking bets on the name of the new Prince, quoting George as the favorite (after his great- grandfather and a long line of Hanoverian kings) and Philip as the next most likely choice (after his grandfather, the Queen's consort, the Duke of Edinburgh)."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/16/business/wary-bankers-reject-an-argentine-proposal.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Bennett", "pub_date": "1984-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 751, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WARY BANKERS REJECT AN ARGENTINE PROPOSAL", "print_headline": "WARY BANKERS REJECT AN ARGENTINE PROPOSAL", "body_text": " **********A group of leading international bankers yesterday declined to agree to an arrangement under which Argentina would pay hundreds of millions of dollars in past-due interest to banks around the world. **********If the banks had accepted the Argentine proposal, it would have enabled them to avoid having to report large and embarrassing reductions in their second-quarter earnings. **********If Argentina could strike a deal with the banks, it would be under much less pressure to agree to an austerity program with the International Monetary Fund. The banks see themselves as partners with the I.M.F. in resolving the debt crisis, so they want to keep up pressure on Buenos Aires to reach an accord with the I.M.F. **********Meanwhile, the bankers are still negotiating with Argentina. Because of the complexities of collecting the money and distributing it to hundreds of banks around the world, they said, a resolution of the debt issue would have to be reached by next week if negative effects on second-quarter earnings are to be avoided. **********Under the proposed arrangement, the banks would receive about $450 million from Argentina of which about $325 million would come from Argentina's reserves. The rest would come from a new loan extended by the banks themselves. But the banks would be assured of repayment on the loan through an arrangement between Argentina and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. **********The meeting of an 11-bank steering committee, which represents hundreds of Argentina's creditor banks around the world, was held at the New York law offices of Shearman & Sterling, Citicorp's law firm. **********Before yesterday's meeting, interviews with bankers made it apparent that they were becoming increasingly disturbed by Argentina's refusal to come to terms with the International Monetary Fund over an austerity program intended to improve Argentina's international financial position. **********Some of the bankers said they were especially perturbed by the Argentine offer because they saw it as a ploy to drive a wedge between the banks and the I.M.F. **********Some leading Argentine politicians have openly recommended that Argentina work directly with the banks and ignore the I.M.F. If that could be done, and if Argentina could receive new loans from the banks, it could avoid having to accept the austerity measures urged by the I.M.F. **********During the two-year-old debt crisis, however, the banks and the I.M.F. have worked in close harmony, and most bankers have become extremely reluctant to do anything that would undermine their institutional associate, even if it meant sharp earnings declines for themselves. **********Thus, according to banking sources, the debate yesterday was over whether the repayment, which would involve a new loan from the banks, should be accepted without a clear nod from Jacques de Larosi ere, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. **********The Argentine offer that the banks discussed yesterday was similar in some ways to the one at the end of March. The banks would have lent Argentina about $100 million, with the same assurances from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Argentina would have put up about $350 million of its own money. **********This quarter as last, the emergency package is considered urgent because American banks must place any loan on which payments are late by 90 days or more on a ''nonaccrual'' basis. That means the banks could not have counted toward their first-quarter earnings any income earned on the loans unless it was collected in cash. In addition, they would have had to deduct from first-quarter earnings any interest they had accrued on the loans in previous quarters. **********Yesterday the banks were facing a similar situation, with the approach of the end of the second quarter. But, because of the recent run on the Continental Illinois Bank and Trust Company of Chicago and because of a general decline in confidence in the banking system, it was feared that if Argentina's loans were to fall into nonaccrual status the effects could be much worse than they would have been three months ago. **********The 11 banks at yesterday's meeting consisted of the ''steering committee,'' which represents all Argentina's foreign-bank creditors. Any decisions made by the steering committee must ultimately be approved by the other banks. **********The banks that are members of the steering committee are Citibank (which acts as chairman), the Bank of America, the Bank of Tokyo, the Chase Manhattan Bank, Credit Lyonnais of France, Credit Suisse, Dresdner Bank of West Germany, Lloyds Bank of Britain, the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company and the Royal Bank of Canada."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/22/business/business-people-apparel-executive-fills-top-post-for-kellwood.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1984-08-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 322, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "APPAREL EXECUTIVE FILLS TOP POST FOR KELLWOOD", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; APPAREL EXECUTIVE FILLS TOP POST FOR KELLWOOD", "body_text": " **********William J.

Similar talks, they added, are expected to open with Brazil next fall. **********In both cases, the negotiations are expected to result in substantial reductions in interest received by the banks from these countries and in a lengthening of the time over which the banks will be repaid. It would include extended grace periods in which no payments at all would be required. **********Most important, the refinancing would apply to payments coming due not only during the next one or two years but also perhaps for the next five or six years. **********Emergence of a New Phase **********The banks' announcement indicated that a new phase in the international debt crisis had begun, in which the banking community would agree to make bigger concessions than before and to seek longer-term solutions. If the new approach works as planned, it would transform much of the debt problem from a crisis atmosphere to something less frenetic. **********The new approach mainly reflects the substantial economic progress made by Mexico and Brazil.

Preston, chairman of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, in an interview today at the 1984 International Monetary Conference here. **********Reasons for Encouragement **********''Statistically, we all should be encouraged about Mexico and Brazil,'' he said, ''but because of unrelated problems - the rise in interest rates and the run on Continental - there's a different perception out there about the debt problem.'' **********''The nervousness out there was greater than we thought it was,'' added John G. McGillicuddy, chairman of the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation. **********The agreement on Mexico's debt problem was worked out Monday night at a closed meeting among leading bankers attending the conference here, together with Jacques de la Rosi ere, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and Paul A.

Rhodes, senior vice president of Citibank, who is also co-chairman of the group of banks handling Mexico's debt. **********Exact Terms Remain Unclear **********Mr. Rhodes said it was too early to say exactly what terms Mexico would receive in refinancing its debt, but he said they would be better than it got when its payments falling due between Aug. 31, 1982, and Dec. 31, 1984, were rescheduled for eight years, including a grace period of four years. **********In addition to defusing the crisis atmosphere, the concessions to be offered to Mexico and Brazil are expected to strengthen the banks' strategy in dealing with other nations. **********Especially important, according to some bankers here, it will be made clear that each country is to be dealt with on an individual basis and that debtors such as Mexico and Brazil that accept strong economic austerity measures will be rewarded. **********Bloc Perception Is Fading **********''In recent months we've moved sharply away from looking at the Latin American countries as a group,'' said Willard C. Butcher, chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank. **********The easing of terms for some countries and not for others is also expected to reduce the possibility of the debtor nations acting as a bloc in dealing with the banks. **********For their part, the bankers attribute the more generous terms primarily to the substantial economic improvement made by Mexico and, to a lesser degree, by Brazil. **********Mr. de la Rosi ere, for example, described Mexico as ''a striking example of how a country making impressive progress toward adjustment is paving the way back to normal access to the financial markets.'' **********Mexican Improvement Noted **********According to Walter B. Wriston, chairman of Citibank, Mexico's current account swung to a surplus of $5.5 billion last year, in contrast to a deficit of $13 billion three years ago. During that period, its trade surplus doubled, to $13.7 billion. Mr. Wriston predicted that Mexico's economy would resume growing this year, probably growing by 2 to 3 percent, and that next year it should accelerate to 5 or 6 percent. ''All this was done by a skillful financial team and a determined Government,'' Mr. Wriston said. ''It is a pattern that can be repeated by many other countries.'' **********Bankers here predicted that Mexico would not need any substantial new money in 1985. **********''The third-world debt problem is becoming less and less a crisis,'' Mr. Butcher said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/28/business/business-digest-113925.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-11-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 648, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 1984 **********Tax Proposals **********The Treasury presented its proposal to restructure the nation's tax system.

Regan charged today that Paul A. Volcker's ''remarkably tight'' management of the money supply was slowing economic growth and hurting the Christmas shopping season. **********This was the Administration's most extensive and pointed public criticism of the Federal Reserve chairman in months. The Federal Reserve System, the nation's central bank, is an independent agency that is not directly answerable to the President. **********Mr. Regan, answering reporters' questions, said it was ''possible but not probable'' that the current economic lull would turn into a recession. He forecast slight improvement during the next six months but said it would probably be mid-1985 before the economy returned to the 4 percent growth rate that the Administration is counting on to help reduce Federal budget deficits. **********Negotiations on Tax Plans **********In an hourlong breakfast with reporters, the Treasury Secretary also said he had begun sounding out Republican and Democratic proponents of tax overhaul in Congress to see how to combine the best elements of their proposals with the Treasury's tax plan and produce ''a superior package'' to send to Congress in February. **********Shrugging aside suggestions that the Treasury's plan was a political ''orphan,'' Mr. Regan said he definitely expected Presidential approval ''after we've polished ours up a little bit.'' He disputed recent criticism that the plan would harm economic growth by inhibiting business investment, but he said, ''If it can be proved to us that we are, certainly we'll change it.'' In an ebullient mood, Mr. Regan vigorously argued for holding military spending in the budget for the fiscal year 1986, which is being prepared, to ''approximately the same level'' as this year. **********Clashing with Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, he said the Administration's proposals for cuts in other programs ''don't have a prayer'' in Congress without Pentagon restraint. **********But Mr. Regan directed his sharpest comments at the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. **********As for Mr. Volcker's handling of the money supply, ''I think he's been a little penurious, remarkably tight,'' the Treasury Secretary declared. **********Outlook for Money Supply **********''I read with a great deal of apprehension the fact that many economists are saying that this week the money supply is going to go down again substantially and wipe out that bulge of a couple of weeks ago,'' Mr. Regan went on. ''Well, that's a hell of a way to start the first week of December, with a big negative number, when this supposedly is a point in time when the Fed is supposedly trying for a 6 percent growth.'' **********Later he added: ''This is not a great Christmas as near as I can find out from anecdotal evidence. And the reason is that people just aren't spending because the credit terms are so high - 21 percent, 22 percent on charge plates and things of that nature, 13 to 14 percent on automobiles, still.'' **********No Comment From the FedA spokesman for the Federal Reserve Board, Joseph R. Coyne, said Mr. Volcker would have no comment on Mr. Regan's remarks. **********Secretary Regan and White House officials have been tilting against the Federal Reserve System intermittently since 1981. **********Last spring the White House staff was fearful that a tightening of the Federal Reserve's credit policy, such as was occurring at that time, might set back the economy and hamper the President's re-election campaign. When people complain that the Federal Reserve's policy is too tight, they want it to pump more money into the banking system through its open- market purchases of Government securities. **********President Reagan put a stop to such criticism last summer, however. Today's was the most forceful Administration critique since then. **********It was reinforced by Secretary Regan's disclosure that the Treasury department - ''at a low level, not at any high level'' - was examining proposals to bring the Federal Reserve under greater influence by the Administration. **********He declined to be drawn into details because ''I'm not sure that they're my suggestions yet.'' He asserted, ''There's been no decision made on the part of the Administration as to what its position should be.'' **********Emphasizing his own frustration with Federal Reserve policy, however, Mr. Regan gave a fairly long rationale for bringing the agency under Administration control. He cited Japan, Britain, France and West Germany as prosperous countries where elected officials control the central bank. He also recalled the recurring battles of previous Presidents, such as Harry S. Truman and Franklin D. Roosevelt, with the Federal Reserve. **********Representative Jack Kemp, Republican of upstate New York, has introduced legislation intended to reduce the independence of the Federal Reserve by proposing that the Treasury Secretary be made an automatic member of the agency's board of governors and that the term of its chairman coincide with the President's term. **********In the past, Congress has deliberately sought to protect Federal Reserve independence by keeping Administration officials off the board and by making the chairman's term start and end in the middle of a Presidential term. Mr. Volcker was first appointed by President Carter in 1979 and was reappointed by President Reagan in 1983. **********A high Treasury official said today that Secretary Regan's remarks were more a reflection of impatience with Federal Reserve policies than an indication of a serious intention to revamp the central bank. **********''Nobody is meeting to produce a crash program to present to the White House,'' this official said. ''The Secretary's not about to run across the street and make recommendations to the White House.'' **********On a separate matter, Mr. Regan said he did not know whether the President would propose to abolish the Council of Economic Advisers because ''I have not discussed the C.E.A. with the President.'' **********Providing Economic Advice **********But the Treasury Secretary, who is known to strongly favor such a move, suggested that it would suit him. ''I think the President should seek his economic advice where he's most comfortable and where he believes he's best served,'' Mr. Regan said. Asked where the President's economic advice is now coming from, Mr. Regan replied, ''I think he's getting it from me.'' **********When he was asked whether President Reagan had left the Treasury's tax plan an orphan by failing to endorse it, Secretary Regan quickly quipped: ''It's no orphan. I'm the father of it.'' **********''My question is when is the godfather going to adopt the baby,'' a reporter pursued. **********''Godfathers don't adopt the baby - they merely see that it grows up properly, as a rule,'' Mr. Regan parried. Then he added that there was time before the State of the Union Message in January for the President to back it. **********Conferring With Congress **********In terms of developing Congressional support, Mr. Regan said that he had met with Representative Kemp and Senator Robert W. Kasten Jr. of Wisconsin, co-sponsors of a Republican tax proposal, and that he intended to talk soon with Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, the co-sponsor with Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri of a similar Democratic tax proposal. **********All three plans call for replacing the current intricate structure of many tax rates with a ''modified flat tax'' of just two or three tiers of tax rates coupled with a vast reduction in tax deductions and tax preferences, broadening the revenue base. **********Senator Bradley, in addressing the National Press Club Tuesday, called the Administration's tax plan ''a very positive development'' and said he would ''put the issue of tax reform ahead of partisan politics.'' **********Because the three tax plans are similar, cooperation between the Treasury Department and the Congressional proponents of tax change had been expected. **********Some Resistance Found **********Most of the legislative resistance so far has come from Democratic leaders such as Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who has said that a tax plan must increase revenues to help reduce the Federal budget deficits, and Republicans such as Senator Bob Packwood, chairman of the Finance Committee, who has said he favors the present tax system. **********Answering charges from some economists that the Treasury's tax plan would hamper business investment by removing investment tax credits and accelerated-depreciation allowances, Mr. Regan contended that their analyses did not take fully into account all the offsetting provisions of the plan. He argued that economic growth would be spurred by 1990, when the tax plan would be completely in force. **********But he said he had an open mind on counterarguments, although he did not want to start ''bargaining'' with business about various provisions of the plan. **********''We can be persuaded if we're making a mistake,'' Mr. Regan said. ''I don't want to harm the economy by what we're doing. We don't think we are. But if it can be proved to us that we are, certainly we'll change. We're not dug in on it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/20/business/business-people-warn-industries-puts-3d-generation-at-helm.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 355, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Warn Industries Puts 3d Generation at Helm", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Warn Industries Puts 3d Generation at Helm", "body_text": " **********Michael T.

Staley, the chairman of Nynex, was made in a letter to the Federal Communications Commission that detailed the company's efforts to resolve problems in providing services to business customers. A similar letter from the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, released Thursday, stated that service in New York City was substantially worse than in the nation as a whole. **********Mr. Staley's letter, sent Thursday and released by the F.C.C. yesterday, did not comment directly on the A.T.&T. letter, but did acknowledge problems in providing services to businesses in New York. ''Every effort is being made to achieve such normal service levels by July 1,'' Mr. Staley said. **********The Nynex chairman said that problems in Nynex's service area, which encompasses New York State and New England, are confined mainly to midtown and lower Manhattan, although there have been some delays in service orders on Long Island and the suburbs north of the city. **********The letter from Nynex was one of a set sent by the regional telephone companies. They discussed private lines used by a single customer and WATS, a bulk discount long-distance service. **********Poor Coordination **********The letters indicated that the magnitude of delays in providing such services vary. But most of the companies disclosed severe problems in coordination between A.T.&T. and the regional companies, which were part of A.T.&T. until the Jan. 1 breakup of the company. **********Services such as private and WATS lines require the cooperation of A.T.&T., which provides the long-distance segment of the line, and of the local companies, which provide the local segment. But computerized systems used by A.T.&T. to place orders with the operating companies are not working properly and orders are getting logjammed. **********When A.T.&T. placed orders for the local work with Southwestern Bell, for instance, computer errors deleted necessary information from the order form. Pacific Telesis said it had received only 550 orders for WATS lines out of the backlog of 5,700 orders placed with A.T.&T. in its region. **********Solution Left to Companies **********The F.C.C. has indicated that it will let the companies try to solve the problems themselves, but would consider taking regulatory action if sufficient progress is not made. Michael Slomin, legal assistant to the chief of the F.C.C. common carrier bureau, said yesterday that the letters indicated the companies were making progress and that most problems should be solved within several months. **********Nynex said customers contribute to the order backlog by ordering earlier than they normally would because of fears of delays. In 70 percent of the backlogged orders, Nynex said, the customer was not ready for the service to be installed. ''This results in a manpower drain by causing two or more installation visits before the order is completed,'' the company said. **********The problem in Manhattan is that orders for service are backed up at A.T.&T. and not reaching New York Telephone. That flood of orders is expected to start coming through next month because A.T.&T. is adding more people to handle the problem. When that occurs, New York Telephone's backlog will grow again. **********The company said that if the increased load from A.T.&T. is back to normal by May 30, New York Telephone's backlog should return to normal by July 1. **********Rate Uncertainty **********Bell Atlantic, which serves New Jersey and other Middle Atlantic States, said service would not return to historic levels until uncertainty over rates is ended. It said it had been planning to introduce software improvements that would have automated its operations more fully in April, to meet the expected date that new access charges were to take effect. But the F.C.C.'s decision to postpone access charges has prompted Bell Atlantic to postpone the software improvements. **********The company nevertheless said that ''overall service performance in Bell Atlantic since divestiture has been as strong as it was before.'' **********Pacific Telesis, which serves California and Nevada, said normal service levels would not return until the middle of the summer. Ameritech, based in Chicago and serving five Middle Western states, said ''several months of extraordinary effort'' will be needed to return service to historic levels."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/26/business/new-national-leader.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 161, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New National Leader", "print_headline": "New National Leader", "body_text": " **********The National Leader, a two-year- old weekly publication for blacks, suspended publication with its Feb. 16 issue after accumulating $1.7 million in losses.

The billions once spent on petroleum are now staying at home, helping to lift personal incomes and finance purchases of more productive goods. **********But for the companies that saw the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries blossom into a major market from 1973 to 1981, the picture is quite different. **********Sales of heavy equipment, trucks and consumer goods, to name just a few areas, have fallen sharply in the past year because of the falloff in OPEC oil revenues. Data Resources Inc., which does economic analysis, said those revenues peaked in 1980, when the group's current accounts surplus hit $130 billion. **********Change May Last Years **********Besides the sales slump, orders for large construction projects have slowed dramatically. And with many economists projecting only small increases in oil prices over the next several years, companies face the prospect of a much-altered business environment throughout the decade, if not longer.''There has been a definite drop-off in our business with the OPEC nations,'' said Robert Winston, director of international trade policy at the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. ''And since we don't see a major turnaround in oil prices, it is likely to be long-term.'' **********Because of the lag between orders and shipments, the drop in business did not take place in lock step with the softening of oil prices. As a result, exports from OPEC's major suppliers - the United States, Japan and West Germany - continued to rise through 1982. **********The slowdown hit last year. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that exports from its 24 member nations to OPEC fell 8 percent last year. If figures from the United States, Japan and West Germany are any indication, however, that projection may be overly optimistic. **********Decline of 26 Percent **********After hitting a peak of $22.9 billion in 1982, exports from the United States to OPEC dropped 26 percent last year, to $16.9 billion, according to the Commerce Department. **********Japan did not do that badly, in part because the yen remained weak against the dollar, giving an edge to yen-priced goods. Nevertheless, statistics from the Japan Trade Center show that Japanese exports to OPEC in 1983 fell nearly 13 percent, to $19.07 billion. **********Year-end figures for West Germany are not available, but through November, Government figures show that export sales were down 17.5 percent from the 1982 period. **********As economists predicted, the impact of weakening oil revenues has been most severe on countries like Nigeria and Indonesia, with their large populations and dependence on oil revenues to finance imports. But rich countries like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have felt the pinch, too. They have been stretching out development programs and payments schedules. **********''One can say that the drop in oil revenues has had a fairly staggering impact in places like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, where Government budgets in terms of actual disbursements have dropped by as much as 30 percent to 40 percent,'' said Charles K. Ebinger, who is director of the energy and strategic resources program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University. **********''That decline has led to some abrogations of contracts, and the extension of contracts over longer periods, reducing the return on equity that might have been realized if the goods had been sold somewhere else,'' Mr. Ebinger said. **********'They Haven't Got the Money' **********An economist at a New York bank, who asked not to be identified, said: ''The needs in countries like Nigeria and Indonesia are still there, but they haven't got the money. And the richer countries, like Saudi Arabia, are being forced into a slower development mode because of the drop in revenue. As a consequence, they are moving away from the blockbuster, multibillion-dollar contracts.'' **********George J. Stathakis, president and chief executive officer at the General Electric Trading Company, estimates that G.E.'s sales to OPEC nations, which declined about 10 percent in 1982 from 1981, may have dropped an additional 20 percent last year. **********Mr. Stathakis said G.E.'s business had been hit hard in Venezuela and Nigeria. Those nations have been hurt by lower oil revenues and sharply higher debt payments. **********Saudi Arabia, which had grown to be one of G.E.'s top six markets, cut back, too. In retrospect, Mr. Stathakis said, the drop might have been expected. In some basic development projects, he said, the Saudis had ''reached a saturation point.'' **********Cordell W. Hull, chief financial officer at the Bechtel Group, the construction giant, said ''work has held up strongly in Saudi Arabia, but in other oil-producing countries like Venezuela and Indonesia, it has not been been what we would have liked.'' **********Ingersoll-Rand's Experience **********James E. Perella, executive vice president at Ingersoll-Rand, the heavy equipment manufacturer, said that sales to the group were cut in half last year and that new orders were almost nonexistent. ''We are seeing some evidence in interest through a rising number of inquiries from countries like Kuwait, but I don't understand why,'' he said. **********For competitive reasons, the executives would not be specific about how much their business had declined in particular countries. But Commerce Department figures provide a view of the slump. **********Sales of goods and services to Venezuela totaled $2.8 billion last year, down 46 percent from 1982. Exports to Nigeria fell 33 percent. Exports to Indonesia declined 28 percent, to $1.5 billion. The decrease was almost as severe in the wealthy Persian Gulf states. Saudi Arabia, which bought more than $9 billion of American exports in 1982, cut that by more than $1 billion last year, a drop of 12.4 percent. Sales to Kuwait fell 21 percent. **********Positive Aspects, Too There is, to be sure, a sunny side - the lift to the oil-importing economies. **********''People fail to remember that the big reduction in imports from OPEC very much helps other countries, including the United States,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''Since 1981, we have cut our oil imports by around $25 billion,'' he said. ''Without that drop, our horrendous trade deficit would be even worse.'' **********Economists say the prospect of flat oil prices is likely to change the way companies compete for business. **********''Over the next few years, a number of changes will occur in the OPEC market,'' an economist at the Commerce Department said. ''For starters, since they have a commodity to sell, it would be logical to expect that when someone bids on a project, they might have to accept payment in both cash and in oil.'' **********And he added: ''When the petrochemical plants in the Gulf states come on stream two or three years from now, it could be that they could say, 'If you want my oil, you'll also have to buy my petrochemical products.' '' **********Smaller Companies May Benefit **********With the move from larger contracts, the bank economist in New York said, ''the opportunity may lie with smaller companies who were unable to compete for enormous jobs.'' **********Joseph C. Story, a senior economist for the Wharton Middle East Economic Service, agreed. ''Big construction companies that did so well in the the 1970's are going to have to settle for smaller projects, and they will have to fight hard to get them,'' he said. ''But companies involved in general training and education, be it medical, engineering or the like, will find that countries like Saudi Arabia have provided large amounts of money in their budgets for those types of services.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/27/business/advertising-pentagon-to-renew-contract-with-ayer.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-09-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pentagon to Renew Contract With Ayer", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Pentagon to Renew Contract With Ayer", "body_text": " **********The Pentagon has decided to renew its contract with N.W.

He was silent as his lawyer pleaded not guilty. **********The hearing lasted less than four minutes and was crowded with journalists and onlookers. A preliminary hearing has been set for next Wednesday, with the actual trial likely to take place in late June. **********As workmen in the National Assembly began to patch bullet holes and replace bloodstained carpet, more details about the incident involving Corporal Lortie emerged. The legislature's sergeant-at-arms, Rene Jalbert, said at a news conference that he was not held hostage but rather chose to stay with Corporal Lortie in order to calm him. **********Mr. Jalbert, 63, a retired major in the Canadian Armed Forces, said he established the sort of rapport with Corporal Lortie that exists ''between an officer and an enlisted man.'' **********Mr. Jalbert said the soldier did not appear to have a clear motive in his remarks to him. Corporal Lortie said in a tape given to a local radio station that his motive was hatred for the Quebec government. **********Mr. Jalbert said he gained Corporal Lortie's respect by insisting that Corporal Lortie, 25, address him as major. ''He came back to reality as a soldier,'' Mr. Jalbert said. **********From this point, the sergeant-at- arms said, it was relatively easy to persuade Corporal Lortie to surrender to military police, who arrived from a nearby base."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/03/world/bolivia-arrests-100-in-attempted-coup-denies-cocaine-link.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 265, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BOLIVIA ARRESTS 100 IN ATTEMPTED COUP;DENIES COCAINE LINK", "print_headline": "BOLIVIA ARRESTS 100 IN ATTEMPTED COUP;DENIES COCAINE LINK", "body_text": " **********Two former Cabinet ministers and about 100 right-wing military officers, policemen and politicians have been arrested in the coup attempt that began with the kidnapping of President Hernan Siles Zuazo, officials said today. **********Col.

Only 12 copies escaped the agency's editing process ''some way or other,'' the President said. **********Today White House officials said the President had misspoken, meaning that only 12 copies of the manual had been sent to Washington. Administration officials still ''don't have all the information,'' one White House official said. **********' Offensive Language' Noted **********After a briefing today by C.I.A. officials, Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, said he had been told that ''the term 'neutralization' was in all the documents.'' **********Senator Nunn and Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, both of whom are members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, attended the C.I.A. briefing along with staff members. **********Mr. Nunn said, ''There were deletions before some printings were made and before some distributions were made.'' But he added that all copies of the manual ''had some of what would be called questionable to some and to others offensive language, including language relating to so-called 'neutralization.' '' **********Both Senators said that the C.I.A's investigation was not complete and that many questions had not been answered.   Rebel's Account Corroborated **********Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is deputy chairman of the Intelligence Committee, did not attend the meeting but was briefed on the discussion. ''The C.I.A.,'' he said, ''still has not told us who ordered this manual, who wrote it and who approved it.'' **********Also today, a Nicaraguan rebel officer, Alfonso Callejas Deshon, a senior director of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, said in an interview that 2,000 copies of the manual were printed. All contained the language advising the rebels to ''neutralize'' Sandinista officials, he said. **********Mr. Callejas corroborated the account given Saturday by Edgar Chamorro, the rebel leader who said he was in charge of publishing the manual. **********''I am not aware that there were any other editions,'' Mr. Callejas said. **********The manuals ''were given to some of our officers,'' he said. ''I saw quite a few of them'' in the rebels' headquarters in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. ''I was given one myself.'' **********The only editing the manual received was by the rebels themselves, who ripped two pages from some copies, Mr. Callejas said.   Contract Employee Blamed **********Also today, Stansfield Turner, who was director of the C.I.A. during the Carter Administration, said ''the President is trying to distance himself from this controversy'' by blaming it on ''a contract employee.'' **********The White House has said the manual was written by ''a low-level contract employee'' in Central America. But Mr. Turner said: ''A contract employee isn't just somebody they found out on the street. It can mean a retired agent brought back in. The only difference is that he isn't on the full-time Civil Service payroll.'' **********Congressional staff members said today that initial reports indicate the man, identified as John Kirkpatrick, was a C.I.A. employee during the Vietnam era who retired and was called back on contract recently. **********Mr. Turner said: ''With the tremendous expansion of covert activities'' during the Reagan Administration, ''they've had to call back a lot of old- time employees. And some of them are working under the old assumption that they can get away with a little more. They are used to working in secrecy.''  Pages Excised, Reagan Says **********On Sunday night, Mr. Reagan said, ''We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the C.I.A. advising, supposedly, on military tactics.'' **********''He drew up this manual'' and turned it over to a C.I.A. officer in the region, ''and a number of pages were excised by that agency head there,'' Mr. Reagan said. He added that the primer was sent to C.I.A. headquarters in Washington ''where more pages were excised before it was printed.'' **********''But some way or the other there were 12 of the original copies that got down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the C.I.A.'' **********Mr. Callejas said 2,000 copies of the manual, unedited, were printed by his own men in Honduras. **********''This man came down to give us advice,'' Mr. Callejas added, ''gave Mr. Chamorro and others a draft'' of the manual ''and they translated it.'' Mr. Chamorro was in charge of editing, ''and somehow this terrible advice escaped and was printed.''  Assassinations Are Disputed **********After the books were printed, Mr. Callejas said, ''we tore out pages 70 and 71,'' which included advice on hiring professional criminals. The criminals were to arrange the shooting deaths of other insurgents so that they would become martyrs. **********Mr. Callejas did quarrel with Mr. Chamarro's assertion that the rebels had assassinated Nicaraguan Government officials. **********On Saturday, Mr. Chamorro said in an interview: ''We do believe in the assassination of tyrants. Some Sandinistas are tyrants in the small villages.'' **********Mr. Chamorro used to be the rebels' official spokesman, but Mr. Callejas said ''he has not been authorized to speak for us since May.''

Statement of 'Concern' **********In addition, they said that despite the crisis in the Persian Gulf, Mr. Reagan had no strong feelings about the necessity of a statement about the war between Iran and Iraq. **********A top official said that a public statement by participants at the meeting would probably amount to an ''acknowledgement of concern'' about the Gulf situation, as well as the importance of diplomacy to reduce tensions, but ''nothing more,'' he said. **********In addition, American officials said that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, the host of the meeting, would seek a statement from the participants on terrorism. She is considered under some pressure to do so because of the recent shooting of a British police officer by someone inside the Libyan Embassy in London. **********Following the practice of past economic summit meetings, participants are to talk about economic issues during the regular sessions and political issues during their lunches and dinners. On occasion in the past, the political discussions turned out to be more important than the economic ones. **********That was the case last year at Williamsburg, Va., where Mr. Reagan pressed the allies to reiterate their support for the deployment of American medium-range missiles in Europe aimed at the Soviet Union.   Objections From France **********The possibility of any formal statement on political issues this year has been clouded by objections from France. French officials oppose any statements on noneconomic matters, even on terrorism. A French official said this week that a statement on terrorism would probably be ''absolutely useless.'' **********Mr. Reagan's noncommittal attitude toward a politial statement contrasts sharply with his insistence on a statement about the European missiles last year. A top aide explained the contrast by saying that ''last year, we were in the driver's seat,'' and this year, Mrs. Thatcher is in charge of the agenda. **********He said that if Mrs. Thatcher wanted a political statement on any subject, Mr. Reagan would probably support one. **********Mr. Reagan leaves Friday for Ireland, his first stop on the way to the summit meeting.   Vindication of Policies **********In briefings and conversations, Administration aides have made it clear that Mr. Reagan has limited economic objectives for the summit meeting, the 10th annual such gathering. Besides the United States, the participants are Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and the president of the European Economic Commission. **********Primarily, Administration aides said, Mr. Reagan will seek what they acknowledge would be a vindication of the economic policies he has been pursuing in the last three years. **********Although European and other critics are worried about high interest rates and high deficits in the United States, Mr. Reagan is expected to dismiss the criticism in much the way he has dismissed criticism from his opponents in this Presidential election year. **********With their minds on the election, in fact, Administration officials said that Mr. Reagan wants a peaceful summit meeting from which he would be able to say that his fellow allies agreed that ''America is back.''  No New Trade Initiatives **********In keeping with this tone, Mr. Reagan is not expected to press some of the items that have led to contention and disarray in past summit meetings. In particular, the United States plans no new initiatives to clamp down on trade between the West and the Soviet bloc. **********In an interview today with a group of television correspondents from participating countries, Mr. Reagan gave some indication of his line of defense on key issues, and to the contention that American high interest rates are caused by high deficits.  ''I don't believe the deficits have anything to do with our high interest rates,'' the President said, asserting that interest rates had gone down in the last few years, even though the deficit had gone up. **********In addition, he said that ''as a percentage of gross national product, we're not too out of line with our deficits, with the deficits of our allies there in the summit.'' **********He added that, in any case, the Senate and House were making progress toward approving a ''down payment'' that would reduce the deficit between now and 1987 by $150 million. **********Administration officials said that the summit meeting would be peaceful largely because so many countries now agree with the American priority of economic growth without inflation. **********A sign of this, they said, is that inflation in all the summit countries - including France and Italy - has dropped since 1981, and growth has risen. **********Three Economic Priorities **********Three major economic priorities were outlined today by a senior Administration official. **********First, he said, the United States would press for emphasis on reducing the role of government regulation and taxation in the West. **********Second, on the subject of the debt problems of developing nations, he said Mr. Reagan would seek a continuation of the existing approach. This would involve helping third world countries with short-term loans and greater access to outside markets for their exports. The President opposes further steps now, and is not expected to meet much resistance. **********Third, the official said, Mr. Reagan favors a commitment from the Western nations to a round of discussions next year to further lower tariff barriers. In principle, the participants always come out in favor of free trade, but in practice their record has been viewed as disappointing by United States officials."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/15/business/beatrice-tender.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 72, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Beatrice Tender", "print_headline": "Beatrice Tender", "body_text": " **********The Beatrice Companies said that about 20,259,000 shares of Esmark Inc. common stock, or 48 percent of the total outstanding, was tendered by Wednesday's withdrawal deadline. **********Some 607,000 shares of Esmark preferred, or 23 percent of the total outstanding, was also tendered.

He was arrested in 1980 when electrical workers in El Salvador went on strike, blacking out most of the country for 24 hours. **********The workers, members of the Union of Hydroelectrical Workers of the Lempa River, took part in a nationwide strike called to protest what they said was Government harassment of the union and its members. **********The Government charged Mr. Recinos and the nine other men with illegal possession of arms and acts of terrorism, saying that the strike was designed to support guerrilla efforts to disrupt the economy.

He left El Salvador earlier this year with his two younger brothers, Jaime, who is 13, and Luis, who is 7. He said in an interview here that they crossed illegally into California after traveling by foot and bus from Guatemala. **********The three were arrested by United States Border Patrol agents in Calexico, Calif. They were later released on bond and are living with their aunt in East Los Angeles pending resolution of their case. They have applied for political asylum in the United States. **********The younger Mr. Recinos said that his mother and sister were abducted from their home in 1982 by 16 armed men dressed in civilian clothing. His mother and sister, who was 13 at the time, have not been heard from since. **********''There is no justice in El Salvador,'' he said. ''There are no human rights.''  Kirkland Complains to Duarte **********Lane Kirkland, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., complained about the handling of the Recinos case in a letter to Mr. Duarte last month. The letter said, in part, that ''the lack of a trial after such a prolonged imprisonment constitutes a violation of the human rights of the persons involved.'' **********In August Representative Mel Levine, Democrat of California, and 12 other Democratic members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, sent a letter about the case to El Salvador's acting Ambassador in Washington, Roberto Jimenez Ortiz. **********The letter asked the Salvadoran Government to bring the case to trial ''in the interest of human rights and as evidence of its movement toward democracy.'' An aide to Mr. Levine said no response had been received from the embassy. **********Mr. Recinos and the other men who were arrested have charged that they were tortured. In an affidavit last year, Mr. Recinos said, ''I have experienced blows all over my body, my hands tied up, psychological torture, threats of death, no food for three days and 70 days of confinement in the general garrison of the national guard.''  Torture Charge Denied **********Salvadoran authorities have denied the men were tortured and have attributed delays in bringing their case to trial to the defendants' failure to arrange for proper legal representation. **********Last month, according to State Department officials, the United States Ambassador to El Salvador, Thomas R. Pickering, asked embassy officials to help make sure that a defense lawyer was properly registered with the court so the case could proceed.

He added that, ''although the economy has been growing at a healthy pace and inflation remains at a low level, it appears the money supply is not accommodating real economic growth.'' **********The Chase Manhattan Bank was the first bank to announce its rate rise today and its action was quickly followed by other major banks across the country. **********No Comment by Fed **********A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Board said there would be no comment on the criticism by Mr. Speakes. **********The statement by Mr. Speakes was the strongest White House criticism of the Fed since the onset of the recession in 1982. Then, as now, the White House was concerned that high interest rates would choke off economic growth. **********But Wall Street experts on the Fed offer a wholly different view. ''There's not a shred of evidence that the Fed is not accommodating the recovery,'' said John Paulus, chief economist at the investment banking firm of Morgan Stanley & Company. ''It's election-year politics as usual.'' **********Muted Alarms Issued **********In recent months, some Administration economists have issued muted alarms about the Fed's policy of curbing the growth of the supply of money. These economists agree that a generally strict monetary policy helps curb inflation, but some fear that, if the money supply is kept too tight, interest rates will rise. **********Others argue that a tight policy is in order, but that there should be greater efforts to reduce the Federal budget deficit. These economists, some of them in the Administration, privately express disappointment that President Reagan is not making more of an effort to reduce the deficit this year. **********A White House official said the continuing debate among Administration economists had heated up recently as it became obvious that the Fed was keeping a tight rein on the money supply. ''The pattern of their action is just now becoming clear,'' said the official, who asked not to be identified. **********Mr. Speakes said the Fed had kept to ''the absolute bottom'' of its target range for growth of the money supply. He added that the target for the growth of the M-1 measure - which includes currency, traveler's checks and checking accounts - had been between 4 and 8 percent. But in the last 13 weeks, he said, the growth had been 4 percent. **********Similarly, he said, for the M-2 measure - which includes M-1 plus Eurodollars, money market funds and savings deposits - the target range had been 6 to 9 percent, but the growth rate for the last 13 weeks had been 6 percent. **********'Systematic Predictable Pace' **********The Treasury's top economist, Assistant Secretary Manuel H. Johnson, also argued today that the Fed had been standing aside as interest rates have risen and growth of M-1 has slipped below the range the Fed had set for it this year. He urged, instead, that it be allowed to grow at the upper half of the range, at a rate of 6 to 8 percent. ''What they ought to be doing,'' he said, ''is allowing money to grow at a systematic predictable pace.'' **********The money supply figures, however, are nearly meaningless now, Fed watchers say. For example, M-1 has been distorted by the addition of negotiable order of withdrawal accounts, so it may have been reduced because NOW account customers are moving their funds into other investments. **********More important, said Mr. Paulus of Morgan Stanley, was the Fed's gauge for the growth of credit, its measure of consumer and business borrowing. The Fed set a range for it this year of 8 to 11 percent, but it has been growing at a rate of 12 to 13 percent, evidence, he added, that the Fed has been accommodating the recovery. **********''Rates are going up,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, ''because we're having an explosion of private-sector credit demand on top of a flood of Treasury borrowing'' to support Federal budget deficits. **********History of Ups and Downs **********The White House has had a history of ups and downs in its relation with the Fed and its chairman, Paul A. Volcker. Despite the fact that Mr. Volcker was reappointed to his post by President Reagan last August, White House officials have frequently expressed the hope that the Fed would not tighten money so greatly as to choke off the economic recovery. **********But the Administration's view is not monolithic; a debate has been going on for months between Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan and Martin S. Feldstein, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. **********Mr. Regan has been more quick to criticize the Fed for its tight-money policies, as he was in 1981 and 1982, and Mr. Feldstein has been more quick to attribute the problem of high interest rates to the large Federal deficit. **********Feldstein Support Cited **********But a White House official said today that Mr. Feldstein supported the statement putting the responsibility for the rise in the prime rate on the Fed. **********Further complicating the issue is the disagreement among economists about the link between the money supply and interest rates. Some argue that an overly tight money supply causes interest rates to rise, others that an overly expansive money supply also causes interest rates to rise because it raises prospects of more inflation. **********A White House official said today that the Administration position was that both an overly tight and overly expansive money supply were to be avoided."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/23/world/sikh-terrorists-kill-13-in-northern-india-state.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sikh Terrorists Kill 13 In Northern India State", "print_headline": "Sikh Terrorists Kill 13 In Northern India State", "body_text": " **********Sikh terrorists in the northern Indian state of Punjab killed 13 people and wounded more than 20 late Monday night. **********The worst incident involved four Hindu travelers who were killed Monday night near Moga, about 175 miles northwest of New Delhi, after six gunmen hijacked a bus and fired at its Hindu occupants.

Shultz and Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko. Mr. Reagan has been joining in meetings, the officials said. **********They seemed eager to rebut a widespread view that Mr. Reagan was paying little attention to arms control issues and leaving them to aides. **********When plans for the Shultz-Gromyko meeting were announced last month, the two sides said that the new negotiations had the ''objective of reaching mutually acceptable agreements on the whole range of questions concerning nuclear and outer space arms.''

The President has also been discussing ''what substantive positions to take,'' the official said. **********The United States has proposed an ''umbrella'' forum in which all weapons can be discussed in general terms, with working groups set up to negotiate specific issues.

Rowny, the negotiator in the suspended strategic arms talks, and Richard N. Perle, the Pentagon's arms control specialist, have been asked to be in Geneva during the Shultz-Gromyko talks. **********Several officials said the President had discussed the importance of ''stability'' and wants to convey to the Soviet side his views on which weapons contribute to stability and which do not. **********Konstantin U. Chernenko, the Soviet leader, has stressed the importance of banning space weapons, and this is taken here to mean that the Russians will make this their first order of business. They have been concerned over American plans to develop weapons that can attack satellites in space and over Mr. Reagan's program to develop an effective missile defense. **********The President wants his aides to tell the Russians that, in his view, stability can be achieved only by reducing offensive weapons and developing an effective defense. He has said that he would be willing to share any new defensive technology the United States might be able to develop to stop missiles. **********While Mr. Reagan's views are not disputed within the Government, there are differences on negotiating tactics. **********State Department officials, for instance, see the Soviet interest in curbing defensive weapons as the key to an eventual breakthrough in arms control. They said the priority being given in the United States to defense may induce the Soviet Union to strike a deal, reducing their heavy land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles and other offensive weapons that the United States regards as a threat.   Officials Differ on Approach **********These officials thus regard American interest in defense as a bargaining chip in dealing with the Russians. They contend that it was Mr. Reagan's emphasis on defense that induced the Soviet Union to resume arms discussions in the Shultz-Gromyko meeting. **********In the Defense Department, officials are against the idea of using the defensive strategy as a bargaining tool. They insist on going ahead in any event with the proposed research and development of an effective missile defense. **********Under a 1972 treaty limiting antiballistic missile defense, the United States and the Soviet Union are limited to 100 missiles capable of trying to hit incoming missiles. The treaty is automatically renewed every five years unless one of the parties seeks to break it. The next such review period occurs in 1987, and some American officials believe that the Soviet Union is fearful that the United States may break the treaty if it develops an effective missile defense. **********The number of offensive missiles and bombers on each side is limited by a treaty that was signed in 1979, but has not been ratified. Mr. Reagan has vowed to achieve a better treaty. **********In the interim, each side agreed not to take steps that would undercut the 1979 pact so long as the other did not. **********Officials said this did not mean that there was agreement to abide by all provisions. For instance, the treaty obliges the Soviet Union to cut the number of missiles and bombers from 2,400 to 2,250, but the Russians have told the United States that they will not do so without ratification.

One such game just reaching arcades now, Mylstar's M.A.C.H. 3, in which the player flies a bomber over a photographed background, has started well, according to arcade owners. **********And at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nev., earlier this month, Paramount Pictures, Sega Enterprises and Bally Midway announced they were planning a laser disk game version of the upcoming Paramount movie ''Star Trek III: The Search for Spock'' that will use footage from the movie and will be released at the same time as the film next summer.  Another game already being shipped is Bally's NFL Football, in which the player quarterbacks a team against a background of filmed professional football games. **********Still, the picture is decidedly mixed. Arcade owners say, for example, that two laser disk games introduced last fall - Sega's Astron Belt and Stern's Cliffhanger - have been unsuccessful. **********Coin-operated video arcade games were a $5 billion business in 1983, according to the ''best guess'' of the Amusement Games Manufacturers Association. If $5 billion cannot be considered a disaster, it was certainly a disappointment to arcade game manufacturers and the owners of America's noisy video pleasure palaces. **********In 1981, more than $8 billion worth of quarters was spent on Asteroids, Pac-Man, and dozens of other five-foot-high, garishly decorated boxes. In 1982, the machines took in $7 billion. **********''Now we've fallen back down to the level of 1980,'' said Glenn Braswell, executive director of the amusement games association, the industry's trade group. ''The days when you could slap a coat of paint on an empty gas station, put in 50 machines and call it an arcade are over.'' **********Figures are hard to verify in a business of mom-and-pop entrepreneurs, but Mr. Braswell said there were probably 10,000 arcades by the end of 1982 and no more than 6,000 now. ''Nice arcades in shopping malls are surviving,'' he said, ''and more than 85 percent of the games have always been in what we call street locations - pizza parlors, bus stations and 7-Eleven stores.''  'Too Much Repetitiveness' **********According to Roger Sharpe, editor of Video Games magazine, ''The days when all you had to do was manufacture something with a coin slot and people would play are gone.'' He added: ''The media hype brought in 'phenomenon players' - older people who wanted to know what everyone was talking about. Those people have stopped playing, partly because there was too much repetitiveness in the games. And they won't come back.'' **********''Thank goodness the die-hard players are still with us,'' said Bill Gillam, director of marketing for Nintendo of America Inc., the manufacturer of such arcade hits as Donkey Kong and Popeye. ''We've lost the attorneys, doctors and women. What we have to do is find products that will lure them back.'' **********Change in Tastes **********The first laser disk game, Dragon's Lair, was an instant success. During its first month, the game, an animated sword-and-sorcery adventure that cost 50 cents a play instead of the usual quarter, was taking in an exceptional $1,000 a week per machine. **********At the Castle Park Arcade in Sherman Oaks, Calif., last July, for example, Dragon's Lair earned twice as much money as the second-place Pole Position, Atari's racing game. **********Today, however, the lines around Dragon's Lair have disappeared, while Pole Position is now No. 1, as ranked by Replay magazine, an industry trade journal. ''Dragon's Lair simply did very well as a novelty for the first few weeks,'' Mr. Braswell said. **********The feeling in the industry is that it is competing for the same entertainment dollar as records, movies, books, miniature golf, and even pinball. Although a few years ago it was thought that the electronic video game had killed pinball, Mr. Sharpe of Video Games magazine said that pinball was having a resurgence. **********A Bally Manufacturing spokesman confirmed that sales of pinball machines ''are up significantly.'' **********The Best Sellers **********Manufacturers and arcade owners, like movie studios, also pray for box-office hits. The best-selling arcade game in history, Ms. Pac- Man, sold more than 100,000 machines. Dragon's Lair sold about 8,500. Laser disk games, such as Dragon's Lair, cost operators about $4,000, while ordinary games such as Ms. Pac-Man sell for about $2,500. **********In a June 1983 report, Christopher Kirby, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, estimated that 200,000 games machines would be shipped in 1983, less than half the 480,000 shipped in 1982. **********''When the income of arcade operators fell off, they couldn't justify spending $2,500 for a new game,'' said Nintendo's Mr. Gillam. ''They began to defer their purchases. In addition, they were skeptical because a series of bad games had been thrown on the market.'' **********Mr. Gillam said Nintendo had responded by making conversion kits, which essentially give operators new games for $800."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/21/world/argentine-military-is-called-uneasy.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Schumacher", "pub_date": "1984-02-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 849, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ARGENTINE MILITARY IS CALLED UNEASY", "print_headline": "ARGENTINE MILITARY IS CALLED UNEASY", "body_text": " **********Weeks of prosecutions and public denunciations of the military's human rights abuses have produced an uneasy mood in the armed forces, according to officers as well as civilians close to the institution. **********''If this aggression against the armed forces continues,'' a senior army officer politically well connected in the armed forces said in an interview, ''it is going to provoke a confrontation.'' **********The two-month-old elected Government of President Raul Alfonsin has begun courts-martial of nine former junta members and a police chief on charges of ordering thousands of assassinations and widespread torture in an antiterrorist campaign in the 1970's. **********Citizens aided by human rights groups have also filed more than 30 lawsuits against commanders for the slayings and disappearances of relatives.

What the Military Dislikes **********The military generally respects Mr. Alfonsin and is prepared to abide by the rulings of the courts and court-martial boards, the officers and civilians said. What unsettles the armed forces, they said, is what they see as a campaign by some human rights groups and others to stir up antimilitary feelings. They said this was being done by making what they said were unproven charges and playing up such emotion-packed evidence of the antiterrorism campaign as the thousands of bodies being uncovered in unmarked graves. **********''Alfonsin is acting thoughtfully for the good of the country,'' the senior officer said, ''but there are subversive elements at work that he cannot control.'' **********The officer, a well-educated, direct- talking man, spoke in the house of a civilian on the understanding that his name would not be used because of a Government ban on political statements by military officers. He said he had spent more than 30 years in uniform, once trained in the United States and commanded a regiment in the antiterrorist fight. **********He cited the possibility of acts of terrorism by underground military groups as possible military responses, although he and the others interviewed stressed that no such acts were being considered now. They said the military, which left office in disgrace over the defeat by Britain in the 1982 Falkland Islands war, is intent on professionalizing itself and on serving the new democracy the way the military does in other Western democracies.   Steps for Civilian Control Trying to bring the military under firm civilian control, Mr. Alfonsin has moved to reduce its political power while at the same time defending it from public vengeance. **********In a far-reaching move Feb. 6, Mr. Alfonsin appointed civilian directors over Fabricaciones Militares, ending 50 years of military control of a state industrial complex that is the nation's largest employer. The complex, which includes domestic airlines and produces an extensive array of nonmilitary goods ranging from paint to plow disks, has long been a source of political patronage run by the military. **********Mr. Alfonsin also has retired several generals and admirals and appointed democratic loyalists as staff chiefs under civilian secretaries. Deep military budget and manpower cuts are promised. **********Eliminating much of the military's judicial power, the Government pushed through laws in the two houses of Congress this month that take away the power of military courts to try civilians or servicemen for crimes and protect most servicemen who followed orders. They give the military a chance to cleanse itself by calling for military trials of servicemen for human-rights abuses, although all the courts-martial must be reviewed by civilian courts.   Vengeance Ruled Out **********Sharply critical of the attacks outside court, Mr. Alfonsin repeated in a recent news conference, ''The Government will not put up with vengefulness of any kind.'' **********Officers in the three services have said in interviews that the juntas failed politically by letting corruption and the repression of terrorism get out of hand while becoming too arrogant in power themselves. **********But they defended most of their military actions, saying that leftist terrorists brought the country to the the brink of disintegration in the mid-1970's with hundreds of assassinations and widespread bombing and kidnapping. The 1976 coup overthrowing Isabel Martinez de Peron was popular. **********''Someone had to dirty their hands,'' the senior army officer said, ''and we took it to be a national cause. If the methods we used were not the best, perhaps it's because there were no others.'' **********The number of military men directly involved in torture and assassinations, however, was small, so most officers today feel they can avoid jail, the informants said.

Some people consider **********this a key question because of the Federal agency's continuing efforts to impose a licensing requirement on small financial publications that give investment advice. **********On July 12 Aubrey E. Robinson Jr., the chief judge of the Federal District Court in Washington, issued a permanent injunction ordering a monthly publication called Stock Market Magazine to cease publication until it had satisfied the S.E.C.'s requirement that it register as an investment adviser - in effect, until it gets a license from the agency. **********The S.E.C. argued that the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 gives it the authority to regulate publications that are primarily devoted to investment advice. But the law exempts ''any bona fide newspaper, news magazine or business or financial publication of general and regular circulation.'' **********In the case of Stock Market Magazine, the court found that from 1977 to April 1983 the magazine's masthead said its articles were based on ''first- hand interviews with company officials, economists, security analysts, tax accountants and other experts.'' But magazine officials acknowledged that in some cases articles were supplied by the companies themselves. For this and other reasons, Judge Robinson concluded that Stock Market Magazine was not a ''bona fide'' publication as defined by the Investment Advisers Act. **********''It is a classic case of prior restraint,'' said Joseph H. Sharlitt, a Washington lawyer for the Yonkers-based Wall Street Publishing Institute Inc., which publishes Stock Market Magazine. ''You can't publish until you are not only registered but comply with their rules.'' **********Mr. Sharlitt's views were echoed by James Clayton, co-director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. ''I think the S.E.C. is trying to expand its jurisdiction beyond that intended by Congress and beyond that authorized by the First Amendment,'' he said. **********Two weeks ago the United States Court of Appeals in Washington suspended Judge Robinson's injunction and called for a hearing on the issue this fall. The court referred to the ''magnitude of the First Amendment interests at stake.'' **********The S.E.C. says its handling of the Stock Market Magazine case is well within its legal authority. ''We're not dealing with an area that is ambiguous,'' said John M. Fedders, the agency's enforcement chief. ''Congress and the courts have both said that the commission has a responsibility in this area, and the cases that we've brought are neither adventuresome nor an attempt to expand the statutory law or judicial decisions. We think it's very consistent law enforcement.'' **********Michael R. Klein, a Washington securities lawyer, disagrees. ''No one claims that fradulent statements, oral or written, are protected by the First Amendment,'' Mr. Klein said. ''The real question is whether a form of prior restraint, and a discriminatory one at that, exists when a private newsletter like the Stock Market Magazine must register with the S.E.C. but a public newspaper like The Wall Street Journal need not.'' **********The ruling is but the latest in a series of S.E.C. actions that some people regard as pitting the protection of investors against the First Amendment's guarantees of free speech and a free press. **********In a case now before the Supreme Court, the agency has cited an investment adviser's prior criminal record as its basis for barring him from publishing a newsletter. **********The defendant, Chrisopher L. Lowe, was convicted in 1977 of defrauding a client and failing to register as an investment adviser in New York State - both misdemeanors. In 1978 he was also convicted of two felonies: tampering with evidence in a New York State criminal proceeding arising out of a client's complaint and grand larceny involving fraudulent checks.  In its brief, the S.E.C. said, ''In assessing what sanctions were appropriate in the public interest, the commission found that Lowe's conduct could hardly be more serious and reflected a callous disregard for the high fiduciary standards required of an investment adviser.'' **********A Federal District Court held, however, that Mr. Lowe had a right to publish his newsletter under the First Amendment. The Court of Appeals then reversed the decision, upholding the S.E.C.'s right to enforce licensing requirements under the Investment Advisers Act. **********Joel Seligman, a securities professor at the George Washington University law school, said: ''The key to the S.E.C.'s de-registration of people like Christopher Lowe is this: It sends a message to all investment advisers that they have to be honest with their clients or else they risk losing the ability to engage in the business. It's a big-stick policy but one that appears to consistently work.'' **********Mr. Seligman added, ''This doesn't mean that the Supreme Court can't surprise us.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/21/world/secret-reply-by-libya-to-british-is-reported.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1984-04-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 507, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SECRET REPLY BY LIBYA TO BRITISH IS REPORTED", "print_headline": "SECRET REPLY BY LIBYA TO BRITISH IS REPORTED", "body_text": " **********-- The Government said today that it had received a secret Libyan response to its conditions for ending the four-day-old police siege of the Libyan Embassy here.

The unions would get the $350 million to compensate for three years of wage concessions they accepted in accordance with the Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981. **********Under the Norfolk Southern plan, the unions would also be worked into the company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan, thus bringing wages and benefits into line with those of other rail workers.

Under this plan, labor would be given 35 percent ownership of Conrail in exchange for threee more years of wage concessions, with a formula for lesser concessions tied to corporate profitability. **********While the Marriott plan calls for the full increase in the union holding immediately, the Alleghany plan would spread the increase over 10 years, starting at 24 percent in the first year. Three union representatives would be appointed to the Alleghany board or to a company it would form to own the railroad. **********As in the Marriott plan, workers would be accorded job protection as prescribed by the 1981 rail act.

Marriott would be restricted to $80 million a year, while Alleghany would be limited to $50 million. **********The Government also proposed that Marriott and Alleghany would have to keep 51 percent of Conrail's common stock for at least five years.

Its revenues last year reached $984.5 million. **********Petrolane's stock jumped $5.50 yesterday, to $18.875, and was the second most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange. Texas Eastern shares on the Big Board dropped $3.375, to $28.125. **********Some analysts of the natural gas industry saw the Texas Eastern bid for Petrolane as a defensive measure to make Texas Eastern less attractive as a takeover target. **********Petrolane has a solid business in bottled propane gas, but its oil services sector has been suffering in a general industry slump and has dragged down earnings.  Such an acquisition would ''have to make Texas Eastern less attractive in an industry that has gotten quite a big play from the takeover game,'' said Donald Dufresne, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. **********Texas Eastern has been concerned about its vulnerability, and is said to be especially wary of the Coastal Corporation, a Houston oil refiner that tried recently to take over the Houston Natural Gas Corporation, another pipeline operator. **********''We think Coastal could be in the buying mode in mid-July,'' Mr. Dufresne said, ''after some of Coastal's own antitakeover positions are in effect. They will come out firing, looking for a pipeline company and a big one.'' **********Coastal earlier this year failed to take over Houston Natural Gas, but left the battlefield $42 million richer when Houston Natural bought back its own stock and paid Coastal's costs as the price of independence. **********The proposed acquisition of Petrolane by Texas Eastern will have ''no material effect on Texas Eastern earnings and, short term, does not really enhance value for the shareholder,'' Mr. Dufresne said, stressing his belief that ''this smells of a defensive measure.'' **********Petrolane itself had been worrying about unsolicited takeover bids, and this spring instituted antitakeover defenses. **********But Petrolane's president and chief executive, John C. Wallace, called the proposed acquisition by Texas Eastern ''very friendly - a very longstanding romance.'' He said, ''We've been in business with them a long time.'' **********The Petrolane board has recommended the acquisition and it is ''pretty well in the gear box,'' he said.  Mr. Wallace conceded that the Texas Eastern bid ''discounts some of our present earnings problems,'' but added that the offer ''looks across the valleys to the other side.'' **********The oil services business began to turn down in 1981, he said, adding that 1984 ''doesn't look much better.'' But bottled propane gas did well, he said, with earnings up although not back to normal. **********First-Quarter Earnings **********In the first quarter, Petrolane earned $5.3 million, or 10 cents a share, compared with $1.7 million, or 3 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. **********In liquefied gas, ''there is an honest-to-gosh fit'' between the two companies, Mr. Wallace said. **********Texas Eastern has a liquefied gas operation that is not as large as Petrolane's, which is perhaps the leading distributor. **********But Texas Eastern does operate the largest liquefied gas pipeline in the United States, from Houston to Selkirk, N.Y., near Albany. **********Texas Eastern said the deal would be financed by cash from credit agreements with various banks led by the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. **********The acquisition would be made by a cash tender offer, expected to begin Monday, and subject to the condition that a minimum of 27,250,000 shares, or 52 percent, be tendered and not withdrawn. **********Shares not purchased in the offer will be converted into the right to receive $20 a share in cash or the equivalent value in shares of Texas Eastern common. **********Petrolane granted Texas Eastern an option to buy an additional 9,662,000 Petrolane common shares at $20 a share. It also granted to Texas Eastern an option to buy the capital stock of Petrolane's Eastman Whipstock Manufacturing Inc. for $250 million in cash.

''Anybody who watched the evening news would have known that.'' **********At a news conference here this evening, Mr. Mondale also said that the Long Commission, which investigated the attack, had found that the commander in Beirut had sent a cablegram five days before the bombing urging that the men be moved. **********In its report, however, the commission, headed by Representative Clarence D. Long, Democrat of Maryland, does not address the question of the withdrawal of the marines. **********''The commission did not question the political decision to insert the marines into Lebanon and did not address the political necessity of their continued participation in the multinational force following the 23 October 1983 terrorist attack,'' the report said.   Shultz Statement Cited **********As he did in his televised debate with President Reagan on Sunday night, Mr. Mondale asserted that Secretary of State George P. Shultz had admitted in a television appearance on the NBC News ''Meet the Press'' program Sunday, before the debate, that a recommendation to relocate the troops had been made directly to the President. **********Mr. Shultz was asked if he could remember Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger's having recommended before the terrorist attack that the marines be pulled back. **********''That very well may be,'' Mr. Shultz replied, ''and Secretary Weinberger, I think, has been reluctant from the beginning about the marines' presence in Lebanon.'' **********A spokesman for Mr. Shultz on Monday denied that the Secretary had intended to confirm that there had been a recommendation of a pullback. The White House, the State Department and the Pentagon all contradicted Mr. Mondale's assertion that the Defense Department or the Joint Chiefs of Staff had recommended that the marines be withdrawn from their position at the airport five days before the terrorist attack. **********Pentagon sources close to the Joint Chiefs said, however, that while no formal recommendations were made, the options for shifting the marines away from their barracks at the airport were discussed on Oct. 18 at a National Security Council meeting with President Reagan. **********''We don't know what the President knew,'' Maxine Isaacs, Mr. Mondale's press secretary, said.

And yet, the nation's shipbuilding industry is trying everything from robots to lasers to build them even faster. **********It seems to be a paradox. But the shipbuilders say that if they can produce the vessels faster, they can reduce their labor costs - one of the central reasons American shipbuilders cannot compete with their counterparts abroad. By reducing the cost of labor, they may be able to preserve an industry that some of them say is in its worst state since the Great Depression. **********Only two commercial ships were ordered built in the nation's 26 major shipyards last year, compared with 43 vessels 10 years ago, according to the Shipbuilders Council of America, a trade group. Although the number of ships contracted by the Navy increased from 7 in 1973 to 27 last year, the shipbuilders say they have not filled the gap left by the loss of nonmilitary shipbuilding. **********In addition, 48 contracts to build or rebuild American ships went to foreign shipyards last year, the group said. Those are contracts that before 1981 would have been blocked by Government regulations aimed at protecting the nation's shipping industry. **********''The fortunes of those who build just ships in the U.S. are, and always will be, highly dependent on global and domestic sociopolitical considerations,'' said Louis D. Chirillo, the president of a shipbuilding consulting firm in Bellevue, Wash. **********At the moment, those considerations have turned against American shipbuilders, those in the industry say, as the Reagan Administration is largely abandoning subsidies that for 47 years helped the American merchant fleet compete throughout the world. **********To stop the loss of contracts to foreign shipyards, United States shipbuilders have been culling technological advances from other industries that could be adapted in their yards. **********So far, those advances have included using robots for welding and lasers to cut steel, measure parts and form parts; computers to design ships and three-dimensional photographs to predict how large sections of ships will fit together. **********''The shipbuilding industry is one in which we have more need to transfer technology from other industries, in some cases from other shipbuilders, than to initiate research into new technologies,'' said James B. Acton, the manager of research and development in the Los Angeles division of the Todd Pacific Shipyards Corporation. ''The majority of our needs can be met through a technology transfer.'' **********As a result, the Federal Maritime Administration, the Navy and the nation's shipbuilding companies, in a joint effort called the National Shipbuilding Research Program, will spend about $7 million this year to study how new technology can help speed ships off the ways. **********The program, which started in 1971 and was joined by the Navy two years ago, is looking into the success of Japan, the world's leading shipbuilder. Mr. Chirillo, who also heads the program's panel on the application of Japanese technology, said that Japan's high performance in shipbuilding was based on organization, not facilities. **********Instead of building a ship from its hull up, the method now used by most American shipbuilders, the Japanese divide the ship into sections, called blocks, and build the ship block by block. Each block contains a portion of the hull as well as the machinery, piping and internal structure of the ship. **********''Basically, what they've done is they take any ship that has to be built and the planners then contrive interim products,'' Mr. Chirillo said. ''They are not experts in shipbuilding, but experts in these interim assemblies.'' The first American ship to be built using the Japanese method, which Mr. Chirillo called ''flexible- system production,'' was the Exxon Charleston, a 41,659 deadweight-ton ship delivered last October. Mr. Chirillo estimated that the method reduced the manhours spent building it by 30 percent. **********The key to the block-by- block method of construction, however, is making sure the blocks fit together. Mr. Chirillo said that in the past when two shipyards were working on separate halves of a ship that was too large to fit in one shipyard the shipbuilders simply added an extra two inches of steel to each half and cut and fit the halves together. **********Now, through a process called ''photogrammetry,'' the two halves of the ship are photographed, the data from the photographs are fed into a computer and the computer gives a three-dimensional picture of the two halves and where they connect, according to John F. Kenefick, a photogrammetric consultant from Indialantic, Fla. ''In the past, typically you would have an argument between the guy who built it and the guy trying to fit it together,'' Mr. Kenefick said. ''Invariably, it would be trimmed and cut and made to fit, but the modern manager won't accept that anymore.'' **********''We're able to measure these blocks for their overall dimensions and any interfacing pieces, such as pipes,'' Mr. Kenefick added. ''We can also predict the fit of that block into the part of the ship that's already erected because we've already surveyed the other pieces.'' **********The technique has been used widely by cartographers to make three-dimensional contour maps. Some aircraft manufacturers have begun to use it and last year the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company formed Its own photogrammetry department, the first American shipbuilder to do so. **********At the Todd Pacific shipyard in Los Angeles, Mr. Acton, who is also chairman of the National Shipbuilding Research Program's flexible automation panel, said welders have been using a robot - a jointed arm mounted on a pedestal - to weld the parts of a ship. **********''With a robot you consistently get a higher-quality weld and we have proved this at Todd,'' Mr. Acton said. ''The point is the robot doesn't get tired, it's not bothered by the heat or cold, and the robot itself is immune to fumes.'' **********Mr. Acton said that the problem with using the robot in shipbuilding is one that also hinders the application of other existing technological advances to the industry: There is not enough repetition. **********Unlike an automobile assembly line, a shipyard never turns out more than 25 of the same model vessel, Mr. Acton said, and as a result the robot must be constantly reprogrammed to perform different functions. **********''You don't have enough repetitive parts and the artificial-intelligence technology is such that you have to use the teach and repeat method,'' Mr. Acton said. ''Basically you program these robots from the floor by actually putting the arm of the robot through the motion you want it to repeat.'' **********John Peart, a corrosion chemist at the Avondale Shipyards in New Orleans, and chairman of the National Shipbuilding Research Program's panel on surface preparation and coating, is considering using robots to paint small parts and pipe pieces. **********Again the difficulty is how to teach the robot to pick up and paint various sizes of parts, Mr. Peart said. **********''Our work pieces are many shapes and sizes so we can't depend on a computer to program one type of operation,'' he said. ''We want to put a sensor on the robot so that it can view the piece and control the envelope of the area to be painted.'' **********Both Mr. Peart's and Mr. Acton's panel have considered using lasers. Mr. Peart considered using lasers and high-intensity xenon lamps to clean ship hulls. **********Mr. Acton said that his panel, in a three- year project with the Navy and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is considering using lasers as a heat source to shape steel parts. **********The process is similar to one in which an acetylene torch is used to heat a steel plate to a depth of one-third of its thickness. The plate is then cooled and it forms around the point that was heated. **********''At the present time, the artistic ability of the operator is key,'' Mr. Acton said. ''We're trying to take the skill out of it.'' **********All of the research into new technologies is meant to revitalize an industry that many consider a national resource, like oil or gas. To lose the industry now - through the sale of shipyard waterfronts to resort developers - would mean losing it forever. **********''A shipbuilder has to be on the waterfront, and there is only a finite amount of waterfront,'' said Mr. Acton. ''A shipyard now existing, that is once lost and that property is put to other use, is lost forever. There's no way that the shipbuilding industry will get it back from the recreation industry.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/13/world/conflicting-claims-befog-china-vietnam-fighting.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1984-05-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1145, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONFLICTING CLAIMS BEFOG CHINA-VIETNAM FIGHTING", "print_headline": "CONFLICTING CLAIMS BEFOG CHINA-VIETNAM FIGHTING", "body_text": " **********For more than a month, China and Vietnam have each reported inflicting staggering losses on the other in their border conflict while suffering only modest casualties, all of them civilians. **********Neither side has admitted having its soldiers killed or wounded, prompting some diplomats to suspect that the artillery duels and battles have been exaggerated and that the biggest casualty of the murky war has been truth. **********Over the last week, Chinese frontier guards have been beating back Vietnamese incursions while being bombarded with thousands of artillery shells, as the New China News Agency told it. **********On Thursday, the press agency said, Chinese frontier guards repulsed the seventh assault in a week on a 3,300- foot-high position on the Yunnan Province border, inflicting ''heavy losses.'' **********A Vietnamese diplomat here called the report ''a total lie.'' And a Chinese official told reporters the day before that the frontier had been ''relatively peaceful'' in recent days.   Soviet Visit Is Postponed **********The conflicting reports have been treated cautiously by diplomats since independent observers have not been allowed into the border zone. **********The reports are unsettling enough and may have been one reason for the postponement of a visit to Peking by Ivan V. Arkhipov, a First Deputy Prime Minister, who would have been the highest Soviet visitor in many years. The Soviet Union is an ally of Vietnam. **********Some border fighting has evidently occurred. A week ago, television showed footage of Chinese infantrymen advancing under fire, a peasant being treated for wounds and a few stunned Vietnamese prisoners. Last week, the Vietnamese Defense Ministry produced two captured Chinese soldiers at a news conference. **********But no one can say how extensive the fighting has been. Western and Asian diplomats here have noted that it follows a pattern of clashes in 1981 and 1983, and they doubt that it will reach the intensity of the border war of 1979. **********The diplomats say the present conflict may be linked to Vietnam's dry- season offensive against Cambodian rebel forces, including the Chinese- backed guerrillas of Pol Pot, near the Thai border.   Tying Down Vietnamese Troops **********By increasing tension, China can tie down Vietnamese troops who might otherwise be sent to Cambodia, and help relieve the pressure not only on the beleaguered guerrillas but also on Thailand. **********China has used border clashes before to punish Vietnam for going on the offensive in Cambodia. Such tactics do not seem to have restrained the Vietnamese. One diplomat said this had left China with the choice of stepping up its harassment or losing credibility. **********Hanoi has blamed Peking for the border incidents. **********''By using their infantry troops to nibble at our territory in the wake of their artillery shellings, the Peking reactionaries hope to come to the rescue and crank up the spirit of the Pol Pot remnants,'' Nhan Dan, the Vietnamese party newspaper, said a month ago. **********China said Vietnam fomented the trouble to distract attention from its activities in Cambodia. But China Daily, an English-language newspaper here, acknowledged that the two conflicts were intertwined. **********''The counterattacks are necessary until Hanoi truly expresses a sincere desire to withdraw completely from Cambodia,'' it said last month.   Vietnamese Offer Rejected **********China has rejected Vietnam's offer to negotiate, saying this is possible only after Vietnam agrees to leave Cambodia. **********The quarrel has ranged well beyond the border. Vietnam has charged that China used President Reagan's recent visit to mount the attacks, implying that Washington and Peking were in collusion. **********Last week the Soviet press agency Tass said it was ''extremely myopic'' of China to try to change Vietnam's policy by attacking its territory. The New China News Agency replied that the Soviet Union was trying to cover up its own role in abetting the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. **********The reported clashes have occurred along the rugged 750-mile frontier that separates Yunnan Province and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China from Vietnam's northern provinces. The mountains, lush with vegetation and sometimes shrouded in fog or drizzle, rise up a mile, exposing limestone cliffs. Muddy streams and red-dirt roads snake through the narrow valleys.   Site of Earlier Clashes Western military specialists note that the skirmishes have been reported where earlier clashes occurred. An Asian diplomat reported that Chinese officials told him that the fighting this spring was of about the same intensity as the clashes last year. A Vietnamese spokesman in Hanoi said the fighting had been the worst since 1979. **********The first significant clash was reported in early April, when China said its artillerymen bombarded Vietnamese troops for three days in retaliation for ''armed provocations.'' Vietnam then said that it had beaten back Chinese incursions. China called this a fabrication, but later said its frontier guards killed or wounded ''large numbers'' of Vietnamese troops. **********In mid-April Vietnam said its forces had beaten back new attacks, ''killing and capturing a number of Chinese intruders.'' The New China News Agency said, ''Chinese frontier troops, driven beyond forbearance, waged counterattacks in what was an outright just action of self-defense.''  More Accusations **********The next week Vietnam said that China had shelled its territory with 3,000 rounds, killing four civilians, and that a Chinese assault on a 4,100-foot hill had failed. China reported killing or wounding ''several hundred Vietnamese soldiers.'' **********On April 28, while President Reagan was in China, the New China News Agency said Vietnam had fired 10,000 rounds at villages in Yunnan and Guangxi. A dispatch from the front said Chinese troops had assaulted intruding forces, ''killing all the Vietnamese in fierce fighting.'' **********Two days later China said its frontier guards had wiped out more Vietnamese troops intruding into Yunnan. **********''Many attacks launched by Vietnamese troops who tried to retake the border area were driven back,'' the New China News Agency said. **********On May 1, People's Daily said Vietnam was bringing up tanks, rockets and heavy artillery for an invasion.   'Extremely Tense' **********As Vietnam told it last week, its forces killed, wounded or captured hundreds of Chinese attackers. The newspaper Nhan Dan said China was massing forces on the border and called the situation ''extremely tense.'' **********No new clashes were reported until May 4, when the New China News Agency announced more fighting and shelling involving forces of up to a company in strength. **********Though there have been fears that the conflict could expand, one Asian diplomat said he expected the tensions to wind down as the rainy season stalled Vietnam's offensive against the guerrillas in Cambodia. **********The shadow war, he said, will fade away, with no more explanation of what really happened along the border this spring."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/13/world/the-un-today.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 25, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

But an additional way for individuals to make use of these bonds is as a self-created annuity, with none of the sales or administrative charges that may be tacked onto commercial annuities. **********Basically, this kind of annuity would allow a person who has acquired a nest egg in Savings Bonds - either through a single large purchase or a series of smaller ones - to redeem a portion each year after retirement as required. The theory is similar to that when purchasing a single-premium or multiple-premium deferred annuity from a private company, with the intention of receiving payments later according to a prearranged schedule. **********''This is one of the best things around,'' said Robert W. Back, an annuities specialist at Blunt Ellis & Loewi in Chicago, about the Savings Bond annuity approach. ''It is United States Government credit, which is, by definition, an outstanding product.'' **********The present version of Savings Bonds traces its origins back to 1941, when Series E fixed-income ''war bonds'' were introduced in denominations as low as $25 to help pay for the American military expenses of World War II. Such bonds, and the Series EE bonds that succeeded them in 1980, continue to accrue interest for as long as 40 years after issuance. **********The present floating-rate Series EE bonds, which have 10-year maturities, are issued in denominations of $50 to $10,000, with a purchase price of half the denomination. Like their predecessors, they are zero-coupon bonds and do not pay interest periodically to bondholders. Instead, such bonds accumulate interest through periodic increases in the redemption value. **********The rate paid to savers is set twice a year by the Federal Government, reflecting 85 percent of the average return on five-year marketable Treasury notes during the previous six months. Since last November, that rate has been 9.38 percent, with the added assurance of a guaranteed minimum yield of 7.5 percent regardless of future changes in money-market conditions. **********To achieve the 7.5 percent floor, however, the bond must be held for at least five years before redemption. Otherwise, the guaranteed interest rate starts at the passbook-savings rate of 5.5 percent and rises one-quarter of a percentage point every six months until reaching the 7.5 percent level. **********The current 9.38 percent rate is, of course, lower than the typical rate of approximately 11 percent now being paid by annuities offered by life insurance companies, which are also tax-deferred during the accumulation phase. But Savings Bonds are direct obligations of the United States and guaranteed by its full faith and credit, while insurer annuities are backed by the issuing concerns. **********And last year's financial difficulties of some major companies that sold single-premium deferred annuities not only made headlines all over the nation but also frightened many investors away from such annuities entirely. **********The concept of Savings Bonds as an annuity has not been promoted by Washington, which naturally emphasizes sales - particularly through payroll deduction - rather than redemptions. Government literature highlights features of the bonds such as portability, availability in small amounts, exemption from state and local income taxes and replacement if stolen or destroyed. Nevertheless, Federal officials recognize the applicability of an annuity-like redemption program in some types of situations. **********''It is particularly good for people who have been buying bonds over the years and are thinking about what to do at retirement to take advantage of continued tax deferral,'' said Steven R. Mead, executive director of the United States Savings Bond divison of the Treasury Department. ''And while the guaranteed life of EE bonds sold today is 10 years, no bond has ever been called short of 40 years.'' **********Furthermore, he added: ''It's just as sensible from a tax point of view to redeem a little at a time as rolling over to HH bonds. Cashing a little at a time can replicate any income stream you want.'' **********Mr. Mead's reference was to Series HH bonds, available only in exchange for Series EE bonds, Series E bonds and old Series H bonds that have matured. Series HH bonds are regular bonds that yield 7.5 percent and pay interest semiannually. **********A variation on using Savings Bonds for an annuity was suggested by P. Kemp Fain Jr., president of the Asset Planning Corporation and this year's president of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners. **********''When you get ready to redeem, you can cash in a certain amount each year and put it in a money- market fund, or a Government-only money-market fund if you are concerned,'' he said. ''Then you can arrange to have a check sent every month under a withdrawal plan. You build your own annuity that way and you don't have to go to the trouble each month of cashing the bonds at a bank.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/10/business/fotomat-debt.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fotomat Debt", "print_headline": "Fotomat Debt", "body_text": " **********The Fotomat Corporation, which had been asked to repay $12.5 million in bank loans by Dec. 31, said it is working on a plan to restructure the debt arrangements.

And they have been eminently successful. **********After the first spot was completed with its handoff of product between identical Rolls-Royce chauffeur- driven limousines, the gang around the Marschalk agency kept asking Stephen J. Kaplan, the art director, and Laurence J. Elegant, the writer, how they were going to top it. **********They did it, quite simply, by accomplishing the same kind of handoff with two similar yachts running very close and side by side. The resulting 30-second commercial has words and actions almost identical to the original highly successful Rolls entry, except for the addition of a romantic interest or at least a person of the opposite sex. **********As with the first spot that was first used in 1980 with very positive results, the second commercial introduces itself with views of opulance and the voice-over saying: ''The finer things. Happily, some are affordable,'' and then goes on to praise the product and its uses. Only then does the rich and pleasant stranger hove into sight to ask, ''Pardon me, but do you have any Grey Poupon?'' **********''But of course,'' is the response, and then the handoff is accomplished between yachts. **********''Hey, Steve. Hey, Larry, how are you going to top that,'' the two creative chaps were asked once again. **********It was a nagging question that even at times kept him from sleeping, Mr. Kaplan admitted yesterday as he joined some other agency heavyweights to show his topper. **********This time, as TV viewers will begin to see in prime time and news starting next Monday, the handoff will be made between railroad dining cars - going in the same direction. But not just any old dining cars, two dining cars from the fabulous Orient Express, each a unit in a seven-car train shot at Stockach, West Germany, after the Americans had laid 500 yards of clean gravel along the track bed and had adjusted two of the dining car windows to make them open wider. **********Four people from the agency were there in the fall, just over the border from Switzerland, where the trains are stored in a car barn for the winter. And the director and cameraman came from America, too. **********All that, and more, just for a 30-second commercial? Is it worth it? **********Judging from the sales results from the first two commercials, continuing the campaign is certainly justified. And the believability of the rich settings has certainly contributed to their success. **********Grey Poupon Dijon mustard made in the United States under a licensing agreement was owned by Heublein, which was acquired by R.J. Reynolds. Grey Poupon, along with a number of other Heublein products, has been put by Reynolds into its Del Monte Specialty Grocery Products division. **********Marschalk is one of the Interpublic Group of Companies, a number of which have worked for Heublein. Grey Poupon had been at the agency since 1964. But it was not until 1980 that Heublein management, aware of a new adventurousness among American eaters, became willing to branch out from magazines, their usual advertising medium, to try television. The first test was for six weeks in Seattle. **********''Our market was growing so fast we couldn't believe it,'' said Jeffrey C. Adams, senior vice president/ management service director, as Andrew J. Langer, agency president, and Daniel E. Cohen, executive vice president, nodded knowingly. **********To verify the findings, the agency started another test in Boston, which was no trouble since the product was already in distribution nationally. The success was repeated and within seven months Grey Poupon was being advertised on network TV. **********In 1980 B.T. (before television), Grey Poupon had an ad budget of $500,000 or less and also about 2 percent of a mustard market worth an estimated $120 million at retail. Since then, its sales have increased 220 percent, its share of a growing market is around 5 percent and this year's ad budget is $5 million. **********About the same time as the creative team was coming up with the second spot, now titled ''Yacht,'' the client was developing a new product, Grey Poupon Country Dijon mustard, a line extension that has flecks made by mustard hulls. Some versions of the commercials featured it and the original, which required the actor to accomplish a difficult double-jar pass. The Country version is now considered established and is not in the railroad version."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/29/business/dollar-gains-gold-mixed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 194, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dollar Gains; Gold Mixed", "print_headline": "Dollar Gains; Gold Mixed", "body_text": " **********The dollar moved higher yesterday in very light trading.

Metzenbaum of Ohio, both Democrats, quickly seized on the existence of a crippled board to try to force a review of the company's mission to spur development of synthetic fuels, or even to shut it down. **********The corporation, created under a law signed by President Carter with great fanfare in mid-1980, was designed to be the catalyst for private-sector development of a major new American industry. It was envisioned that the Government would provide up to $88 billion in aid but, largely because of the decline in world oil prices, interest in the development of synthetic fuels has waned. **********Mr. Thompson resigned yesterday from his $135,000-a-year post as president of the corporation, after its chief ethics officer found that Mr. Thompson had violated the corporation's standards by failing to disclose that the Tulsa, Okla., bank he formerly headed was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Mr. Thompson had said on Thursday that he would stay on as a director, but this afternoon he sent the White House a letter resigning his directorship, to which President Reagan appointed him in 1981. Mr. Thompson could not be reached for comment and a White House spokesman said that a copy of the letter could not be provided. **********Meanwhile, the corporation's chairman and chief executive officer, Edward E. Noble, instructed its inspector general, S. Kenric Lessey, to begin an investigation into new charges that Mr. Thompson tried in 1982 to sell shares in the Tulsa bank, the Utica Bankshares Corporation, to a Texas oil executive who had applied for millions of dollars of aid from the fuels corporation for a tar sands project. The new charges were raised during a meeting of board members on Thursday. **********The lack of directors reflects three previous 1984 resignations. Robert Monks left in January to take a pension and welfare benefits post at the Labor Department. Milton M. Masson resigned in February because his partner in a Phoenix engineering business died suddenly. Howard Wilkins also left in February, citing private business reasons. **********Mr. Thompson is the second successive president of the corporation to be forced from office. His predecessor, Victor A. Schroeder, resigned last August amid various charges that included letting consulting contracts without competitive bids and billing the corporation for thousands of dollars of costs involved in the purchase of his Virginia home. **********Mr. Schroeder is one of the three remaining board members. The others are John Carter and Mr. Noble. **********Today's developments inspired yet another outburst of criticism of the corporation from Capitol Hill. Senator Metzenbaum said he would try to block confirmation of a pending nomination to the corporation's board to prevent it from making further commitments to aid synthetic fuels projects. ''My intent is to shut down the S.F.C. temporarily - and perhaps permanently,'' Mr. Metzenbaum said in a statement. **********The Reagan Administration has never had a high regard for the fuels corporation and would not be expected to mount a strong defense if Congressional efforts to change its role or abolish it gathered momentum. **********Delay Asked by Bradley **********Senator Bradley sent a letter to President Reagan today urging him to take what he called a ''special opportunity'' to make large budget savings and to promote sound energy policy by using the ''hiatus'' to re-examine with Congress the corporation's mission and operations. He specifically asked the President not to send up a nomination for the fourth board vacancy until this was done. **********The White House announced last week that it intended to nominate Eric Reichl, described as an experienced executive in the synthetic fuels field, to the seven-member board. Mr. Noble said in a statement today that he expected Mr. Reichl to be confirmed ''in the near future.'' The next board meeting is scheduled for May 17. **********Senator Thomas F. Eagleton, a Missouri Democrat, also weighed in with strong criticism of the corporation, declaring it to have been hobbled by ''cronyism, mismanagement and self-dealing by executives who aren't satisfied with salaries almost double what the country pays to Cabinet officials.'' **********Referring to Mr. Reagan's appointments, Senator Eagleton said: ''We haven't had an aroma like this since the days of President Warren G. Harding.'' Although appointed by Mr. Reagan, Mr. Thompson is a Democrat. **********Continue Without Interruption **********Mr. Noble asserted today that the corporation's day-to-day operations ''will continue without interruption.'' He said that ''project negotiations and contract documentation are moving forward expeditiously and I fully expect that a number of contract award decisions will be ready for prompt board consideration once a quorum is in place.'' **********There was speculation that Mr. Thompson remained on the board an extra day so he could participate in approving two additional subsidies - up to $790 million in price guarantee assistance to the Great Plains coal gasification project in North Dakota and up to $620 million in price subsidies for a Dow Chemical Company coal gasification plant near Plaquemine, La."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/22/business/lincoln-national-buys-into-safeco.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lincoln National Buys Into Safeco", "print_headline": "Lincoln National Buys Into Safeco", "body_text": " **********The Lincoln National Corporation of Fort Wayne, Ind., has purchased 7.3 percent of the Safeco Corporation, an insurance holding company based in Seattle, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********Officials of Lincoln National, a life insurance and investment company, told the S.E.C. that they may seek representation on Safeco's board and control of the company. **********Lincoln National acquired 1,371,650 of Safeco's common shares for $74.5 million as of Feb. 16, according to the filing.

It was the largest gain in 20 months. (Page D1.) **********Euphoria and Frenzy **********For Wall Street, where profits have deteriorated along with the markets in recent months, the mood yesterday was euphoric. In the trading rooms, the atmosphere was frantic. **********''It's as if every investing institution in America at once decided it was O.K. to buy stocks again,'' said James Davin, a managing director of the First Boston Corporation. **********If the rally was favorable for Wall Street's traders and investors, it seemed equally so for President Reagan. **********''It looks like the election will be taking place in a best-of-all-possible- worlds scenario for the President,'' said Leon G. Cooperman, chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''The economy should be good, unemployment will be declining and people's wealth, as measured by the stock market, would be at a relatively high level, assuming the rally continues.'' **********Government Reports Cited **********The two-day rally followed a gradual decline in interest rates. But the spark, analysts said, was two Government reports this week that indicated the economy was slowing. **********On Monday, the Commerce Department announced that its index of leading economic indicators, a gauge of the nation's economic strength in the months to come, had declined nine-tenths of 1 percent in June, its biggest drop in almost two years. The next day, word followed that the nation's factory orders had fallen 1.4 percent in June. **********''All the indications are the economy is going to slow significantly,'' said Martin D. Sass, who runs his own money management firm. ''That sparked the bond market, followed by the stock market.'' Rapid growth raises fear of rising prices, which can push up rates and depress bond prices. **********Further encouraging those who watch the bond market was testimony last week by Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. He told the Senate Banking Committee that the nation's central bank had decided not to tighten its monetary policy, signaling steady, rather than climbing, interest rates. **********The fear on Wall Street has been that the Federal Reserve would act to raise interest rates to slow the economy from its torrid growth rates of 10.1 percent in the first quarter and 7.5 percent in the second quarter. **********But after a dramatic runup in May, interest rates in the credit market have been falling lately. Stocks tend to do better when interest rates fall, because fixed-income investments become less appealing and corporate profits are more likely to climb.  ''People who have been bearish on the market are suddenly saying, 'It's not going to be that bad; disaster is not waiting around the corner,' '' said James Karanfilian, president of Bernstein-Macaulay Inc., a money management concern. **********'Coming Out of the Weeds' **********As that view took hold yesterday, buy orders outnumbered sell orders by a 10-to-1 ratio, said Dudley A. Eppel, a managing director at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. Institutional customers - pension funds, mutual funds and money managers - were ''coming out of the weeds,'' he said. ''They're almost buying defensively.'' **********Indeed, follow-the-crowd psychology was seen as a key reason for the suddenness of the market's jump. Institutions hold a hefty 14.6 percent of their assets in cash equivalents, and few managers want to miss the chance to invest. **********''If the market goes up and you're not there,'' said Peter Lynch, portfolio manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund, ''you have to be very impressive not to lose your job.'' **********The sharp rally has now raised the possibility that individual investors, who left in droves in recent months, might take another stab at stocks. **********Yesterday morning, Lyonel Mehler, a retail broker with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc., reported ''very, very little'' interest from his customers. By afternoon, however, as word of the market's dramatic reversal spread on radio and television, Mr. Mehler reported, ''The phone has started to ring with, 'What's going on, and what should we do?' '' **********Just How Long? **********The question now is just how long and how far the market can rally.Today's prospects are good, because after the market's close, the Federal Reserve announced a surprisingly large decline of $1.7 billion in the nation's basic money supply. Bond prices rose and interest rates fell after the report. **********For the longer run, Mr. Cooperman of Goldman, Sachs said, the Dow might reach the ''low 1,200's,'' but would not move beyond that point unless the yield on the 30-year Government bond dips below 12 percent. **********But, analysts said, the lingering fear that keeps interest rates at relatively high levels is the Government's large budget deficit. Borrowing to cover the deficit is believed to push up interest rates, and sharp cuts in the deficit do not appear imminent. **********For now, however, many on Wall Street hope the deficit will not dominate investor thinking. **********''Many of the things that people worried about really are not resolved,'' said A.

But business is booming, at a time when most of southern Ireland is suffering from a deep recession. **********''My T-shirts are going a bomb,'' said Con Donovan, who runs one of the village's four grocery stores, all of which sell more souvenirs than bread these days. ''They especially like the one with the Irish and American flags and shamrock on it.''  'Put Us on the Map' **********Over at the Allied Ireland Bank's Ballyporeen suboffice (open every Wednesday from 10 A.M. to 12:30 P.M.), Patrick Brennan, the manager, said that ''there are a lot of people in town, and they all spend - Ronald Reagan has really put us on the map.'' Some local businesses are doing twice or three times the volume that they did in July of last year. **********Most of the visitors are Irish. Almost every day, two or three busloads of retired people or schoolchildren or members of the Irish Countywomen's Association pull into town, stopping for a half-hour or so before continuing up through the pines to the lovely mountain paths known as the Vee and on to Cork, perhaps, or to Blarney. **********''We didn't have one tourist bus a year before Reagan,'' said John O'Farrell, the pubkeeper who entertained the President during his visit to the village where his ancestors are said to have lived before emigrating. **********But Mr. O'Farrell's wife, Mary, who runs a gift shop above the Ronald Reagan Lounge, said there had not been as many American visitors as she expected - not more than a handful each day. She theorized that maybe more would come in August and September, or that maybe the flood would begin next year.   'Already Made Their Plans' **********''I suppose that most Americans had already made their holiday plans for this year before they read about us or saw us on TV,'' Mrs. O'Farrell said. **********Almost everyone who comes here buys something - a Ronald Reagan placemat, or a piece of Waterford crystal, or an Arun Islands sweater, or at least a glass of Smithwick's ale, which is what the President drank when he visited the O'Farrell pub. There is really nothing else to do except a bit of shopping. **********A pair of enormous signs stand opposite the O'Farrells' pub, 12 feet tall, in two shades of green, proudly announcing the presence of the President Ronald Reagan Center. But it does not exist yet; just the signs and a marble plaque, already defaced by graffiti, which was unveiled by Mr. Reagan ''to mark the commencement of the building.'' **********''We're waiting for the money from Dublin,'' said an old-timer in a red sweatshirt and a flat cloth cap, who spent his morning waiting for Meaney's Saloon to open. Others in Ballyporeen, who express reluctance about being quoted, said the Irish Tourist Board had allocated the money but had not yet, as one businessman put it, ''handed over the cash to get started.'' Some of them wondered if the project would ever get off the ground. **********But Mr. Donovan, who has represented the village on the Tipperary County Council since 1960, insisted that construction would begin on Aug. 13 and would be finished sometime next year. The center, he promised, would include video displays of the visit as well as photographs.   A Vote for Reagan **********''We're all hoping, of course, that President Reagan will be re-elected,'' Mr. Donovan said, ''and that more Americans will want to come to visit us.'' **********The publicity circus that surrounded the visit taught the simple folk of Ballyporeen a lot about the ways of American politics and world journalism. They now use the phrase ''off the record'' as if it were second nature, and everyone seems to be thoroughly aware of the role of the visit in President Reagan's campaign for re-election. **********''I'd say that the whole event gave the impression that it wasn't stage- managed,'' Mr. Donovan said, ''which in point of actual fact it surely was.'' **********All the same, many people were impressed by some of the things Mr. Reagan said here - especially his comment about some of his forebears having been buried in pauper's graves - and most are grateful to him for coming. Not only has the visit made money for them, but it has also given them a spick-and-span village, with fresh paint on every house, whitewash on every wall, cheerful flower beds at several corners and their first public telephone booth. Only the occasional pony- drawn cart remains to remind people of how isolated the place used to be.   Awaiting a 'Thank You' **********The one thing that rankled is the lack of communication from Washington since June 3. Although gifts were distributed during the visit to those who helped to organize it - Mr. Donovan keeps his shiny pewter cigarette box on a shelf in the kitchen, still carefully wrapped in the gold paper it came in - nobody has received a thank-you note from the White House yet. **********''He told John when they left, 'I'll be in touch,' '' Mary O'Farrell said, ''but unfortunately we haven't heard a word since. No one has. I think it would be extremely rude if we didn't get a note, after we spent three years planning it all.'' **********Some London and Dublin papers, meanwhile, seem determine to prove that Mr. Reagan's family never even saw Ballyporeen and that the whole episode was a publicity stunt, pure and simple. The Sunday Times said a couple of weeks ago, for example, that ''even the most myopic of glances'' at the signature of Thomas Reagan, the President's great-grandfather, in the church register ''shows that his name has been tampered with and that in all probability it once was read Ryan, not Reagan.'' **********''Well, now,'' said a newly worldly housewife, ''don't they say there's no bad publicity except no publicity at all?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/24/business/market-place-tonka-s-role-in-toy-industry.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1984-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 816, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TONKA'S ROLE IN TOY INDUSTRY", "print_headline": "MARKET PLACE; TONKA'S ROLE IN TOY INDUSTRY", "body_text": " **********SHARES of the Tonka Corporation, a leading toy manufacturer, have been generating excitement lately on the New York Stock Exchange, thanks to unconfirmed rumors of a possible takeover and concrete evidence of what the industry calls ''a hot new item.'' At the same time, some toy stocks have been stellar performers. **********Looking ahead, David S. Leibowitz, an analyst at the American Securities Corporation, said yesterday: ''We think the entire toy industry will have a very good holiday season in 1984.'' **********Last October Tonka's stock was trading around 18. It began to climb sharply in 1984, and early this month it reached a record price of 48 3/4. In the last two sessions the stock has been volatile. On Wednesday it fell 4 3/4 points, to 39. Yesterday the shares advanced 1 1/8, to 40 1/8, after trading as high as 43. **********Tonka has a small capitalization of slightly more than one million common shares outstanding, and the reason for Wednesday's price decline was readily apparent. It followed the announcement by Bramah Ltd., a British manufacturing concern, of plans to reduce its ownership in Tonka to 29.2 percent from 36 percent. **********The stock rebounded yesterday, partly in response to a ''buy'' recommendation by Paul Valentine, analyst of the leisure-time industry for the Standard & Poor's Corporation. ''The sale of shares by Bramah removes takeover speculation, but the stock is still attractive on its fundamentals,'' he said. **********Tonka, based in Spring Park, Minn., had a $3.85 million loss last year when it encountered manufacturing problems and inefficiencies at two new plants in Texas and Mexico, according to Mr. Valentine. He estimated that the company would earn $3 a share this year and $8 a share in 1985. Other analysts, however, suggest less optimistic profit figures. **********''Tonka's hot item is the Gobots,'' said Stephen M. Carnes of Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc. in Minneapolis. Gobots are plastic-and-metal toys. Their shape can be manipulated from trucks, planes and other vehicles into robots. Conversely, the toys, which retail for about $4 apiece, may also be transformed from robots into vehicles. **********''A key determinant to Tonka's earnings,'' Mr. Leibowitz said, ''is the amount of Gobot products it can get on retailers' shelves.'' **********As for Tonka's stock, Mr. Leibowitz regards it as ''rather fully priced'' at present levels. He projects profits for 1984 at between $1.50 and $2 a share, but said he may raise this estimate later in the year. **********Mr. Carnes of Piper, Jaffray said: ''I'm recommending sale of the stock on strength. We had recommended its purchase in January of this year, when the stock was trading in the mid-to-high 20's.'' **********Gobots made their debut in January and were an immediate success. How did the toys get that name? ''We developed it internally through our own marketing group,'' Joseph M. Joyce, the company's secretary, said yesterday. ''We wanted a simple name that's catchy with children.'' **********Hasbro Industries of Pawtucket, R.I., has introduced a similar product called Transformers. Hasbro, which recently announced plans to acquire the Milton Bradley Company, another toy manufacturer, has experienced sharp gains in both earnings and its stock price. On the American Stock Exchange, the shares closed yesterday at 52 1/2, down 3/4. Hasbro's stock, which sold last year as low as 10 5/8, reached a record price of 60 5/8 earlier this month. **********''We are very optimistic on the earnings outlook for Hasbro and estimate profits of between $5.50 and $6 a share, including the Milton Bradley acquisition, for this year,'' said Mr. Leibowitz of American Securities. ''Hasbro earned $2.41 a share last year.'' **********One reason why Mr. Carnes of Piper, Jaffray recommends selling Tonka is that the float, or number of shares readily available for trading, ''is so thin that the stock can be whipsawed easily.'' He also expects increasing competition as other companies start producing toys similar to Gobots.  ''What Tonka needs now,'' he said, ''is another hot product.'' **********Mr. Carnes believes the way to ''play the toy group'' is to invest in either Quaker Oats or General Mills - two corporate giants that also are in the toy-making business. Yesterday Quaker Oats, which traded at record prices, rose 1 5/8, to 67 1/2. The company said it knew of no corporate reason for the rise in its stock price. Shares of General Mills gained 1/4, to 54 3/4. **********Other toy manufacturers include Mattel Inc., which recently reached an agreement for a financial restructuring, and Coleco Industries, which scored a big hit last winter with its Cabbage Patch Kids dolls. **********Analysts generally expect an excellent Christmas season for toy sales. ''The traditional toy business is booming once again,'' said Mr. Valentine of Standard & Poor's. ''This reflects the economic recovery, along with the decline in popularity of video games. These factors free up both dollars and retail shelf space for traditional toys.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/20/business/barnett-banks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Barnett Banks", "print_headline": "Barnett Banks", "body_text": " **********Barnett Banks of Florida Inc. said it had acquired 5.3 percent of the shares outstanding of Florida Coast Banks Inc. and acquired options to purchase up to an additional 16.1 percent. **********In an amended filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Barnett said the stock had been acquired at prices ranging from $19 to $27.50 a share.

It apparently reflected a last-minute political settlement by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone on a figure that might placate potential American critics and yet not upset Japanese who believe the armed forces will receive too large a share in the most rigorous national budget since 1955. **********Over all, in the budget approved this evening by Mr. Nakasone's Cabinet, spending will total $217 billion this fiscal year. That is only one-half of 1 percent above the 1983 level. When required interest payments and aid to local governments are deducted, the money available for national purposes actually declines by one-tenth of 1 percent. **********Some Government agencies had their budgets reduced sharply, and even so politically sensitive an area as public-works spending was cut by 2 percent.   Revenues Lagging **********A major reason for austerity is a lag in revenues, brought about in part by the lingering effects of economic recession and in part by a tax structure that habitually fails to produce enough funds to cover obligatory expenses. **********The budget provides for more than $5 billion in new corporate, liquor and commodities taxes, but these merely offset cuts in income and resident taxes pressed by Mr. Nakasone to fulfill a campaign pledge in last month's national elections. **********As a result of the revenue problem, one-fourth of the budget, or $54 billion, is financed through borrowing - a rate of debt higher than that of the hard- pressed United States Treasury. **********Japanese Government officials left little doubt that if they encounter American criticism on defense, they will argue that they have done their best given the overall belt-tightening. **********The military budget comes to $12.6 billion, a third of which covers payments due on past weapons purchases.   Bigger Rise for Foreign Aid **********On a percentage basis, the only area to get a larger increase was foreign aid - 9.7 percent, for a total of $2.3 billion. As with military spending, Japan has been persistently criticized for not using enough of its considerable economic power to help other countries. **********''Comparatively, we think this defense increase is a good victory,'' said Kiyoshi Furukawa, a Defense Agency spokesman. **********The budget must be approved by Parliament before the new fiscal year begins April 1, but the governing Liberal Democratic Party has a sufficiently strong majority to guarantee that no changes of consequence will be made. **********The 6.55 percent increase for the military appeared to be a carefully constructed figure. It was, as expected, one of the smaller rates of increase over the last 20 years. But Mr. Nakasone had nudged it upward a bit so that it would not be lower than the 6.50 percent rise adopted last year.   U.S. Criticism Anticipated **********With a Presidential election campaign under way in the United States, officials here have made it clear that they would like to keep Japanese military spending from being made an issue by any candidate seeking to capitalize on frustration over the large American trade deficit with Japan. **********These officials have braced themselves for criticism that, despite an increase, the new military allocation puts them behind in a planned five-year buildup, begun last year, that is designed to make Japan capable of defending its sea lanes for a radius of up to 1,000 nautical miles. **********Today's budget contains fresh equipment for sea-lane protection, such as 17 F-15 fighter planes, eight antisubmarine patrol planes and three destroyers. On balance, though, the Defense Agency is not at the strength it was scheduled to be at this stage of the five- year program. **********Mr. Furukawa said that, after inflation is taken into account, the 6.55 percent rise amounts to a ''real increase'' of 4.8 percent. This is appreciably larger than in most European countries, he maintained. **********On the other hand, the increase was just low enough to avoid tripping over a limit of 1 percent of the gross national product that Japan has imposed on military budgets since 1976. **********Response by Weinberger **********WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 - Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger welcomed Japan's new military budget today but urged Tokyo to raise it ''at an ever greater pace in future years.'' **********Mr. Weinberger, in a statement, said that the 4.8 percent increase, calculated to take account of inflation, ''compares favorably with those of NATO allies and constitutes progress toward Japan's self-chosen defense goals.'' **********Increases in many Western European military budgets have been running at less than the 3 percent a year agreed on during President Carter's Administration. But the base from which Japan started was but a small fraction of European military budgets. **********The Defense Secretary asserted that ''maintaining a realistic defense is a formidible task against an adversary who does not decide budget levels democratically.'' Mr. Weinberger did not name the adversary but clearly meant the Soviet Union. **********State Department Is Cautious **********A State Department comment on Japan's new military budget, which would be 6.55 percent above last year's in terms of actual spending, was cautious. That figure is far less than senior Administration officials have said privately was needed for Japan to fulfill its commitments. **********Alan Romberg, a State Department spokesman, told reporters that ''it is extremely important that Japan achieve the capability to fulfill mutually agreed upon roles and missions.'' **********Mr. Romberg pointed to a statement by Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki in 1981 that Japan would seek to defend the airspace and sea lanes for 1,000 miles from its shores. The Reagan Administration has taken that as a commitment. **********The Administration has urged Japan to acquire more military strength to free American forces, particularly warships and aircraft carriers, from duty in Northeast Asia. American forces would then be available in Southeast Asia where they could guard sea lanes from the Pacific into the Indian Ocean and to the oil sources around the Persian Gulf. **********Mr. Romberg said that was important for Japan to focus on that objective rather than on a specific budget level. Administration officials have said privately that Japan would have to increase its military spending 10 percent to 12 percent a year to acquire the weapons, manpower, and supplies needed to defend an area out to a 1,000- mile limit. **********Administration officials said the subject was certain to be discussed with Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe, who is scheduled to arrive here Thursday for meetings with top American officials."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/20/business/advertising-unusual-specialist-agencies.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 746, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Unusual Specialist Agencies", "print_headline": "Advertising; Unusual Specialist Agencies", "body_text": " **********THREE interviews in as many **********days, and each was with principals of agencies that have positioned themselves as specialists in particular categories.

Meanwhile, as a hobby he was designing and making what his associate called ''high end'' acrylic boxes. **********By 1972, he was confident enough to start Edgar Watkins Cubics, which became Edgar Watkins At Home after he sold it to H. J. Stotter Inc. Watkins & Blumenthal now does advertising for Edgar Watkins At Home. **********Mr. Blumenthal's marketing career began as a promoter of artificial Christmas trees for Mr. Christmas. It has also included working for American Express and RCA, where he was, he said, director of advertising and sales promotion for the Videodisc division. **********The men have two associates in their cozy, artsy quarters, Laura Gray Detzin, senior account executive, and Natalie Ross, account executive, publicity. **********The founder of Decker, Decker & Freas is John L. Decker, whom you might well remember best as the marketing director of Newsweek who created the ''Zero-Based Media Planning'' concept. That was before he went to Knapp Communications as group publisher and after he worked for N.W. Ayer (on the Newsweek and TV Guide accounts, among others); the Van Sant, Dugdale agency, and Meredith Publishing. **********No wonder he feels he can contribute so much to a magazine's promotion. He also says that he is prepared to deal with all of the promotion needs, unlike other agencies that specialize only in trade promotions, or direct mail subscription solicitation, audio visuals, sales presentations or magazine redesign. **********The second Decker in the title is First Lady Marilou Healy Decker, herself senior vice president and treasurer. She wanted to go back to work after the Decker little ones became big ones. **********Finally, the creative director, is Len Freas, 50, who worked for Young & Rubicam, Dentsu in Japan and the Dreyfus Agency. He was also president of See/Saw, his own company, before going to Knapp Communications as creative director for media and promotion.

While Congress blames the White House for the red ink and the White House blames the Congress for too little spending cuts, the Federal Reserve escapes any culpability time and again. Few, with the notable exception of Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, have pointed out that a cooperative Federal Reserve would be able to eliminate much of the nation's budgetary red ink and that a bull-headed Fed will lead us to disastrous, irreparable troubles. **********So far, the budget balancing act is seen in terms of a major tax increase, punitive spending cuts or a deep recession. But in fact, a balanced budget is possible provided the Fed cooperates with the White House on a unified Governmental program to provide the capital necessary to bring interest rates way down, cut in half the financing costs of Government, business and residential housing, and at the same time, increase the growth of production capacity to at least a 5 percent annual rate. **********How can this be done? The answer may sound drastic, but it is fundamentally sound. The Fed should begin a major loosening of its monetary policy and begin to reduce interest rates substantially until they reach traditional levels of 5 to 8 percent. It should increase Federal Reserve Bank holdings of Government bonds (particularly long-term) from currently about $165 billion to as much as $251 billion, a total that would be no greater than the 6 percent of gross national product that Fed holdings totaled 15 years ago. **********If this were done, for the first time in 15 years it would pay business to borrow the funds with which to modernize and expand, because Government borrowing will not ''crowd out'' corporate financial needs, and both consumption and production would be encouraged to increase growth to the maximum of about 5 percent a year, which can realistically be sustained without the emergence of inflation. **********But doesn't this require a greater money supply to lower interest rates and therefore ultimately cause more inflation? Yes and no. The money supply must be increased substantially, but this need not produce any significant increase in inflation. **********For example, today's basic money supply totals $555 billion, compared with $525 billion (in 1984 dollars) in 1969. This is an increase of only 6 percent in the money available to finance a 51 percent increase in G.N.P. during the same period. In fact, today's money supply is 31 percent less, in relation to G.N.P., than it was 15 years ago when Arthur F. Burns became chairman of the Federal Reserve and precipitated ''the Great Credit Crunch of 1970.'' **********This totally unnecessary exercise of monetary restriction initiated an enormously expanded creation of Eurodollars abroad by foreign-based banks. As a result, dollars abroad became cheap, which led to the doubling, in dollar terms, of world commodities and ultimately led to the multiple increases in the worldwide dollar costs of energy. **********To all of this, the Federal Reserve's response was nearly a decade and a half of misconceived and excessive restriction of the domestic supply of money and credit that in turn resulted in a series of recessions that severely slowed America's growth, increased our public debt and were, thus, a major underlying cause of today's Federal deficits. **********Inflation is no threat today, not **********because the Fed broke its back by **********stopping excessive monetary growth, but because the external inflationary shocks of the 1970's are now moving in a non-inflationary direction. **********The United States domestic supply of money has been reduced from 21.4 percent of our G.N.P. 15 years ago to only 14.8 percent today while interest rates have been artificially and excessively raised by a decade and a half of unnecessarily severe Fed restriction of the money supply. **********CONSEQUENTLY, Americans have suffered from a destructively restrictive regulated money supply, usuriously high interest rates, and ''cost-push'' inflation that was exacerbated by near-prohibitive financing costs. The recent recovery was made possible only by a new President's leadership in drastically reducing taxes and increasing expenditures for the military, in combination with what turned out to be only a partial and temporary relaxation of the Fed's policy of monetary restraint. **********Today, it is already apparent that we are again slipping back toward the slough of economic stagnation and debilitating unemployment that have always been the result of a restrictive money supply and high interest rates. **********Our manufacturing and materials production and use have not yet attained the levels reached during every prior recovery since World War II. All signs now point to an accelerating downward slide. New orders for manufactured goods are down. Consumer spending for durable goods is off. Industrial production is declining. Inventories are growing. Real G.N.P. growth is down to a 2 percent to 2.5 percent annual rate and slowing. Worst of all, the big 1982 economic boosters - tax cuts and burgeoning military orders - are now behind us. **********This fiscal year's Federal deficit has been estimated at $167 billion, or 4.5 percent of current G.N.P. In constant dollars that would be about three times as great as the largest deficit in any post World War II year prior to 1970. Now, however, it is becoming clear that no existing estimates of this year's deficit can be relied upon because these estimates were made on the assumption of an ongoing economic recovery. Unless something drastic is done, and right away, a new recession will descend upon us, adding potentially as much as $120 billion a year to the budget deficit. **********On the other hand, 5 percent real growth would increase tax revenues by about $6 billion a year. The potential saving on the Federal debt would add $65 billion by reducing interest payments from $130 billion at 10 percent, to $65 billion at 5 percent on $1,300 billion of debt. Close to $3 billion in interest would be saved by a $60 billion increase in Fed vs. public holdings of United States Government bonds. **********The combination of added tax revenues and reduced interest payments would save $74 billion and cut the range of projected fiscal deficits to about $93 billion during the first 12 months in which they became effective. Subsequent years would improve progressively because Government revenues would gain and expenditures for unemployment and welfare costs would diminish as growth of the nation's products and services expands. **********But it all depends on how the Fed sets the course of monetary policy for 1985. The Federal Reserve Board and its chairman should all think very carefully before letting an obsession with inflation dictate another year of tight money. **********John Winthrop Wright is president of Wright Investors' Service in Bridgeport, Conn., a money management and economic advisory firm."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/17/business/executive-changes-139616.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 191, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " **********Caressa Inc., a manufacturer and importer of shoes, has appointed Jules Schneider an executive vice president of the company, and general manager of its S.R.O. division. ***********  Estee Lauder International has named Christian Garelli a senior vice president and general manager of the Estee Lauder brand. ***********  Federal-Mogul Corp., Southfield, Mich., has elected Ralph A.

Relations with the United States, which has cut off aid and has contributed millions of dollars to the rebels, are poor. **********The Sandinista candidate for the presidency, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, is expected to win easily over five active opponents in Sunday's balloting. A sixth candidate, Virgilio Godoy Reyes of the Independent Liberal Party, quit the race two weeks ago to protest what he said was coercion of voters by the Sandinistas. **********Mr. Ortega and his running mate, Sergio Ramirez Mercado, a European- educated writer and member of the governing junta, are considered likely to carry with them a large Sandinista majority in the new 90-member National Assembly. The Assembly will write a constitution and also function as a legislature.   First Vote Since Revolution **********The election will be the first since the insurrection that toppled the Somoza family dictatorship in 1979. Nicaraguans last went to the polls 10 years ago, electing Anastasio Somoza Debayle in an election marked by low turnout and charges of fraud. **********The Sandinista Government has urged all citizens to vote as a symbol of their patriotism and support for the revolutionary process. Mariano Fiallos Oyanguren, president of the Supreme Electoral Council, said today that he expected about 80 percent of the 1.56 million registered voters to turn out. **********Mr. Fiallos said that there had been no deaths or serious injuries during the campaign, and that of 250 political rallies by the seven registered parties, only five had been disrupted. He characterized the campaign as having been ''very peaceful when you compare it with other countries like ours.'' **********Seven parties will be on the ballot, but one, the Independent Liberals, announced after the ballots were printed that it was quitting the race. Another party on the ballot, the Democratic Conservatives, appeared ready to withdraw at a party convention a week ago, but the convention was broken up by chanting youths opposed to the withdrawal. **********The Sandinistas appear to have lost some of their popularity since they seized power five years ago, but their leaders say the vote will reflect their continuing strength among poor people, who make up the majority of Nicaraguans. **********At the Selim Shible dairy plant here today, the Sandinista union leader, Edmundo Aviles, said he estimated that 85 percent of the workers would vote for the Sandinista ticket.   'You Have to Vote' **********But in the slum of Ciudad Sandino, enthusiasm for the election was not universal. **********''There are rumors that something could happen if you don't vote, that the next time you need something from the Government you could have trouble,'' said a woman gently rocking a baby on her knee. ''I don't believe it myself, but since there is an election you have to vote. You have to dance to the tune that is being played.'' **********Diplomats and others who watch the Sandinistas closely said they believed that they were divided among themselves on the question of whether to call elections. With the country facing a series of crises, some members of the Sandinista leadership are believed to have urged against holding an election on the grounds that a campaign would be expensive and divisive. **********But in the end, the nine-man Sandinista National Directorate, which makes final political decisions, apparently concluded that calling citizens to the polls would show the world that Nicaragua respects pluralism and could lessen pressure on the regime. **********At a ceremony Feb. 21 on the 50th anniversary of the killing of Augusto Cesar Sandino, the Sandinista hero and namesake, Mr. Ortega announced that elections would be held in 1984. **********Initially, the four parties that had been in coalition with the Sandinistas since the 1979 revolution offered to maintain the coalition during the campaign and field a single slate. But the Sandinistas chose to run alone, and the other parties did the same.   Opposition Candidate Withdrew **********The three parties composing the Democratic Coordinator, an anti-Sandinista grouping that also includes two labor federations and most of the country's business alliances, nominated their candidate, Arturo Jose Cruz, just before the deadline for registration expired in early August. But then, only hours after he had been nominated, Mr. Cruz announced that he would not run because the Sandinistas were not giving opponents a fair chance. **********''Suddenly Cruz was inflated as the only real opposition candidate, and overnight we were put in a position in which his participation or nonparticipation was going to determine the legitimacy of the election,'' Mr. Ramirez, the Sandinista vice presidential candidate, said in an interview a few days ago. ''We did all we could to persuade him, but it seems a decision to boycott had already been made.'' **********Cruz supporters said that they were ready to reach an accord that would have allowed their candidate to participate, and that the Sandinistas refused to make concessions. **********After Mr. Cruz refused to register his campaign, he tried to hold public rallies in the towns of Masaya, Chinandega, Boaco and Leon. Election laws prohibit outdoor appearances by anyone not registered as an official candidate, and all four of Mr. Cruz's rallies were disrupted by demonstrators chanting pro-Sandinista slogans and accusing Mr. Cruz of being a pawn of the Reagan Administration. **********Yet the registered candidates were permitted to speak and to be quoted in the press attacking the regime in terms that have not been heard publicly here since the Sandinistas took power. **********''Although the Spanish language is very rich in meaning and in descriptive powers, there are no words to describe what the Sandinistas have done to our country,'' said an activist from the Democratic Conservative Party, Felix Pedro Espinoza, in a campaign speech two weeks ago. ''Words do not exist that could capture the perversions and evils they represent.''  Press Censorship Loosened **********Press censorship, though still in force, has been loosened during the campaign. There has been no official indication if tighter curbs will now be imposed again. **********Opposition parties were divided about participation in the election because they do not agree on how to confront the Sandinistas. Some opponents are pushing to make the best possible accommodation within the Sandinista- dominated structure. Others, including many businessmen and politicians sympathetic to the United States, believe no accommodation is possible. **********Three of the opposition parties are Marxist-Leninist: the Nicaraguan Socialist Party, the Communist Party of Nicaragua, and the Popular Action Movement-Marxist-Leninist. The Independent Liberals and Democratic Conservatives, remnants of Nicaragua's two traditional political parties, are also on the ballot. The sixth non-Sandinista party that registered for the election, the Popular Social Christian Party, is a breakaway faction of the Social Christian Party, which is backing Mr. Cruz and therefore is not participating in the Sunday election. **********Clemente Guido, the presidential candidate of the Democratic Conservative Party, remained in the race despite substantial sentiment in his party that he should quit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/01/world/assassination-in-india-profile-of-a-vast-land-india.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-11-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 558, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INDIA", "print_headline": "ASSASSINATION IN INDIA: PROFILE OF A VAST LAND; INDIA", "body_text": " **********The People   685,184,692  Percent rural: 76.6%  Percent urban: 23.4%  Life expectancy: 54 years in 1983  Birth rate per thousand: 33.3 in 1981  Death rate per thousand: 12.5 in 1981  Percentage of men: 51.7%  Percentage of women: 48.3%  Literacy rate: 36.5% in 1983 Official languages: Hindi and English.

A day earlier, the two-year note yield was 12.84 percent and the 30-year bond yield was 13.44 percent. **********With many investors reluctant to make large-scale purchases until the Treasury comes to market in the last week of June with an estimated $15.5 billion of notes and bonds, traders said prices were fluctuating according to the latest rate for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market. Yesterday, for example, higher prices for Treasury issues were partly the result as the funds rate fluctuated in a narrow range around 10 3/4 percent, down from 11.16 percent on Monday. **********Rate Often Volatile **********Although the overnight rate is often volatile, it is closely watched by traders and speculators who assume that a persistent trend toward a higher rate shows that the Fed has decided to make bank reserves scarcer, while a persistent trend toward a lower rate could signal an easing in the Fed's policy. **********''The market is keying off the funds rate,'' one trader said. But he acknowledged that many economists were arguing that the funds rate was often volatile and could be inflated in the near future as banks raised funds in advance of loan requests expected for the June 15 corporate tax date. The end of second quarter, when money flows are distorted by window- dressing of balance sheets, may also bring an abnormally high Federal funds rate. **********William Melton, a vice president and economist at Investors Diversified Services, an affiliate of American Express, said that the overnight rate for Federal funds was particularly hard to interpret ''because the old tried and true relationship'' between bank borrowings from the Fed and the funds rate was no longer valid. **********Mr. Melton, who estimated that the funds rate would fluctuate around 10 1/2 percent in the future, said recent and prospective developments in the economy would keep the Federal Reserve from tightening monetary policy and encouraging higher short- term interest rates. **********Auto Worker Strike Assumed **********A slowdown in economic growth to a 3 percent rate in the second quarter from 8.8 percent in the first ''is not the usual setting for a tightening move,'' Mr. Melton said, especially if growth is likely to continue at 3 percent or less in the second half of the year. Assuming that there was a strike by the United Automobile Workers in September, he said that economic growth could be reduced by two percentage points in the third quarter and two and a half points in the fourth quarter. **********Faster money supply growth during May and June is not likely to cause the Fed to tighten policy, Mr. Melton added, since growth in the M-1 money supply measure was nil in April. In May 1983, when the Fed began a series of small moves that allowed rates to rise, Mr. Melton noted that economists did not understand that rapid money supply growth in May and June was overstated by measurement errors. **********Today, he said, many economists in and out of the Federal Reserve recognize the unreliability of the money supply data at this time of year. **********Elsewhere in the short-term market, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board announced a yield of 12.10 percent for $1.4 billion of bonds due April 25, 1985, and 13.25 percent for $800 million of bonds due Dec. 29, 1986. **********Note and bond investors looking for higher yields than in the Treasury market were offered a $250 million issue of collateralized mortgage bonds through underwriters led by Shearson Lehman/American Express. **********The bonds, whose maturities may vary depending on the rate at which underlying mortgages are prepaid, are backed by a pool of 9 percent Government National Mortgage Association pass-through certificates.

Minster is an old word for any of various large churches and cathedrals. **********Although the vastness of the cathedral's scale and the virtuosity of its Gothic-cruciform design place it high among the world's great religious buildings, its chief glory is its windows, which represent about half of the surviving medieval stained glass to be found in Britain. The windows were removed for safety during World War II and were replaced after the war ended.   Chapter House Finished in 1330 **********The cathedral's south and north transepts were built between 1227 and 1260. The octagonal chapter house, linked to the north transept, was completed in 1330. **********The west facade, an extravagant and elaborate web of carved detail that is said by experts to be almost unequaled in English Gothic architecture, was finished in 1338, and the unusually wide and lofty nave in 1345. **********The great rood screen, filled with life-size statues of every English King from William the Conqueror to Henry VI, was completed in 1405. The ornamental screen serves as a partition between the nave and the choir on the church's 500-foot-long east-west axis. **********The huge 210-foot-high central tower, as tall as the church is wide at the north-south axis formed by the transepts, was finished in 1430. The stately twin towers, flanking the church's front facade on the west, were completed between 1433 and 1473. **********But, as Harry Batsford and Charles Fry put it in their 1934 book ''The Cathedrals of England,'' it is through York Minster's famed windows that the ''steady development of English glass-painting can be traced through three centuries.''  'So Fine an Idea' ''No other great English church,'' the authors write, ''preserves so much of its original glazing, or conveys so fine an idea of the color and glow of the interior in which medieval man delighted.'' **********Much of the glass work is done in grisaille, a form of decorative painting in gray monochrome, relieved and varied in some instances by other shadings of color. **********The deep-toned 14th-century arched window set in the west facade faces the length of the cathedral to the many-tinted sea of glass that fills the east end, completed in 1405 by John Thornton of Coventry. **********The east window, the size of a tennis court, is composed of 117 Biblical panels, ranging from the Creation to the Apocalypse. Each panel is about a yard square.

The countries are Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Mexico. **********Department officials publicly criticized the Nicaraguan announcement as a public relations ploy designed to undermine the substance of the proposed peace plan while giving the impression that the plan was acceptable. **********Specifically, the department officials said that the Nicaraguan endorsement of the peace plan, which includes a provision that Nicaragua expand civil liberties and hold free elections, was undercut by the Sandinistas' simultaneous declaration that presidential elections scheduled for Nov. 4 would not be postponed.   U.S. Demands Delay **********The United States has said that the elections must be delayed to permit the full participation of opposition parties and candidates. **********Secretary of State George P. Shultz appeared to soften the United States objections somewhat today. Attending the opening of the United Nations General Assembly session, Mr. Shultz termed the Nicaraguan statement ''a positive development in a general sweep.'' **********While the criticisms voiced by State Department officials Saturday are widely shared within the Government, Administration officials said today that they were not a complete explanation for the response to the Nicaraguan announcement. **********The officials said that underlying the specific objections was concern that the Nicaraguan announcement would rally international opinion behind the Sandinistas at a time when their support worldwide seemed at a low ebb and when doubts were mounting in Nicaragua and abroad about the legitimacy and openness of the coming elections. **********Mr. Ortega, who is scheduled to address the United Nations General Assembly on Oct. 2, informed the State Department earlier this month that he planned to visit Los Angeles after his stay in New York.   Talks Could Be Affected **********A State Department official involved in the formulation of policy toward Nicaragua said that Mr. Ortega's planned visit to Los Angeles had not yet come up for high-level discussion. **********However, another official familiar with the issue said that the proposed trip was discussed at senior levels in recent days, with a number of officials arguing that the trip should not be approved, in part, to punish Mr. Ortega and the Sandinistas for accepting the Contadora peace proposal. **********The Nicaraguan announcement on Friday, and the American response, are likely to hinder negotiations between Washington and Managua that began in June when Mr. Shultz made an unexpected visit to Nicaragua, according to Administration officials. **********American and Nicaraguan negotiators have met five times since Mr. Shultz's visit and are expected to talk again before the end of the month in the Mexican Pacific resort of Manzanillo, where most of the meetings have been held, the officials said. **********Nicaragua said on Friday that any regional peace agreement must include a separate pact between Washington and Managua. The United States has said it would not accept such a condition. **********''I'm not sure what there's left to talk about at Manzanillo,'' one State Department official said. He added, ''The whole point was to get the Nicaraguans to accept the Contadora proposals. Now they have, but we say we aren't satisfied. I'm not sure I would blame the Nicaraguans if they were confused.''  Accommodation Opposed **********There have been divisions within the Administration about how best to deal with Nicaragua, and how to respond to the Contadora process. Generally, officials at the Defense Department, Central Intelligence Agency and the White House have opposed any accommodation with the Sandinistas, while the State Department has advocated negotiations. **********Even State Department officials, however, doubted that Nicaragua would accept the Contadora proposals. The text of the draft treaty has not been published, but Administration officials said it would require signers to hold free elections under international inspection, end support to groups fighting to overthrow other governments and prohibit the construction of foreign military bases in Central America. **********In addition, they said, it would require countries to reduce the number of foreign military advisers. The security sections of the treaty, they said, would be subject to verification procedures to be worked out in later talks. **********The Administration, according to officials, doubted that the Sandinistas would accept many of the security provisions in the treaty, particularly because many of specific issues were left unresolved and subject to further discussion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/24/business/telerate-profit-up-75.7-in-quarter-by-the-associated-press.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 78, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Telerate Profit Up 75.7% in Quarter By The Associated Press", "print_headline": "Telerate Profit Up 75.7% in Quarter By The Associated Press", "body_text": " **********Telerate Inc., which provides financial information to institutional customers via computer, said its profit for its fiscal first quarter was up 75.7 percent from a year earlier. **********Telerate earned $6.5 million, or 15 cents a share, in the three months that ended Dec. 31.

Bush Confers With Mitterrand **********The French view on the likelihood of a return to nuclear arms talks became known as Vice President Bush arrived for talks with President Francois Mitterrand that French aides said would deal mainly with Lebanon. **********The French are reported irritated about the circumstances of the announcement of the pullback of United States troops from Beirut airport. The French suggest that no serious consultation had occurred and that the American decision had been relayed more as a closed matter than as a subject for discussion between the two principal Western allies in the multinational force in Lebanon, to which Britain and Italy have also contributed. **********A source familiar with the French Government's attitude said the American pullback would shake the confidence of Arab and other third-world allies in United States commitments. **********Another view of the French attitude was that the American decision would permit France to make the same choice soon while deflecting attention and responsibility to the United States. For the time being, Mr. Mitterrand has ordered the French contingent to maintain its positions in Beirut.   Bush Is Cautious on Arms Talks **********Mr. Bush, after his meeting with Mr. Mitterrand, was asked at a news conference whether he had detected during his conversations in Moscow a willingness to resume arms control talks. **********''I can't say that I did,'' he replied. ''But I didn't detect an unwillingness. I can't say willingness, but I also don't want to leave the wrong impression. My view is that there will be a resumption of talks. But I can't say out of that meeting I detected a schedule or an agenda or anything of that nature. But I did detect on their part an interest in arms reduction.'' **********The French official back from Moscow said the conviction that Soviet- American arms talks would resume was a basic change in the French analysis. **********The French had thought that the talks would resume only after a gradual increase in Soviet-American contacts on nonmilitary issues. **********The official said he now believed that Mr. Gromyko's presence in Stockholm last month at the start of the East-West talks on security and confidence-building measures in Europe signaled a change in course. The deployment of the new American missiles in Europe, Mr. Gromyko's meetings in Stockholm with Western foreign ministers, expressions of Western interest in developing contacts, and the possibilities opened by the change in Soviet leader all contributed to what France now regards as a Soviet opening, he said. **********In Stockholm, Mr. Cheysson was the first Western Foreign Minister to confer with Mr. Gromyko. Mr. Cheysson said then that he saw no likelihood of an early return to negotiations. **********France, which has supported the Western missile deployment as a counterbalance to the buildup of Soviet SS- 20's targeted on Western Europe, has tried to improve relations with the Soviet Union.

Arkhipov, has run parallel to efforts by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to develop British contacts with the Russians."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/02/business/berg-enterprises-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 88, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BERG ENTERPRISES reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "BERG ENTERPRISES reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/22/business/business-digest-102026.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-11-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 636, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 1984 **********The Economy **********The Federal Reserve cut its discount rate by a half point, to 8 1/2 percent, apparently reflecting the perception that the weakening economy had become a more urgent problem than inflation.

Thus, whenever rumors swirled about takeover targets among the nation's big international energy concerns, Wall Street usually put Gulf on the top of the list.  What has astonished most experts, however, has been the David and Goliath battle that led finally yesterday to the agreement by Gulf that it would permit a merger offer by the Standard Oil Company of California. Few would have thought that Gulf, one of the group of seven international oil concerns that once exercised almost complete control of global oil supplies and prices, could be forced into a shotgun marriage with Socal by a company as small as the Mesa Petroleum Company. **********But that is what happened. **********Gulf's agreement to be acquired by Socal in a $13.2 billion transaction, which will be the largest merger ever if it is carried out, appears to end an six-month battle by Gulf to remain independent in the face of the determined tactics of Mesa, its chairman, T. Boone Pickens, and a group of investors he assembled. **********As has happened in several bids that Mr. Pickens has orchestrated in the past, he and the investors allied with him should profit handsomely from a Gulf-Socal merger. The group has acqired 22 million Gulf shares, or 13 percent of the company's total stock, at an average of $44 a share, and now has the chance to sell them for $80 each. **********With that profit, analysts believe Mr. Pickens will turn his attention to accumulating the shares, and threatening a takeover, of another oil company. Encouraged by Mr. Pickens's success, meanwhile, other investor groups and small oil companies may be adopting similar strategies. **********''This has put the fear of God into the management of every major oil company,'' said Frederick Leuffer of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc., a securities firm. **********The fight over acquiring Gulf has been attributed largely to a concensus among oilmen and bankers that crude oil, which is becoming much more expensive to obtain through exploration, can be bought more cheaply by buying other companies. **********For example, if Socal acquires Gulf at $80 a share, it would get a company whose assets, composed primarily of oil and gas reserves, are appraised by John S. Herald Inc. at $114 a share. **********In addition, the trend toward more mergers and consolidation in the oil industry may be intensified by the success of the Pickens group. For major oil companies, ''the problem of Pickens and others like him is going to stay around,'' said Bruce Lazier of Prescott, Ball & Turben, a securities firm, adding that it may require tougher antitrust laws or new Federal rules discouraging oil industry mergers to slow down the the trend. Indeed such efforts are already under way. **********But for Gulf, now the nation's sixth- largest oil company, a merger with Socal would bring to an end a decade of mounting difficulties. **********The Pittsburgh Company, founded at the turn of the century by the Mellon family, had been one of the most successful drillers in Texas after bringing in the Spindletop well near Beaumont in 1901. After World War II, heavy investments in exploration in Kuwait and other Middle East countries made it one of the world's most powerful oil companies. **********In Kuwait, however, Gulf's production, which had exceeded 3 million barrels a day in the 1960's, was cut to a trickle during the 1970's, as the Kuwait Government nationalized oil production and looked to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to set oil prices. **********In addition, Gulf began to develop a reputation as one of the least aggressive explorers for oil, as its domestic oil reserves fell from 920 million barrels in 1979 to 717 million last year. **********Few Antitrust Problems **********The combination of Gulf and Socal would probably not raise major antitrust problems, according to oil analysts. There is little overlap between the companies on a regional basis, and where there is, it lies in refining and marketing facilities that Socal would not hesitate to sell. **********By buying Gulf, Socal would add two major refineries in Texas and Pennsylvania to the three large ones it already operates in Mississippi and California. The San Francisco company would also be adding 14,900 service stations in Texas and the Northeast to the 12,100 Chevron stations it operates in the Southeast and the West. **********Socal's principal interest in Gulf is Gulf's oil and gas reserves, which are still much larger than any oil company could hope to add through exploration over the next decade. **********Gulf's proven crude and natural gas liquid reserves worldwide last year totaled 1.97 billion barrels. Just over half of these reserves were in the United States, with the remainder in the North Sea, Nigeria and other areas. These reserves would be more than double Socal's 1.63 billion barrels; 73 percent of Socal's reserves are in the United States."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/03/business/security-pacific.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 54, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Security Pacific", "print_headline": "Security Pacific", "body_text": " **********The Security Pacific Corporation said it would file applications with the Comptroller of the Currency to establish ''non-bank banks'' in 20 markets outside California.

But he said that the exact shape of their involvement remained open to negotiation and that their participation in elections was not necessarily contingent on their gaining a share of power. **********''We have a right to participate in running the country,'' he said, ''but there are many ways to do so. We do not want the lion's share of power.'' **********He added, ''Flexibility is the nature of the negotiating process, and we don't know what the final shape of our role in the Government would be.'' **********Holiday Truce Predicted **********He said, however, that the guerrillas probably would not participate in municipal elections tentatively scheduled for March because the safey of their candidates could not be assured. **********Mr. Ungo said that the guerrillas would probably declare a Christmas truce but that there would probably not be a permanent cease-fire anytime soon. **********Mr. Ungo and other opposition leaders visiting the United States this week have hinted at concessions, apparently in an effort to win Congressional and public support. Several participated in a televised debate in Los Angeles on Wednesday with Salvadoran Government officials and a conservative Salvadoran political spokesman. **********Mr. Ungo's comments came as the guerrillas and the Salvadoran Government tried to agree on a time and place for a second round of talks on the five- year-old civil war. President Duarte met with Mr. Ungo and other guerrilla leaders on Oct. 15 in the Salvadoran town of La Palma. **********Mr. Ungo said the guerrillas had received no response from the Government to a proposal that the next meeting be held in San Salvador on Nov. 27. Government officials said this week that they had not received the proposal.   Honduran Activity Reported **********A report of Honduran military activity on the border came from a representative of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the alliance of guerrilla military forces, who participated in the interview with Mr. Ungo. The official, Oscar Acevedo, said 1,200 Honduran soldiers crossed the border into El Salvador on Tuesday and were occupying two Salvadoran villages in the northern province of Chalatenango. He said San Rafael and San Antonio, villages about two miles from the Honduran border, were being occupied by two Honduran battalions based in Marcala, Honduras. **********His account could not be verified. A spokesman at the Honduran Embassy said officials there had no information about such an incursion. **********Mr. Acevedo said the Honduran soldiers were helping the Salvadoran military. **********In July 1982, a senior Honduran military officer reported that 3,000 Honduran soldiers were operating in El Salvador in Morazan Province in a joint campaign with the Salvadoran Army against guerrilla units. **********El Salvador and Honduras fought a border war in 1969, and despite cooperation on some military matters, the two countries remain wary of each another. **********Mr. Acevedo, who is associated with the National Resistance, one of five groups in the guerrilla military alliance, said insurgents had shot down or disabled 10 Salvadoran Army helicopters in recent weeks. The Salvadoran Army has about 45 combat helicopters, according to the Defense Department.   Series of Pacts Sought **********Mr. Ungo said the guerrillas would like to use the negotiations with Mr. Duarte and the Government to produce a series of political and military agreements that would eventually end the civil war. **********''We think there should be a step-by- step process,'' he said, adding, ''We don't know how it will end, but if we proceed in stages we can develop some momentum.'' **********Although the guerrillas have said they are willing to discuss a cease- fire, Mr. Ungo said it was ''a complex matter.'' The Government, he contended, does not want to talk about a cease- fire because ''it is committed to deepening the war and the involvement of the United States.'' **********As a result, he said, periodic truces are more likely than a cease-fire. **********He said the main obstacle to peace would be increased American involvement in the war. He said the pace of negotiations would depend in part on decisions made in Washington. **********On the issue of elections, Mr. Ungo said: ''We believe in elections and have participated in the past. We need elections as soon as possible, but not ones planned without us and against us.''

Wilson, the nation's biggest pork processor, said it would file suit to prevent a takeover. **********On Tuesday, Occidental told the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Oklahoma City, where Wilson is based, that it would file an alternative to Wilson's reorganization plan in February. **********Under the plan, Occidental's beef packing subsidiary, would acquire Wilson for $95 million. The Occidental unit, IBP Inc., of Dakota City, Neb., is the nation's biggest beef packer; the Wilson acquisition would be in line with IBP's recent drive to dominate the nation's pork processing industry, too. **********For Wilson, the proposal is a challenge to its survival at the time when it was expecting to emerge from bankruptcy as a strong competitor to IBP in the meat slaughtering and processing industry. **********'Continuing Conspiracy' Charged **********''The IBP proposal is nothing more than a plan for liquidating Wilson Foods and is clearly part of a continuing conspiracy by the officers and directors of IBP and Occidental Petroleum to monopolize the meat industry,'' said Kenneth J. Griggy, president and chief executive of Wilson. **********Gordon Reece, a spokesman for Occidental, said the company ''denied all of the allegations and accusations made by Wilson Foods.'' He added: ''IBP believes its proposed plan wof reorganization ill offer Wilson creditors, debt holders and shareholders a better alternative than Wilson's plan. **********If the Occidental plan is approved by creditors, stockholders of both companies and the court, IBP would acquire the 5.9 million common shares of Wilson, repay trade creditors and redeem debentures that became due Jan. 1, for a total of $95 million. Occidental would also take on $67 million in outstanding notes, debentures and lease obligations, to be repaid from profits. Under the Wilson plan, creditors would be paid on a four-year schedule. **********The industry has been uneasily watching IPB's presence in the pork industry grow for some months.

R. KLEINFIELD **********Patients going to the Methodist Medical Center in Peoria, Ill., never worry about parking their cars. The hospital started offering valet parking a few months ago. The place also has a doorman. After he swings open the door, patients are handed over to an escort, who shepherds them to their destination. **********''These things are going over really well,'' remarked Ellen Barron, the hospital's vice president for marketing and planning. ''People appreciate the little things.'' **********Hospitals and doctors, faced with competition at every turn, are resorting to the sort of marketing tactics more commonly found in the airline business or the quick-burger industry. With increasing frequency, they are advertising in newspapers and on television. According to figures from the Television Bureau of Advertising, for example, health-care professionals spent $41 million on TV spots last year, compared with just $3.7 million in 1977. **********Some Concerns **********To be sure, many doctors and consumers, who feel that the saving of lives is a lot different from the selling of pudding, look with half-lidded eyes on the idea of health-care advertising. Marketing expenditures, moreover, might contribute to higher health- care costs and needless utilization. A spokesman for the American Medical Association remarks, ''Lots of physicians still associate advertising with quackery. Some doctors don't want to even list their names in the Yellow Pages.'' **********But the concept is clearly gaining acceptance among nonprofit and profit-making institutions alike. ''Different approaches are being tried,'' said William Flexner, head of Flexner & Associates, a health care consultant. ''Some places are advertising that they care, which I don't think works because you have to experience caring. Others are advertising 'we have such-and-such service' - prenatal care or ambulatory surgery, for instance. Some hospitals advertise an image. A popular one seems to be the high-tech image.'' **********In addition, health-care dispensers are cooking up some unorthodox enticements. Some hospitals, including a number of the 89 facilities in the Humana Inc. chain, guarantee that they will inspect a patient within a prescribed time of arrival in the emergency room. Eastwood Hospital in Memphis gives refunds to patients of between $5 and $15 if various standards are not met, such as if the floor nurse does not answer a call signal within a minute, the linens are not changed daily or a meal is not served piping hot. In the program's first year, infractions resulted in the hospital's trimming a total of $140 from patients' bills. **********Direct Mail Campaign **********When Southwood Community Hospital in Norfolk, Mass., was converted to a general hospital from a cancer treatment center recenntly, the community was saturated with direct mail brochures that enclosed coupons good for a free medical encyclopedia. To get the volume, a patient had to show up at the hospital's walk- in clinic, but did not have to be treated. And an Albuquerque, N.M., obstetrician-gynecologist advertised his practice using a hot-air balloon with a stork painted on it. **********One of the more memorable marketing gimmicks was used by Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas. A number of years ago, the hospital staged a lottery that was open only to patients who checked in on the weekend, a typically slack time at hospitals. The grand prize was a cruise for two. Utilization soared by 60 percent in 18 months. **********''Hospitals and doctors have suddenly found themselves in a competitive situation which didn't exist 10 years ago,'' said Dan Beckham, head of Healthmarket Inc., a health-care consultant. **********Mr. Beckham guesses that perhaps 50 percent to 60 percent of the nation's hospitals now employ a marketing professional, compared with perhaps 5 percent to 10 percent just three years ago. **********Until recently, medical societies and hospital associations frowned on or actually barred their members from soliciting patients. It was as recently as 1977 that the American Hospital Association published its first guidelines for hospital advertising. The Federal Trade Commission ruled in 1980 that the American Medical Association could not bar its members from advertising, and the A.M.A. has revamped its code of ethics to allow advertising in a truthful manner. **********Since then, health-care professionals have found different ways of marketing their services. **********Ways of Marketing **********''Marketing is how your office is decorated,'' remarks Irwin Braun, president of Braun Advertising and a student of the subject. ''Marketing is what kind of service you give people. Marketing is how long you keep people waiting. An ad can get you into an office, and if a person is kept waiting for an hour, he'll take a walk. One famous ear, eye and throat doctor in New York has his office reception room decorated with portraits of Presidents and actors whom he has treated. That's marketing.'' **********Like many cities, Flint, Mich., is extremely competitive for health- care providers. To woo patients, St. Joseph's Hospital thought up several special deals. For example, the hospital offers a packaged obstetrical program called ''Special Delivery.'' An expectant mother gets a 24-hour hospital stay and follow-up visits for $799. A normal charge for delivery had been $2,500 to $3,000. **********In advertising the offer, the hospital used the theme: ''A bundle of joy . . . A bundle of money.'' It hit home. Deliveries climbed to 1,650 last year, from 1,200 in the previous year, a rise the hospital attributes mainly to the campaign. **********Emergency Room Fees **********St. Joseph's also noticed that it was rapidly losing emergency room business, especially minor emergencies, to after-hour clinics and emergency clinics not associated with hospitals. A study found that the key elements that affected a patient's choice of emergency rooms were cost and waiting time. **********So instead of charging a flat fee of $65 for all emergency room patients, the hospital switched to a tier system of pegging fees to the severity of the injury. Someone with a heart atack now pays about $250, while a person with a bump on the head would be charged $25. A TV campaign promoted the new approach, and the hospital reports that emergency room business has picked up by about 10 percent in the past year. **********Greg Korneluk is a Lewiston, N.Y., consultant who specializes in advising doctors on how to sell themselves. ''The marketing theory that I use with physicians is that the actual cost service offered to patients is pretty homogeneous,'' he explained. ''Things like parking, appearance, staff, courtesy - all those peripheral things matter.'' **********Mr. Korneluk, noting that a number of doctors have video games in their reception rooms, urges his clients to put TV sets in their examination rooms. ''While the patient is sitting there naked he can watch the TV,'' he said. ''I know a doctor in St. Louis who has color sets in all his exam and reception rooms. That's class.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/07/business/death-stalls-pantry-pride-dispute.html": {"writer_name": "Tamar Lewin", "pub_date": "1984-11-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 572, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DEATH STALLS PANTRY PRIDE DISPUTE", "print_headline": "DEATH STALLS PANTRY PRIDE DISPUTE", "body_text": " **********Philip Devon, the former director of Pantry Pride Inc. who announced over the weekend that he would begin a proxy fight to oust the company's management, died Monday evening, leaving the plans for the proxy battle for the supermarket chain in doubt. **********Mr. Devon originally indicated that the proxy fight was being planned under an agreement with Stuart Perlman, a Florida investor, who with his brother, Clifford, owns about 4 percent of Pantry Pride.

It was then that he headed the design bureau mentioned in his obituary. **********Although neither his obituary nor his entries in encyclopedias mentioned his role in nuclear bombs and missiles, they contained hints that were not noticed at the time. They said he had the distinction of being a three-time recipient of the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, an unusual honor shared by a handful of people, most of them linked to nuclear weapons development. **********The recipients included Dr. Kurchatov and Dr. Shchelkin. Others, among participants in the bomb program who are still living, are Andrei D. Sakharov, 63 years old, the banished physicist and rights advocate; two other physicists, Yakov B. Zeldovich, 70, and Yuri B. Khariton, 80, and Yefim P.

He was a five-time winner of the Stalin Prize, a rare distinction. Like others in the atomic bomb program, he was made a corresponding member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1953. **********He was born in the village of Vesprik, in Poltava Province of the Ukraine, and worked in a sugar-beet factory in his youth. After graduating from an engineering school in Leningrad in 1932, he went to work in a tractor plant. **********When the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, the plant was evacuated to Chelyabink in the Urals and converted to tank manufacture.

Most activity of this sort in Nicaragua has been paid for by the United States through the C.I.A. **********The primer explains how to kidnap and kill officials, blow up public buildings and blackmail ordinary citizens. **********The White House had no comment on the document today. But at least one member of Congress said he was calling for an investigation. **********Representative Thomas J. Downey, New York Democrat, said he wrote to the House Select Committee on Intelligence today, asking for a hearing when the new Congress convenes next year. **********''Is it the position of our Government to hire killers?'' he wrote. ''This runs counter to the President's directive condemning terrorism, and I want to know how high up in the Administration this goes.'' **********A copy of the primer was first obtained by The Associated Press and intelligence officials confirmed that the C.I.A. had written it. An agency spokesman declined comment. **********The primer consists of chapters describing the steps of building a guerrilla force. It is written as if it were written by a Nicaraguan taking up arms along with the guerrillas. **********The author advises guerrillas to ''precondition the masses to believe'' that ''foreign advisers and their counseling programs are in reality 'interventionists' in our homeland who direct the exploitation of our nation.'' The advice alludes to the Nicaraguan Government's Cuban advisers. Some residents of the region have said that it is the C.I.A. that intervenes. **********5 Phases of WarThe primer leads ''the guerrilla student'' through five phases of preparing for and carrying out a guerrilla war, and it includes two diagrams. One demonstrates the arrangement of self- reinforcing guerrilla cells, and the other shows how operations should be carried out in a hypothetical region. **********The following, taken from the primer, is an abbreviated version of the guerrilla warfare course: **********The guerrilla is first turned into a propagandist through small group discussions, designed to ''create a favorable impression of our movement.'' **********Guerrilla leaders direct the discussions, leading the fledgling guerrillas ''to reach a correct conclusion'' although ''the guerrillas should feel that it was their free and own decision.'' **********Guerrillas should explain to the people that ''our struggle is not against the nationals but rather against Russian imperialists.'' All of that ''will foster the sympathy of the peasants, and they will immediately become one of us.'' **********Once the guerrillas are indoctrinated, the course moves to ''armed propaganda,'' meaning actual warfare.   Visit to a Town Depicted **********Guerrillas are advised to ''occupy a town or small city which is neutral or relatively passive in the conflict.'' Immediately on arrival, the guerrillas should take these steps: **********- ''Destroy the military or police installations and remove survivors to a public place.'' **********- ''Cut all outside lines of communication.'' **********- ''Establish a public tribunal'' where the guerrillas ''shame, ridicule and humiliate'' Sandinistas and sympathizers, ''shouting slogans and jeers.'' **********- Make ''courtesy visits'' to the town's ''prominent people, such as doctors, priests and teachers.'' **********If ''it becomes necessary'' to shoot a citizen who is ''trying to leave the town,'' guerrillas should explain that ''he was an enemy of the people'' who would have ''alerted the enemy'' so that the Sandinistas could ''carry out acts of reprisals, such as rapes, pillage, destuction, captures, etc.''  'Neutralizing' Public Officials **********The final lesson in the armed propaganda chapter, titled ''Selective Use of Violence,'' involves ''neutralizing'' selected public officials. The lesson stresses that ''it is absolutely necessary to gather together the population affected, so that they will be present and take part in the act.'' **********After the official is publicly ''neutralized,'' guerrillas should offer ''extensive explanation'' of ''why it was necessary for the good of the people'' and then ''choose carefully'' the person ''who will replace the target.'' **********In Chapter 3, guerrillas are taught the function of ''armed propaganda teams.'' These are recruiters who visit villages to ''exploit the socio-political weaknesses in the target society.'' **********At first, each team member should be ''courteous and humble'' and should ''mix in with the community,'' attending birthdays, parties and funerals. If ''one or two men'' are hostile, that ''can be overcome by eliminating the enemy in a rapid and effective manner.'' **********Initially members of propaganda teams ''should not mention their political ideology.'' Instead they should elicit concern by telling workers that ''the state is putting an end to factories'' and doctors that ''they are being replaced with Cuban paramedics.'' **********As soon as the guerrillas learn the aspirations of the local people, they should say that joining the insurrection is the way to see those desires realized. **********The chapter calls for short visits, no longer than three days, on the ground that longer visits ''would overexpose the target audience and cause a negative reaction.''  A Lesson on How to Blackmail **********Guerrillas next learn how to blackmail citizens so they can be used as informants. **********''Meetings with the guerrilla leaders can be arranged to seem casual,'' the primer says. ''The meeting will be held so that other people know that the target is attending them. The target then is faced with his participation in the insurrectional struggle, and it will be indicated to him that if he fails to cooperate or carry out future orders, he will be exposed.'' **********If the target still decides not to join, guerrillas should denounce the target to the police using ''false statements from citizens.'' If targets do join, they will be used ''for subjective internal control of groups to which they already belong.'' **********All of this is to ''prepare in advance a hostile mental attitude among the target groups so that, at the decisive moment, they will erupt in general violence.''  Use of Professional Criminals **********When the uprising occurs, ''professional criminals should be hired to carry out selective jobs,'' such as ''taking the demonstrators to a confrontation with the authorities to bring about uprisings and shootings that will cause the death of one or more people to create a martyr for the cause.'' **********Other people will be ''armed with clubs, iron rods and placards and, if possible, small firearms, which they will carry hidden.'' Still other ''shock troops,'' equipped ''with knives, razors, chains, clubs and bludgeons,'' will ''march slightly behind the innocent and gullible participants'' as the uprising progresses. **********When the ''concentration reaches its highest level of euphoria or popular discontent,'' the guerrilla commander, watching from a high vantage point, will order his men to begin chanting anti-Sandinista slogans. The commander ''can change slogans'' as the rioting progresses ''and eventually incite violence if he wishes.'' **********That will give the impression that there are many guerrillas and that ''they have a large popular backing.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/25/business/finance-new-issues-utility-agency-makes-offering-in-california.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 166, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES ; Utility Agency Makes Offering in California", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES ; Utility Agency Makes Offering in California", "body_text": " **********The Southern California Public Power Authority is offering $235 million of revenue bonds with a maximum yield of 11 percent for bonds due in 2021, according to tentative prices announced yesterday by underwriters led by Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.

CUTS PRICES ON PC LINE", "print_headline": "I.B.M. CUTS PRICES ON PC LINE", "body_text": " **********In a move to step up pressure on competitors, the International Business Machines Corporation yesterday announced deep price cuts on its entire Personal Computer line, including its troubled PCjr home computer. The reductions, which have long been expected in the industry, range from 18 percent to about 23 percent. **********The computer giant, whose three- year-old Personal Computer has become an industry standard, also quadrupled the amount of internal memory it offers with its entry-level models - making even the most basic machines capable of running some of the most popular and increasingly complex software packages. **********But it did not announce any changes in the much-criticized design of the PCjr, which has floundered since its introduction in January. **********The move comes as retailers report that the I.B.M. PC's, once in such short supply that customers waited months for delivery, are suddenly abundant - a reflection of both tapering demand and of greatly increased production rates at I.B.M.'s Boca Raton, Fla., plant. **********Renewed Competition **********It also comes as the company's product is under renewed attack from its primary competitor in the personal computer field: Apple Computer Inc. **********Under the new pricing plan, which is effective immediately, a typically configured I.B.M Personal Computer with 256,000 bytes, or characters of internal memory, a single disk drive and a monochrome display screen will retail for about $2,520. That is about 23 percent below the old price of roughly $3,270, and only $25 above the base price of Apple's popular new Macintosh computer. **********But Apple may suffer less from the cuts than the raft of I.B.M.-compatible manufacturers who have stayed alive by offering machines that are only marginally different from I.B.M. models but cost about 20 percent less. Recently several of those companies, particularly Eagle Computer, have suffered reversals of fortunes, and analysts doubt that all of them can stay afloat. **********''This is the first salvo in the shakeout,'' said Douglas A. Cayne, vice president and financial analyst for the Gartner Group, a Stamford, Conn., research concern that follows I.B.M. closely. He added, ''Everybody is going to have to match the prices, and some of them don't have the margins to do it. It's going to be a bloody summer.'' **********But the president of one manufacturer most directly affected by the cut, Rod Canion of the Compaq Computer Corporation, contended in a telephone interview from Houston last night that he thought the company might even benefit from the I.B.M. move. **********''We anticipated the move, and cut our prices accordingly,'' said Mr. Canion, referring to a price cut announced by Compaq several weeks ago. He said, however, that after the cut took place dealers were less willing to steer customers to the Compaq, a portable computer that has proven the most popular I.B.M. compatible, because their own profit margins were diminished. **********'Tough' Year Ahead **********''This should make it easier,'' he said. Still, I.B.M,'s cuts included its new Portable Personal Computer, which at $3,020 is only $25 more than the similar Compaq model. **********And Mr. Canion admitted that ''this is going to be a tough rest of the year for all of us because of the supply situation,'' which has already led to some deep discounting of personal computer products. **********Indeed, in yesterday's announcement Philip D. Estridge, president of I.B.M.'s Entry Systems Division, hinted that more aggressive moves may be on the way. ''The personal computer marketplace is one of the most dynamic segments of the information-handling industry today,'' he said. ''We intend to continue to respond to the needs of our customers across the entire I.B.M. Personal Computer product line.'' **********Rumors about an I.B.M. price cut have raced through the industry and Wall Street for the past week, and combined with reports of weakness in sales of low-end home computers, they have made investors jittery. I.B.M.'s stock fell $2.875 on Tuesday - the day it extended more liberal credit to dealers carrying the PCjr - although it rose 35 1/2 cents on Wednesday. Yesterday, it closed at $105.625, down 12 1/2 cents; the market was closed by the time the company announced its price cuts at 5:30 P.M. **********Several Strategies Pursued **********Analysts said that I.B.M. appeared to be pursuing several separate, but interwoven, strategies in its announcement today. **********''The first, of course is simply a matter of price,'' said Frank Gens, an analyst with the Yankee Group, a Boston consulting concern. ''Outside competitive pressures have increased, and I.B.M.'s costs are coming down,'' he noted, as the company has stepped up production. **********Earlier this year, an I.B.M. executive addressing financial analysts in Boca Raton said that the company was producing one Personal Computer every 15 seconds, and by the end of the year planned to step up that rate to one every seven seconds. **********A second aspect concerns the capability of I.B.M.'s machines. While a standard model with 64K, or 64,000 bytes, of internal memory, looked like a lot in 1981, when the computer was introduced, it is unimpressive now. The most popular business software, such as the Lotus Development Corporation's top-selling 1-2-3 financial spreadsheet program, takes about 180K to run, and a new generation of programs, such as Lotus's ''Symphony'' and Ashton-Tate's ''Framework,'' require much more. In its statement yesterday, I.B.M. indicated that the move was prompted by ''customer desire for increased function and ease of use.'' **********More Powerful Machine **********It also makes way, at a price point only somewhat higher than those occupied until yesterday by the PC and the more powerful XT model, for a new, more powerful I.B.M. computer. That machine, which is expected to be much faster than the current Personal Computer and capable of handling multiple tasks at one time, could come as early as this summer. Under the new pricing plan, a basic XT, with 256K of memory, a hard disk for mass storage, a floppy disk, and a monochrome display costs $4,920, down 18 percent from $6005.  However, if I.B.M. sought simply to step up the pressure on competitors with its Personal Computer and XT price cuts yesterday, its strategy for the PCjr was less clear. **********Sales of the home computer were disappointing, by I.B.M.'s own admission, and analysts had expected both a price cut and modifications to the packaging of the machine - specifically its keyboard and its memory capacity. **********''I really don't know that a price cut alone will do the trick,'' said Mr. Gens, even though I.B.M. has brought the base price of its high-end model of the PCjr - which includes a single disk drive - to $999, from its old level of $1,269. **********However, an I.B.M. spokesman, Jeannette Maher, said last night, ''We believe the PCjr price and performance make it very competitive with other computers in its class.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/01/world/old-andes-language-finds-niche-in-computer-age.html": {"writer_name": "Marlise Simons", "pub_date": "1984-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OLD ANDES LANGUAGE FINDS NICHE IN COMPUTER AGE", "print_headline": "OLD ANDES LANGUAGE FINDS NICHE IN COMPUTER AGE", "body_text": " **********As a boy, Ivan Guzman de Rojas would roam among the alpaca herds and mud huts of the high Andes with his father, at the time Bolivia's best-known painter of the Indians known as the Aymaras. **********''My father would tell me, this is a rich culture,'' Mr. Guzman recalled of the Aymaras. ''Don't be fooled just because its appearance is poor.'' **********Now, 40 years later, Mr. Guzman says he has made discoveries that support his father's claim, although in an entirely unexpected way. He has concluded that the ancient Aymara language is an ideal tool for the computer. **********Mr. Guzman, a German-educated mathematician, says that because of the unusual structure of the Aymara language, he has been able to convert it into an algebraic code. By using this code as an interface, or bridge, in the computer, he claims to have developed the beginnings of a multilanguage translation system. Several experts who have seen Mr. Guzman's work say he may be on the verge of a breakthrough in computer linguistics.   The Problem of Idioms **********Computer translation, a field of research in which manufacturers have already invested millions of dollars, has always been hampered by the nature of human language, which is too whimsical and filled with ambiguities and hard-to-translate idioms to be handled easily by a machine. **********But Mr. Guzman's formula, some experts say, deals with language in a mathematical way. **********''Basically, I found a way to teach the computer any grammar by using the Aymara syntax,'' Mr. Guzman said. **********In his home, along one of the capital's steep streets, the soft-spoken, 50- year-old scientist quickly turned passionate when referring to his research into Aymara, which he calls a ''hobby that now dominates my life.'' **********''The language is beautiful,'' Mr. Guzman said, holding the first known dictionary of Aymara, which was compiled by a Jesuit in the 16th century. ''It is a very fine piece of logic, so compact and orderly, so well-conceived, you might think it was designed.'' **********Aymara is related to Quechua - a language more widely spoken by Indians in South America - and is believed to be between three and five millennia old. Mr. Guzman said Aymara uses no irregular verbs or gender but builds ideas and sentences by adding strings of suffixes to root words.   Language of 2.5 Million Indians **********Mr. Guzman said he began his work with Aymara largely in an effort to generate respect for the neglected culture and dying language of 2.5 million mostly illiterate Indians in the highlands of Bolivia and Peru. **********Anthropologists and computer experts, he said, at first laughed at his claim that an ancient language was a fine mathematical tool. But as he developed his translation system and outsiders began to show interest, this has taken over most of his spare time. **********He works on borrowed computers, usually on weekends or late at night. Although he founded and headed the Institute for Science Research at the University of La Paz, political in-fighting forced him to resign. Since then he has supported his five children by working as a consultant in accounting systems. **********Several organizations in the United States, including Wang Computers of Lowell, Mass., have invited Mr. Guzman to the United States for demonstrations. **********''Guzman's approach is extremely original,'' said Miguel Brazao, head of one of Wang's research and development divisions. ''It is the only program that uses mathematics to go from one language to another. It is based on the algorithmic structure of Aymara. It is small and exceptionally fast and goes much further than the translation systems I'm familiar with.'' **********Canada's International Development Research Center in Ottawa has published a 150-page monograph that Mr. Guzman wrote about his findings. **********''Academically and professionally the analysis is sound,'' said Robert Valentin, a center official consulted by telephone. ''We supported the work to look at the communication problems between Aymara and Spanish speakers, but we have no program to support machine translation.''  Small Grant From Unesco **********The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has given Mr. Guzman a small grant to continue research. **********Some skepticism was expressed by experts who had not seen the Aymara method but who said that systems using a bridge language have so far had only limited success. **********Daniel Everett, a visiting scholar in the linguistics department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an authority on Andean languages, noted that there had been many efforts to reduce one language to a mathematical form for translation into another tongue, but with only limited success. **********A specialist at the International Business Machines Corporation also questioned the value of using an intermediate language, rather than direct translation.   Aymara Lacks Modern Words **********The discovery of Aymara's unusual properties happened accidentally in 1980, Mr. Guzman said, when he was searching for a new way to teach mathematics to Aymara children. **********''I heard there were problems,'' he said. ''We have always used foreign models in our educational system, often so alien that they become a joke.'' But he got into trouble, he said, because he could not figure out Aymara logic. **********''So I made a truth table. Two-valued Boolean algebra did not work. I tried three-valued formulas, following the Polish scientist Jan Lukaciewicz. It worked. Then I got drawn in and studied the logical structure and the whole syntax on the computer. Once I had the algorithms formalized, I began translating.'' **********Most of the work, he said, is still to come: the main drawback of Aymara is its lack of modern words, but its structure can easily incorporate modern ideas and vocabulary. **********''That will also help the Aymaras communicate with the outside world,'' he said. ''Right now the language is being currupted by Spanish and eroding quickly.'' **********After finishing the work on his translation system, Mr. Guzman hopes to get back to his plan to use the computer to translate textbooks into Aymara and to study the Indian thought process. **********''I am now convinced that there is a different logic at work,'' he said. ''This may be one reason why American Indian peoples have such trouble communicating with the European cultures around them.'' **********''We need to study this,'' he added. ''It's the key to our culture. If I can use the computer to do this and to protect the language, I'm satisfied. My dream is to get the Aymaras to read in their own language and to use my computer one day to start an Aymara newspaper.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/15/world/brandt-visits-managua-but-fails-to-settle-nicaragua-vote-dispute.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1984-10-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 444, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRANDT VISITS MANAGUA BUT FAILS TO SETTLE NICARAGUA VOTE DISPUTE", "print_headline": "BRANDT VISITS MANAGUA BUT FAILS TO SETTLE NICARAGUA VOTE DISPUTE", "body_text": " **********Former Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany, who arrived here less than 48 hours ago to mediate disputes over Nicaragua's planned presidential election, left today, his mission apparently a failure. **********During his visit, Mr. Brandt, the president of the Socialist International, met with the president of the Roman Catholic Episcopal Conference, Bishop Pablo Antonio Vega, and with leaders of the Government and the opposition.

The pledge was part of the Fontainebleau summit accord last month on reforming the finances of the trading bloc, whose formal name is the European Economic Community. **********That agreement was supposed to end the bitter disputes over the community's runaway farm spending and Britain's complaint that it pays an unfair share of it. The quarrel had virtually paralyzed the Common Market for the preceding four years. **********'Relaunching of Europe' **********After the compromise, the 10 market members - Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Greece, Ireland and Luxembourg - announced ambitious new plans for a ''relaunching of Europe,'' including closer integration of their economies and steps to improve political cooperation. **********But all this will be jeopardized, officials warn, if the Fontainebleau accord starts to fall apart. The vote today by the European Parliament, the market's legislative arm, suggests that it might, and the action was greeted angrily in Britain. Under the Fontainebleau compromise the 10 members agreed to limit Britain's budget contribution over the next few years. But they also undertook to impose tighter spending controls and to increase the community's own financial resources so it can afford to admit Spain and Portugal as members. **********Promised to Find Funds **********By blocking Britain's promised rebate, the Parliament is trying to put pressure on Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to settle the one financial disagreement that the members failed to resolve at Fontainebleau: how to raise the additional $2 billion they still need this year to pay for the huge food surpluses their farmers are producing. **********At Fontainebleau the members merely promised to find all funds needed ''to insure the community's normal functioning'' during 1984, without saying how. But unless this money is found by October, the Common Market will run out of funds, forcing member governments to pay for these agricultural surpluses out of their own pockets or accept a sudden, drastic decline in their farmers' incomes.  At a meeting in Brussels last week, Britain refused to provide any additional financing for this year's budget, saying the community should balance its books by cutting or deferring planned expenditures instead. **********Other countries suggested making advance payments on their 1985 or 1986 budget shares. But Britain vetoed this, finding itself politically isolated again as it was so often during the acrimonious debates that preceded the Fontainebleau compromise. **********After that meeting, the Common Market's executive commission further irritated Britain by announcing a series of new agricultural spending mesures that add another $150 million to the year's expected deficit but are supported by other members. These include politically controversial plans to sell surplus butter and meat to the Soviet Union and Iran at heavily subsidized prices. **********Vote Called Illegal **********In London, British officials called the vote illegal and provocative. They said there was no question of Britain's approving additional revenues for the community this year and that the Common Market must cut spending instead. **********(Prime Minister Thatcher, in a British television interview, condemned the decision as ''absolutely despicable'' and ''very childish and petty, the more so because the previous Parliament had agreed,'' Reuters reported. Asked whether Britain would withhold payments to the community, she said: ''I don't think it's come to that yet. Just because they behave that way is no reason for us to do so, too.'') **********In Strasbourg, Lord Druro, the British Conservative Party spokesman on budgetary matters, said the Parliament's vote makes it ''almost impossible'' for Britain to ratify the Fontainebleau agreement on increasing Common Market revenues by giving the community a larger share of the sales taxes of member states. **********The opposition Labor Party spokesman on Europe, Robin Cook, said in London that the vote ''means the Fontainebleau agreement is in tatters'' and called on Mrs. Thatcher to refuse to attend any more meetings on community finances until Britain's rebate is paid. **********The French Government, which as host played a major role in negotiating the Fontainebleau agreement, appeared embarrassed by the Parliament's action.  In a radio interview, the French European Affairs Minister, Roland Dumas, said that the Fontainebleau accord still stood and that France would do everything possible to see that it was carried out. He hinted that France would try to persuade French Socialist members of the European Parliament to reverse the decision at its next meeting in September, although they do not have the votes to do this alone. **********Some Progress Made **********The 10 market members have already made some progress toward reducing the high subsidies they pay their farmers to produce what have been depicted as ''mountains'' of unwanted butter and meat and ''lakes'' of undrunk wine. Over the last two years, they have withdrawn the unlimited subsidies they used to offer farmers from about 60 percent of European food production, reducing or eliminating payments when output exceeds a certain quantity. **********But increased productivity has raised Europe's ''butter mountain'' to a record 1.24 million tons, and the ''meat mountain'' is also growing swiftly as farmers react to the limits on subsidies by slaughtering dairy cattle. Only next year will the 10 market members start to restrict subsidies for wine. **********By refusing to advance the community any more money to pay for these surpluses, some analysts think Britain is hoping to strengthen its bargaining position for the negotiations this fall on tightening budget discipline. In principle, the 10 market members have agreed to set overall limits of farm spending. But they have not yet translated this into specific rules. **********But officials also agree that the ambitious plans the 10 members announced after their Fontainebleau agreement for closer integration of their economies and increased political cooperation will be in danger if this latest budgetary quarrel is not resolved soon."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/16/world/israel-vows-to-reply-on-terror.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 241, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ISRAEL VOWS TO REPLY ON TERROR", "print_headline": "ISRAEL VOWS TO REPLY ON TERROR", "body_text": " **********The Israeli Cabinet secretary, speaking after the Cabinet met to review last week's hijacking of a civilian bus by Palestinian guerrillas, said today that Israel would respond ''appropriately'' to any future terrorist attacks, **********After the meeting, some officials said Israel held the Syrian Government responsible for the recent increase in terrorism against Israelis. **********The Cabinet secretary, Dan Meridor, did not mention Syria by name in his statement. **********''The Government is watching, as always, the actions of the terrorists, their intentions, the assistance they receive and it will respond appropriately,'' Mr. Meridor said.

The 32-year-old Mr. Lam, who came here from Hong Kong 15 years ago, is a garment contractor who makes clothes for such quality houses as Leslie Fay, Pierre Cardin and Evan Picone. He is a real estate speculator who owns four Chinatown buildings. He trades in silk. And he is talking about opening a bank. **********But his businesses do have one thing in common. They are outgrowths of a network of family members and business contacts that spans from Chinatown to Hong Kong to China. ''I have a big family and each member goes in a different direction,'' Mr. Lam said. ''Then we all work together.'' **********Indeed, Mr. Lam, like many immigrants, started with an all-in-the- family approach. It was $5,000 of his father's savings that enabled him to start his contract garment business in 1971. His sisters were the foremen at his first five factories. His brother and both his parents chipped in to manage the growing business. **********Cousins in Shanghai got Mr. Lam into silk trading. Through their contacts, he ships silk fibers from China to be woven in Hong Kong, then sells the finished fabrics in the United States. ''I don't even have to work, I just sign the contracts,'' he said. And lucrative contracts they are - Mr. Lam imported $12 million worth of silk fabric last year. **********While Mr. Lam has earned the respect of any number of non-Chinese business contacts - Ralph Iannozzone, vice president of Leslie Fay, calls him ''a very assured young man who has definitely learned this business'' - he still turns to his countrymen for partners, labor or funding. **********When he needed $250,000 last year for garment manufacturing equipment, the loan came from the United Orient Bank, a Chinese-run bank in Chinatown. His right-hand man in the garment contracting business, which has grown to 14 garment factories that generate $30 million in annual revenues, is Hung Luk, a 25-year-old Chinese immigrant who studied business at New York University and is dating Mr. Lam's youngest sister. **********The business employs 1,000 people, most of whom are immigrant Chinese women, many of them skilled garment workers from Hong Kong. Those who have risen to the rank of foreman get a 25 percent interest in the profits of their shop, as well as salaries of between $400 and $500 a week. ''It's easy for an operator to get a job in Chinatown, so I have to pay well,'' Mr. Lam explains. **********Although Mr. Lam has not soured on the garment business, these days ''whatever money I get I throw into real estate,'' he said. Mr. Lam and six Chinese immigrant partners, armed with their own funds and with money sent over from people in Hong Kong who wished to invest here, have made a killing in Chinatown, where real estate prices have tripled in four years. Mr. Lam says he just turned down an offer of $4.5 million for his office building at 129 Lafayette St. The partnership bought it for only $1.8 million in 1982. **********Now Mr. Lam and yet another group of Chinatown partners, also with some financing from Hong Kong investors, have raised $5 million in assets and are seeking a state charter to open a bank in Chinatown. **********At this point, having reached a level of financial comfort, Mr. Lam is ready to move from beneficiary to benefactor in the Chinese ethnic network. He plans to donate several thousand dollars toward a scholarship program for Chinese students at the Fashion Institute of Technology. **********''The future of the Chinese people in the garment manufacturing industry depends on the second generation,'' he said. ''If more become the designers, the buyers and the sales people, then the Chinese will continue to grow in this industry.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/20/business/goldsmith-plans-move-on-colgate.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-11-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 430, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GOLDSMITH PLANS MOVE ON COLGATE", "print_headline": "GOLDSMITH PLANS MOVE ON COLGATE", "body_text": " **********Sir James Goldsmith, the British industrialist, has made an application to increase his holdings in the Colgate-Palmolive Company to more than 10 percent, and the United States Government is not expected to oppose the move, New York antitrust lawyers said yesterday. **********Based on Colgate's 82 million shares outstanding, this would give Sir James over 8.2 million shares, or more than $200 million worth, of the big soap and detergent producer. **********Sir James is thought to have less than half that amount now because, under rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, he would be required to report his holdings once they reached at least 5 percent. **********Rumors of Sir James's interest, which have been circulating for at least a month, pushed up Colgate's stock by more than $2 on the New York Stock Exchange in early October, to nearly $26.

It also reports that the courts are getting tougher and that the service's success rate in audits has improved markedly. **********The Justice Department's tax division, meanwhile, says it will have two dozen lawyers working exclusively on fraudulent shelters. **********A tax shelter, basically, is an investment that provides substantial deductions from income otherwise taxable to the investor. Real estate and oil exploration are two of the most popular. The Government regards as abusive the shelters that promise immediate deductions of several times the taxpayer's cash investment, especially if the venture seems to have little prospect of earning profits. **********Frequent Methods **********In many cases, the Government says, this is accomplished when the investor puts up some cash but pays the rest through a loan from the promoter that will never have to be repaid. In other instances, the investment property is fraudulently appraised at a much higher value than it merits. **********According to Treasury Department estimates, abusive shelters cost the Government more than $3.6 billion a year in lost revenues. While the campaign to curb them has been under way since the late 1970's, officials say they are now better armed for the attack. **********''There is very definitely a crackdown now,'' said Glenn L. Archer Jr., Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's tax division. **********According to Roscoe L. Egger Jr., Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the stepped-up effort comes at a time when Congress, the courts and taxpayers are calling for action. ''They expect us to do something about it,'' Mr. Egger said in an interview, ''and we are doing it.'' **********An Inhibiting Effect **********Accountants, lawyers and shelter promoters confirm that the enforcement campaign is having an inhibiting effect. **********''Clients are becoming more leery of this type of investment,'' said Warren Kolb, a partner in a New Jersey accounting firm. ''They're becoming afraid of an automatic audit if they invest in a shelter.'' Mr. Kolb said he approved of the Government's effort to stamp out shelters that offer write- offs of four to five times the taxpayer's investment and are set up for tax purposes only. **********Some people think the Government is being excessive, however. ''The service may have gone too far in discouraging people from exercising legitimate options available to them to minimize taxes,'' said Walter Pozen of Washington, a senior partner in Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, a law firm with an extensive tax planning practice. **********Mr. Pozen pointed out that the tax laws were designed with a double aim - to raise revenue and to encourage ''socially attractive investments.'' The social aims of the tax law, he said, should not be sacrificed through an overly harsh approach to investments that may offer shelters. **********The determination of the I.R.S. and the Justice Department to stamp out abusive shelters landed them in trouble last week when a Federal judge in Denver attacked their handling of a major shelter prosecution. Dismissing the charges voted by a grand jury, the judge said prosecutors and investigators had ''knowingly'' committed ''abuses of the rules'' of Federal court procedure and had violated constitutional principles in the effort to secure indictments. **********The Law's Requirements **********The rules enacted in the Tax Reform Act of 1984 strengthen measures in the 1982 tax act. The 1982 act empowered the Government to seek an injunction barring a promoter from further sales when it can prove that a shelter is abusive. The act also permitted the I.R.S. to impose a penalty of 10 percent of the gross income derived from abusive schemes. **********The new act adds muscle and makes it easier for the Government to identify potentially abusive shelters in these ways: **********- Starting this month, it requires tax shelter organizers to register shelters with the I.R.S. and requires investors to list their shelters' I.R.S. registration numbers on their tax returns. **********- It requires promoters to maintain lists of investors for inspection by the I.R.S. **********- It doubles the 10 percent penalty for those who participate in abusive shelters. **********- It sets an interest rate of 120 percent of the going I.R.S. rate for tax underpayments attributable to certain types of abusive schemes. **********The new requirement that shelter promoters register with the I.R.S. and that taxpayers list registration numbers on their returns is already causing some consternation. **********''Some investors are worried about having their names registered with the I.R.S. on what's being called an I.R.S. hit list,'' Mr. Kolb, the accountant, said. **********Confused and Frightened **********''People are confused over what the I.R.S. wants to have registered, and when they're confused, they become frightened,'' said a Connecticut shelter promoter who declined to be identified. ''It's a scare tactic, frightening people away from investing in any kind of shelter. The small entrepreneur who has to raise capital for research and development through a shelter will be hurt.'' **********Both the Justice Department and I.R.S. have developed new methods to curb abuses. The I.R.S., Mr. Egger said, has focused on the ''front end,'' in an attempt to close potentially abusive shelters before they are sold. Alternatively, if the shelter is widely sold, the revenue service may try to head off the deductions before the return is filed. **********''Last year, we sent letters to over 11,000 taxpayers telling them we knew they had invested in a shelter we believed would not produce claimed credits,'' he said. ''We said if they claimed the credits, their returns would be examined and corrected, and they would be charged penalties.'' **********Mr. Egger said the service has also refined its methods for selecting returns to audit. Eight or nine years ago, he said, 43 percent of all returns selected for examination proved correct as originally filed, with 57 percent challenged. But with refinements, more careful selection has raised the share of returns challenged to 83 percent. **********In addition, the number of injunctions sought by the I.R.S. to block the sale of shelters it views as abusive has ''stepped up dramatically,'' Mr. Egger said, ''with about 200 cases now in the pipeline.'' **********Litigation Office Formed **********Mr. Archer, the head of the Justice Department's tax division, said that a new office of special litigation was opened in the department last year ''solely to bring injunctions against abusive promoters and handle penalty cases.'' **********He said that cases referred to the Justice Department last year blocked participation by 70,000 potential investors in questionable shelters and averted a potential tax loss of $4 billion for the Government. **********Over all, Mr. Egger said, the I.R.S. has 350,000 tax shelter cases pending, as against 248,828 in 1981. Mr. Egger also said the courts had become less lenient in such cases than they were a few years ago. **********''That has really turned around,'' Mr. Egger said. ''In 1981, 67 percent of those convicted in tax shelter cases were sent to prison,'' he said. ''In 1984, the rate is 87 percent, the highest rate for any tax-related conviction.'' The average prison term has jumped from 11 months to 51 months in tax shelter cases, and the average fine from $6,000 to $20,000, he said. **********''It is a difficult job to distinguish between abusive and illegal shelters and legitimate investments,'' Mr. Archer added, explaining that tax cases generally required some ''badge of fraud'' for prosecution. Such badges, he said, include backdating of documents and secret side agreements between a promoter and an investor. **********How Uncle Sam Defines An Abusive Shelter **********1.  Do the tax benefits far outweigh the economic benefits? 2.  Is this a transaction you would seriously consider, apart from the tax benefits, if you hoped to make a profit?  3.  Do shelter assets really exist and, if so, are they insured for less than their purchase price?  4.  Is there a nontax justification for the way profits and losses are allocated to partners?  5.  Do the facts and supporting documents make economic sense? Or have there been sales and resales of the tax shelter property at ever increasing prices? 6.  Does the investment plan involve a gimmick, device, or sham to hide the economic reality of the transaction?  7.  Does the promoter offer to backdate documents after the close of the year and are you instructed to backdate checks covering your investment?  8.  Is your debt a real debt or are you assured by the promoter that you will never have to pay for it?  9.  Does this transaction involve laundering United States source income through foreign corporations incorporated in a tax haven and owned by United States shareholders?"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/05/world/soviet-rumanian-relations.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 43, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviet-Rumanian Relations", "print_headline": "Soviet-Rumanian Relations", "body_text": " **********Konstantin U.

Under that system, businesses are allowed to write off the cost of investments in plants and equipment much faster than would be permitted under the Treasury's plan. **********Marlin Fitzwater, a White House spokesman, said President Reagan would discuss tax simplification in his State of the Union Message next month but would not send specific tax proposals to Congress until late February or March. **********Baldrige and Block Views **********Two influential members of the President's Cabinet Council on Economic Affairs who were not involved in developing the tax proposals - Malcolm Baldrige, the Secretary of Commerce, and Bill Brock, the United States trade representative - complained at a council meeting last week that the changes in depreciation rules would damage business. **********Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan was said to have responded that he would be willing to change the depreciation recommendations if he could be given statistics rather than speculation about what the effect would be. **********Then, on Thursday, Mr. Regan received a copy of a study by the United States Chamber of Commerce showing that, altogether, the proposals would lead to an increase in the cost of capital formation, a reduction in productivity and a slowing of economic growth. Richard W. Rahn, chief economist of the chamber, said that the depreciation rules were the single most damaging part of the Treasury's package. **********'First Specific Analysis' **********Thomas C. Dawson, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Business and Consumer Affairs, said later that the chamber's presentation was the ''first specific analysis we have received on what the overall impact on the economy would be.'' **********Treasury officials said, however, that if the depreciation proposals were made more generous, other features of the tax plan would have to be made less favorable to business. One official said it was a ''working hypothesis'' that the taxes paid by individuals would not be raised to give businesses better tax breaks. **********The Treasury's plan, delivered to President Reagan on Nov. 27, would increase corporate taxes about 25 percent and reduce the taxes paid by individuals by 8 1/2 percent. **********One problem with changing the proposal on accelerated depreciation is that it would throw the package out of balance. The current proposal would generate $80 billion a year by 1990, and that is a large part of the additional revenue that would permit the rates on corporate taxation to be lowered. **********A Middle Ground **********Tax experts said that it might be possible to find a middle ground between retaining the current depreciation system and adopting the one suggested by the Treasury. **********One business provision of the plan that might be modified to make the depreciation rules more favorable, the officials said, is the one that would allow corporations to deduct half of their dividend payments. **********Alfred H. Kingon, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Policy, Planning and Communications, said revisions in the Treasury's plan would be made and sent to the White House by the middle of January. **********The President's staff members who deal with economic policy have been preoccupied with spending reductions and have yet to turn their attention to taxes, White House officials said. **********Secretary Regan and other top Treasury officials have met several times with Representative Jack F. Kemp, Republican of upstate New York, and Senator Robert W. Kasten Jr., Republican of Wisconsin, who have proposed their own tax plan. They have also met with Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, and Representative Richard A. Ge phardt, Democrat of Missouri, who have introduced a third plan. **********The Kemp-Kasten and BradleyGephardt bills differ in specifics but not in principle from each other and from the Treasury's recommendations. The bills' sponsors and Treasury officials said they hoped eventually to meld the three plans into a single proposal that all could endorse. **********Complaints on Contributions **********As for the proposals concerning individuals' taxes, the officials said they had received the most complaints about the way the Treasury would treat charitable contributions. **********Under the proposal, taxpayers could deduct donations to charity only to the extent they exceeded 2 percent of total income. Furthermore, taxpayers who donate stock, art or other assets to charity would be able to deduct only what they paid for the assets plus an amount to offset the effects of inflation during the time they held the property. Under current law, such people can deduct the market value of the assets, a rule that in most cases has more tax advantages than what the Treasury has recommended. **********Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, met with Secretary Regan on Thursday to express his objection to the proposal that would disallow deductions on Federal tax returns for state and local income taxes. New Yorkers pay the highest state and local taxes in the country, and New York politicians believe the proposal would be especially damaging to the state's residents. **********Treasury officials said they had received few complaints about this provision from people outside of New York State."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/07/world/thatcher-foes-assail-visit-by-south-african.html": {"writer_name": "Jon Nordheimer", "pub_date": "1984-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 324, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THATCHER FOES ASSAIL VISIT BY SOUTH AFRICAN", "print_headline": "THATCHER FOES ASSAIL VISIT BY SOUTH AFRICAN", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister P.

The five- tenths of 1 percent increase in November meant that inflation at the producer level was running at an annual rate of 1.9 percent, three times last year's rate. Although the increase is expected to show up at the consumer level in the months ahead, few economists predicted renewed inflation. Indeed, most saw the surge as a sign that the economy was moving ahead again after several months of limited growth. One surprise was in energy costs, which continued to rise as oil prices fell. **********The recovery of the recovery was shown in the latest retail sales figures, which rose a strong 1.8 percent in November after a dismal summer.

Silicon Valley companies find they have to match the high-volume, high-quality output from Japan, while trying to exploit what is widely recognized as the American advantage - better design skills and greater technological innovation. **********The rate of technological innovation in microelectronics is the fastest of any major industry. This innovation spurs competition among some 80 semiconductor manufacturers in Silicon Valley alone. In this race, the company that is first to market with a new chip can get a tremendous advantage and big dollars. **********But inevitably, haste to deliver leads to problems in quality - an issue that first exploded in March 1980 when Richard W. Anderson, general manager of Hewlett-Packard's computer division, showed to a Washington conference a slide comparing American and Japanese semiconductor quality. Hewlett-Packard had bought 16K RAM (random access memory) chips from three American and three Japanese companies. But the slides showed that the highest quality American product had six times as many defects as the lowest quality Japanese product. **********The initial reaction to the Anderson presentation by Silicon Valley companies was outrage. Then, after calming down, they set about raising the quality of chip production. Within a year, American companies supplying Hewlett-Packard had almost doubled the quality of their 16K RAM's. But the best United States performance was still below that of the worst Japanese, and in fact that discrepancy continues to this day, as the Government's action against National proves. **********The consequences of poor quality semiconductors are serious. There are reports of chips failing in heart pacemakers, in kidney dialysis machines and in a recent NASA space shot. Similar, although unpublicized, failures have occurred in weapons and other military applications. **********Along with Hewlett-Packard, the United States military deserves credit for encouraging high-quality semiconductor production. For chips to meet military specifications, or ''mil specs,'' they must pass tests requiring higher tolerances and greater reliability than most chips sold for consumer applications. And some companies have tried to make all their chips according to mil specs, an effort that cannot help but improve quality. **********During their production, chips are subject to a series of quality control tests including heat-stress tests, commonly called ''burn-in tests.'' These tests run electricity through the chips for nearly seven days to identify defective circuits. Although National conducted burn-in tests on its chips, it frequently terminated the tests after only two days, thereby shortening production times. **********BUT in this business, production time is crucial because the life of a semiconductor product is so short; 80 percent of all chips are based on designs less than five years old. When a new chip is introduced, sales usually start slowly. If it catches on and is available from a second source as well as the developer, the new chip becomes a ''rising star.'' As sales increase, the chip begins to pay off as a large-volume product. Here is where the Japanese excel - large-volume production of standard chips. But eventually a chip becomes outdated and sales dry up. Thus, constant innovation is a key to success. **********The main cause of lower quality, however, comes in the semiconductor production process, where a basic trade-off occurs between innovation and quality. In the United States, quality control usually is a synonym for strict and frequent inspection during production. But the Japanese approach is mainly preventive. They design a semiconductor product and plant to reduce the probability of defects. Much effort is given to the human side of quality control by motivating the workers themselves to value craftsmanship. Quality control circles are organized in many Japanese companies. **********And the primary enemy in the manufacturing process are dust specks, because they short-circuit the miniaturized electronics, leading to rejection of the chip. Semiconductor ''clean rooms'' (the work areas in which the chips are produced) are closed off from the external environment. Workers must wear ''bunny suits'' of lint-free cloth, report forms are made of special paper and pencils cannot be used as they are great dust generators. One enters and leaves a clean room through air locks, each with a negative vacuum inside. **********A semiconductor clean room is cleaner than a hospital operating room; a clean room contains fewer than 100 dust particles of one micrometer or more in diameter per cubic foot, while the dust level in a modern hospital is about 10,000 particles per cubic foot. Ordinary clean air contains about one million dust particles per cubic foot. **********Japanese semiconductor clean rooms are much cleaner than their American counterparts, another factor explaining the higher quality of Japanese chip production. These Japanese approaches to quality, many of them concepts originated in the United States, are being reintroduced here. Most semiconductor companies in Silicon Valley now have quality circles, and they are trying to enforce stricter standards for their clean rooms. But American companies still stress technological innovation, sometimes at the expense of quality. **********The recent National Semiconductor case illustrates this. No National executives were indicted because there was no indication that the directions for the short-cut testing came from top executives. However, middle- level managers, staff engineers and line-operators are pushed by strong pressures to speed production. **********While constant innovation and high- quality production are to be valued, they can also be abused. We think the American industry would be better off if it slowed its production rate and made even greater leaps in quality. A competitive edge will not be gained by poor business practices and bad ethics. **********Everett M. Rogers is Janet M.

No matter how fast the latest machine, **********computer users are always looking for one that can halve the time it takes to crunch a football field full of numbers. And no matter how big a computer's internal memory, someone is soon clamoring for more space - to accommodate more data or to run bigger, more complicated programs. **********So far those two factors - processing speed and memory size - have distinguished the powers of giant mainframe and minicomputer systems from the personal computers that have taken over the nation's desktops. Now the differences are fading quickly. A new generation of microprocessors, the thinking part of a personal computer, has begun to appear on the market with powers that rival those of much larger machines. Those chips are, in turn, making it possible for computer researchers to begin to crack the memory barrier, primarily by making new use of a 20-year-old technology called ''virtual memory.'' **********Virtual memory can be envisioned as a process of electronic sleight of hand. It creates a kind of mirage, one that ''fools'' a computer into thinking that it has far more memory capacity than it does. In reality, with a combination of hardware and ingenious programming, virtual memory systems change the way a computer defines the dimensions of its own internal memory. The result is that the guppie can swallow the whale - the personal computer can run giant-size programs that already provide hearty fare for minis and mainframes. **********''The possibilities are tremendous,'' reports Tron McConnell, computer systems manager of the engineering center of Mellon Institute, a division of Carnegie-Mellon University. ''Until recently, virtual memory technology has been enormously expensive. But these days we are talking about spending $1,000 for a set of chips far more powerful than we used on the onboard computers on the Apollo spacecraft that went to the moon.'' **********Virtual memory is essentially a method of overcoming the limitations of a computer's hardware. Ordinarily, computer programs and other data are stored permanently in a mass storage device, such as a disk drive. But to begin using that information - to run an electronic spreadsheet, for example - an individual must instruct the machine to feed the program from the disk drive into the computer's internal memory. Only when the program resides in the internal memory does it become useful. **********Of course, a computer cannot deal with a program that is bigger than its own memory space. For personal computer users, that hardly posed a problem three years ago, since scarcely a single commercial program was bigger than 64,000 bytes, or characters. But the most popular programs now take up a quarter of a million characters or more, and programmers are itching to write far more powerful, easier-to-use software that could take up several million bytes. **********Adding more memory is feasible, but expensive. The virtual memory system circumvents the need for more memory by eliminating the distinction between the computer's internal memory and the disk drive. ''The way to envision it is to think about a big program cut up into a bunch of little segments,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''The computer looks for what segment it needs at any given time and puts it into memory,'' usually swapping it for another segment of that program that it no longer needs. Thus, the computer ''sees'' its disk drive as an extension of its own memory. **********The concept goes back to the 1960's, when Honeywell Inc., the International Business Machines Corporation and other manufacturers first sought to overcome the limits of their own mainframes. It first became popular in 1972, when I.B.M. incorporated it in its System/370. **********Already, some microcomputer systems, although usually the more expensive ones, make use of the technique. A version of the System/370 virtual memory design can run on the I.B.M. PC XT/ 370, which links the Personal Computer to Big Blue's bigger machines. And the Digital Equipment Corporation's Microvax, for example, runs a virtual memory system nearly identical to the type designed for the larger VAX minicomputers. **********But there are trade-offs. ''The big one is speed - the Microvax runs at about 30 percent of the speed of the bigger system,'' Stephen Kallis, a Digital official, said, adding: ''But then again it costs $10,000, not $100,000.'' Most of the problems have to do with a bottleneck in the transfer of information from the disk to the internal memory. **********While Motorola, Intel and National Semiconductor are all now deeply engaged in what the industry calls ''specsmanship'' - making claims about superior specifications of the virtual memory features incorporated in their newest 32-bit chips - some microcomputer makers are more cautious. I.B.M., for example, was expected by some to announce a virtual memory system for its new Personal Computer AT last week, and surprised the industry by announcing a series of business application programs instead. **********Some I.B.M. watchers now believe the company may hold off for some time, because virtual memory systems for personal computers are still not as graceful as those on bigger systems. It is particularly difficult, for example, to design systems that distinguish easily between the most important or commonly used computer functions, which must be quickly accessible to the computer's central processor, and less crucial work that can be swapped on and off the disk drive. **********''It will be some time before the benefits of virtual memory trickle down to the average user,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''But in this industry 'some time' is not all that long - maybe a year and a half, maybe three years.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/12/world/doctor-s-friends-call-him-model-israeli.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1984-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 749, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DOCTOR'S FRIENDS CALL HIM MODEL ISRAELI", "print_headline": "DOCTOR'S FRIENDS CALL HIM MODEL ISRAELI", "body_text": " **********Friends of one of the Israelis arrested in Britain on charges of abducting a Nigerian exile have described him as a model citizen who would never have become involved in such illicit activity except for patriotic reasons. **********The Israeli Government today reiterated its stand that it had no connection of any kind with the three Israelis arrested on charges of kidnapping and drugging the exile, Umaru Dikko, who was Transport Minister in the Nigerian Government that was overthrown last Dec. 31. **********''This affair was of a criminal nature and whatever Israeli citizens are involved have no connection whatsoever with the Israeli Government or with any of its agencies, either in the past or in the present,'' the spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Avi Pazner, said today. **********A senior Israeli Government source said the three men appeared to be ''hired hands.''

The independent, elected in metropolitan Toronto, has said he will turn Tory in the near future. **********''Canada has responded to a call to unity,'' Mr. Mulroney told a crowd of widely cheering supporters in his hometown of Baie Comeau. He said the party's mandate was ''to create jobs and get the economy of Canada moving again.'' Mr. Mulroney won his own district of Manicouagan in Quebec's north shore. **********Turner Congratulates Mulroney **********Prime Minister Turner was the only Liberal in the country to take a seat formerly held by a Tory. His victory in the district of Vancouver Quadra sets the stage for his plans to rebuild the party over the next three or four years. **********Mr. Turner said in a late evening concession speech that he had congratulated Mr. Mulroney by telephone.  ''The people of Canada from coast to coast have spoken and the people are always right,'' he told a crowd of supporters in a Vancouver hotel. **********He then pledged to work to help the Liberal Party recover from its debilitating loss. ''Tomorrow I begin my task of rebuilding the Liberal Party,'' he said. **********Eleven Liberal Cabinet ministers were losing. Among them were Energy Minister Gerald Regan of Nova Scotia and Employment Minister John Roberts of Toronto. **********Strong Showing in Quebec **********In Quebec the Tories were running ahead of their 1958 result, the best the party has done in the province this century, with 51 percent to 35 percent for the Liberals. That compared with the Liberals' winning victory margin in the last federal election in 1980 of 68 percent to 13 percent for the Tories. **********That result was expected to translate into 61 seats for the Conservatives and 13 for the Liberals. The Conservatives had held one seat in Quebec. **********The Liberals also suffered a severe setback in Ontario, where they formerly held 47 of 95 seats, with the Tories holding 36. Tories were elected to 67 Ontario seats, Liberals to 14, New Democrats to 13 and an independent to one. **********The N.D.P., which favors greater spending on social programs, fared so well that political analysts this evening speculated that it might come close to edging the Liberals out as the official opposition. ''The real opposition in the coming Parliament of Canada is going to be the New Democratic Party,'' Ed Broadbend, the leader, said. **********Mr. Mulroney will be the 18th Prime Minister of Canada. Until 15 months ago, he was a private businessman, serving as president of the Iron Ore Company of Canada. **********Mr. Mulroney's Tories trailed the Liberals by 11 percentage points in a Gallup Poll immediately after Mr. Turner became Prime Minister on June 30. A Gallup Poll issued over the weekend indicated that the Tories had the support of 50 percent of Canadian voters, the Liberals 28 percent and the New Democratic Party 19 percent. **********Sunny weather prevailed across much of the country, and Canadians were said to have turned out in large numbers.   'It's Already Going Bananas' **********In past elections, a high turnout tended to favor the Conservatives. Part of the Liberals' strategy in calling a summer election, when fewer people might be expected to vote, was to take advantage of this phenomenon. **********''It's already going bananas,'' an election clerk here said this morning. An election official in Winnipeg said, ''It's a pretty heavy turnout from what I can see.'' **********Under the country's rigorous practice of repeatedly visiting people's homes before an election to register voters, some 16.7 million of Canada's population of 25.1 million were eligible to cast ballots. Almost nobody escapes enumeration, as the process is called here. **********Normally, about three-quarters of those eligible actually vote. In the last election of February 1980, when winter weather whistled across this northern nation, 69 percent of those eligible went to the polls. By contrast, 54 percent of eligible American voters cast ballots in the 1980 Presidential election. **********At the dissolution of the last Parliament on July 9, the Liberals held 135 seats, the Conservatives 100, the New Democratic Party 31, an independent 1 and 15 seats were vacant.   Distance From Trudeau **********During his 57-day campaign for Canada's highest office, Mr. Mulroney, 45 years old, tried to picture himself as different from former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who many Canadians thought had overstayed his welcome and wreaked havoc with the economy. **********Mr. Trudeau, 64, served as Prime Minister almost continuously from 1968 until June 30, when he stepped aside for the new Liberal Party leader. **********Joe Clark, Mr. Mulroney's predecessor as Tory leader, served as Prime Minister for nine months in 1979-80, after beating Mr. Trudeau, who later was elected again. **********If Mr. Mulroney assumes office on Sept. 17, as some of his aides have suggested, Mr. Turner will have been Canada's leader for just 80 days, making him the second-shortest-serving Prime Minister in Canadian history. **********Mr. Turner, who resigned from Mr. Trudeau's Cabinet in 1975 to become a corporate lawyer, campaigned in his own hotly contested Vancouver district for much of today. **********Mr. Turner had vowed to remain as Liberal leader even if he were not elected Prime Minister. He has said he intended to continue as Liberal leader at least for the next three or four years to rebuild the party. **********But whether he would be able to do so remains to be seen, Liberal politicians say, in part because pressures are expected to mount to replace him.   A Centrist Position **********Although commentators complained often during the campaign that candidates were ignoring the issues, Mr. Mulroney managed to stake out a clearly centrist position. On the one hand, he favored increased military spending, deregulation of various business activities, a weakening of controls on foreign investment and less-nationalistic energy policies. **********On the other, he stressed his commitment to Canada's broad array of social programs, including national health insurance. **********''As I have said repeatedly, the goal of a Progressive Conservative government will be to protect and improve the social safety net,'' Mr. Mulroney said in a major economic address in the last week of the campaign. **********In addition, he pledged a ''handsome'' minimum tax on the rich. **********Mr. Mulroney also promised to repair Canada's relations with the United States, which are believed by some to have been damaged by some of Mr. Trudeau's nationalistic policies. **********Among other things, Mr. Mulroney promised to make the agency responsible for screening foreign investments into something of an investment promotion agency. He also pledged to weaken the features of Canada's energy policies considered most odious by American oil executives. **********''If I were President of the United States, every morning I would thank God that I have Canada as a neighbor,'' he said several times. **********Canada and the United States are by far the world's largest trading partners, with the two nations expected to do $110 billion in trade this year - more than the United States combined trade with Europe and Japan. **********In addition, Canada is the most logical bomber route to and from the United States and the Soviet Union. Canada is also a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and has been generally supportive of United States military policies. **********Mr. Mulroney and President Reagan appeared to get on well last June during a White House visit by the Canadian opposition leader. ''North America needs another Irishman at the helm,'' Mr. Mulroney joked at the outset of the meeting. Mr. Reagan answered, ''I agree.''  Liberal Dominance in Quebec **********With the Tory victory, Canada again has a national party. The Liberals had held 74 of 75 seats in Quebec and 47 of 95 seats in Ontario, but were weaker in the rest of the country.

That was when they received large-scale aid from the Union Nationale, a provincial party angry with the Liberals, and won 50 seats in 1958 under the leadership of John Diefenbaker. **********By a number of measures, elections here are conducted on a smaller scale than in the United States.

''How ridiculous to say that I would give legitimacy in any form to Nazis!'' **********He said he had no idea why the charges had been made by the author of the State Department report, Vincent La Vista, who looked into the illegal movement of refugees in Europe during the postwar period. **********State Dept. Made Report Public **********The State Department made his report public after The New York Times on Jan. 26 published an article that was based in part on the La Vista report. **********Since then new evidence has emerged in New York indicating that Mr. La Vista may not have been aware that some of the people he was investigating were in fact working with United States intelligence authorities. **********In Rome, independent sources have made available official American documents describing Dr. Nix, who headed the German Anti-Nazi Association here after the liberation of Rome in 1944, as a man ''of unquestioned anti- Nazi record'' who was cooperating with Allied intelligence. **********West Germany has recognized Dr. Nix as a victim of Nazi persecution and is paying him restitution in the form of a pension. Hundreds of thousands of people who suffered under the Nazis are receiving such restitution. **********A report on Dr. Nix prepared on April 9, 1945, by the headquarters of the 426th Counter-Intelligence Detachment in Rome and signed by Daniel A. Leahy, special agent, said Dr. Nix ''upon request of C.I.C. has allowed suspicious German nationals in the Rome area to enter into the activities of his group so that closer surveillance and control could be exercised over them and their political security appraised.'' Nix Remembers American Agent **********Dr. Nix, who has no knowledge of the Leahy report, recalled Mr. Leahy as the agent with whom he was in contact while he headed the office that, under Allied and Italian supervision, provided identity cards to Germans who lived in Rome or had drifted here after the liberation. **********Dr. Nix, 77 years old, has been living here since arriving as a refugee in 1938. He said he was imprisoned in Germany from 1935 to 1937, first in the Esterwegen and later in the Oranienburg-Sachsenhausen concentration camps for anti-Nazi activities among Roman Catholic students. He was stripped of his German citizenship in 1940 and it was restored in 1963. **********His association was set up after the liberation as a grouping of about 250 German anti-Nazis who had lived in the somewhat more tolerant atmosphere of Fascist Italy. **********When hundreds of other Germans - defectors or civilian residents of Italy or refugees from neighboring countries - began to arrive, the Allied authorities gave the Anti-Nazi Association, the task of interrogating the Germans and recommending whether they should be given identity cards and allowed to live freely pending repatriation or be interned as Nazi suspects. Work Continued Until 1947 **********Dr. Nix said his group received no money, but staff members were given food rations and collected small fees for the issuing of documents. This work continued until the Italian peace treaty was signed in February 1947, and Italy assumed control over aliens within its territory. **********The following December, Dr. Nix was assigned as a physician to an internment camp for Germans near Rome and was told that he was considered an undesirable alien for reasons that he says were not explained. He was granted legal status as a resident alien six months later, and continues to live and conduct cancer research here. **********Dr. Nix said that he would never knowingly have given an identity card or any help to any suspected Nazi. ''But neither I nor any one else in the chaos of those days, when Europe was full of people far from their countries and without documents, could have prevented that some one slipped through,'' he said. He added that to this day he was aware of no such case in his own work. **********Study Reported Shelved **********The State Department investigator whose 1947 report said the Vatican had assisted in the escape of Nazis may have unwittingly stumbled onto American intelligence operations that were making use of the very people he was investigating, according to Government documents and former officials. **********As a result, the sources say, the report by the investigator, Vincent La Vista, appears to have been ultimately shelved without the wider investigation he recommended. However, documents show that American diplomats took up aspects of his report with an envoy of Pope Pius XII and with officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Both promised to look into the matter, records show. **********In the report, Mr. La Vista called the Vatican ''the largest single organization involved in the illegal movement of emigrants.'' He said that the Vatican had brought pressure on Latin American countries to take in Nazis and that ''the justification of the Vatican for its participation in this illegal traffic is simply propagation of the faith.''  Allegations Were Denied **********Two church historians, the Rev. Robert Graham and the Rev. Pierre Blet, dismissed the allegations in the report as ''nothing but air'' and ''artificial and false.'' Father Blet also questioned accounts that Walter Rauff, a former Nazi official said to have developed the mobile death vans, had been given refuge in church convents before escaping to Chile, where his extradition is again being sought. **********A Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Romeo Panciroli, called the statements of the historians ''a sufficiently clear reply'' to the issue and the Vatican indicated that the statements constituted its official reply. **********Mr. La Vista, a lawyer, worked at the beginning of World War II as an investigator for the Army Air Forces and in 1945 was assigned to the embassy in Rome under the Division of Foreign Activity Correlation, a State Department intelligence office. He was assigned to trace looted Nazi wealth in a secret operation code-named ''Safehaven'' and he also headed the American team that studied and microfilmed the seized archives of Benito Mussolini. Mr. La Vista died in Arlington, Va., in 1951 at the age of 44. **********John Loftus, a former member of the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations dealing with war criminals, said he had no doubt that the La Vista report was shelved to preserve the secrecy of intelligence links. **********Mr. Loftus, a Boston lawyer who has written a book charging that Byelorussian Nazis were smuggled into the United States, also said that, according to documents he had seen, American intelligence had gone to the Vatican for help in arranging the escape of Nazis working for the Americans. **********As evidence that Mr. La Vista had run across intelligence operations, Mr. Loftus cited the case of Ferenc Vajta, the Hungarian Nazi. **********In his report, Mr. La Vista said: **********''The Hungarian Communists are also trying to hunt down the Hungarian fascist, Vajta, Ferenc, who, so their propaganda says, is living in great state at the Grand Hotel Rome, under the very eyes of the Anglo-American authorities. However, Vajta is not at the Grand Hotel, but, according to fairly reliable sources, in one of the many monasteries in the Rome area.'' **********In December 1947, half a year later, Mr. Vajta, who had been an aide to Ferenc Szalasi, the executed Hungarian Nazi leader, was discovered living in New York. A Congressional inquiry determined that he had entered the United States on a diplomatic visa issued by the American consul in Madrid. **********Another State Department document obtained by Mr. Loftus indicates American concern about illegal emigration of Nazis to Latin America and the possible role of the Vatican. **********On Sept. 5, 1947, W. N. Walmsley Jr., counselor for economic affairs in the American Embassy in Rome, sent Washington a followup on the La Vista report in the form of a secret memorandum of July 16, 1947, prepared by the American Embassy in Buenos Aires. **********The Buenos Aires memorandum cited an Istituto di Snt. Jeronimus a Via Tomacelli 132 in Rome that the La Vista report gave as the address for a Vatican Croatian relief organization ''engaging in or suspected of engaging in illegal emigration.'' The memorandum called the institute the headquarters of a clandestine movement of Yugoslav Ustaschi war criminals from Italy to Argentina. The memorandum stated: ''It would appear that necessary sums come from Vatican circles, who had previously actively supported this organization in 1923-1941. Membership of 'Ustascha' and Catholic religion are compulsory for help and assistance in leaving Italy.'' **********The memorandum listed several Croatians and a Frenchman - Drago Krernzir, Juan Percevick, Dr. F. Todt, and Marquis Eric de Surville - who it said arrived in this manner in Argentina by ship from Italy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/05/world/us-role-in-salvador.html": {"writer_name": "Lydia Chavez", "pub_date": "1984-05-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 618, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. ROLE IN SALVADOR", "print_headline": "U.S. ROLE IN SALVADOR", "body_text": " **********The accusation made by Senator Jesse Helms that United States Embassy officials have manipulated the presidential election campaign here in favor of the Christian Democratic candidate has focused new attention on United States activities in El Salvador, particularly in advance of the election runoff Sunday.

The latest issue appeared a week before the resumption of Chinese-British negotiations on Hong Kong's future in an eighth round of talks here on Jan. 25. **********An assertion by Mr. Ji that ''certain progress has been made'' already in the talks seems bound to fuel speculation that the two sides will break out of the public deadlock that has dominated their negotiations since Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited China in September 1982. Both sides have refused to give any details of the talks. The last round was held in Peking in November. **********Outlook quoted Mr. Ji as saying that ''the time is now ripe to solve this problem left over from history.'' The State Councilor went on to list these specific guarantees for Hong Kong's future, most of which had been suggested before in articles and conversations: **********- Hong Kong would become a special administrative zone, retaining its social and economic system and way of life, under Article 31 of the Chinese Constitution adopted in December 1982. A similar arrangement has been promised for Taiwan upon reunification with the mainland. **********- As a special administrative zone, Hong Kong would have its own legislative powers. Its existing laws would be basically unchanged, ''except for those of a colonial nature or detrimental to China,'' Mr. Ji said. These would include references to Hong Kong as a British crown colony with fealty to Queen Elizabeth II. The Outlook article did not say how the legislative powers would work. But the leftist Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao on Jan. 8 quoted Min Chien-shu, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, as saying Mr. Ji had told him that the legislative powers would be responsive to the interests of those who are pro-Peking, pro-Britain and neutral. **********- The judicial system would be independent, with its court of final appeal in Hong Kong and not Peking. The colony now operates under a British system of justice with its final court of appeal in London. **********- The colony's financial system and economic policies, including its free port status, would remain intact. The stock and gold markets and foreign currency exchange would not be closed. The Hong Kong dollar would continue to be used and would be freely convertible to other currencies. Thus it apparently would not be linked to China's artificially pegged renminbi. **********- Peking would be responsible for Hong Kong's defense and foreign affairs, but Hong Kong would retain the right to maintain and develop economic and cultural ties with other countries, regions and international organizations. Hong Kong could also issue its own travel documents for exit and entry. Mr. Ji previously told Professor Min that residents would carry a ''China-Hong Kong'' passport that would let them leave and return freely, unlike other Chinese citizens. **********- The economic interests of Britain and other foreign countries in Hong Kong would be protected by law. Foreigners would also be invited to work in Hong Kong's public and private organizations, as many Britons now do. **********- Hong Kong would be governed by local representatives rather than by officials dispatched from the mainland. This has been proposed to the British under a formula of supervised self- determination. Mr. Ji said that Hong Kong's leading officials would be selected through elections and consultations as well as by appointment.   No Evidence of an Accord **********The conditions that Mr. Ji outlined appeared to be terms that Peking expected London to accept, though there was no evidence that the coming two- day round of talks would produce an agreement. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said after the last round of talks in November that China would announce its plans for Hong Kong on its own if no accord should be reached with Britain by next September. **********In his interview with Outlook, copies of which reached subscribers today, Mr. Ji made no mention of a promise last week by Xu Jiatun, Peking's ranking representative in Hong Kong, that China would keep Hong Kong's capitalist system intact for 50 years after reasserting sovereignty in 1997. Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang mentioned the same time period during his visit to the United States. **********Mr. Ji also omitted the freedoms of the press, speech and assembly that Mr. Xu mentioned last Tuesday in a speech at the convocation of Hong Kong University. **********But otherwise Mr. Ji reiterated what Mr. Xu had said, confirming the details of a formal policy on Hong Kong that has trickled out piecemeal in deceptively casual conversations between Chinese officials and prominent Hong Kong residents or overseas Chinese visitors.   Financial Uncertainty in Colony **********Mr. Ji's interview with Outlook emphasized China's concern about maintaining the colony's prosperity and stability. Local fears that the system will be altered or dismantled, or that capitalism cannot survive under a Communist regime, have caused financial uncertainty and some outflow of capital from Hong Kong. **********''I deeply believe that the special administration region is sure to do a good job in running Hong Kong, and the whole package of special policies on Hong Kong will surely make it more prosperous,'' Mr. Ji told Outlook. **********Mr. Xu said at Hong Kong University last week that the policies had not been initiated by a few leaders in Peking, but were reached only after ''long-term and repeated research, study and discussions'' within the Communist Party and the Cabinet-level State Council. **********Disparity in Living Standards **********The weekly magazine, which is read by Chinese for its authoritative articles, did not address the disparity of life styles that is bound to result between Hong Kong and China proper if the policies enumerated by Mr. Ji are carried out. **********Professor Min told the newspaper Ta Kung Pao that when he asked whether this difference might make mainland Chinese unhappy, Mr. Ji said: **********''The central authorities will let Hong Kong become a special administrative zone for the sake of the country's modernization. We will explain to the people of the whole country why we do this. To maintain capitalism in a small place is beneficial to socialism in the whole country.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/03/business/venezuelan-debt-talks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-12-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 89, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Venezuelan Debt Talks", "print_headline": "Venezuelan Debt Talks", "body_text": " **********Venezuela's President, Jaime Lusinchi, said today he would discuss his country's private sector debt when he meets President Reagan and bankers on an official visit to Washington and San Francisco between Monday and Thursday.

The news has not been good. **********The leader of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, Adolfo Lugo Verduzco, accused Mr. Gavin recently of making ''imprudent'' statements and asserted that the Ambassador ''still doesn't understand the idiosyncrasies of the Mexican people and our profound nationalistic feelings.'' Congressmen in the leftist opposition have called for Mr. Gavin to be declared persona non grata and expelled from the country for meddling in Mexico's internal affairs. **********''Virtually all my predecessors had to put up with this nonsense,'' Mr. Gavin said in a recent interview, ''and perhaps my successors will have to, too. But we seek to change that.'' **********Mexico is not an easy place to be the United States Ambassador. The power and proximity of the United States make it a natural place to turn to quietly for help and to blame loudly for problems. In times of political need, images of American interventions on Mexican territory or the fact that some of what was once Mexico's best land went to Texas and California can be conjured up as if they happened only yesterday.   Deeper Tensions Than Usual **********The recent tensions, however, seem to go deeper than most. When the country's Foreign Minister, Bernardo Sep ulveda Amor, was asked in October about his relations with Mr. Gavin, this is how he responded: **********He praised the ''reciprocal respect'' between President Miguel de la Madrid and President Reagan. **********He lauded Secretary of State George P. Shultz's ''knowledge of the Mexican political reality, the history of Mexico, the Mexican political traditions, the Mexican idiosyncrasy, the Mexican nationalism and all the questions that are important for Mexico.'' **********He spoke of Mexico's own respect for the political institutions of the United States, and of nonintervention as one of the ''essential principles'' of Mexican foreign policy. **********He praised the ''indispensable respect'' of the Under Secretary of State, Langhorne A. Motley, for ''matters that are Mexico's own,'' and the ''respect, understanding and appreciation'' for Mexican political affairs of Harry W. Shlaudeman, a United States special envoy. **********He pointedly - and, an aide said later, intentionally - did not mention Mr. Gavin at all.   Trouble After Lunch **********To an American, what touched off Mr. Gavin's current round of problems hardly seems the stuff of political scandal: he had lunch in the northern state of Sonora with two representatives of the conservative National Action Party and a Roman Catholic archbishop. A similar lunch between the Mexican Ambassador to Washington and Democratic Party officials would probably not raise an eyebrow in the United States, but that is where Mexican political tradition, nationalism and idiosyncrasy come in. **********One political tradition here is that the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has controlled the national Government for 55 years, wins all state elections as well. In Sonora, where Mr. Gavin had his lunch, that tradition is being threatened by a strong challenge from the National Action Party in a gubernatorial race next year. **********One element of Mexican nationalism is to be ever alert that the United States not try to intervene in Mexican politics. And that is what, in the minds of governing party officials, Mr. Gavin appeared to be doing. **********Mr. Gavin asserted that the embassy had invited officials of the governing party to the Hermosillo lunch as well, but that they had not come. He noted that he had also paid a call on the Governor of Sonora, a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. **********A leading member of the National Action Party said that the governing party had been piqued by being invited to the lunch as if the two parties had the ''same political importance, and they can't stand that anybody be given the same political importance as them.''  'Remarkable in Their Fury' **********Mr. Gavin's visit, which was made against counsel from his advisers, stirred greater concern than it might have because it followed attacks on officials of the National Action Party for having attended the Republican National Convention in Dallas, which in turn led to charges they were receiving financing from the Republican Party. Officials of the National Action Party have denied the charges. **********A visit last year to Hermosillo, the capital of Sonora, by George High, then Mr. Gavin's deputy chief of mission, stirred similarly negative reactions that were, in the Ambassador's words, ''remarkable in their fury.'' That did not, however, dissuade Mr. Gavin from making such a visit himself. **********Mr. Gavin is acquainted with the political traditions of Mexico. His mother is a Mexican citizen who lives in Sonora, and the Ambassador speaks Spanish fluently; both facts have been viewed as assets by many Mexicans. **********Some officials have retained a sense of insult, however, that the man sent to represent the Reagan Administration was best known to Mexicans not for his diplomatic or political work - his official biography lists advisory posts to the Organization of American States and the Government from 1961 to 1973 - but as the television spokesman for Bacardi rum during his acting career. **********Understanding Mexican political idiosyncrasies, Mr. Gavin says, does not mean accepting Mexican political attacks. A thick skin and forgiving manner toward critics are not part of the Ambassador's style, according to his aides and others who have dealt with him. His private remarks about his critics can be biting; members of the press who write unflattering things about Mr. Gavin on occasion have been dressed down by the Ambassador himself in front of guests at a cocktail party.   'Their Sacrificial Lamb' **********In response to the recent criticism of his activities, Mr. Gavin has assailed unnamed Mexican politicians who he said want to make the United States ''their scapegoat, their whipping boy, their sacrificial lamb.'' In an interview, he said the controversy was the work of people trying to play on ''fears and sensitivities in the Mexican psyche, in Mexican society.'' **********''If indeed we have done something wrong,'' the Ambassador said, ''I would be the first to stand up and apologize, but we have not.'' He said that some Mexican officials have warm relations with him and praise American aid to Mexico in private, then turn around and publicly criticize the United States and him personally.   A New Round of Criticism **********''It is time that this particular custom, this exotic habit be changed,'' he said, ''for the good of the relationship, for the good of both participants in the relationship.'' As if to underscore that he would not be affected by criticism, Mr. Gavin recently headed north again, visiting municipal officials in northern cities controlled by the opposition and, although he visited officials of the governing party as well, touching off a new round of criticism. **********But Mr. Gavin, who has been in Mexico for more than 41 months, says he is ready to remain if asked to do so. And he says one of his goals is to end Mexican attacks on the United States and its Ambassador. **********''I am going to try to change it,'' he said. ''If I just succeed in turning it 5 degrees I'll have done something worthwhile.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/26/world/schultz-says-us-should-use-force-against-terrorism.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 765, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SCHULTZ SAYS U.S. SHOULD USE FORCE AGAINST TERRORISM", "print_headline": "SCHULTZ SAYS U.S. SHOULD USE FORCE AGAINST TERRORISM", "body_text": " **********Excerpts from speech, page A12. **********Secretary of State George P. Shultz said last night that the United States should stop equivocating and adopt a policy to use military force against terrorist groups. He said this should be done even if it led to the death of American servicemen and some innocent people. **********''We may never have the kind of evidence that can stand up in an American court of law,'' he said. ''But we cannot allow ourselves to become the Hamlet of nations, worrying endlessly over whether and how to respond.'' **********In another development on terrorist actions against the United States, a Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff report, which is expected to be made public today, places blame for the car bombing of the United States Embassy in Lebanon last month on the ''tragically simple mistake'' of not blocking access to the road leading to the building. (Page A12.) **********Praise for Israel **********Mr. Shultz praised the way Israel has handled terrorists and called for a public campaign to win support for a policy of ''swift and sure measures'' against terrorists, both to prevent attacks and to retaliate for them. **********Administration officials said the views expressed by Mr. Shultz in a speech prepared for delivery at the Park Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan were his own and were not necessarily shared by other senior officials, even within the State Department. Mr. Shultz, almost alone of senior officials, has been waging virtually a one-man campaign since last spring for a policy of force toward terrorists. **********Mr. Shultz's remarks last night, however, went much further and underscored his feelings that an effort has to be made to galvanize the rest of the Administration, the Congress and the public behind a much tougher response to terrorists, who have twice struck with impunity against the American Embassy in Beirut and once against the Marines barracks there in the last 18 months. **********A senior Administration official in Washington said yesterday that the Defense Department, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Central Intelligence Agency were all much more wary than Mr. Shultz of using American military power against terrorists, who usually cannot be precisely identified. **********Also, he said, the White House, concerned about lack of public support for counterterrorist actions, has been unwilling so far to do more than call for further discussion. It has not endorsed the program outlined by Mr. Shultz. **********In fact, President Reagan, in his debate with Walter F. Mondale last Sunday night, argued that the United States could not hit out at terrorists unless it was certain it was hitting the perpetrators. **********''We are not going to hit people to say, 'Oh, look - we got even,' '' Mr. Reagan said on Sunday. ''We want to know, when we retaliate, that we're retaliating with those who are responsible for the terrorist acts.''  'We Must Be Willing' **********Mr. Shultz, however, said last night that the United States might sometimes have to attack terrorists even if this led to the death of some innocent people, or if the evidence for such an attack might not stand up in a court of law. The United States, Mr. Shultz said, may have to face ''a choice between doing nothing or employing military force.'' **********''We can expect more terrorism directed at our strategic interests around the world in the years ahead,'' he said. ''To combat it we must be willing to use military force.'' **********Mr. Shultz's call for a more active policy raised anew the problem the Administration has had from the start in dealing with terrorism. It has spoken out often against terrorism, particularly in the speeches by Mr. Shultz in the last year, but it has taken no actions against those groups believed responsible for the attacks on American installations. **********Mr. Reagan, when he took office, was highly critical of President Jimmy Carter for having allowed Americans in the United States Embassy in Teheran to be held hostage for 444 days and for having failed in the one rescue attempt. Mr. Reagan vowed at the start of his term to carry out swift retaliation against similar terrorists.   No Response by U.S. **********After the bombing of the Marine barracks a year ago in Beirut, the White House said that once the perpetrators were found, they would pay a price. But no retaliation occurred after any of the terrorist attacks on American installations, including the one on Sept. 20 against the embassy near East Beirut. Administration officials said Tuesday that they expected additional attacks on American installations, not only in the Middle East but in Central America."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/25/business/fed-policy-unchanged-last-month.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 877, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FED POLICY UNCHANGED LAST MONTH", "print_headline": "FED POLICY UNCHANGED LAST MONTH", "body_text": " **********The Federal Reserve decided last month to maintain ''the existing degree of restraint'' on credit, and to raise, by a modest half-point, the target interest rate range for overnight loans among commercial banks, according to minutes, published today, of its main policy-making arm. **********The vote at the July 16-17 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was 11 to 1, with the vice chairman, Preston Martin, dissenting. **********Today's disclosure of the decisions at the meeting, and the reasoning behind them, sparked little reaction on Wall Street, where the Fed is seen as continuing a credit policy described as firm, but not severely restrictive. **********Traders in the money and bond markets, according to one specialist, ''yawned and went home'' shortly after the minutes were released at 4:30 P.M. **********One Mild Surprise **********The one mild surprise, said Raymond W. Stone, manager of financial economics at Merrill Lynch & Company, was that the committee raised the target rate for Federal funds only to 8 to 12 percent from its preceding level of 7 1/2 to 11 1/2 percent established in March. Mr. Stone, noting that the funds rate was already about 11 1/2 percent at the time of the meeting, said he thought the four-point reference band might have been lifted somewhat further, but attached little policy signficance to this. **********The committee regards the funds range mainly as a mechanism for prompting committee consultation when the limits are persistently exceeded. The minutes contained no mention of any consultation. **********Federal funds traded today mostly at 11 1/2 and 11 9/16 percent. **********There is no indication that the Fed intends to raise the discount rate, now 9 percent, on loans it makes to financial institutions, even though this source of credit is substantially cheaper than Fed funds. **********'To Maintain Existing Pressure' **********The F.O.M.C., in its directive to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which executes committee decisions in the market for Government securities, declared that in the short run it seeks ''to maintain existing pressures on reserve positions.'' **********It said this is expected to be consistent with growth rates for M-1, M-2 and M-3 of about 5 1/2, 7 1/2 and 9 percent, respectively, for the June-to- September period. **********''Somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable in the event of more substantial growth of the monetary aggregates,'' it declared, ''while somewhat lesser restraint might be acceptable if growth of the monetary aggregates slowed significantly.'' **********A Frequent Dissenter **********Mr. Martin, who has now dissented at three of the latest five F.O.M.C. meetings, said he wanted to assign more weight to the possible need for some policy relaxation, in light of the vulnerability of key sectors of the economy and of markets to very high interest rates. ''He also believed that somewhat higher objectives for monetary growth should be established for the third quarter,'' the Fed's account asserted. **********Mr. Martin is thought to be the board member most closely in tune with Reagan Administration thinking - and a candidate to succeed Paul A. Volcker as chairman. **********The minutes also expressed a view held by ''most'' members that there should be a ''somewhat asymmetrical approach'' for dealing with a significant change in conditions. In effect, the F.O.M.C. said it would move more quickly to tighten monetary credit than it would to ease it. **********This ''would involve a more prompt response to the potential need for a move toward somewhat greater restraint, if monetary growth should accelerate in association with continued indications of an ebullient economy,'' the committee said. It added: ''In this view, policy implementation should be relatively tolerant, for a time, of some shortfall in monetary growth, because the latter might well prove to be temporary, if the present apparent momentum in the economy were to continue.'' **********Rates Little Changed **********Interest rates fluctuated little yesterday, ending a quiet session slightly higher. **********Market participants had waited on the sidelines most of the day in advance of the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee. After the release, bond prices dropped slightly. **********The Treasury's 30-year bond due 2014, which had risen about 2/32 of a point before the release, quickly slipped back 6/32 afterwards. **********In late dealings, the bellwether 30- year Treasury bond was offered at 100 14/32, off about 1/8 point from Thursday, to yield 12.44 percent. **********In the shorter-term market, the 12 3/8 percent notes due in 1986 fell 2/ 32, to 99 30/32, to yield 12.41 percent. The five-year notes to be issued next Thursday were offered at 12.61 percent, unchanged from Thursday. **********Flurry of Offerings **********There was a flurry of corporate offerings. **********The First Home Capital Corporation, a unit of the First Home Federal Savings and Loan Association of Greensboro, N.C., is offering 1.5 million shares of perpetual adjustable- rate preferred stock at $50 each, through underwriters led by Kidder, Peabody & Company.

But Shimon Peres, head of the Labor Party, rejected the proposal during the campaign. **********Peres Awaiting Final Outcome **********Mr. Peres was silent on the subject today, preferring to ''wait until all the results are in,'' while pursuing his own contacts and meeting with political allies for a possible Labor-led coalition. **********The request to form a government will officially come from the Israeli President, Chaim Herzog, who has said he will begin talks with the parties on Thursday. **********The President is free to choose whichever leader he thinks has the best chance to establish a workable coalition and is not limited to selecting the head of the largest parliamentary faction, Labor, which is Mr. Herzog's own party. **********The selected leader has six weeks to form a government. If the effort fails, Mr. Herzog could then select someone else to try.   'What They Meant' **********A cartoonist today depicted a man explaining to a friend that on Monday citizens ''got a chance to have their say - now we're trying to figure out what they meant by what they said.'' **********The multiplicity of parties meant both major political blocs lost power to the far left and the far right. After the 1981 election, for example, Likud had 48 seats and Labor 47, a total of 95. This time they will share about 85 seats. **********Divisions have occurred even within parties. The National Religious Party once loomed over the religious political scene; now there are four religious parties dividing the same dozen seats in Parliament. **********Support for a national unity government has grown, in large measure, from the widespread belief that drastic steps are needed to deal with Israel's economic problems, which include a 400 percent inflation rate and a large trade deficit.   Economic Moves Announced **********The first such step came during the day, when the Bank of Israel suspended all foreign transactions in anticipation of changes in regulations. **********More specific measures were announced tonight by the Finance Minister, Yigal Cohen-Orgad. He announced at a hastily called news conference that the 15 percent value-added tax that Israelis have been paying for goods and services would now be applied to the purchase of dollars, generally for use abroad. **********A $2,000-a-year limit on taking dollars abroad remains in force, he said, but only for travel and not for gifts or support, such as paying for college abroad, except with special permission. He said he hoped ''this will slow the flight of foreign currency abroad.'' **********The Finance Minister said the Government was taking the action now to end rumors of devaluation. Shekels have been officially listed at 271 to the dollar, but the dollar has been worth up to 350 shekels on the black market.   Setback for Peres Seen **********The election results were seen in the Israeli press today as a defeat for Mr. Peres in his third attempt to lead Labor to victory and a personal triumph for Mr. Shamir, who had been regarded as a lackluster successor to Menachem Begin, founder of the Herut Party and the wider Likud bloc. **********Although at no time in the long election night did the Likud ever forge ahead of Labor, it was Mr. Shamir who gave the evening's most exuberant victory speech, which was followed by ''Hatikvah,'' the national anthem, at a televised Likud rally. **********He repeated his call for a national unity government and reminded listeners that the proposal had initially recived ''an immediate negative response from Labor,'' which he said was ''influenced by its leftist elements.'' **********But it appears Mr. Shamir will have to deal with his own problems of ideology in seeking to build a right-wing coalition, according to the accounts of the maneuvering that went on today.   One Party's Demands **********The Tehiya Party, for example, formed by Likud defectors who opposed Mr. Begin's peace treaty with Egypt, got four seats and may get another after the military votes are counted. The party is seen as a ''safe'' coalition partner for Mr. Shamir, but it revealed its own demands today. **********Shmuel Lewin, a spokesman for Prof. Yuval Neeman, the Tehiya Party leader, who is Minister of Science and Development as well as chairman of the Cabinet committee on settlement of the occupied territories, said, ''We'll join a Likud coalition, but not if it includes Ezer Weizman.'' **********Mr. Weizman, whose Yahad Party got two seats, is a former Likud leader who was instrumental in the Camp David agreement and now favors accommodation with the Arabs. ''We're opposed to such accommodation,'' Mr. Lewin said. **********But Tehiya said it would join a coalition that included the Kach Party, which received one seat, for its leader, Rabbi Meir Kahane. At a news conference today, Rabbi Kahane said his condition for joining any coalition was amnesty for Jews charged with or convicted of terrorism. He has also called for expulsion of Arabs from Israel and the occupied territories.   Tactics and Goals **********Mr. Lewin said, ''We differ with Rabbi Kahane's tactics - you don't achieve a Jewish state by provoking Arabs - but not with his goals, while Weizman's tactics are fine, but not his goals.'' **********Talks tonight, as reported on the Israeli radio, focused more and more on a national unity government. Mr. Weizman was reported to have said he preferred serving in such a government under Labor leadership. Religious party leaders were said to have proposed a rotating leadership. **********Some of the small parties on the left, representing the peace movement, had said they would join a Labor-led government, but not a coalition government with the more conservative of the religious parties. Four religious parties account for a crucial 12 seats in Parliament. **********A majority of the smaller parties, which represent a total of 33 or 34 seats, have indicated they that would join a national unity government, some specifying the leadership they would prefer.   Results a Surprise **********The results surprised many political analysts in Israel who had equated dissatisfaction with the military effort in Lebanon, where more than 500 Israeli soldiers have died, and mounting economic problems with a likely loss of votes for the Likud Government. **********But dissatisfaction over the war may have waned since the fighting gave way to the occupation. And on the economic side, inflation has not been harsh for most Israelis because salaries are pegged to the cost of living. **********The expected defection from Likud to Labor ranks did not take place, although both parties lost strength to the smaller parties of like ideologies but with more specific platforms.   Labor Campaign Was Low-Key **********The pre-election polls that showed Labor with a large, albeit declining, lead over Likud were believed to have prompted Labor to conduct a low-key campaign ''in the belief that victory was assured,'' as the independent daily Maariv put it today. **********Mr. Peres did not concede that was the case, however, insisting in the early hours that he would not be able to assess the results until all the votes were in.

The Seven Sisters (the major magazines in the field) carried more than $627 million in advertising last year, according to estimates by the Publishers Information Bureau. **********The West German publisher of Woman's World, Heinrich Bauer, has nothing against advertising (the approximately 20 weeklies the company publishes out of Hamburg carry it), but as Konrad Wiederholz, the president of the North American subsidiary, explained yesterday, the company decided to wait until it could deliver the kind of circulation it was promising advertisers.That time should not be far off. On Monday, when Woman's World finally moves into specially made racks at checkout counters throughout the New York market and the Deep South, the goal will be to push the circulation from its approximately 1.2 million a week to 1.7 million. **********If it can hold that for five or six weeks, Mr. Wiederholz promised that he would be out selling space with Xeroxed rate cards if the regular ones are not back from the printer. **********He is already looking for an advertising sales director, a title he once held himself back home.

Some 350 thirty-second spots both day and night will run over the period. **********The first week the ads herald the magazine's appearance. On the following Sunday, April 28, some 29 newspapers in this market will carry 16-page inserts that give a preview of the magazine. Then the last week, the commercial, while promoting that week's issue, will also stress the fact that Woman's World is a weekly. **********From the beginning of the year up to the end of the three-week effort, Heinrich Bauer will have spent $30 million on advertising. **********''We are kind of familiar with the weekly rhythm,'' Mr. Wiederholz said at one point. At another, to explain the preference of the weekly over the monthly frequency, he said, ''The fast cent is better than the slow dollar.'' **********In addition to the news weeklies, People magazine and TV Guide, most of the other weekly publications at checkout are the garish national tabloids. And there is a little something of them in the black and white editorial sections of Woman's World.

Neither Mr. Neeld nor his editorial staff of about 40 were in the start-up crew. Management kept changing staff until an editorial formula with consumer appeal was discovered. **********The testing began in fall of 1980, when early versions of the magazine were distributed in Phoenix, Minneapolis, Hartford and Rochester. At this point, it was discovered that a nine-inch-wide publication made a greater impact on sales than the standard eight inches. **********It has taken five steps to reach its current distribution point, according to Richard C. Parker, vice president- sales manager, who is in charge of circulation. The most recent was in March, when the state of Texas was added. On Monday in addition to the New York metropolitan area, the final areas to be filled in will be Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. **********The process has been slow, Mr. Wiederholz said.

The utility, squeezed by ever-rising costs at the Seabrook nuclear power project, also ordered more layoffs and salary reductions, for a total saving of $38 million this year. **********The company's auditors said Public Service may be in default by next week unless it is able to secure additional credit. The company has a 35.5 percent share in the two Seabrook reactors, which are over budget by $6 billion to $8 billion, depending on the estimate used. Public Service is building the reactors as the head of a group of New England utilities. **********In an announcement late yesterday, Robert J. Harrison, president and chief executive of Public Service, said the board had acted with ''extreme regret'' to omit the dividend, which will save about $30 million this quarter. **********Retirements and Attrition **********Mr. Harrison also said the company would save $8 million a year through early retirements, attrition and layoffs to trim the company's non-Seabrook work force by 200 people, or 11 percent, and through salary cuts of 10 to 15 percent for those earning more than $35,000. Fees paid to outside directors will also be cut, he said. **********On Wednesday, the company laid off 5,200 workers at Seabrook 1 and stopped work there; that plant is about 75 percent complete. Work on Seabrook 2, which is 25 percent complete, was suspended earlier. **********After the two announcements, Moody's Investors Service lowered its ratings on Public Service preferred stock to Caa, from B-3. **********''The ratings on the company's debt securities remain under review and may have to be reduced further,'' the rating service added. Moody's rates the utility's first- mortgage bonds Ba-3, its general mortgage and refunding bonds B-2, and its debentures and Eurobond notes B-3. All the ratings are below investment grade. **********According to Myra Barradas, a spokesman for the company, the omission of the dividend on preferred stock does not represent a default by the company. However, she said, if the company omits dividends for four consecutive quarters, holders of preferred shares would have the right to elect directors to the board. **********The common stock dividend had been 53 cents a quarter since 1979. Dividend payments on preferred stocks varied by issue. **********''This decision will affect the thousands of people who have invested in New Hampshire's future through our stock,'' Mr. Harrison said. ''It will create a special burden for the people, many of them elderly, who depend upon our dividend for their income. But it is a decision that had to be made in an attempt to maintain the viability of the stockholders' investment.'' **********The utility has about 66,000 shareholders. The dividend announcement was made after the stock market closed, but analysts said action on the dividend had been anticipated. The common stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at $5.12 1/2 yesterday, down 25 cents. **********Mr. Harrison added that he was concerned about the impact of the austerity measures on the company's ability to provide reliable service.  ''These stringent measures come on top of cash conservation measures that have been implemented at Public Service of New Hampshire over the last several years,'' he said. ''As a result it has become increasingly difficult for employees to perform their duties. The fact that they have done so is a tremendous credit to them.'' **********Bailout Plan Setback **********Meanwhile, in Hartford, the lower house of the Connecticut General Assembly unanimously voted for a bill intended to prevent utilities from using money from the state's ratepayers to help bail out Public Service. The New Hampshire utility's partners had proposed a plan under which a consortium of New England utilities would import relatively inexpensive hydroelectric power from Canada, and give Public Service a subsidy from the savings that the Canadian power produced. In exchange, Public Service would drop its opposition to the abandonment of Seabrook 2. **********Public Service had insisted on the completion of both reactors because of an ambiguity in New Hampshire law that makes it doubtful that the company could recover from ratepayers any investment in plants that are not ''used and useful.'' **********The New Hampshire company is the fourth utility to cut its dividend in recent weeks. **********On April 10, the Consumers Power Company in Michigan cut its annual dividend to $1.40, from $2.52, and raised the estimated cost of its Midland 2 reactor to $3.95 billion, from $2.5 billion. Work on Midland 1 has been suspended. **********The Long Island Lighting Company, which is at the edge of bankruptcy because of its Shoreham plant, recently said that it would omit its dividend on common stock at least through the end of this year.

And many of those increases will be reflected on 1983 state and local personal income tax returns. **********''States are in a scramble to get additional revenues,'' said William Katz, a partner at Ernst & Whinney, an accounting firm. ''And even if they haven't raised rates, states are getting more aggressive in seeking revenues.'' **********This push by the states for more tax revenues will be especially evident for people who live and work in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. **********In Connecticut, where there is no general income tax on wages, many residents will find their interest income being taxed for the first time, at rates of 6 to 13 percent. In New York City, residents will find the income tax surcharge has doubled, to as high as 10 percent. And in New Jersey, those with taxable income over $50,000 will find that the state gross income tax has been raised to 3.5 percent from 2.5 percent. **********Still, the increase in state and city taxes that will result from these changes will be somewhat cushioned by the Federal tax deduction for state and local income taxes available to those who itemize their Federal income tax return. **********''Even though you may have a higher state tax burden, Uncle Sam will be a partner in that,'' Mr. Katz said. **********In New York City, the resident income tax surcharge, imposed on top of the regular city income tax, has been doubled for 1983 tax returns, to 5 percent for those with adjusted income of more than $15,000, and to 10 percent for incomes in excess of $20,000. The rates will fall back to the 2.5 percent and 5 percent levels, respectively, on 1984 returns. **********For New York State residents as well as out-of-state residents who work in New York - especially executives who exercised incentive stock options last year - an increase in the state tax may result from the expanded Federal alternative minimum tax. **********Incentive Stock Options **********Under New York's Federal conformity statute, state and city ''minimum taxes'' automatically copy the Federal list of so-called preference items that can make one subject to the minimum tax. Thus, when the Federal Government broadened its minimum tax for 1983 tax returns, the New York minimum taxes were broadened to include such new items as the gain or ''bargain element'' of an incentive stock option at the time of exercise. **********But what may surprise many of those who manage to avoid the Federal minimum tax is that they may still be struck by the state and city versions. Although the list of preference items is similar, it is easier to fall victim to the state and city versions. **********The reason is that while the Federal minimum tax applies only if it is larger than an individual's regular tax bill, the state and city minimum taxes are imposed on top of the regular tax bill. **********Only $5,000 worth of preference items are needed before an individual has to make the minimum tax calculation. The tax is applied at a state rate of 6 percent and a city rate of 2.5 percent after the amount of preference items is reduced by a $5,000 personal exemption and one's New York State personal income tax liability. **********The state taxes are imposed not only on residents but also on those from out of state who work in New York. The city minimum taxes affect only New York City residents. **********Change in State Form **********For those with less complicated financial situations, the New York State short form, IT-200, has been modified to enable those with taxable income up to $30,000 to use the form, a rise from the $20,000 limit. **********State tax officials estimate as many as one million more taxpayers will now be able to use the short form. Last year, some 1.9 million taxpayers used it. While the form may be easier to fill out, many taxpayers, such as those who itemized deductions on their Federal return, will save money by filing the long form. **********One change in the long form, IT- 201, will simplify the task of computing the standard deduction for most people, but may create confusion for the 500,000 married taxpayers who typically file separately. Instead of computing the standard deduction, a new table in tax return instruction booklets lists the amount for the various income brackets.  However, an omission in the booklet fails to alert married taxpayers filing separately that they must combine their income before looking up the standard deduction. **********Changes in New Jersey **********In New Jersey, only those with taxable gross income of more than $50,000 will find the state gross income tax rate increased to 3.5 percent, from 2.5 percent. Otherwise, the rates are the same, at 2 percent on the first $20,000 and 2.5 percent on income between $20,000 and $50,000. **********For New Yorkers who work in New Jersey, this will be the last time they will have to pay the special New Jersey commuter tax. The tax, enacted in 1961, was struck down as unconstitutional last June by the New Jersey State Supreme Court. **********New York commuters are required to pay either the emergency transportation tax or the New Jersey gross income tax, whichever is higher. The commuter tax usually is higher. A credit can be taken against New York tax liability. **********Although the commuter tax officially died on Jan. 1, New York commuters will probably not see a reduction in their total tax liability when filling out returns next year. They will continue to be subject to the New Jersey gross income tax. And the extent to which that tax liability is lower than the commuter tax will be made up with higher payments to New York State, since the New York credit for New Jersey taxes paid will be lower. **********'Wind Up Paying the Same' **********''The net effect for most people is they will wind up paying the same amount of state taxes, except there will be a shift of some of it from New Jersey to New York,'' said Stephen A. Hennesey, tax partner at the Roseland, N.J., office of Arhur Andersen & Company. **********Because the commuters may have to pay a higher tax in New York for the 1984 tax year, Mr. Hennesey cautioned that they may need to make estimated tax payments to New York this year. **********Perhaps the most dramatic changes have occurred in Connecticut, where for the first time certain residents will pay a tax on interest income. **********''Some of the tax haven aspect of Connecticut is gone,'' Mr. Katz of Ernst & Whinney said. **********The state revised its tax on dividend income, and instituted a tax on interest income for residents with adjusted gross income of $50,000 or more. The tax rates for both dividends and interest income start at 6 percent and rise to 13 percent for those with incomes of $100,000 or more. **********As part of the tax changes, however, residents with adjusted gross income under $50,000 no longer have to pay state tax on dividend income. Under prior law, Connecticut residents with income of $20,000 or more were subject to a tax on dividends at rates of 1 percent to 9 percent. The new law changed the income threshold to $50,000 and raised the rate schedule. **********Provisions Retroactive **********Although the changes became law last June, the provisions were made retroactive to Jan. 1, 1983, thus covering the entire tax year. **********The Connecticut tax rate on capital gains remains at 7 percent, after an exemption of $100, or $200 on a joint return. **********The state's new tax on interest is likely to be an unpleasant surprise for many investors.  Interest income from Federal obligations is not subject to the new tax, nor is interest from obligations of Connecticut or its municipalities. But as is the case with many states, the tax will apply to tax-exempt obligations issued by other states and local governments. **********The new interest tax will be an especially hard blow for the many Connecticut residents who purchased New York tax-exempt municipal bonds, according to Barry Salzberg, coordinator of personal tax services for the New York region at the accounting firm of Deloitte Haskins & Sells. **********''But it's still a good place to live from a tax viewpoint,'' he added, ''because there's still no tax on salaries.'' **********Tomorrow: Preparing returns and planning for next year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/17/business/finance-new-issues-home-loan-bank.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Home Loan Bank", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Home Loan Bank", "body_text": " **********The Federal Home Loan Bank System, the Federal regulator for savings and loan associations, yesterday announced an interest rate of 11.20 percent for a new $1.085 billion issue of bonds due on Oct. 25, 1985, and a 12.05 percent yield for $365 million of bonds due on Oct. 26, 1987.

Do you expect interest rates to rise? **********A. They have risen. What they're going to do in the future I don't know. That's more up to Chairman Volcker of the Federal Reserve and the President. Every increase in interest rates has a negative impact on the housing industry. **********Q. The White House spokesman, Larry **********Speakes, hailed the April housing start figures **********and said ''people are buying and building **********homes in impressive numbers.'' Do you see it **********that way? **********A. He works in the White House and I work in the housing industry. As interest rates increase, it just cuts that many more people out of the marketplace. It forces them into accepting a home that is smaller than they want. **********Q. What is ahead economically? **********A. You are still seeing good economic statistics. But it's apparent to me that the economy is not doing anywhere as well as the current reports indicate. The housing industry is the first to come back out of a recession and one of the first to feel a downturn. We get a hit first, and my message to other industries is, ''It's coming.'' **********Q. How does the housing industry ride out **********bad times? **********A. You have to place a high premium on flexibility when you have an economic environment like you've had over the last four years. The lead time in developing a subdivision is two, at best three years or more. Can you tell me what the interest rate is going to be in three years? If it was 25 percent, you wouldn't be likely to do much with the subdivision. If it was 8 percent, you'd be scrambling to handle the business. But you have to make that decision today, not three years from now. You are rolling the dice and investing the money today, betting there will be a business opportunity three years down the road. **********Q. What can you do specifically? **********A. Keep things on option as opposed to having dollars in them. Reduce overhead and the employment force. The years 1981 and 1982 were the worst for the industry since World War II. Our profits did go down and we lost money in one quarter in each of those years. In 1981 and 1982 we also downsized our homes considerably. **********Q. Will you be doing more of that? **********A. When interest rates came down and briefly touched 11 1/2 percent, we increased the size, but now that interest rates are going back up, more consideration is being given to further downsizing. We are fighting to keep the price of our homes in the affordability range. **********Q. What is the price? **********A. Our average home was $71,000 in the first quarter versus a national average of $94,200. As interest rates go up, you go to higher-density housing - condominiums and fewer detached houses. **********Q. What is your message to home buyers right now? **********A. Damage is being done to the consumer in rising interest rates. One of the most important things you can tell buyers is to hustle out now and buy while they can afford it. There is a sense of urgency on the buyer getting out there and getting a mortgage and interest rates he can afford."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/27/business/lily-studies-sale.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lily Studies Sale", "print_headline": "Lily Studies Sale", "body_text": " **********Lily-Tulip Inc., which has been active in recent days in over-the- counter trading, reported that it had retained Kidder, Peabody & Company to explore the company's financial alternatives, including its possible sale.

It had the charm of corrugated cardboard: snimog. **********''Snimog,'' he said, stands for ''sustained non-inflationary market oriented growth'' and, the summit manager explained, the American delegation likes to make certain that the phrase, or one like it, goes into the communiques that come out of summit conferences. **********Like boilerplate, the final statements bear hundreds of hammer marks and rivets. And in their leaden way, they are perhaps as good a reflection of the mood that dominates the meetings at Lancaster House as the photogenic scenes behind the building this afternoon when President Reagan seemed to want to mow the old building's lawn. **********''We'll get a snimog in there, and somebody else will get their Japanese or German equivalent, and that's the way it works,'' said the American who has been attached to summit preparations for years, explaining the trade-off system. **********''Do you remember Nelson Rockefeller's 'bomfog'?'' asked the American. ''He had this phrase about 'the brotherhood of man under the fatherhood of God' that he used all the time, and his staff always talked about 'bomfog' and 'bomfoggery.' That's how 'snimog' came to me. I'd never leave a summit without one.'' **********That was not said cynically, but rather in a way suggesting how routine the summit conferences have become in terms of professional organization. **********Once these meetings seemed to hold the possibility of concerted economic steps by the Western industrial powers, and even a meaningful exchange of ideas by the men and women who lead those powers. Now, the snimog has become institutionalized and the leaders can struggle head-to-head for a word or phrase they think should be in the summit summary.  Today, another American said, the leaders' walk past the geranium pots and daisies on the Lancaster House lawn was delayed more than 45 minutes because of another phrase, one that has not yet become an acronym for summit professionals but is wanted by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to suggest the link she sees between individual liberty and economic success. According to the account, President Francois Mitterrand, the Socialist leader of France, did not much like it, and an argument followed. The phrase in dispute was not made public. **********For some of the summit old-timers, the dispute showed it was easier now to fit a snimog into summit language than a new, or at least an un- used, idea. **********If the summit meetings were movies, the one at Williamsburg, Va., last year probably would have been ''Gone With the Wind'': vast scale, changing decors, consciously epic proportions. The 1982 conference at Versailles and its great chateau seemed like ''Fanfan la Tulipe,'' the great French film of the cape and the epee. **********But the London meeting is smaller in scale. The film the discussions here really resemble is ''Rashomon,'' the Japanese classic in which a crime takes place and all the witnesses see it differently, each recounting their own version. **********Although the seven countries' leaders attend the same events, there has never been a more striking summit meeting for producing seven different versions of what is taking place. Spokesmen for each of the delegations brief reporters in separate halls of the Connaught Rooms, a remarkably complicated building whose usual trade is not the future of the world but labor union meetings, wedding showers and bar mitzvah receptions. **********Today, a Canadian spokesman spent most of his time talking about a paper dealing with East-West relations and securing peace that was given to the other participants last night by Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. By the Canadian's account, it was a moment of near metaphysical importance; for his counterparts, it hardly merited mention. **********The West German spokesman made clear that the conference was all about the American budget deficit and the high interest rates that Chancellor Helmut Kohl insists the deficit has caused. The French version was something else: What people were really discussing was the rising debt of the developing nations, a subject Mr. Mitterrand regards as of central importance. **********The Italians looked through the prism in still another way. They said the French President had emphasized the need to call into question the notion that true free-market economies exist. The Americans said they did, the Italians recalled Mr. Mitterrand as saying, but he added that the United States wound up subsidizing its industries in real but often disguised ways. **********The mechanism for providing seven conflicting views of the truth does not stop when the leaders finally produce a conference document and place their names on it. Then one phrase recurs in each of the seven briefing rooms: ''The real sense of this summit is . . .'' **********Most of the governments here are about to face the voters, either in elections for the European Parliament or in Presidential races, and for them, one goal of the London talks is to get out of town with as little political damage as possible. **********An American staff member described the meeting as ''a road game'' for President Reagan, one in which he did not have the ''home court'' advantages of Williamsburg - his camera angles, his organizational control. **********For an official of the French delegation, the conference was essentially a place where Mr. Mitterrand was sure to get his colleagues' blessing for his trip to Moscow in two weeks, a gesture of understanding that would undercut the political opposition at home. **********Both Mr. Reagan and Mr. Mitterrand, who describe their interest in shaping domestic opinion as public diplomacy, shared one small regret. It would have been nice if June's calendar had been reversed. They both would have liked to have done the London summit meeting first, gotten it out of the way, and then arrived home fresh from the D-day commemoration in Normandy. **********''There's no socko homecoming after a summit communique,'' the American said.

People with incomes below a specified level would pay no taxes. **********- The corporate rate would be lowered to 33 percent from 46 percent. **********- The two largest corporate tax breaks - the investment tax credit and the rapid depreciation feature of the 1981 tax law - would be curtailed. The tax credit would be repealed, and the depreciation system would be replaced. **********- The deduction for interest paid on a mortgage on a taxpayer's principal residence would be retained in full. **********- All other deductions for interest payments, whether consumer loans or mortgages on vacation homes, would be disallowed above a specified ceiling. **********- Fringe benefits paid by employers, such as health insurance premiums, would be counted, at least in part, as income for tax purposes. **********- The rules for deducting state and local taxes and charitable contributions would also be changed. **********The officials said individuals' tax payments would be reduced under the plan by an average of 8.5 percent. Corporate taxes would be somewhat increased so that the plan over all would neither raise nor lower total Government revenues. **********Pressed on whether the accelerated cost recovery system for businesses would actually be abolished, one official said, ''I read it as A.C.R.S. gone.'' The official did not say what would replace it, but presumably companies would still be able to write off plants and equipment at a rate faster than their actual life span. **********Mr. Speakes said the Treasury's plan ''meets the President's objective of simplifying the tax system and making it more fair.'' **********Final Package to Be Shaped **********Mr. Speakes said that the Treasury's recommendations would ''form the working basis for the President's tax proposals'' but that President Reagan's presentation to Congress would probably not be agreed upon until his State of the Union Message in January. He said Mr. Reagan might want to change the package after he consults with his advisers and members of Congress. **********In his State of the Union address last January, the President said he had instructed Secretary Regan to study the nation's tax system and to make recommendations after the election on how to change it. **********The furthest Mr. Speakes would go today was to say the Treasury had recommended a ''modified flat tax'' that was revenue-neutral, with ''lower individual tax rates'' and fewer ways than there are now to reduce taxable income through deductions, exclusions and credits. **********Thus people would have to pay taxes on a larger portion of their total income than they do now, though at a lower rate. **********The Outlook for Industry **********Mr. Speakes would not comment on business taxes, but tax specialists who have discussed the plan with Treasury officials said they had expected the plan to include modifications in the investment tax credit and the rapid depreciation system. **********Those two tax breaks for the business world are costing the Government about $50 billion in lost revenues this year. Most of the benefits are enjoyed by companies that invest heavily in real estate, plants and machinery. At a meeting with business lobbyists last week, Secretary Regan said it was unfair that ''smokestack'' industries should get tax breaks that were not available to service industries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/11/business/milwaukee-road-new-bidding-clash.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 340, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Milwaukee Road: New Bidding Clash", "print_headline": "Milwaukee Road: New Bidding Clash", "body_text": " **********The Soo Line Railroad Company yesterday attacked as ''too much and too late'' a sweetened bid by the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company for the bankrupt Milwaukee Road, which the rival bidders have been pursuing for four years. **********Chicago and North Western's revised offer, which was lifted by $211 million, includes $366.6 million in cash, notes, common shares and ''other forms of consideration.''

It did not explode. **********In light of intelligence reports that the accused terrorist and his group planned to try again, the Federal Aviation Agency warned inspectors to watch for explosive devices aboard United States airliners flying to Athens and the Middle East. The warning also went to El Al, the Israeli airline. **********Greece's Attitude Criticized **********The State Department official took the initiative in passing on the information. **********Administration officials have become increasingly critical of the Socialist Government of Prime Minister Andreas Pqpandreou for what they consider his anti-American policies and for what they say is presumed laxity in dealing with international terrorism. **********This week Richard Burt, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, told the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East, ''It is often very frustrating to deal with a government, an allied government, that defends the Soviet Union and criticizes the United States.''  Ambassador Rejects Charge **********The Greek Government, acting through its embassy in Washington, today flatly denied most of the points raised by the United States officials. The embassy statement referred to the Administration's behavior as a ''cover up'' for American activity on Greek territory that, according to the Greeks, ''violated international law and Greek sovereignty.'' **********In a telephone interview, George Papoulias, the Greek Ambassador, said the evidence against the suspected terrorist was ''not enough for the case to be brought to the court and therefore the man had to be released.'' **********As related by two Administration officials, the events began last November when a Jordanian, Fuad Hussein Shara, paid an unsuspecting friend to fly from Athens to Tel Aviv, pick up some curios and fly to London to sell them. **********In December the friend's baggage was said to have been lined with an ''improvised explosive device,'' set to go off when the airliner reached a particular altitude. More than 200 passengers were aboard the plane. **********Later, through intelligence sources, the Administration learned that Mr. Shara planned other actions and Administration experts were also able to reconstruct his activities.   Greeks Detained Jordanian **********The officials said the evidence on this was turned over to the Papandreou Government and it was sufficient for the Greeks to detain Mr. Shara in mid-April. **********A month later, without notice to Washington, the Greek Government released him to travel to a country that the American officials said was friendly to terrorists. They declined to name the country. **********The Americans described Greek explanations for the release of Mr. Shara as totally unsatisfactory. **********The notice issued by the Federal Aviation Agency said the explosive devices were carried by ''innocent victims'' and were ''secreted under the bag lining, thus making them very difficult to detect by hand search or cursory X-ray examination.'' **********The officials said Mr. Shara had been identified as a member of a group called 15th of May.   Greeks Were Watching Suspect **********According to the statement by the embassy, Greek authorities had been watching the suspected terrorist and his accomplice, reported to be an Englishwoman, for some time. One day, according to the statement, Greek agents photographed two men entering the woman's apartment and then emerging with a suitcase. **********The Greeks were said to have recognized the men as an American operative of the Central Intelligence Agency and a colleague from British intelligence. **********The Greek Government, the statement continued, requested that the suitcase be turned over to local authorities. **********American officials were said to have responded that the suitcase had been destroyed in the process of examinination. But they said photographs had been taken and they clearly established the presence of an explosive device. The photographs were offered as evidence. **********The Greek Embassy rejected this and responded that the American operative had been responsible for ''tampering with evidence and obstruction of justice.'' **********The C.I.A. officer was declared persona non grata by the Greek Government and left the country. Administration officials said they did not want to sharpen the dispute between Washington and Athens by publicizing this incident or by expelling a Greek diplomat in Washington in retaliation. **********Administration officials said they were puzzled by Greece's motives in dealing with terrorists generally. They noted a ''documented'' increase in terrorist incidents in Greece since 1982, including several against Americans. **********Last November a United States Navy officer was murdered there.

If enacted into law, these would be anti-investment, anti-housing, anti-growth, pro-inflation and unfair. **********The majority of the Finance Committee fails to recognize the difference between excessive tax shelters and efficient investment in America's future. Fortunately, most Americans recognize that the huge $200 billion Federal deficit must be reduced. However, the majority of the Senate Finance Committee does not realize that how you lower the Federal deficit is as important as whether you lower it. **********In particular, we strongly disagree with the committee's decision to increase the current 15-year cost recovery, or depreciation, period for all structures to 20 years, which translates into a 50 percent increase in the tax burden on a typical building. This tax increase would cut investment in construction by up to 10 percent a year and a total of $20 billion less investment annually when fully effective. **********It would likely reduce the availability of rental housing units by 100,000 each year, culminating in more than one million fewer units in the future. And lower-income households would suffer with less adequate housing. **********Because it would reduce after-tax cash flow, the change in the depreciation period would reduce the value of existing structures by up to 10 percent, or $200 billion, equivalent to a $2,500 loss of value for every household in the United States. **********The current 15-year period is one component of the Accelerated Cost Recovery System (A.C.R.S.) and was a fully debated cornerstone of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, A.C.R.S. was enacted ''to simplify the calculation of depreciation, encourage new capital investment and offset the effects of inflation on the real value of depreciation deductions.'' **********The stimulus to investment provided by A.C.R.S. is only now becoming apparent. The Commerce Department's survey of American businesses indicates a 12 percent real increase in planned capital investment during 1984. However, most of this planned increase is in equipment. Investment in structures is expected to remain relatively weak, even with A.C.R.S. Therefore, if anything, greater incentives should be provided to encourage construction. In fact, as long as inflation is greater than 3 percent, as just about every economist is forecasting, 20-year depreciation would not provide enough funds to replace each worn-out structure. **********In recent weeks, the real estate industry has worked closely with the Senate Finance Committee to identify real estate related tax law changes that would raise revenues, eliminate shelter abuses, and yet continue to encourage needed investment. However, in the final package, 25 percent, or $12 billion, of the $48 billion of tax increases for 1985-87 proposed by the committee is to be taken from real estate investment; $4.5 billion alone would come from the extension of the cost recovery period for structures. When fully effective this depreciation change would increase the additional tax burden on real estate by $15 billion to $20 billion annually. **********IN supporting the change, some committee members point to what is a temporary oversupply of office buildings in some cities - clearly the result of the deepest recession since the 1930's which was primarily caused by bad Federal Government policies. But tax policy must be aimed at the longer run - for the next 10 to 20 years. The uncertainty of tax policy is causing less investment now. Shortages of structures have already appeared in several industries, such as electronics, in several regions of the country, such as the Northeast and West and in several communities, such as space for small businesses and rental units. **********The real estate industry continuously petitioned the President and the Congress in 1981 about the potentially disastrous consequences of huge increases in defense spending and huge tax cuts aimed at stimulating consumption without offsetting spending reductions in nondefense areas. The messages were not heeded. The Federal deficit has risen to $200 billion a year, absorbing three-fourths of all net domestic savings, causing crowding out of private investment and reigniting fears of higher inflation in the future. **********Our estimate, undisputed by the Treasury Department in a debate before the Joint Economic Committee late last year, shows that mortgage interest rates are 1 1/2 percentage points higher because of Government borrowing for the current deficit, and 5 to 6 percentage points higher because of fear of higher inflation in the future because of continuing deficits. **********Instead of crippling investment for only a small proportion of funds needed to lower the Federal deficit, the Congress should limit the annual growth of real defense spending to 5 percent, freeze the real growth of nondefense discretionary spending, and modify the current formula for indexing increases in entitlement benefits and personal income tax brackets to the change in the Consumer Price Index minus 3 percentage points. **********Jack Carlson is the executive officer and chief economist of the National Association of Realtors."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/25/world/around-the-world-two-laotian-pilots-fly-to-thailand-for-asylum.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 89, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Two Laotian Pilots Fly To Thailand for Asylum", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Two Laotian Pilots Fly To Thailand for Asylum", "body_text": " **********Two pilots from Laos flew a passenger plane from the Laotian capital, Vientiane, to Udorn Air Force Base in northeastern Thailand today and requested asylum in a third country, the army spokesman's office said. **********A senior Thai Foreign Ministry official said the plane would be returned to Laos, but Thailand would allow the two men to seek asylum in an unspecified third country. **********The men reportedly said they left Laos because of difficult living conditions there."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/18/business/key-rates-200169.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/05/business/futures-opinions-cocoa-falls-daily-limit-in-heavy-profit-taking.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 358, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COCOA FALLS DAILY LIMIT IN HEAVY PROFIT TAKING", "print_headline": "FUTURES/OPINIONS; COCOA FALLS DAILY LIMIT IN HEAVY PROFIT TAKING", "body_text": " **********Cocoa futures posted a second consecutive day of heavy losses today.

Administration officials, acknowledging that the issue had not been handled smoothly, said the request was rushed to the committee because of fear that normal consideration might drag on for months. **********The committee did not consider a related request to provide $93 million in emergency military aid to El Salvador. **********Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said that Mr. Reagan, fearful of ''a deteriorating situation in Central America,'' was unwilling to wait for a longer-term aid package before sending additional military assistance to El Salvador. Administration officials asserted that the Salvadoran military needed a quick infusion of aid because of shortages of arms and ammunition. **********They said that, without the aid, the Salvadoran Government would be unable to provide security for presidential elections later this month.  The Senate majority whip, Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, gave a similar rationale to the committee for increased aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. Senator Stevens, who offered the amendment to the home-energy assistance bill, said the present aid pipeline to the rebels runs out by late spring.  The committee vote, which may be reconsidered in floor debate later this month, seemed to be a reflection of irritation with the tactics used by the White House rather than substantive opposition.  After a peppery debate and procedural maneuvering, a majority of the committee agreed that linking the last-minute request to the domestic bill would delay, if not imperil, assistance to low-income citizens. **********Senator Warren H. Rudman, a New Hampshire Republican who supports the Administration's policy in Central America, voted against the amendment because he said it would complicate consideration of the domestic measure and delay payments to ''cold people in my state.'' **********The committee postponed until next week consideration of a bill that would add provide $150 million in food aid to African nations. That bill may now serve as the vehicle for both the additional financing for the Nicaraguan rebels and the additional aid to the Salvadoran military. **********Mr. Stevens said the African bill might collapse if more than one Central American amendment were added. Echoing White House officials, he said the African bill and the domestic energy aid program were the only two measures already approved by the House that could be enacted swiftly enough to provided the needed Central American aid before June. **********The issue of the Nicaraguan rebels spilled over into the Senate Intelligence Committee, where Secretary of State George P. Shultz and William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, also asked for additional financing. **********Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is committee vice chairman, later said that Mr. Shultz had apologized for the fact the committee was not consulted before the request was submitted to the Appropriations Committee.

These pilots, the article said, veered off the drop course to avoid ''heavy'' antiaircraft fire that, in fact, consisted only of small arms and machine-gun fire. **********The writers went on to say that when Marine helicopters lifted Army troops into one of two campus areas for United States medical students the Marine pilots ''panicked and lifted off with Army troops hanging from the doors.'' **********''Once again, some Army officers on the ground had to be 'counseled' against pressing charges of cowardice,'' the Globe article said. Pentagon officials said they could not comment on these suggestions. **********In one of the most arresting statements by Mr. Gabriel and Mr. Savage, the article said that a 35-man special operations group sent in early to clear the then-uncompleted jet airstrip at Point Salines in the southern part of Grenada was discovered by Cuban and Grenadan troops, who pinned it down and isolated it. **********The writers contend that by morning 22 of the special force had been killed or wounded and that a plan in which Army Rangers would have landed on the strip had been changed to an airborne parachute drop. **********The authors said that a ''panic'' resulted in the diversion of many C-130 aircraft to pick up troops of the 82d Airborne Division. ''The result,'' the authors wrote, ''was that almost three- fourths of the Ranger force never left Fort Stewart,'' S.C., and never parachuted into Grenada in the early hours of the conflict. No such charge has previously been made, and a Pentagon official said he doubted it was true. **********The existence of ''special operations'' troops - drawn from all branches of the military service - is not denied by Pentagon officials in private, but rigorously denied for the record. **********It is now believed by many officials that the press was excluded from Grenada in the first days not because of Pentagon animus but because of rigid rules to preserve the fragile secrecy of the special groups. **********Photographs taken on Grenada clearly show two models of United States helicopters on the ground that are difficult to explain as part of a ''regular'' military operation. One, the Hughes Aircraft Corporation Defender, has not been purchased, offically, by the armed services. The other, photographed on the scene, has long been absent from the Army inventory. Several military analysts suggest these ''deniable'' aircraft have been purchased for and used by special groups in both Central America and such areas as Grenada. **********Some families of dead servicemen have also recently telephoned Washington journalists to say they believe they have convincing evidence that their sons died in combat recently, rather than in accidents described by the Pentagon. These families have been unable, however, to make ironclad cases and some have withdrawn their remarks, saying they had been told to ''shut up'' by the Pentagon. **********Mr. Gabriel and Mr. Savage wrote in today's article: ''In Grenada, good men died in the service of their country. Their memory ought to be honored by those who sent them to their deaths by more than a cover-up of the facts and the awarding of 8,663 debased medals, some given to officers and even civilians who never left the safety of the Pentagon - perhaps as a reward for keeping their mouths shut.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/08/business/rockcor-may-be-takeover-target.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-12-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rockcor May Be Takeover Target", "print_headline": "Rockcor May Be Takeover Target", "body_text": " **********A group led by American Investment Partners, a California partnership, told the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was considering seeking control of Rockcor Inc. through a proxy fight. **********The group holds 248,543, or 5.8 percent, of the common shares of Rockcor, a company based in Redmond, Wash., that makes high-technology products for the aerospace, military, telecommunications and energy markets. **********The group said it was thinking of a proxy fight after Rockcor's management refused to meet with the partnership's managing partner, N.

The army high command is also required to give its approval before an air strike is launched by signing an order authorizing each attack. **********''We have tightened the tactical situation as much as possible so that there is no possibility of action in any area that could cause a danger to the civilian population.'' Mr. Duarte said. **********Civilians Reported Attacked **********The new instructions follow charges by Roman Catholic Church officials here and by American human rights groups that the Salvadoran Air Force has several times bombed civilians living in guerrilla-held areas. Mr. Duarte has met with air force officers to discuss the charges, according to the Minister of the Presidency, Julio Adolfo Rey Prendes. **********An American Embassy spokesman, Donald Hamilton, said United States officials discuss the use of combat aircraft with the Salvadoran high command, but he added that there was no specific embassy policy regulating bombing by the air force here. **********Most Salvadoran jet fighter and helicoptor pilots have been trained by the United States, Mr. Hamilton said, and a United States Air Force officer is assigned to maintain contact with the Salvadoran Air Force. **********Before the guidelines announced today, air strikes could be ordered without the authorization of the army high command and without a specific description of the target to be attacked, Mr. Prendes said. Combat officers commanding troops in the area to be bombed radioed the air force directly to request aerial support, he added. **********The new procedures require an officer requesting an air strike to describe the target area and give its location. He must also give the location of army and guerrilla forces, as well as any civilians. Additionally, the officer must inform the air force if the International Red Cross is working in the area, Mr. Duarte said. **********Commenting on a separate issue, Mr. Duarte said he was still waiting results of an army investigation into a reported massacre by Salvadoran soldiers two months ago of civilian guerrilla supporters in Cabanas province, 45 miles northeast of the capital of San Salvador. **********Defends the Armed Forces **********He said he had been told that there had been a military operation in the area in which guerrillas and soldiers had been killed, as well as some civilians. But he said he could not yet comment on reports that 68 civilians had died. **********Mr. Duarte's account appeared to contradict a description of the military operation in Cabanas given by the army last week. At that time, the army spokesman, Col. Ricardo Cienfuegos, said that five soldiers had been wounded in the operation but that none had been killed. He added that he had no report of guerrilla or civilian casualties. **********Mr. Duarte defended the conduct of the armed forces and pledged to protect civilians living in combat zones, while harshly criticizing leftist guerrillas for operating in areas occupied by civilians. **********''The terrorists are using the masses as shields and they are using the masses to provoke, exposing these people to be killed,'' Mr. Duarte said in English in answer to a question. ''This is horrible. This is inhuman.'' **********Rebel-Held Cities Bombed **********On at least two occasions before Mr. Duarte assumed the presidency this year, Salvadoran Air Force pilots bombed cities after they were occupied by guerrilla forces. In 1982 they bombed the city of Berlin. Last year the city of Tenancingo was similarly attacked. **********On other occasions the air force has been accused of dropping bombs on over areas controlled by guerrillas without selecting specific targets. **********The Salvadoran Air Force is estimated to have 1,000 men, a figure that includes an 800-man paratrooper battalion. The air force flies 22 combat helicoptors and six A-37 jet fighters, all provided by the United States. **********The six jet fighters are equipped with machine guns and drop either 500-pound or 750-pound bombs, according to a United States Embassy official. The Pentagon is considering converting two Salvadoran Air Force DC-3 cargo planes into gunships equipped with 50-caliber machine guns, the official added. **********The United States has attempted to limit the destructive power of the weapons it has provided to the air force, according to the official. A recent report to the Defense Department is believed to have suggested that jet fighters are of limited use in a guerrilla war of the sort being fought in El Salvador."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/11/business/suddenly-new-resolve-to-confront-the-deficit.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Kilborn", "pub_date": "1984-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 863, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SUDDENLY, NEW RESOLVE TO CONFRONT THE DEFICIT", "print_headline": "SUDDENLY, NEW RESOLVE TO CONFRONT THE DEFICIT", "body_text": " **********The Federal Reserve said it would keep doing what it has been doing - keeping a lid on inflation while trying to slow the economy's growth to a speed it might maintain for the balance of the 1980's.  But the Fed chairman, Paul A. Volcker, said he was not going to modify his plans if a force he cannot control - the biggest Government budget deficits in history - set off a paralyzing rise in interest rates or even another recession. With that, hundreds of thousands of investors canceled their bets on a healthy economy and the stock market plunged. **********The market heard the Fed, and the Government heard the market. In the span of the week, the Fed and the market awakened Congress and the Administration to the issue in a way that a year of wrangling never did. **********They said deficits of $200 billion a year were wrong in a growing economy, election year or not. As a result, Republicans and Democrats are saying that they might not get away with the token solutions they seemed willing to accept a few days ago.   'Forced Into It' **********''We'll be forced into it,'' said Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey. ''The markets are responding that this thing, the deficit, is going to do just what the realists suggest - eat up all our capital.'' **********''Before there was no incentive for the President to bargain,'' said Gregory B. Mills, a budget expert at the Urban Institute, a private research organization. Until the markets began to tumble, Republicans in the Administration and Democrats in Congress were stalemated over the deficits - ''gridlocked,'' in Mr. Volcker's word. **********Bracing for the campaign, the Republicans controlled the issues of military spending and taxes, Mr. Mills said. They would run on a strong defense and a refusal to raise taxes. Democrats controlled the issues of the deficit and domestic spending, he said. They would run on Mr. Reagan's 1980 promises of a balanced budget and the cuts he made in social programs. **********Willing to Give Up Issue **********For a long time, the Democrats planned to charge that the deficit resulted from the tax cuts and military buildup. But the tone of the debate now has changed. ''I'm willing to give up a political issue,'' said Les Aspin, a Democratic Representative from Wisconsin, ''if it solves a problem for the country.'' But the White House, he said, could not give up any less. **********''We are completely agreeable'' to a discussion of military spending, James A. Baker 3d, President Reagan's chief of staff, said in a letter to Congressional leaders. **********''Everything is on the table,'' Martin S. Feldstein, the President's chief economic adviser, said repeatedly in a half-dozen appearances this week, beginning before the sharpest dives of the Dow. **********Mr. Feldstein's credibility as a spokesman for the Administration had suffered in the internecine skirmishing with the Treasury and the White House. But he won a major battle. Once silenced from raising the specter of deficits, he was discussing them openly in White House-approved testimony to Congress. **********Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, Mr. Feldstein's adversary in the debate over the impact of deficits on interest rates and the dollar, still would not concede a close relationship. But, he said, the markets believe there is a relationship, and he bowed to the markets. **********Skepticism by Democrats **********With the market eruption over the deficit's threat to the economy, President Reagan's brand new budget became suspect, as did his proposal to reduce the deficit by $100 billion over three years. **********Democrats saw the proposal as a cynical way to force them to relinquish the deficit issue. By joining the Administration in negotiating the reduction, they would put their thumbprint on the plan. Then, as they examined the question further, they found that a $100 billion down payment was already included in Mr. Reagan's budget. The fiscal year 1985 deficit of $180 billion would remain the same. **********They found, too, that the budget's projected decline in the deficit, to $123 billion in 1989, was based on interest rates falling 4 percentage points, a robust economy, growing 4 percent a year, and continued low inflation. The Congressional Budget Office, on the other hand, showed that a more conventional forecast would produce a deficit of $326 billion by 1989.  Finally, they found that there might well be room for a tax increase to reduce the deficits, even within the limits of the President's goals. **********Three years ago, with the publication of Mr. Reagan's ''Program for Economic Recovery,'' the Administration sought to reduce the nation's taxes from 21.1 percent of the gross national product then, to 19.3 percent by 1985. But the Congressional Budget Office has found that the tax cuts and lower inflation brought Government revenues to only 18.6 percent of the G.N.P. in the current fiscal year. **********Mr. Volcker said he wanted the deficit cut by between $30 billion and $50 billion this year, from the $180 billion shown in the budget. He said he preferred spending cuts but failing that, tax increases. **********The message the markets sent last week, and the threat of more to come, may have forced Congress and the Administration to try.

Last week, lobbyists representing both American and foreign manufacturers of luxury cars won reversal of the earlier approval of the proposal with a tie vote. But this morning, Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas and chairman of the committee, changed his ''no'' vote to ''present,'' which changed the vote to 9 to 8 in favor of the $15,000 cap. But this afternoon, Senator David L. Boren, a Democrat from Oklahoma, changed his previous ''yes'' vote to ''present'' and it was tied again, killing the proposal. **********These changes can occur because of the Finance Committee's custom of keeping a ballot open for changes until the panel takes a final vote on an entire bill at the end of the drafting process. **********Two Republican Senators have not yet voted on the provision. Senator Dave Durenberger of Minnesota said in an interview today that he was opposed, while Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon is undecided. **********The change in income averaging approved today would shorten the period from four to three years, raising $1.6 billion in revenue over four years. The committee, last year, had already approved raising the level of income needed to qualify for income averaging from 120 percent of the average over the period to 140 percent. The House Ways and Means Committee has approved both changes. **********Under current law, income averaging allows a taxpayer who has a sharp increase in income in one year to average it over the previous four years, when the taxpayer's income was much lower, and the current year, therefore reducing the tax paid. **********Thursday Finish Is Sought **********Senator Dole said he wanted to finish the work on the deficit reduction package by Thursday. The committee had set out to approve about $100 billion in spending reductions and tax increases. So far, it has approved about $47.6 billion in tax increases and about $26 billion in spending reductions, including proposals approved last year. There are still major tax increase items to be considered, including some taxes on the real estate industry. **********The repeal of the generation-skipping tax was backed by the panel by a vote of 10 to 1. If Congress approves the repeal, a grandfather, for example, could establish a trust for a grandson but give the son the trust's income during his life and there would be no estate tax on the son. Under current law the Treasury can tax the son's share of the estate. Since 1976, when the generation-skipping tax was passed, the Treasury has barely been able to carry out the provisions of the law because of the controversy over it, officials said. **********In the ''golden parachute'' provision, the committee accepted a Treasury provision that would limit to 200 percent of normal compensation the amount a departing executive could be paid after a merger. If the settlement was higher, the company could not deduct the settlement as a business expense.

He characterized the expense as a ''worthwhile investment.'' **********Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Government is embarked on a program to make a wide range of state-owned companies profitable. Mr. Lawson's remarks reinforced the view that the Government sees the coal strike as threatening that program. The strike was undertaken by the National Union of Mineworkers in an effort to stop the state- owned National Coal Board from closing money-losing pits. **********Support for Government **********Much of industry agrees with the Government. ''Industry and commerce are united behind the Government and the National Coal Board,'' said Sir Terence Beckett, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, in a recent letter to member companies urging them to cut electricity consumption by 5 percent to 10 percent to prevent power reductions. ''If we can do this, it will signal to the extremists and the moderate majority of strikers alike that industry and commerce cannot be brought down, no matter how long the strike goes on.'' **********Securities analysts in the City of London, the financial district, suspect that Mr. Lawson's assessment of the strike's costs reflects cash paid out so far and that the total costs are higher. Estimates of the gross cost to the public sector range as high as $85 million a week, according to a London stockbroker, Simon & Coates. **********Losses to the National Coal Board are at the top of the bill. The board says it is losing about $33 million to $39 million a week, but some analysts put the figure at more than $44 million. **********The Central Electricity Generating Board, which is state-owned, has responded to the strike by switching a large part of its generating load from coal to oil. Oil's share of production has reached 40 percent, compared with an average of 4 percent in 1983, according to a spokesman for the board. **********The switch is costing the board the equivalent of $26.2 million a week, the spokesman said. Keith Skeoch, an economist at the London brokerage house of James Capel & Company, said the net cost to the board - after accounting for reduced coal purchases - is probably about $19.7 million a week. **********Late last month, Norman Tebbit, Secretary for Trade and Industry, warned that the higher costs would eventually have to be borne by the consumer, but the electricity board said it does not have plans to raise prices or cut production. **********Steel Output Cut **********The state-owned British Steel Corporation estimates the strike is costing the company about $6.6 million a week. The company has cut production at one of its five integrated works, primarily because it was unable to bring in iron ore and coal by normal routes. **********Various other costs to the Government arising from the strike, including social security payments, the loss of income tax and national insurance surcharge payments, policing the strike and losses to British Rail as trucks take over coal transport, amount to $13 million a week, according to Mr. Skeoch at James Capel. **********The strike has also lowered projections for the British economy. Some analysts, assuming the strike will last until the end of September, have lowered projections of real gross domestic product for 1984 about five-tenths of 1 percent from previous estimates. **********Britain's balance of trade on current accounts will suffer a loss of between $589.5 million and $1.44 billion, analysts predict, primarily because of the increased use of oil in power plants. Some of the oil is imported and the rest comes from North Sea production that would otherwise have been exported. But analysts continue to predict the Government will remain within its 1984 borrowing target of around $9.5 billion and they say they do not expect much direct inflationary impact. **********Much of Industry Unaffected **********Private industry has been largely unaffected. **********The cement industry, one of the largest private users of coal in Britain, said it was not feeling the strike to any great degree. A spokesman for Blue Circle Industries, one of Britain's three major cement companies, said the National Coal Board had been able to continue supplying the company's coal needs, and stockpiles are averaging about 7 weeks to 8 weeks. **********From the national perspective, the loss of income for miners is expected to have a minor impact. Analysts estimate the strike will depress consumer spending only two-tenths to five-tenths of 1 percent this year. **********The loss of income is cushioned in mining communities by retailers and creditors who are sympathetic to the miners' plight. Consumer credit agencies, for example, appear willing to wait for their money, at least for the time being. **********The North Eastern Cooperative Society, an organization of 400 supermarkets, department stores, travel agencies, funeral homes and garages mostly in the north of England, said the strike's biggest impact has been felt in sales of luxury goods such as television sets and video recorders. The Co-op's travel agencies have begun to offer striking miners and their families vacations on credit to forestall cancellations. **********''A lot have been on holiday, though they haven't paid yet,'' a Co-op spokesman said. ''Hopefully, we'll get their payment when they've started work again.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/15/business/moving-industry-s-revival.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1984-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1162, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MOVING INDUSTRY'S REVIVAL", "print_headline": "MOVING INDUSTRY'S REVIVAL", "body_text": " **********The country's major moving companies are expected to begin slowly phasing out the price cutting and discounting that kept them rolling through the recession. The economy's improvement has meant that people are now moving nearly as often as they did four or five years ago, before the recession hit. **********And in their scramble to compete with one another in this newly healthy business environment, the companies say they are emphasizing customer service as much as pricing. So, for example, the Bekins Van Lines Company says it will pay its customers $100 a day for every day it is late with a shipment. And United Van Lines has what it calls a ''golden umbrella'' program that, for a small premium, replaces damaged goods at full current market value. **********As for Allied Van Lines Inc., the nation's largest mover has begun a ''coming home service'' that sends a company representative to a customer's home two days after the move to check that everything went smoothly. **********Discounts Reached 25% **********For the last two or three years, all the major moving companies offered discounts to individual customers that ranged as high as 25 percent. But Allied put in an across-the-board 9 percent rate cut last January, a cut matched by its competitors that has made them all less willing to discount individual moves. **********Joseph Harrison, the president of the Household Goods Carriers' Bureau, one of the industry's trade groups, said that he expects discounts to decrease, because 1983 showed some recovery in the business and 1984 is beginning to look like a very busy year. ''You will not see as many discounts as in the prior two years,'' he predicted. **********Until thet were deregulated in 1980, the interstate moving companies had no price competition. They maintained a standard of service that was fairly uniform - and was often criticized by consumers, who chronically complained of inaccurate estimates, late deliveries, damaged furniture and overcharging. **********But whether they are repairing their image or simply searching for more effective marketing tools, the moving companies have now turned more service conscious. **********'Tremendous Improvement' **********''Compared to three years before deregulation,'' said Jack Harms, vice president of Bekins, the nation's fifth- largest mover, ''there is a tremendous improvement in the quality of service that customers are getting.'' **********Somewhat to its surprise, the industry has not gotten a swarm of applicants seeking authority from the Interstate Commerce Commission to enter the moving business, even though the 1980 legislation that derergulated the industry made entry pretty easy. **********''You and I could form a van line this afternoon, and in a few days have 48-state authority at a nominal fee of about $350,'' said Charles C. Irions, president of the American Movers Conference, another industry trade group. **********In contrast, some 10,000 new carriers have joined the trucking industry since its deregulation four years ago. **********Recession Bred Overcapacity **********One reason the moving industry has not exploded, Mr Irions said, was that along with deregulation came the recession. The result was considerable industrywide overcapacity at a time when interstate moves became less frequent. Few newcomers, understandably, were willing to tackle the established companies under such conditions. **********But another reason for the lack of new entrants was that some special skill and more expensive equipment are needed for interstate moves. **********''In the household goods businesss,'' Mr. Irions said, ''the man that loads that trailer, drives it, and then unloads. He has total liability and responsibility for the move. He's a very special breed of driver.'' **********The industry, therefore, is made up of about 25 companies that handle 90 percent of the moves, and through which some 3,000 local agents do their business. **********There are six major companies that dominate the field: Allied, North American, United, Mayflower, Bekins and Atlas. **********The van lines coordinate and manage the individual jobs that are handled by their agents - the men and women who estimate the cost of moves, pack and load the job, and drive and deliver the household effects to their destination. With the van lines as coordinator, the idea is that the vans themselves can be loaded and routed for maximum efficiency. **********Two of the major companies, Allied and United, are actually owned by their agents, and are in business mainly to provide services to the agents. The other four companies, North American, Mayflower, Bekins and Atlas, are publicly held. They charge the agents for services, such as marketing, claim settlements, training, rental of equipment and the like. **********According to the Household Goods Carriers Bureau, last year 19 of the top moving companies had $1.75 billion in revenues and a net income of $44.6 million, compared with $1.6 billion in revenues, and net income of $39.5 million, in 1982. **********Stocks Haven't Done Well **********The stocks of the moving companies have not set Wall Street afire. While they improved somewhat from their level during the recession, current worries over the direction of interest rates have put a damper on their prospects. Atlas, for example, which is traded on the American Stock Exchange, closed at 12 1/4, up 1/4 yesterday, well off its 52-week high of 19 3/8. **********Jerry Levine of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., who follows Atlas, said he expected little recovery in its stock price as long as nervousness over interest rates continues. A rise in rates could slow housing starts and make home mortgages more prohibitive - and fewer people may be inclined to move. **********In part to avoid some of the vagaries of the economy, moving companies are expanding their services, according to Sidney Epstein, president of Allied. As an example, he said, a moving company could sell insurance to customers, register their cars in a new state, or provide a pet- care service while a family moves. **********Mr. Epstein is also predicting that the 25 companies with the major portion of the country's moving business will probably be reduced to fewer than 10 in the coming years. He said that companies that did not develop sophisticated computer systems and nationwide networks of agents would fall by roadside. **********Diversification of Agents **********He also predicts diversification by the van lines' agents. Those, such as the Clancy Cullen Storage Company of Manhattan, have had to look beyond household goods for new business. **********Gene Clancy, the president of the company, recalled that up to 1980 it had been exclusively a mover of household goods, mostly in the metropolitan area. With deregulation, he said, almost all competitors were offering 25 percent discounts, and that severely cut the company's revenues. **********Under deregulation, however, moving companies were, for the first time, allowed to move general commodities freight. He said his company quickly entered that field and has become adept at moving delicate equipment, such as computers and other electronic hardware. Referring to deregulation, Mr. Clancy said: ''When it hit, it was either diversify or get out of the business.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/21/business/debt-issues.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-12-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Debt Issues", "print_headline": "Debt Issues", "body_text": " ***********  Appalachian Power Co.  will redeem $800,000 of its 14 5/8 percent bonds due 1992 on March 1. ***********  Baltimore Gas and Electric Co.  filed for a shelf offering of up to $100 million in first refunding mortgage bonds. ***********  Comdisco Inc.  is extending until Jan. 4 its offer to exchange a new issue of its 99.65 percent senior subordinated debentures due 2002 for its 8 percent convertible debentures due 2003."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/07/world/a-delay-is-reported-in-talks-on-israeli-unity-government.html": {"writer_name": "James Feron", "pub_date": "1984-09-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 517, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A DELAY IS REPORTED IN TALKS ON ISRAELI UNITY GOVERNMENT", "print_headline": "A DELAY IS REPORTED IN TALKS ON ISRAELI UNITY GOVERNMENT", "body_text": " **********Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said tonight that they now expected it would take until the second half of next week to complete formation of a bipartisan Israeli government. **********The two leaders said Wednesday that they hoped to complete the task in two days.

That figure is expected to grow even more on Nov. 6, in response to the organizing efforts by the overseas branches of the Democratic and Republican Parties. **********Excluding United States military personnel and their dependents, there are an estimated 3.3 million Americans of voting age living overseas, the majority of them either employees of American multinational corporations or private consultants and lawyers. Before 1975, only those expatriates who said they were living abroad ''temporarily'' had the vote. But in the two Presidential elections since Congress enfranchised all American citizens, the expatriates have turned out in surprisingly large numbers, according to the Federal Voting Assistance Program. **********In 1976, about 31 percent of the 2.5 million civilians abroad voted or attempted to vote, according to a survey by the program, which is housed within the Department of Defense. In 1980, the figure grew to 35 percent of about 3 million civilians. And next month, said Harry Valentino, the program's director, ''that number is expected to increase considerably.'' (Stateside, 53 percent of those qualified to vote went to the polls in 1980, down from 54.3 percent in 1976.) **********Those overseas votes could change the outcome of a close election, especially for Senate or House seats. Lois Shepard, chairman of Republicans Abroad, cites the thousands of American citizens, mostly from California, who are in Saudi Arabia for the Bechtel Group, the worldwide engineering and construction company that has its headquarters in San Francisco. ''If those people got their act together, they could elect a Congressman,'' she said. **********In addition, Mrs. Shepard said, Texas, Pennsylvania, New York and Florida could have significant numbers of votes coming from overseas. **********One recognition of the potential political power of Americans overseas came in August, when President Reagan appointed Douglas A. Riggs as Presidential liaison to the overseas community. Mr. Riggs, who is a special assistant to the President in the Office of Public Liaison, declined a request for a telephone interview. **********Mrs. Shepard and her counterpart at the Democrats Abroad, Andrew P. Sundberg, said their organizations have held many sessions to register Americans living overseas and give them political information. Both parties encourage Congressmen and Senators, when visiting an area where a substantial number of Americans live, to arrange a meeting with the local club. **********As the political parties step up their efforts to organize Americans overseas, the familiar expatriate concerns have re-emerged - above all the much-debated issue of American tax on income earned abroad. The amount of income exempt from United States taxes was raised in 1981 to $80,000, from a low of $35,000. However, some Americans overseas argue that, because their incomes may also be taxed by the countries in which they live, the Internal Revenue Service should not tax any income earned abroad. **********Another problem is the citizenship of children born overseas. In a small minority of cases, the child may lose United States citizenship if one of the parents is not an American citizen. Still others complain that Medicare does not cover medical expenses incurred overseas. **********''Overseas Americans need to get active politically and make their voice heard and say this is nonsense,'' declared Mr. Sundberg of Democrats Abroad. **********There is also some talk overseas about getting a nonvoting delegate in Congress to represent Americans who live abroad. Mr. Sundberg is most enthusiastic about the idea, while others say it would hurt rather than help Americans overseas. **********''Now, overseas citizens have access to 435 Congressmen and 100 Senators,'' said J. Eugene Marans, a Washington-based attorney who is counsel to the Bipartisan Committee on Absentee Voting.

Griggs of Griggs & Santow Inc., financial consultants. ''The long and middle end did a little better than the short end, but we are in a waiting period for the refunding. Before then, no one wants to move the market.'' **********Some analysts had been concerned that yesterday's introduction by the Federal Reserve of a new accounting procedure that affects the way banks account for their reserves would lead to increased interest rate volatility. Based on yesterday's trading activity, those concerns were unjustified. **********The change is intented to give the Fed tighter control over M-1, the closely watched measure of money available for spending. **********Market Stability Cited **********''You have to have had your eyes closed and your fingers in your ears not to be impressed by the stability in the bond markets over the past few weeks,'' said William C. Melton, a vice president and senior economist at Investors Diversified Services, a subsidiary of American Express. **********''We are in a deflationary environment, and if you are looking at a 3 percent to 4 percent inflation rate, current yield levels are very attractive. I think a lot of portfolio managers are beginning to understand that.'' **********For those reasons, Mr. Melton and others anticipate that the new Treasury issues will be well received by investors next week. **********In when-issued trading yesterday, a period when traders buy and sell newly announced issues in advance of an auction, the Treasury's 3-year note, due Feb. 15, 1987, was offered to yield 10.80 percent; the 9 3/4-year note, due Nov. 15, 1993, was offered to yield 11.61 percent, and the 29 1/2-year bond, due Nov. 15, 2013, was offered to yield 11.71 percent. **********All three issues posted very slight declines in yield during trading following the Treasury's refunding announcement on Tuesday. **********Opinions about the likely success of the refunding were not uniformly positive, however. **********Federal Funds Rate Down **********''I don't see very much retail demand for these issues,'' said E. Craig Coats Jr., a managing director at Salomon Brothers. ''Unless yields go up to attract buyers, the market is not ready to absorb $16.25 billion of Treasury notes and bonds.'' **********In the market for overnight loans between banks, the Federal funds rate closed at 9 1/2 percent, down 3/8, from the day before. **********A month or six weeks ago, when the recovery was still perceived to be running at an unsustainably rapid rate, analysts were wary that the next move on the part of the Federal Reserve would be to tighten its grip on monetary aggregates, sending interest rates upward. The unusually long period of calm in the markets has tempered that view for the near term at least. **********''I am a little more constructive on the market,'' said Philip Braverman, chief economist at Briggs Schaedle & Company, Government securities dealers. **********''The economy isn't overheating, but it isn't dead in the water either. That suggests a continuation of the Fed's current stance. As a consequence, rates are likely to remain fairly stable through this quarter, and, if Treasury receipts in the second quarter are larger than anticipated, a result I expect will occur, then rates could decline.'' **********Mr. Griggs agreed. ''After the refunding is completed, I tend to think we could do a little better,'' he said. ''Over the next eight weeks, both the Fed and the market will be responsive to movements in the economy. I expect the Fed funds rate to be a little better, and no significant pickup in private credit demand.

The publication is intended to encourage commercial application of the country's space technology. **********Through Associated Business, the publication will be getting advertising for the first time in its 21-year history. And there are those who say that what getting a man on the moon was to the space business, getting advertising into a Government magazine is to the publishing business. **********NASA will deliver copy and illustrations covering the agency's technological discoveries and Associated Business will handle the rest, including circulation, which is currently held at 75,000 because of a Government-imposed ceiling put on for cost reasons. Tech Briefs has a free circulation and Mr. Schnirring is confident he can double it. **********According to Leonard A. Ault, NASA's chief of dissemination and analysis, the move began several years ago when the Office of Management and Budget put pressure on Government agencies to find ways to recoup losses from publishing ventures. **********Most agencies have tried to do so by charging for publications that had been free, Mr. Ault said. NASA, however, researched Tech Briefs' readership and discovered a common attitude, which went like this: ''We paid for the research as taxpayers in the first place, and we don't want to pay again to learn about it.'' **********A check by his associates, he added, showed that among technical publications outside the Government, the trend is away from paid circulation and toward controlled or free. Other checking, he said, showed that the cost of maintaining a paid circulation frequently ran to more than a publication earned from it. **********Mr. Schnirring, 25 years in publishing, found his place in this playlet because his executive vice president, Frank Northaft, is what he described as ''an inveterate Government watcher.'' It was he who spotted the NASA call for bids. **********NASA Tech Briefs will mark quite a shift in subject matter for American Business Publications, a 10-year-old company that puts out The Convenience Store Merchandiser, The Vegeterian Times and three annual directories in the food field. **********Tech Briefs began life as single- page fliers. The latest edition has 162 pages of summaries of NASA- wrought innovations, along with information on their patent status and availability of production licenses. **********For starters, Mr. Schnirring believes that likely advertisers will be from the aerospace industry but that they will eventually spread to almost all areas of manufacture. **********To help him sell the inner space - with a full black-and-white page selling for $3,990 and a four-color costing an $850 premium - he has hired Robert Kimmerle, formerly of Aviation Week, as ad manager.

It had been erected over vaults so broad that medieval masons could not span them with stone. **********Canon Ralph Mayland, cathedral treasurer, said the damage was in excess of $1.3 million, but added, ''We intend to restore it.'' **********Rose Window to Be Removed **********The cathedral's windows contain nearly half of all the medieval stained glass found in Britain. One of the most beautiful, the Rose Window, built in 1510 to mark the end of the Wars of the Roses, is in the gable end of the south transept and was damaged by the fire and will have to be removed for repairs, Canon Mayland said. **********Above the Rose Window, the window at the apex of the gable, was a blackened hole. And one of the arched windows was damaged by a falling timber.  Smoke-smudged and bleary-eyed under his blue hard hat, Canon Mayland watched workmen carrying the remains of the 700-year-old ceiling out in wheelbarrows. **********The larger pieces, including the gilt bosses, or decorative knobs, from the ceiling, were being labeled by members of the York Archeological Trust and stacked together. Sheets of plastic were going over the stone crypts. **********The blaze was discovered at 2:30 A.M., apparently simultaneously, by the building's alarm system and the nightwatchmen who said they saw ''huge orange flashes'' of lightning nearby. **********Although firemen said they had not ruled out any cause, ''there was lightning at 11 P.M. last night,'' said Alan Stow, commander of the York Division of the North Yorkshire Fire Brigade. **********The cathedral, which is visited by two million people every year, underwent a five-year multimillion-dollar restoration program, ending in 1972, after the building's foundation was found to be unsound and the cathedral in danger of collapse. **********Restoration of the roof of the south transept, the oldest roof on the cathedral, was finished three years ago. **********''Some of our carpenters are terribly upset,'' Canon Mayland said. ''A life's work was consumed in two hours.'' **********The fire spared a wooden crucifix, which hangs on the wall as a monument to choir members who gave their lives in World War II. And a huge wooden sculpture of the Virgin Mary was only slightly scorched at the base.   Roman Treasures Unharmed **********During the fire, thousands of gallons of water were sprayed on the cathedral to stop the flames from spreading to the building's central tower, 200 feet high. There was concern for the relics and Roman treasures in a museum in the undercroft, entered through the transept, but this morning firemen found little more than an inch of water there. The artifacts, in glass cases, were unharmed, firemen said. **********Today the entire cathedral was closed to visitors. **********Canon Mayland said he hoped the building would be reopened Thursday, or at least by Sunday. The Very Rev. Ronald Jasper, the Dean of York, is retiring on Sunday. **********The Dean said he and other clergymen rushed to the church after the first alarms and, with help from the police, took as many objects out of the building as they could, fearing the whole cathedral might be consumed by the fire. **********''We saved all the treasures in the east end, the high altar cloths, the crosses, the chairs, the kneelers, the carpets,'' the Canon said. ''It took a dozen of us to carry the sanctuary carpet. We were mortified that the whole of the minster could have gone. We are thankful it was contained as it was.'' **********''We saved priceless items using a human chain of police and firemen until we were forced to leave by the smoke and flames,'' the Dean said. **********Bernard Feilden, the architect responsible for the restoration of York Minster, called the fire ''a shock and a tragedy.'' He said the cathedral had been fully protected against lightning ''in every conceivable way, but you can never be quite sure with lightning.'' **********He said he believed the fire had been caused by lightning because it had spread so quickly. **********Another factor in the rapid spread of the fire, he said, was that, unlike other cathedrals, the vaults of York Minster are made of wood and plaster, instead of stone. **********''This is because the south transept is 46 feet wide, far wider than any other cathedral, and this meant the medieval masons were unable to put up stone ceilings,'' he said. **********The Archibishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Robert Runcie, who had been in York for a church meeting, visited the cathedral. **********''It's a scene of great sadness,'' the Archbishop said. ''But the minster will rise again.'' **********The Archbishop promised that the transept would be rebuilt, and the work is expected to be paid for by the Church of England's own insurance company, the Ecclesiastical Insurance Office.

He said the draft treaty called for a halt to the arms race in Central America ''and it says we have to negotiate the reduction and control of arms, of troops and of foreign advisers, but it does not say when they should take place.'' **********Mr. Paz proposed that ''a calendar be established'' and that ''we polish the mechanism for verification and control.'' **********He also said the treaty should specify how the nations involved in the treaty would know if free elections were taking place and if human rights were being respected. **********The nations have until next Monday to propose revisions in the document. The United States has said that although the final draft is a improvement over earlier versions, it still needs substantial revision before it will be acceptable.   No Timetable in Treaty **********One objection expressed by State Department officials is similar to the Honduran complaint - that there is no timetable for the arms and troop reductions foreseen by the plan. Timing is left for future negotiations. **********Nicaragua, meanwhile, has said it favors the proposed treaty the way it is. Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the Nicaraguan leader, reaffirmed his Government's ''unconditional support'' for the peace plan last week. In an earlier interview, he said ''any modifications that might be submitted would only destroy the document.'' **********Costa Rica's position will probably be spelled out Wednesday when its Foreign Minister, Carlos Jose Gutierrez, is scheduled to speak. Mr. Paz conferred with Mr. Gutierrez briefly after speaking today. **********All the Central American diplomats have created a stir in appearances here. Mr. Ortega surprised the General Assembly by saying Nicaragua was expecting a United States invasion on Oct. 15, and Mr. Duarte, in his dramatic proposal Monday to meet with rebels in his country, also picked that date for the peace talks. Mr. Paz's call for a meeting was similarly unexpected.   He Criticizes Nicaragua **********The Honduran diplomat was critical of Nicaragua both in his prepared speech and at the news conference. Addressing the General Assembly, Mr. Paz devoted a considerable portion of his remarks to what he said were ''unfounded assertions'' of impending invasions that have come from Nicaragua in the last three years. **********Speaking with reporters, Mr. Paz used Nicaragua as a example of why he said a group like Inter-American Commission on Human Rights must be empowered to utilize on-site inspections to monitor both military reductions and political standards. **********In 1979, he said, the commission ''verified a human rights matter in Nicaragua and firmly condemned the dictatorship of Somoza.'' More recently, he said, the commission went to Nicaragua and ''condemned the present Government'' for a violation of human rights.''  Africa Also on Agenda **********Earlier in the Assembly session today, the focus was on Africa. The Foreign Minister of Rwanda, Francois Ngarukiyintwali, spoke of an ''economic crisis'' that he said represented ''tragedy'' for developing countries. **********He said Rwanda, which he described as ''a least developed'' nation ''with almost no natural resources,'' had to depend on foreign partners for almost 60 percent of the financing for its five- year plans. **********He called, as other speakers have, for ''global negotiations,'' or discussions between the industrialized and underdeveloped nations, over changes that the smaller nations would like to see in international financing, reduction of tariff barriers and other components of trade. **********Tanzania's Foreign Minister, Benjamin Mkapa, said that the deterioration in the economies of most developing countries had reached grave proportions and that a ''frank exchange'' between developed and developing nations was a key element to the revival of the world economy. **********The Foreign Minister of Lesotho, Vincent Montsi Makhele, said the efforts of smaller nations to restructure their economies was being frustrated ''by the polarized manipulaion and refusal of the developed countires to accept a new international economic order.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/13/business/changes-on-london-exchange.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1984-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 419, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHANGES ON LONDON EXCHANGE", "print_headline": "CHANGES ON LONDON EXCHANGE", "body_text": " **********The London Stock Exchange's governing council issued a discussion paper today concluding that several membership restrictions and the current trading system separating dealers from brokers should be dismantled. **********Many members, major investors and experts have described such changes as inevitable since last summer's agreement with the Government to phase out fixed commissions, but the paper is the first indication of the extent to which the exchange officially agreed with such comments. **********The discussion paper disclosed that the council is divided on what dealing system might replace the current one once the loss of fixed commissions makes it financially unsustainable. **********Jobbers and Brokers **********The exchange currently operates as a market where jobbers - members who can own securities and make markets in them like a merchant buying or selling goods - deal exclusively with members who are brokers, that is, representatives of investors. Brokers must execute orders and are not allowed to buy securities on their own account for resale. **********The new system is expected to give brokers leeway to be dealers, and dealers the opportunity to market directly to investors. **********The basic problem is that the exchange covers a wide range of securities - about 2,700 companies and Government securities.

He won 54 percent of the vote against 46 percent for Mr. d'Aubuisson. **********On Monday Mr. Duarte is scheduled to confer with President Reagan and with Secretary of State George P. Shultz. He is also due to meet with members of Congress to lobby for passage of military and economic aid for his country. **********Congress Deadlocked on Aid **********The House and Senate are deadlocked over emergency military aid of $62 million for El Salvador, with the Senate in favor and the House reluctant to approve it. House leaders, such as Representative Clarence D. Long, Democrat of Maryland, chairman of a key House Appropriations subcommittee, are expected to seek commitments from Mr. Duarte on ending civil and human rights abuses in El Salvador as a price for the aid. **********Mr. Duarte appeared on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press'' and then with an aide, Julio Rey Prendes, chatted with reporters. **********He stressed that he was ready to give pledges to move against right-wing death squads and other violators but that he believed these should not be forced on him as conditions for economic or military aid, as suggested by Mr. Long and other House Democrats.   'I Know My Responsibility' **********''I don't agree with conditions from one side to another,'' he said. ''I believe on the responsibilities that each government has. And I think that I understand the problems of my country. I will confront the abuses of authority, the problems of death squads, the problems of violence, the problems of injustice, the problems of lack of opportunities.'' **********''I know my responsibility to my people and I'm going to confront that,'' he said. **********Mr. Duarte said he needed help and support from all friendly and democratic countries of the world ''and specifically the United States.''  Visits 3 Heads of State **********Before flying here he visited the heads of state of Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica. **********Mr. Duarte was the choice of most members of Congress and of the Administration to win the Salvadoran election because of Mr. d'Aubuisson's purported ties to the death squads responsible for many political killings in El Salvador. The Central Intelligence Agency reportedly funneled some $600,000 to El Salvador to help Mr. Duarte's election campaign. **********On ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. Duarte said he had ''no information'' about receiving C.I.A. money. **********Mr. Duarte seem unbothered by the issue. He said that reports of C.I.A. support had helped him because the Salvadoran right wing, which had accused him of receiving such money, had earlier said he was in the pay of the Communists. **********He also said he had ''no problem'' about receiving money from democratic countries because ''you have to remember that we're fighting against an hegemony of power of the extreme right, who had millions of millions of money support from all over the world.'' **********''And we had no support from anybody,''he said. ''And we have been doing this all by ourself.''  Rebel Offensive Predicted **********The Administration has said that El Salvador faces a major guerrilla offensive in the fall and needs all the aid it can get now to build up its armed forces. Mr. Duarte said the Salvadoran forces had only a three-month supply of ammunition left and was using up about ''150,000 bullets a day.'' **********''Therefore, this is a dramatic situation because we are absolutely dependent on the supply of these bullets,'' he said. **********He said that in his last meeting with Salvadoran military leaders, he had suggested they think of building an ammunition factory so the country could be independent of foreign sources. **********On the specific steps he might take to end the death squads, Mr. Duarte said he would appoint a special commission, directly responsible to him, to investigate past crimes attributed to these squads. **********''The country will not accept any more of these kinds of abuses,'' he said. ''We will establish the basis of discipline.'' **********When Mr. Duarte was reminded that he had expressed concern in the past about the military's willingness to accept democratic, civilian rule, he replied that the military high command was now ready ''to give back the power to the people'' while the guerrillas were trying to impose power on the people. **********''The army institution has changed a lot,'' he said. ''And this is the only reason why I am here and this is the only reason why I can be president, the first civilian president in the last 50 years. I think the army will back up and is ready to support the effort we're going to do in the direction of democracy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/09/business/prospects.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1984-09-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 732, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PROSPECTS", "print_headline": "PROSPECTS", "body_text": " **********Pay Now or Buy Later **********The same Americans whose borrowing spree helped fuel the economic recovery are starting to rein in their buy-now, pay-later instincts. According to Merrill Lynch Economics, figures due out next week will show that consumers spent about $436 billion on credit purchases in July, an increase of just $6 billion over the previous month. In June, the increase in monthly credit buying was $7.83 billion, and in May credit buying was up about $10.2 billion.  ''We expect installment debt expansion to diminish,'' said Stuart M. Robbins, vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities. ''Consumer confidence could be particularly tempered if it becomes apparent that tax increases are to be a vehicle for reducing budget deficits.'' **********Unlike the credit buying splurge of the late 1970's, when consumers rushed to make major purchases because they expected prices to soar, the recent credit binge was a race against rising interest rates. Credit buying was about 20 percent higher in the first half of 1984 than in the same period of 1983. Now, with the zest for credit diminishing, the figures for full-year 1984 are likely to level out at 15 percent over 1983. **********The Swiss Get a Best-SellerThe Swiss watch industry may have found the product that can lift it out of its financial swamp: the ''Swatch,'' a battery-driven timepiece with an analog face, retailing for $25 to $35. ''It's a hot item, a buyer's dream,'' said Ilia Jagenburg, watch buyer for Bloomingdale's. ''Customers buy two, three, even five at a time.'' **********The Swatch is the first precision Swiss watch made on a totally automated production line, and thus, the first high-quality Swiss offering to sell below $100. And Swiss watchmakers claim that, this time around, they've hit the market in time. ''We did not believe the digital quartz watch would sell, and the Asian watchmakers proceeded to take away 90 percent of our market, worldwide,'' said Jacques Irniger, vice president for marketing at the ETA Group of Grenchen, which makes the movements for almost all Swiss watchmakers. Now, Mr. Irniger said, digital watches are going out of style, leaving a wide open market for the Swatch. **********That might be wishful thinking to justify the Swiss industry's gamble on the Swatch. The Swiss ''thin watch,'' its last fashion offering, never sold very well and the industry had to borrow huge sums to develop production technology for the Swatch. **********Courting Conventioneers **********Convention centers are proliferating. Mammoth new centers are going up in New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, San Diego, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Numerous older centers are also expanding, sometimes to more than double their original size. **********The future holds more of the same. ''There will be more centers and bigger ones,'' said Dan Graveline, director of the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta. **********Some of the centers are sponsored by local government, while others are being built by private developers. All are after the same goal: visitors' dollars. Some 400,000 visitors to the Georgia Center spent about $500 each last year. ''That is $200 million Atlanta wouldn't have gotten without the center,'' Mr. Graveline said. **********The convention center boom does have its downside. Along with growing revenues come growing pains - of financing, subsidies, tax debates , infrastructure headaches, and huge building and maintenance costs. **********Little Kids, Big Thirst **********Fruit juices - in their natural state, blended with one another or cut by water - are due for a big surge through 1990, thanks to the small fry. **********Extrapolation of census data indicates that some there will be three million more children under the age of 9 by 1990. That's a bonanza for the juice business. Young children are becoming the most frequent consumers of juices, according to Frank Panyko, vice president of the Food Institute, Fair Lawn, N.J., a research group. **********For example, while only 3 percent of adults are frequent users of apple juice, an Institute study found that about 8 to 9 percent of young children are apple-juice imbibers. ''Small consumers doesn't mean small tummies,'' quips Mr. Panyko. The kids' love of juices, he says, has cut into milk and soft-drink consumption. **********Food companies aren't taking their chances on just orange, apple and pineapple juice. They are blending juices, such as apple and grape. Tree Top, Campbell Soup, and Libby and McNeil already have blended juices in selected markets. **********Isadore Barmash"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/21/business/thrift-regulators-move-against-equity-cd-s.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Bennett", "pub_date": "1984-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 754, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THRIFT REGULATORS MOVE AGAINST EQUITY C.D.'s", "print_headline": "THRIFT REGULATORS MOVE AGAINST EQUITY C.D.'s", "body_text": " **********Federal officials are trying to stop a new technique by which savings institutions have been issuing certificates of deposit to finance real estate ventures generally considered riskier than usual. **********While the depositors are given a chance to share in any profits the ventures might make, regulators call the practice ''unsafe and unsound'' and are balking at insuring the deposits. **********Dallas Thrift Unit Balks **********Under the program, the savings institutions sell C.D.'s - usually maturing in seven or eight years - with a guaranteed minimum interest rate, typically 10 percent. But investors are promised additional income based on the earnings, if any, from the pool of real estate investments. **********However, if the investments turned out to be disastrous, causing the savings association to fail, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation could be required to pay off depositors. **********As a result, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the parent of the F.S.L.I.C. and the Federal regulator of savings and loan associations, has ordered insured thrift institutions to stop issuing the so-called equity C.D.'s. It has also warned that the C.D.'s may not qualify for F.S.L.I.C. insurance. **********The Murray Savings Association of Dallas, however, is defying the bank board and is continuing to aggressively market the C.D.'s in television, radio and newspaper advertisements. **********Insurance Could Be Canceled **********''We have respectfully declined'' the request to stop issuing the C.D.'s, said Robert W. Stallings, executive vice president and chief operating officer, in a telephone interview. **********If the bank board can prove that Murray Savings is engaging in an illegal practice, it is possible that all of its deposit insurance could be canceled. **********''I'm not sure what their concerns are,'' Mr. Stallings said. ''I'm not sure they have any worries about our product at all. They would like to review it before it's offered; we would like them to review it.'' But Murray has spent too much money on advertising and legal fees to stop the program now, he said. **********Other savings and loan associations, however, have agreed to at least a suspension. **********''I'm totally in favor of what the bank board is doing - making sure that safety and soundness concerns are met,'' said Christopher J. Sumner, president of the Western Savings Company of Salt Lake City. **********Western plans to issue $50 million of equity C.D.'s through Shearson Lehman/American Express. **********''At this point,'' said Mr. Sumner, ''I have no reason to be concerned that it will not come out with some guidelines for this kind of transaction.'' **********California Institutions **********At least two California thrift units are said to have issued equity C.D.'s: Farmer Savings Bank and Malibu Savings and Loan Association. **********Malibu's offering, underwritten by E. F. Hutton & Company, originally was for $50 million, but demand was said to be so great that the amount was raised to $70 million. **********Banking sources said the problem arose in the past year or so, after the Depository Institutions Deregulation Committee, which is composed of bank regulators, permitted variable- rate deposits. The committee said that the interest rates could be tied to any index that the thrift institutions might choose. **********Technically, the return to the investor on the equity C.D.'s is tied to an ''index'' of loans put aside by the thrift unit for that purpose. **********At Murray, for example, the C.D.'s carry a guaranteed minimum interest rate of 10 percent, paid quarterly. Murray contends that this portion is insured by the F.S.L.I.C. **********Share of Profit Participation **********Investors are promised an 85 percent participation in any interest income Murray earns on a designated group of ''commercial, income- producing mortgage loans'' for such projects as shopping malls, multi- family dwellings and construction projects. But the interest rate on the deposits could not fall below 10 percent. **********If, for example, the average interest rate on the loans were 15 percent, the yield to the deposit holders would be 12.75 percent, Mr. Stallings said. **********Moreover, the C.D. holders would receive a share of the profit Murray might earn from any appreciation in the value of the real estate - its ''profit participation,'' which usually amounts to 50 percent of such appreciation over the life of the loan. **********Holders of the equity C.D.'s would receive 100 percent of Murray's profit participation in the loans until the annual rate of return over the life of the loan amounted to 13 1/2 percent. **********After that, they would receive 75 percent of Murray's profit participation, until the return on the C.D.'s reached an annual rate of 18 percent. And after that, any profit participation income would be split 50-50 between Murray and the C.D. holders."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/05/business/advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 46, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; People", "body_text": " **********Joseph Carlucci and  Christine Hansen have been appointed to the newly created positions of executive vice president at Geers Gross. ***********  David Frankel, Karen Olshan, Vincent Taschetti and  Ronald Taylor have been elected senior vice presidents at Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/14/business/nicor-write-down.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-12-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 83, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nicor Write-Down", "print_headline": "Nicor Write-Down", "body_text": " **********Nicor Inc. said that because of the depressed energy markets it serves, the company expected ''significant asset write-downs'' to be included in its full-year 1984 results. **********Nicor said it was completing studies of the asset carrying values in its coal, contract drilling, mineral and marine businesses.

Belize, the only English- speaking country in Central America, had long been associated with only one man: George Price, the tall, scripture-quoting former seminarian of Scottish and Mayan ancestry who began working for independence 30 years ago and ushered it in as Prime Minister in 1981. His international stature is unquestioned. **********Mr. Price's fall from power Friday night and Mr. Esquivel's cometlike ascent appeared to be due in no small part to a widespread sense among the country's 60,000 voters that it was time for a change at the top. **********But it was clear from the postelection comments of many Belizeans that Mr. Esquivel's victory had much to do with his own merits: his forceful and articulate presentation of the United Democratic Party platform, stressing faster economic development, and his rock- solid reputation as an upright family man in a political arena noted for innuendo and mud-slinging. His landlside defeat of Mr. Price was an extraordinary achievement, a United States official here said. **********''A change of Government is a new experience for Belize,'' Mr.  Esquivel said at a news conference tonight. ''For many it is an experience of great joy and hope, while for others it may be an experience of apprehension. I would therefore like at the outset to categorically state that no one need fear this dramatic change of Government.'' **********''The U.D.P. Government,'' he added, ''is a Government for all Belizeans.''  Phone Rings Constantly **********Like 40 percent of Belize's population, Mr. Esquivel is of Latin extraction, and his family has lived in Belize for many generations. He was born Manuel Amadeo Esquivel in Belize City in on May 2, 1940. **********This morning, the Prime Minister was holding court in his modest, two- story frame house on a dirt side street in Belize City. **********Mr. Esquivel, wearing a white guayabera shirt, his silver hair boyishly tousled, was having trouble getting up from the the dining-room table to greet his visitors. **********Everytime he would finish a congratulatory telephone conversaion and replace the receiver, the phone would ring again, and he seemed unable to keep himself from picking it up. Almost every call elicited a characteristically shy grin. **********''The new Prime Minister is busy,'' Norris Garcia, a young campaign worker, told visitors in a mock stentorian tone of voice.  ''Take a seat.'' **********As a student Mr. Esquivel earned a bachelor's degee in physics from Loyola University in New Orleans. He later acquired certification in physics education at Bristol University in England, where he met his wife, Katherine. They have three children: David, 11 years old, Laura, 8, and Ruth, 3.   Teacher Until This Year **********Mr. Esquivel, like Mr. Price, is a Roman Catholic, and until nine months ago astaught at the Jesuit-run St. John's Junior College in Belize City. He quit to devote full time to the party. **********In 1973, he helped found the United Democratic Party and served as party chairman from 1976 to 1982, when he became the party leader. He also served two terms on the Belize City Council. He was named to the Senate, an appintive body, in 1979. **********This morning, sitting in their plainly furnished second-floor sitting room, the rest of the family seemed elated but not entirely adjusted to the idea that the household was about to acquire a Prime Minister. **********''Will you move to Belmopan now?,'' someone asked Mrs. Esquivel, referring to the designated capital city of 5,000, a sort of miniature Brasilia 50 miles inland from hurricane-vulnerable Belize City. **********''Goodness, no, I can't,'' Mrs. Esquivel said firmly as her husband reached to answer still another congratulatory telephone call. ''I have to teach.'' **********And what do you teach, she was asked. ''Mathematics,'' she replied cheerfully.

These problems include excessive advertising and other product start-up outlays, along with some overdiversification. **********Nonetheless, the consensus on the outlook for cosmetics equities appears quite bright. **********''You might be able to make money in Avon, for instance, if you hold it until next year when the stock could be selling for as high as $32 a share versus about $24 today,'' said Harold Mackinney, chairman of the investment policy committee at the Fleet Financial Group in Providence, R.I., and basically a fundamentalist. **********Technicians say that a look at movements of the Standard & Poor's Cosmetic Index over the last 24 years supports their view that gains are in store for cosmetics issues. The index is made up of Alberto- Culver, Avon, Chesebrough-Pond's, Gillette and Noxell. **********In 1961 the index doubled in price. From 1965 through 1972 it registered a threefold increase, and from the third quarter of 1974 into mid-1975 it doubled again after suffering an extreme drop throughout the 1973-74 bear market. **********In contrast, from late 1978 until recently, cosmetics stocks have been in a well-defined downward trend. Last July, however, prices began to move higher. **********Robert E. Walsh, senior vice president and technical analyst at Rotan/Mosle in Houston, said that those signs - plus an improvement in the technical patterns of various individual issues - indicate that cosmetics stocks are positioned for above- average price performance over the next 6 to 12 months. **********''While not included in the S.&P.; Cosmetic Index, our favorite cosmetic stock is International Flavors and Fragrances,'' Mr. Walsh said. ''The stock has corrected about 50 percent of its strong mid-1982- to-late-1983 advance, and a solid price base has been built over the last six months.'' **********He continued, ''I think we will see visible evidence of the dollar coming down as we get into the new year, and stocks such as International Flavors and Fragrances, Avon and Alberto-Culver - because of their large foreign exposure - should be major beneficiaries of that dollar weakening.'' **********Mr. Mackinney of Fleet Financial said that of the four cosmetics companies in his concern's portfolio - Avon, Gillette, Revlon and Chesebrough-Pond's - only the latter company is currently considered a ''buy'' opportunity. **********''Essentially, Chesebrough-Pond's has a better earnings growth record than the others, and that growth should continue at better than 10 percent a year,'' Mr. Mackinney said. ''The company is predictable and has benefited from diversification and a strong acquisition policy. There also have been been recent hints that new products are on the way.'' **********Avon, the industry leader, predicted this week that its third-quarter net income would be up about 10 percent from the $24.9 million, or 33 cents a share, earned in last year's third quarter. The estimate did not include an expected gain of $40 million to $50 million from the sale of Tiffany & Company, the New York retailer. Tiffany is being bought by an investor group for $135.5 million. **********''The cash they get from the sale of Tiffany should keep them from having to cut their dividends,'' Mr. Mackinney said. ''We feel that at the current 11 times earnings, the stock is not cheap.'' **********Mr. Mackinney said Gillette's problems had been currency-related because of the company's big foreign exposure. ''From 1973 to 1974 the stock dropped from about $64, to $24, because of more competition and its fading image as a pure growth play,'' he said. **********The volatility of Revlon, a company that has diversified into health care in recent years, has had a major impact on the total cosmetics group. The company's stock climbed from a February-March low of $29 a share to a high of about $41 a share in June. Then it retreated to the mid-30's. Revlon closed yesterday at $35.87 1/2, unchanged. **********Revlon is described by Mr. Mackinney as ''a mixed bag.'' The company is strong domestically, he said, but has had problems overseas, particularly with Max Factor in Japan.

He has to haggle with foreign steelmakers who want to sell dear and domestic customers who want to buy cheap. He has to tiptoe through a thorny maze of trade laws, dumping suits and countervailing duty petitions. **********Despite these pressures, Mr. Lamesch - who started 28 years ago as a sales trainee for a steel company in Luxembourg, his homeland - said he loves the wheeling and dealing aspects of being a trader in the United States. **********''The personal freedom that exists within a company here is far preferable to the much more rigid structures that exist abroad,'' said the thoughtful, ruddy-faced 49-year-old. **********Industry's New Targets **********From his river-view office in the Random House building, on Manhattan's East Side, he presides over a 130-employee trading house that is an arm of Arbed S.A., a Luxembourg-based steelmaker. Tra deArbed imports several hundred thousand tons of steel annually, much of it from Arbed's mills. A few hundred thousand tons come, however, from third world countries such as Brazil, Argentina, South Korea and Taiwan, which are the domestic industry's latest targets because they are shipping increasing amounts of steel to the United States. **********Just as Mr. Lamesch dislikes the ''rigid structures'' of European corporations, he abhors the strictures that the nation's steelmakers are trying to impose. **********The industry, which lost more than $5 billion in 1982 and 1983, is lobbying for a bill in Congress that would limit imports to 15 percent of the domestic market. The Bethlehem Steel Corporation has filed a trade petition that also seeks a quota. In addition, there is a flood of unfair-trade suits accusing developing countries of selling steel that is government-subsidized, or ''dumped,'' at prices below the cost of production. **********Import Share Rises to 20% **********Calls for quotas have increased as imports have surged from 7 percent of the market in 1964 to 13 percent in 1974 and to more than 20 percent this year. **********''I don't blame the domestic steel industry for wanting quotas,'' Mr. Lamesch said in almost unaccented English. ''When you have competitors who are doing better than you, you'd rather not see them around. The Government must remember, however, that quotas will hurt the consumer.'' **********Mr. Lamesch, who was recently named president of the American Institute for Imported Steel, an importers' trade association, talks like a selfless champion of the American consumer. A 15 percent import quota, he predicts, would raise steel prices 20 percent, or almost $100 a ton, and make everything from stoves to station wagons cost more. **********In a franker moment, Mr. Lamesch acknowledged that quotas will hurt him, too. He said his company earns a 2 percent to 5 percent commission or profit margin per ton, and quotas would of course reduce the tonnage he imports. **********'Government Meddling' Feared **********Moreover, quotas would take a lot of the excitement out of his work. ''With quotas,'' he said, ''there would be Government meddling in every aspect of the business.'' **********Noting that the market is very dynamic, he said quotas would freeze everything and prevent adjustments for fluctuating demand. Instead, Mr. Lamesch suggested bilateral agreements with third world countries, saying that such agreements could easily be altered to account for changes in demand. **********''Countries like Korea and Brazil could have shipped larger quantities but have held back for fear of unfair- trade suits and other protectionist actions by the U.S.,'' Mr. Lamesch said. In addition, he said that when dumping suits were brought against Brazil, he cut back his imports from there because he feared they would be slapped with 50 percent duties if Brazil were found guilty. This, he said, has caused him to rely more on other developing countries. **********Price Is Biggest Sales Factor **********''A buyer's first choice will always be a domestic source,'' Mr. Lamesch explained, ''provided he can get it at the right quality and the right price.'' He added that ''the most determinative element is almost always price.'' **********In Europe, flat-rolled steel made for automobiles often sells for $320 a ton, compared with a $563 list price for domestically produced flat-rolled steel. And, analysts say, Brazil and South Korea produce steel even more cheaply than the Europeans. **********With transportation costing $30 a ton and tariffs another $20 a ton, and the dollar recently at record highs, it is little wonder that steel imports have gone from a toehold to what domestic steelmakers say is a stranglehold on the market. **********''If the price differential between domestic and imported steel is larger than 5 percent, then people look to foreign steel,'' said Mr. Lamesch. His customers include construction companies, appliance makers and steel service centers that process the metal for other users. **********Imports $100 a Ton Cheaper **********''The delivered price is at least $100 a ton cheaper when I buy from abroad,'' said one of his customers, William P. Helm, president of Riverside Steel Construction, a California- based concern that fabricates steel frames for skyscrapers. **********Mr. Helm, who buys 75 percent of his steel from abroad, added, ''If we were n't buying imports, we couldn't remain competitive because everyone else is buying imports.'' **********The lower price of imports has meant that domestic producers, who once religiously observed their list prices, are discounting as much as 30 percent from list to compete. This discounting, they say, is one reason for their cascading losses. **********According to Mr. Lamesch, domestic steelmakers have unwittingly brought their problems upon themselves. When steelmakers won a no- strike clause in 1960 to prevent walkouts by the United Steelworkers of America, they gave a generous wage package in exchange. These high wages, Mr. Lamesch asserted, have gone far to make the industry uncompetitive. **********Trigger-Price System Blamed **********Then, Mr. Lamesch said, the trigger-price mechanism that the industry got Washington to institute in 1978 discriminated against European steelmakers and forced him to look for the first time to the third world for steel. That mechanism sets minimum prices below which imported steel cannot be sold in the United States without initiating an investigation by the Government. If it is determined that the steel has been sold at unfairly low prices, bonds and antidumping duties can be imposed on the products. **********And in 1982, when Washington got the European Economic Community and Japan to cut back shipments to the United States, resourceful importers like Mr. Lamesch responded by relying even more on third world sources. **********''If the government puts up a barricade, traders are smart enough to find new ways to get around it.'' he said, almost boastfully. ''My business is to serve my customers, and that means I have to obtain steel at the best price I can.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/31/business/briefs-164319.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 315, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " ***********  Abbott Laboratories , a maker of hospital and laboratory products based in North Chicago, Ill., said Burroughs Wellcome Co., a drug and pharmaceutical concern in Research Triangle Park, N.C., had agreed to market its line of injectable drugs. ***********  Carter-Day Industries of Minneapolis said it had acquired Micro Tech International, which produces automated computerized systems for the materials-handling industries. **********Terms were not disclosed. ***********  Data Access Systems Inc. , a distributor of personal computers based in Blackwood, N.J., said its plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code had been confirmed by a Federal court. ***********  Florida Commerical Banks Inc. , a bank holding company based in Miami, said it had recommended to shareholders that they reject Hugh F.

Weinberger to make public the Pentagon's plans for military construction and exercises in Costa Rica this year. **********Mr. Sasser and Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, both Democrats, expressed concern that the Administration's efforts to promote exercises by 1,000 United States military engineers in Costa Rica and increase arms sales to that country were intended to shift the country away from political neutrality to closer alignment with the United States against Nicaragua. **********In a letter to Mr. Weinberger drafted May 4, Senator Sasser said he had been told that in late March the United States Ambassador, Curtin Winsor Jr., had ''secured an agreement with Costa Rican officials to permit U.S. military engineers to participate in construction projects in the northern zone as well as in southern Costa Rica.'' He asked to see the agreement and information on what arrangements were made to assure the security of United States forces. **********Information on Accords Sought Mr. Sasser, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, asked Mr. Weinberger whether the United States already had ''an airfield access agreement'' with Costa Rica as well as plans to improve and use Costa Rican airports ''for contingencies,'' as the Administration has planned to do in Honduras. **********The Tennessee Democrat, voicing support for Costa Rica's declared neutrality and policy of avoiding a military buildup, said he was particularly disturbed by the American reaction to reported clashes between Nicaraguan Army troops and Costa Rican forces in border regions used by Nicaraguan rebels, who receive money from the Central Intelligence Agency. **********An internal State Department report written on May 5 advocated using Costa Rica's request last week for $7.5 million in emergency military supplies, mainly light arms, as an opening to shift Costa Rica from its ''neutralist tightrope act and push it more explicitly and publicly into the anti-Sandinista camp.'' Administration spokesmen have dismissed this as the work of ''low-level officials'' and said it did not reflect Administration policy. **********In the last 10 months, the United States Southern Command in Panama and Ambassador Winsor have sought Costa Rica's agreement for Army engineers to build more than 100 miles of roads and improve civilian airports at Upala in the north, near the border with Nicaragua, and in the south, near San Isidro.   Reports on Exercises Differ **********Earlier this spring, President Luis Alberto Monge announced that some United States military construction exercises would take place in the southern zone, but they were later called off.  Last week Mr. Weinberger told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Pentagon had received the ''permission and approval'' of Costa Rica for the exercises. But Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said arrangements were still being worked out. **********On Friday a Pentagon information officer, Lieut. Col. Richard E. Lake, said that National Guard units were ''planning an exercise down there sometime this summer, but not all the details have been worked out.'' **********The Administration has been divided on how forcefully to prod Costa Rica toward military cooperation. Some officials, especially in the Pentagon and the embassy in Costa Rica, were said to be eager to move rapidly. Others, sensitive to political differences in the Costa Rican Government, have advocated moving more gradually. **********American diplomats say the trend of attitudes in Costa Rica over the last year or so has been toward ''greater receptivity'' to military cooperation with the United States.

Although ''this is the time of the business cycle when interest rates increase'' Mr. Gross estimated that the Fed would supply enough credit to the banking system so that the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market would average 10 1/2 percent. **********Because of recent statistics showing that economic growth is slowing and with the unresolved problems of bank loans to less developed countries, many analyts have said the Federal Reserve would be very unwilling to foster higher interest rates. Growth of the basic M-1 money supply measure, which has accelerated sharply in recent weeks, raised fears that the Fed might soon encourage higher rates despite its other concerns. **********But after the announcement of the $2.4 billion drop in money supply rather than a $500 million increase that was widely expected, Allen Sinai, an economist at Shearson Lehman/American Express said, ''The decline likely has removed the only possible reason for a tighter Fed policy.'' **********M-1 Below '84 Objective **********The $541.9 billion level of M-1 for the week of May 28 places the closly watched money supply measure about $3.3 billion below the upper limit of the Fed's 1984 growth objective of 4 percent to 8 percent. M-1 consists of currency plus all kinds of checking accounts at banks and thrifts. **********While economists said the drop in money supply and business borrowing would seem to reduce, for now, the upward pressure on interest rates, activity in the long-term bond market seemed to be divorced from fundamental developments in the economy and money supply. **********Traders were amazed at the volatility of bond prices, with the 13 1/4 percent Treasury issue due in 2014 rising from about 98 1/2 half an hour before the Fed's announcement, to a peak price of 99 3/4 soon after the announcement. By the time trading subsided, the bellwether issue was offered at 98 26/32, up 1/2 point, to yield 13.41 percent, and well above the morning's low trade of about 97 5/8 to yield 13.58 percent. **********''This volatile trading in the long bond is exactly why you see so little participation in that market by professional managers of large pools of money,'' said Robert Shomaker, national sales manager at Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. Other analysts said the erratic price movements showed the eagerness of specualtors to take profits quickly because they worry that the fundamental direction of bond prices is lower so long as the economy continues to expand. **********The average rate for new one-year Treasury bills at the 1 P.M. auction was 10.92 percent, up from 10.64 percent at a similar sale on May 15 and 9.86 percent at the April 12 auction. The average rate was the highest since August 1982. **********Before the money supply announcement, some analysts were worried that an overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market was high enough to indicate that the central bank was trying to encourage higher short-term interest rates by making bank reserves scarcer. **********Other analysts brushed off the overnight rate, which averaged about 11 percent for the second consecutive day, as a temporary development caused by short-lived seasonal forces, not Fed policy. **********Reserve data published by the Fed for the two-week bank accounting period ended Wednesday were hard to interpret because analysts did not know how much in reserves Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust was borrowing. Excluding special extended loans, financial institutions borrowed an average of $3.054 billion from the Fed, while maintaining excess reserve balances of $581 million. The result was a net borrowed reserve position of $2.473 billion, compared with net borrowed reserves of $3.528 billion in the May 23 period. **********The outlook for stable interest rates, or at least less upward pressure on rates, was further enhanced, analysts said, by data showing that business loans outstanding at 10 large New York City banks fell by $260 million, excluding bankers acceptances. Since Dec. 28, such loans on the books at those banks have increased by more than $4.7 billion, to $62.248 billion. **********Commercial paper outstanding fell by $722 million, after rising more than $6.8 billion in the previous two weeks.

Together, the United States and Israel do about $3 billion in trade a year. **********The Administration is pressing for similar authority to bring Canada into a free trade zone as well. **********What it means is that virtually all exchanges would be free of tariffs and that nontariff barriers such as quotas, restrictive licenses and other discriminatory practices would be substantially reduced. **********It's a new idea in American trade policy, but European countries have been pursuing it for years. A sharp expansion in intra-European trade has resulted. Supporters expect similar benefits to flow to North America and Israel. **********A newly published study by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobby, predicts substantial net gains for both sides - possibly even more for the United States than for Israel. **********The United States now has about 20 percent of the Israeli import market. Should this decline to 10 percent, some 20,000 export-related jobs would be lost. An increase in the American market share to 40 percent would generate an additional 40,000 jobs in the United States, the study says. **********A threat to American-Israeli trade now arises from a tariff-cutting agreement that Israel has already signed with the European Common Market, warns the study's author, Peggy Blair, a former Washington international trade reporter. **********A free trade agreement would get American exporters under Israel's tariff walls. The average tariff there is 10 percent, and some categories of goods are substantially higher.

If some member does object, the matter will be put over until Wednesday. **********The House, which is expected to approve the measure overwhelmingly, had been insisting that the Senate act first, but the House leadership finally got tired of waiting. The scenario now calls for the House to pass the bill and send it over to the Senate, where the majority leader, Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, will ''hold it at the desk.'' This will permit the Senate to vote on it without first referring it to the appropriate committee. **********The tobacco lobby is not objecting to the bill because it fears that rejection of it would lead to even stronger health warnings. As a result, Republican Senator Jesse A. Helms, who is strongly protective of the tobacco industry in his state of North Carolina, is not expected to try to block the bill. **********The present warning - ''the Surgeon General has determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health'' - is believed to have lost its impact through repetition. The new warning would say that smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease and emphysema and may complicate pregnancy. **********Debate on Powerful Dollar **********Only when people can make more money investing in Europe and Japan than in the United States will the dollar stop rising in world currency markets.

Feldstein, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, that the dollar's strength reflects the American budget deficit's upward pressure on interest rates. **********This view is shared by a number of European government officials as well but has been challenged repeatedly by the United States Treasury. **********''The argument that it is just the budget deficit is certainly one-sided and inadequate,'' said Mr. van Lennep, a former Dutch Treasury official, in a conversation with a few reporters. **********''I think we should see exchange rates in the context of a dynamic economy,'' he commented, noting that ''maybe the key to when the dollar will decline is when Europe and Japan become more profitable.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/30/world/editor-angers-fellow-sinhalese-in-sri-lanka.html": {"writer_name": "Sanjoy Hazarika", "pub_date": "1984-08-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 649, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EDITOR ANGERS FELLOW SINHALESE IN SRI LANKA", "print_headline": "EDITOR ANGERS FELLOW SINHALESE IN SRI LANKA", "body_text": " **********A story about Gamani Navaratna going the rounds of this capital of the Tamil-dominated Northern Province goes like this: **********An army officer, a member of the country's Sinhalese majority, telephoned Mr. Navaratna, also a Sinhalese, and asked, ''Are you a Tamil or a Sinhalese?'' **********Mr. Navaratna, a spare, wiry man who edits the city's only English-language newspaper, The Saturday Review, replied, ''I am a Sri Lankan.'' The army officer is said to have angrily slammed down the phone. **********His anger was apparently touched off by the fact that the editor had taken a rare stand, unpopular among Sinhalese, by reporting on what have been described as assaults by Sri Lanka troops on Tamil civilians and property. He also criticized the Government of President J. R. Jayewardene and strongly defended the movement for Tamil rights in the region. **********Subjected to Censorship **********''I am fighting for a cause,'' the 52- year-old editor said. ''I am for press freedom and human rights.'' He said he had to submit every report that he wanted to publish to a censor in Jaffna. Often there are severe cuts, he said. **********Mr. Navaratna is among a handful of Sinhalese who live in Jaffna, a city situated on a sand spit between two stretches of sea. More than 750,000 Tamils live in the Northern Province, which is drier and harsher than the lushly forested other regions of Sri Lanka. **********The Saturday Review is owned by a Tamil, and Mr. Navaratna took over as editor soon after its founding in 1982. Originally, he said in an interview in his high-ceilinged office, he often traveled between here and Colombo, the capital, where his family lives. But he has remained in Jaffna for nearly three weeks, through the spasm of violence that has rocked the area. **********''I have been called a traitor by my own people,'' he said.

Nalin Senaviratne, nor President Jayewardene could control their troops. ''I have no hopes of a solution to this problem,'' he said. ''The more civilians they harass and kill, the more tigers they create.'' **********What Tamils and their supporters describe as army atrocities have sharpened the ethnic and other differences between Tamils and Sinhalese. **********The differences go back nearly 1,000 years to the time when Tamil kings of southern India first invaded the island. The traditional rivalry was fueled when the British brought in thousands of Tamil laborers from India to work their sprawling tea and rubber plantations, work disdained by the Sinhalese.   Higher Economic Status **********The Tamils also made good use of the English language to acquire an economic status that far outweighed their numbers. Relations soured further, in the Tamil view, after independence in 1948 as successive governments led by Sinhalese sought to undercut their powerful role. **********They made Sinhala the national language and cast English aside. Then Buddhism was made the state religion - most Sinhalese are Buddhists, most Tamils Hindu - and the Government ruled that Tamil students must score higher qualifying marks than Sinhalese to qualify for universities. **********During rioting last year, Sinhalese mobs rampaged through Tamil areas of Colombo, burning, beating and killing. Today many of the Tamil shops there have reopened but the fear remains.

Those reservations were overcome when Iraq agreed to order about $100 million worth of American steel pipe, which was not part of the original proposal, Administration officials said. **********The episode shows the role that steel politics is playing this election year. ''You can bet this order is going to be played hard up and down the steel country,'' one Reagan official said. **********''That's a very substantial piece of business,'' a steel executive commented. It represents about 10 percent of last year's total steel exports. **********President Reagan has been under mounting pressure to give the steel industry further protection against imports this year, particularly after such protection was recommended last week by the United States International Trade Commission. **********The Iraq deal is the first one in years that includes American steel pipe in an overseas pipeline. The United States usually provides most of the pumps, compressors and turbines for the overseas projects. **********Iraq's willingness to buy American steel rather than cheaper steel from West Germany, Japan, or third world exporters was taken as an indication of its desire for a stronger American participation in the project. One Administration official close to the negotiations suggested that the Iraqis sensed the deal might not go through otherwise. **********Iraq had approached the London subsidiary of Bechtel Group Inc. last spring.

Shultz before he came to Washington. Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger was vice president and general counsel for Bechtel before coming to the Pentagon. **********Bank Board's Decision **********After a long period of resistance, the board of the Ex-Im Bank voted on June 19 to guarantee 85 percent of $500 million worth of commercial loans to cover American supplies for the pipeline. The remaining $500 million is expected to come from European sources. **********The Ex-Im Bank provides direct credits and credit guarantees for overseas purchasers of American products where there is, in the words of its charter, ''a reasonable assurance of repayment.''

Plans are to have 500,000 barrels daily flowing within 18 months and to have the line completed in two years. **********'Top Priority' for Iraq **********Bechtel said it expects to wind up negotiations with Iraq in London in the next few weeks and begin construction later this summer. **********''It's a top priority item for Iraq,'' said Al Donner, a spokesman for Bechtel. ''We're going to be under a tight schedule.'' **********He added, ''We have gone out and talked to all the leading U.S. suppliers for this type of job, and bids have come in from quite a number of them.'' **********While confirming that substantial quantities of steel were involved, Mr. Donner declined to name any possible steel companies with whom Bechtel is negotiating. **********The leading domestic makers of steel pipe are the United States Steel Corporation, the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the LTV Corporation, the Lone Star Steel Company and Armco Inc. **********The State Department, Commerce Department and United States trade representative all strongly backed the pipeline project. **********A State Department spokesman said, ''the more oil available on the market, the better it is for the West.''

In 1981, Israel bombed an Iraqi nuclear reactor. **********In its course south to the Gulf of Aqaba, the 42-inch pipeline would run only a few miles from the Israeli border. **********Iraq's motives, the Brookings analyst added, are also to promote a ''better, or at least less hostile, relationship with the United States.'' **********The war has sharply cut Iraq's oil exports, which had averaged three million barrels a day in the late 1970's. **********Iran knocked out two Iraqi offshore loading terminals in 1980, and in 1982 pressured Syria to close its pipeline for Iraqi oil. **********Iraq now ships about one million barrels a day through a pipeline across Turkey to the Mediterranean and by truck through Turkey and Jordan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/06/world/chinese-city-finds-its-past-is-worth-saving.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1984-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 649, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHINESE CITY FINDS ITS PAST IS WORTH SAVING", "print_headline": "CHINESE CITY FINDS ITS PAST IS WORTH SAVING", "body_text": " **********During the Ming dynasty six centuries ago, the ancient city of Xian threw up massive earthen ramparts to protect itself from invaders. **********Founded in the 11th century B.C., the city served as capital of 11 dynasties and grew larger than ancient Rome. But its prestige as the gateway to the old Silk Road declined after the Tang dynasty, when subsequent emperors made their capitals elsewhere. **********New walls were built from 1374 to 1378. In 1568 they were faced with gray brick, and the fortifications grew more intricate. Double towers rose above the four major gates. A moat was dug and deepened. **********For all such defenses, the eastern gate was breached by new conquerors. The wall deteriorated, despite repairs made during the Qing dynasty in 1781. Now a new effort is under way to restore the 8.5 miles of walls to their original 40-feet-high splendor. **********The project has attracted national interest because only Xian, of China's six historical capitals, kept its walls basically intact. Peking and other cities tore down their walls to make way for modern boulevards and buildings after the Communists seized power in 1949. The restoration reflects a belated concern over the architectural treasures sacrificed for such urban progress. **********Although the Government declared Xian's walls a protected historic site in 1961, no steps were taken for 12 years, said Zhang Jingfei, the project engineer, who is deputy director of Xian's City Wall Construction Commission. **********''Because of the wall's terrible condition, we realized that something had to be done,'' he said. **********The wall was honeycombed with almost 1,200 miles of tunnels and holes dug by residents when the Japanese bombed Xian in 1937 and 1938. More recently, some of the heavy bricks were pilfered for building materials. When repairs got under way in April 1983, about 200,000 square feet of brick facing was missing or damaged and part of the wall's earthen core had collapsed. **********Mr. Zhang conceded that the work had not gone easily. **********For example, the original earth had become so compacted over the centuries that new material added as filler would not bind, and crumbled away. **********''You just cannot do it in one small spot like patching clothes,'' Mr. Zhang said. **********The dredging of the surrounding moat has had a more practical purpose. Over the years, factories dumped waste into it and residents added garbage, so that sections almost disappeared. This blocked the drainage of the heavy rains that whip Xian every summer. The northeastern neighborhoods were flooded when the moat overflowed in 1981 and 1982. **********''So we decided to rebuild the moats, too, while we were rebuilding the walls,'' Mr. Zhang said. **********To defray the cost of restoration, which he estimated at nearly $40 million, each of Xian's citizens has been urged to donate several days of labor. Mr. Zhang estimated that volunteers were doing up to 80 percent of the work. **********Enough has already been done to let residents promenade along the 40-foot- wide brick top. The plan is to complete the wall by the end of next year and then start working on the towers. **********Xian's preservationists have lost a battle, too. Even as the restoration of the city wall got under way last year, officials in the provincial bureaucracy ordered another 14th-century gate of the old city within Xian knocked down to make way for housing. **********The city's Bureau of Cultural Relics appealed to Peking, which sent down a restraining order. It was ignored while bulldozers worked for a week from 6 A.M. until midnight to raze the gate. **********Afterward, Gov.

Fewer still have acid rain's ability to wreak widespread economic and environmental damage. And no problem is as much in need of immediate action. **********More than 10 years ago researchers began to document acid rain's effects in the lakes in the Adirondack Mountains and warned of potential adverse impacts. Today, hundreds of lakes in New England, the Upper Middle West, the Mountain states and the Southeast that once teemed with fish have been stilled by acidification. **********And acid rain is damaging more than just lakes. Forests are showing signs of a precipitous decline throughout large parts of the Eastern United States. Spruce and fir stands in many areas are now littered with dead or dying trees. Growth of many economically important pine species, including the loblolly pine vital to the economies of several Southern states, has declined dramatically. Not surprisingly, trees are also being damaged in the Middle West, especially in the heavily-polluting Ohio River Basin, where much of the acid rain in the Eastern United States originates. **********Our nation's forest damage is not unique. In West Germany, pollution has injured an estimated 34 percent of that nation's trees. **********Enormous economic implications accompany such extensive damage. Reduced forest yields will have a direct impact on the $49 billion-a-year forestry and forest products industry. And as might be expected, investment analysts are becoming apprehensive. In a recent report, Standard & Poor's warned that acid rain presents a clear danger to the forest products industry and cautioned that ''if acid rain kills an appreciable number of trees on the millions of acres owned by the forest products companies, the companies' stock prices will die faster than the trees.'' **********The economic costs involve more than just damaged forests. Our nation's fishing, recreation and tourism industries will face an unprecedented assault on their vitality. **********Moreover, the health consequences of acid rain are especially staggering. A recent Office of Technology assessment estimates that these pollutants may be responsible for 50,000 premature deaths a year. **********Despite acid rain's adverse health, economic and environmental consequences, President Reagan has joined with Middle Western coal companies and utilities in opposing any control program at the present time. Although the President originally argued that there was no acid rain problem, his Administration now asserts that it exists but is so complex and poorly understood that scientists cannot agree on a solution. **********But this position ignores the scientific consensus that has emerged through thousands of acid rain studies. When objective expert panels have been assembled to evaluate the problem, they have reached the same conclusion: If we do not act now to reduce the sulfur and nitrogen oxide pollutants that cause acid rain, we risk widespread, irreversible damage to the ecosystems upon which our economy and well-being depend. **********Our nation's most prestigious scientific organization, the National Academy of Sciences, has unambiguously recommended a ''prompt tightening of restrictions on atmospheric emissions.'' Even President Reagan's own handpicked panel of scientists affirmed the academy's call for control action. But the Administration suppressed the advisers' report last spring, while actively opposing Congressional efforts to enact a control program. **********IN opposing legislation, the Administration argued that acid rain **********controls would unfairly penalize some states and favor one region of the country over another. In fact, just the opposite is true. The Administration's ''do nothing'' policy is environmentally and economically unfair to states with strong control programs, and favors polluting states that for over a decade have fought pollution reduction requirements. It is a policy that gives short-sighted protection to the profits of a narrow sector - the utilities and coal companies - at the expense of immense long-term economic and environmental costs. The refusal of coal and utility companies to act reasonably should not be allowed to threaten our health, environment and economy. **********Legislation has already been drafted that would achieve significant reductions without causing Midwestern unemployment or expensive utility rate increases. According to the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, a 10-million-ton sulfur dioxide reduction program, relying upon pollution control technologies that would protect the jobs of coalminers by institutionalizing the use of high sulfur coals, could be paid for with an average increase in electricity rates in the 48 states of only 3 percent.

''One is steady and sustained development of our friendly relations and cooperation.'' The other, he said, is ''stagnation of our relations at the present level with frequent frictions and even setbacks.'' **********''To be frank,'' Mr. Zhao said, ''the Taiwan question is the main obstacle to the growth of Sino-U.S. relations.'' **********Mr. Zhao's remarks came at a luncheon at the Hilton Hotel in Manhattan that was jointly sponsored by the Foreign Policy Association and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations. The Chinese Prime Minister's prepared text, which was read in English by an interpreter, was almost entirely devoted to the Taiwan issue and drew attention to the importance China attaches to its goal of reuniting the island with the mainland. **********The Chinese Prime Minister did not refer in so many words to what has been China's principal grievance against the United States, which is the continued sales of arms to the island's effective authority, the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party. But Mr. Zhao's remarks seemed intended to convey the impression that only by agreeing to stop the arms sales can the two sides ''dispel the clouds hanging over Sino- U.S. relations.'' **********Earlier yesterday, during an interview with editors of The New York Times, Prime Minister Zhao said he hoped President Reagan's visit to China, which is scheduled for this April, would lead to a loosening of trade restrictions, particularly on China's imports of American technology. Mr. Zhao expressed satisfaction that the Reagan Administration has already decided to liberalize some of its policies on technology transfer to China, but he added that there were ''still many obstacles'' to be overcome. **********In the interview, Mr. Zhao answered questions about possible Chinese arms purchases from the United States and gave his views of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. **********Mr. Zhao said that China would buy what arms it needed and could afford, but that the amounts of Chinese purchases were not likely to be large. ''We cannot use lots of money to buy foreign weapons,'' Mr. Zhao said, adding that his country's first priority was economic development for its own people. **********In his speech yesterday, Mr. Zhao reiterated the main points of Chinese policy on Taiwan, which, in essence, is to guarantee in advance to the Kuomintang that under any reunification agreement, Taiwan's way of life and economic system would remain intact. **********''The existing party, Government and military setups in Taiwan can also remain unchanged,'' Mr. Zhao said. **********''I believe everybody will agree,'' he said, ''that on these reasonable terms it will not be difficult to bring about China's peaceful reunification if there is no foreign interference.'' While stressing the mainland's desire to solve the issue by peaceful means, Mr. Zhao explicitly refused to rule out the eventual use of force. **********''We are seeking a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question in good faith,'' Mr. Zhao said. ''But we cannot make a commitment to any foreign country that only peaceful means will be used in solving the Taiwan issue, because this is China's internal affair and within China's sovereign rights.''  Taiwan Arms Sales **********In his interview with The Times, Mr. Zhao said the three communiques issued by the two countries since 1972 that spoke of Taiwan's status as a part of China should be ''earnestly implemented.'' **********The Chinese Prime Minister attached particular importance to the agreement of Aug. 17, 1982, in which the United States agreed that its arms sales to Taiwan would not increase in amount or quality. **********Present at the meeting, which was held at the Plaza Hotel, where Mr. Zhao has been staying, were Seymour Topping, managing editor; Warren Hoge, foreign editor, and Karl E. Meyer, a member of the editorial board. **********These were among the other points made by Mr. Zhao in the interview: **********- On nuclear proliferation, he said that China's policy is ''not to support or encourage'' other countries' efforts to develop nuclear weapons. ''China has undertaken this commitment,'' he said. China which has developed nuclear weapons and missile delivery systems. **********- On the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Mr. Zhao said he doubted that a Soviet withdrawal was possible at present. He said, referring to the chances for a change in Soviet policy, ''Only when the Soviets change their strategy of driving southward, and when internal economic difficulties force a change, will there be one.'' **********- On the Sino-Soviet border dispute, he affirmed China's belief that, since the so-called unequal treaties concluded in czarist times, the Russians have occupied large areas of Chinese territory. ''Unequal treaties are unequal treaties,'' he said, ''and we should say so.''  Repeatedly Draws Applause **********Mr. Zhao, who appeared relaxed and confident in his public appearance today, repeatedly drew applause and laughter from his audience of 1,800 business and civic leaders, scholars, and journalists, particularly as he fielded questions after his prepared speech had been read. **********On Hong Kong, Mr. Zhao repeated declarations that China intends to re- establish its sovereignty over the territory, now a colony of Britain, when the lease expires in 1997. China and Britain have been holding a series of talks on the future of Hong Kong after expiration of the lease. **********Mr. Zhao repeated three basic assurances regarding Hong Kong's future under Chinese jurisdiction; he said that Hong Kong would remain capitalist, that it would be governed by ''the people of Hong Kong,'' not by Peking, and that these policies would remain unchanged for at least 50 years after the restoration of Chinese sovereignty. **********At one point, Mr. Zhao was asked whether his first appearance in 1982 in a Western-style suit, rather than the more traditional Chinese-style high- collared tunic, was a personal choice or a signal of ideological relaxation. It was both, Mr. Zhao replied. **********One of the two sponsoring organizations of Mr. Zhao's appearance, the Foreign Policy Association, is this year celebrating the 30th anniversary of its ''great decisions'' program, a compilation into book form of discussions of various topics by some 200,000 people across the country. This year's topic was the state of Chinese-American relations five years after their formal establishment. **********Zhao Arrives in Ottawa **********OTTAWA, Jan. 16 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang, the highest-ranking Chinese leader ever to come to Canada, arrived in Ottawa tonight for a week-long visit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/08/world/around-the-world-255289.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 133, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;", "body_text": " **********Six masked gunmen stole 220 pounds of gold, worth more than $1 million, from a metal refinery today after holding the refinery director, his family and two other people hostage for five hours, the police said. **********The police said they believed the robbers were professionals who may have had informers inside the refinery. **********The thieves waited outside the home of Michel Rey-Coquais, the refinery director, and grabbed his 17-year-old daughter and two friends as they returned from a party. **********Two of the gunmen remained with the family while the other four took Mr. Rey-Coquais to the plant. **********The thieves, given the codes to the alarm system, opened four safes containing 220 pounds of gold in the form of chains, wires and plaques."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/10/business/ibm-settles-secrets-suit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.B.M.

He said he could assure the United States that Kuwait was not seeking the missiles ''to declare war'' against Israel. **********Kuwait asked for the missiles about the same time the Saudis received theirs at the end of May. President Reagan ordered the sale of 400 Stingers to the Saudis at that time through his emergency authority without waiting for the 30-day waiting period in Congress. This touched off strong opposition from some members of Congress.   Relations Have Been Strained **********Relations with Kuwait have been contentious in recent years, with the Kuwaitis rejecting a proposed United States Ambassador to Kuwait, Brandon H. Grove Jr., because he had served as head of the consulate in East Jerusalem. Even though that consulate reports directly to Washington, the Kuwaitis said that if they accepted Mr. Grove it would signify acceptance of Israeli annexation of that part of Jerusalem. **********The State Department felt that if Stingers were provided to Kuwait, this would touch off a major confrontation with Congress that could undercut the Administration's efforts to improve its relations with friendly Arab nations. **********The message sent to the Kuwaitis was couched in ''euphemistic, diplomatic language,'' one official said. He said it explained that there was political opposition to the sale and that the United States did not believe it was in the interests of either Kuwait or the United States for there to be a political dispute at this time over the missile question. **********'No Final Decision' **********This afternoon, the State Department sought to treat the rejection of the Kuwaiti request for Stingers in a gentle fashion. John Hughes, the department spokesman, said that although ''we don't contemplate a sale at this time'' of the Stingers, ''no final decision has been made.'' **********He said that as a result of a recent survey of Kuwait's defense needs, ''we are looking at more immediate and effective ways of improving their air defense.'' **********''Our willingness to offer improvements in their defenses demonstrates our concern over the security situation in the gulf and our policy of support for the self-defense efforts of the gulf states,'' Mr. Hughes said. **********Department officials said the Kuwaitis were being advised to improve their radar and to ask for additional emplaced antiaircraft missiles and guns, rather than for the Stingers, which have become an issue with Congress.  Moreover, officials said, there are only limited amounts of Stingers available for sale to foreign countries. **********Concern Over Terrorists **********The concern of members of Congress about the Stingers in connection with Kuwait is that they could fall into the hands of terrorists and then be used against civilian aircraft. There are large numbers of Palestinians in Kuwait, and some members of Congress have charged that security was not good enough in Kuwait to warrant the risk of the loss of the missiles. **********In another matter, State Department officials said the United States was planning to send William L.

''As a New Jersey resident working in New York I'm not clear as to the necessity of paying a New Jersey income tax when my income is virtually derived entirely from New York sources,'' he said. ''I am paying local school taxes, property taxes, sales taxes on purchases within the state and high commuter fares on New Jersey transit. Even though New Jersey gives credit for taxes paid to other localities, it seems inherent in the system that New Jersey assumes that all income not taxed by New York must be taxed by New Jersey.'' **********Similar complaints can be heard at cocktail parties and on commuter trains throughout the tri-state area. Sometimes people move out of the city or to a different suburb - or find jobs in the suburbs - in part to lessen the tax bite. And people newly assigned to work in the metropolitan area are often in a quandary as they try to decide where to establish a home, partly because of the often conflicting advice given by friends or colleagues about which area has the most favorable tax structure. **********Are the tax variables in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut indeed sizable enough to outweigh the simple ''because I like it'' method of selecting a home? The final answer may well be subjective, but to help quantify it William Katz, a partner in the accounting firm of Ernst & Whinney, computed the tax liabilities of three couples who work in New York City and live outside it and three who live and work in the suburbs, compared with a couple who live and work in the City. **********Each family has an earned income of $80,000 plus $5,000 in unearned income from such sources as stocks and bonds and two children at home who are old enough to take care of themselves. To simplify comparisons, none of them takes any itemized deductions, except for state and local taxes where applicable. They live in apartments so they do not have real estate and mortgage interest deductions.  The heaviest tax burden, he found, falls on those living and working in New York City. The city couple would pay $21,162 in Federal income tax and $9,708 in state and local taxes, or a total of $30,870 for 1983. Their higher tax liability is attributable primarily to the higher city income tax paid by residents, which starts at 9/10 of one percent and rises to a maximum of 4.3 percent. **********''The one person made extremely happy by my tax situation is my accountant,'' said Davia Temin, a vice president of a New York bank and a city dweller, calling him very appreciative of ''all the revenue he earns from the complicated paperwork. **********''Our rates are high, but the services I get are very important,'' she added, evidently accepting the tax burden as an inevitable quid pro quo for all that the city has to offer. **********Not everyone feels this way. Indeed, many prefer suburban homes, schools and recreational facilities. **********The first suburban family Mr. Katz studied lives in New Jersey, which levies a gross income tax. Many New Jersey residents object strenuously to this tax. Mr. Mangold, for example, deplores the fact that items like contributions to an I.R.A. and interest paid on loans and mortgages are not deductible items for New Jersey's income tax; nor are real estate taxes. However, homeowners get a credit of less than $100 a year - a sop provided to angry taxpayers when the state adopted its first income tax in 1976. **********In New Jersey, the tax on adjusted gross income starts at 2 percent up to $20,000 and rises to 3.5 percent on adjusted gross income above $50,000. With the exception of taxes paid to other jurisdictions, few deductions are permitted. **********Family number two lives in Connecticut, one of 10 states that has no earned income tax. Connecticut does, however, have a tax on unearned income from dividends, interest and capital gains, which goes as high as 13 percent, depending on income level. The other nine states without income taxes are Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. **********The third family lives in Westchester County, in New York State, which has one of the highest state income tax rates in the nation, rising to 14 percent in the top brackets. **********All three families have to pay income tax to both New York State and New York City, and the couples from Connecticut and New Jersey also have to pay taxes to their own states. **********The New Jersey family is permitted to take a deduction on its New Jersey tax form for the taxes paid to New York State and city, and most of what is owed to New Jersey is tax on the unearned portion of the family income. **********In addition to the tax they pay to New York, the Connecticut couple must pay tax only on the $5,000 of unearned income, or about $600, since their own state has no income tax. **********The Westchester couple has only to pay taxes to New York State and to the city, but their resulting tax is slightly higher than that for out-of-state commuters. **********Mr. Katz of Ernst & Whinney found that, after all the figures have been considered, the New Jersey residents fare slightly better than the other two. **********The total tax bill for each commuting family, including Federal, state and city, works out this way: $29,157 for the New Jersey couple; $29,419 for the Connecticut couple and $29,458 for the New York State couple - a difference of about $300. **********''That's not enough to encourage a couple to move from one of the states to another,'' Mr. Katz said. **********The tax obligations can be broken down as follows: The couple in New Jersey will pay $6,655 in state and local taxes; the Connecticut family will pay $7,124, and the Westchester residents will pay $7,193 total in state and local - as would residents of Nassau, Suffolk, Rockland or elsewhere in New York State outside the city. In all of these cases, the major part of their state and local tax liability is to New York State because the three couples work within New York state and earn about 94 percent of their income in New York. **********The reason that the New Jersey couple fare a little better is that the highest tax bracket on adjusted gross income of all types is 3.5 percent. Connecticut's top rate on the unearned taxable income involves a sliding scale rising to 13 percent, while in New York the highest rate for income taxes reaches 14 percent. **********One might expect that all three families would owe the same amount of Federal income tax. But since state and city taxes can be deducted on the Federal tax form, and these are different in each case, the final amounts differ. The Federal tax payable will be $22,502 for the New Jersey family, $22,295 for the Connecticut family, and $22,265 for the Westchester family. These figures are based on taxes in effect for 1983. **********Although Mr. Katz considered the few hundred dollars difference in the example hardly worth worrying about, there are some cases in which the choice of state can be important, he said. **********Mr. Katz recalled the instance of a New York businessman who sought tax advice some years ago. He had decided to sell his business and would therefore be liable for a large capital gains tax to be paid not only to the Federal Government, but also to New York State. His accountants calculated that the tax bite would be almost $500,000 more if he stayed in New York State than if he became a resident of either New Jersey or Connecticut. **********''We figured out the man was better off in either of the other two states, and so he chose New Jersey. But after several weeks of commuting, he telephoned us and said that he did not like the train ride and missed the social life in New York and he planned to move back to the city even though he would lose about $500,000,'' said Mr. Katz. **********Although the differences are relatively small for the three sample commuting families, if the husband and wife both work within the state of residence, the situation changes dramatically. **********Many Connecticut residents fare better by working within their home state, where there are no state taxes on earned income - although the lack of a deduction for state income tax raises their Federal levy a bit. The couple in this sample would have to pay $600 to Connecticut on the unearned $5,000, plus Federal income tax of $23,934, for a total of $24,534. **********''Everyone knows Connecticut is a wonderful place to live, but an undoubted lure is the favorable tax base.'' said Alma McArdle, who heads her own real estate brokerage firm, Alma McArdle Associates, in Madison, Conn. Many high-earners who need to live near metropolitan New York find Connecticut residency ''the answer,'' she added. **********''The tax situation seems to attract a growing number of large companies,'' she said, naming the Bristol-Myers Company as one of the most recent to move out of New York City. **********The Connecticut tax total contrasts pleasantly with the $26,169 that the New Jersey residents working in New Jersey would have to pay - $23,934 to the Federal Government and $2,235 to New Jersey. **********In contrast, the couple living in Westchester and working within the state (but outside New York City) would pay a total of $29,259 to the Federal Government and New York State. **********It must be remembered, if the tax totals in these examples appear to be high, many deductions that the typical taxpayer can - and usually does - claim on the Federal income tax form were not taken. These include medical expenses, sales taxes, property taxes, interest on mortgages, car and other loans and contributions. And, on the other hand, in considering total tax burdens, a family considering buying a home would want to check the property tax burden, which can vary considerably from village to village or school district to school district within the same state. In addtion, states with low or no income taxes often have high sales taxes. **********When all of these other factors are taken into consideration, calculating taxes for families becomes so complex that those interested in finding the best tax haven need to do some careful figuring, perhaps with the help of an accountant."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/19/business/deficit-accord-seen-by-regan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-03-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 153, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Deficit Accord Seen by Regan", "print_headline": "Deficit Accord Seen by Regan", "body_text": " **********Treasury Secretary Donald T.

Leaders of the National Religious Party, the first to be consulted, said they were holding out for a national unity government. **********Two other parties, Agudat Israel and Tami, were also scheduled to confer. They have also indicated a preference for a broadly based government. **********Shimon Peres, the Labor leader, said in a radio interview that, ''unless there is a surprising change in Likud, it is all over'' as far as a coalition of the two major parties was concerned. **********He said that failure to form a government would lead to new elections. But that point may not be reached so soon. First Mr. Peres must report to President Chaim Herzog after the Sept. 16 deadline that he has been unable to form a government and then Mr. Herzog would have to reject another choice - asking someone else to try - before turning to Parliament.   Parliament May Be Reluctant **********Parliament would then have to dissolve itself, which some commentators saw as unlikely since it was just elected and members might fear that they might be be re-elected in a new round of voting. **********In the meantime, the Likud Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir continues in a caretaker role. In 1959, Prime Minister David Ben- Gurion presided over such an interim government for five months until new elections enabled him to form a coalition. **********Even after the announcement Sunday by Mr. Peres and Mr. Shamir that there were still ''serious obstacles,'' hopes for a national unity government appeared to remain alive. **********Within hours of the announcement, Mr. Peres was reported to have telephoned Mr. Shamir from Labor Party headquarters in Tel Aviv and a news conference by Mr. Peres was cancelled. **********And in radio interviews today, the two men outlined their differences in reasoned terms, refraining from personal attacks.   Settlements Are Key Issue **********The subject of West Bank settlements, which Mr. Peres was said to have discussed with Mr. Shamir on Sunday, emerged as the principal issue separating the two political blocs. Labor would halt new construction while Likud would continue. **********Mr. Shamir stated his party's position this way in the radio interview: **********''We know that the focus of the next few years would not be the establishment of new settlements due to economic limitations, but we must develop existing settlements and honor decisions already taken by the government for new settlements.'' **********Mr. Peres, in his interview, said: ''There are decisions that must be honored, but they cannot be divorced from the economic situation and political considerations.'' **********A total of 26 new settlements were believed to have been approved by the Shamir Government. **********Among other problems, Mr. Peres mentioned a drop in foreign currency reserves of $192 million last month while the Government printed $400 million worth of shekels.   Questions About Rotation **********The two leaders also differed on how the post of Prime Minister would rotate in the 50-month government that they approved before the talks broke down. Mr. Peres had told Labor officials that Mr. Shamir agreed to each leader's holding the office for half the period, with Mr. Peres first. **********But Mr. Shamir, after discussing it with his colleagues, came back with a one-year rotation. **********''We went a considerable distance in agreeing to two years,'' Mr. Peres said, ''but one year, that is a formula for instability, and it would give Israeli democracy the strangest look.'' **********On Wednesday, Mr. Peres said, he told Mr. Shamir that his proposals represented ''the furthest I could go,'' alluding to no new settlements and a 25- month rotation. Mr. Shamir said that ''at his request I did not submit these proposals to my friends until he had informed me that he had told me they were acceptable to his friends.'' **********On Friday, the two men spoke with reporters about making headway and facing only one or two more obstacles. But on Sunday, before meeting again with Mr. Peres, Mr. Shamir said, ''We in the Likud discussed the proposals and my friends suggested some changes.'' Compromise Plan Is Offered **********Apparently the changes also included rotation of some ministerial positions, largely because Likud does not want to see Yitzhak Rabin, a Labor member who favors a freeze on settlements, in the post of Defense Minister, which has responsibility for such activity. **********The National Religious Party, which said it had a compromise formula for the two major parties, is proposing that for the first two years Mr. Peres would be Prime Minister, Mr. Shamir Defense Minister and Mr. Rabin Foreign Minister. Then Mr. Shamir would head the government, Mr. Peres would become Foreign Minister and Mr. Rabin Defense Minister. **********That would give Likud control of settlement policy for the first two years, and probably be unacceptable to Labor unless settlement was specifically limited in a policy formula."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/07/world/rebels-capture-west-beirut-us-gunfire-supports-regime-reagan-denounces-syrian-229489.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1612, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. GUNFIRE SUPPORTS REGIME; REAGAN; DENOUNCES SYRIAN AID", "print_headline": "REBELS CAPTURE WEST BEIRUT; U.S. GUNFIRE SUPPORTS REGIME; REAGAN; DENOUNCES SYRIAN AID", "body_text": " **********Shiite and Druse gunmen demanding the resignation of President Amin Gemayel took over virtually all of West Beirut today. **********By early this morning, according to Lebanese Defense Ministry sources, the Lebanese Army had been driven out of that section of the capital, and the continuing small-arms clashes were the last pockets of army resistance to the anti-Government forces. **********''What we had feared most has happened,'' one of the sources said. ''Whole units have left the army.'' **********City in Chaos **********As the fighting Monday plunged the city into chaos, the United States Marine contingent at Beirut's international airport came under fire, and American fighter planes and naval gunners bombarded the bases of anti- Gemayel militias in the hills overlooking the capital. **********Shortly after midday, groups of Shiite Moslem and Druse youths, most of them in civilian clothes and many wearing cloth masks, began attacking key Lebanese Army bases throughout the predominantly Moslem western half of Beirut. **********Some Lebanese Army officers and soldiers put up fierce resistance, while others broke and ran. **********The state-run Beirut radio said today that at least 90 were killed and hundreds wounded in the fighting. But since neither fire trucks nor ambulances dared move through the streets, the death toll may rise much higher. **********'A Living Hell' **********''It is a living hell,'' Lilly Klink, a 57- year-old widow living in the eastern Beirut suburb of Ashrafiye said by telephone. ''We have rockets coming down on us one a minute. There are no lights and smoke is everywhere.'' **********The Beirut radio said that many buildings were ablaze around the city, which was obscured in a haze of smoke. Residents caught unprepared by the sudden outbreak of shooting were trapped in their homes or offices, often with no way to communicate with their families. **********The repeated whoosh of rockets sailing overhead and then crashing into buildings in the distance echoed across the darkened streets late into the night. **********Worst Fighting Since Civil War **********The fighting was described by residents here as the most ''intense and frightening'' battles the city has witnessed since the 1975-76 civil war. **********A statement issued Monday by the Syrian-backed Shiite Amal militia said the attacks had been undertaken to prevent the Lebanese Army from sending reinforcements into West Beirut. Amal has been fighting the Lebanese Army for the control of the southern suburbs of West Beirut for the last several days. **********At first the gunmen made no attempt to attack the United States Marine compound at the Beirut airport, according to Maj. Dennis Brooks, a Marine spokesman. **********As Monday's fighting wore on, however, unidentified militiamen fired small arms at sandbagged Marine outposts and then unleashed at least one rocket barrage around 6:30 P.M. that slightly injured one marine, Major Brooks said. **********A French soldier was killed and two others wounded Monday when rockets hit their position, according to a French Army spokeman. Eight Italian soldiers were also injured in grenade attacks on their posts. **********''We are in our bunkers,'' Major Brooks said by telephone. ''Initially we were taking a lot over and some directed small arms fire. Later we took some direct rocket fire. We then responded tonight.'' Major Brooks said two American fighter-bombers from the carrier John F. Kennedy bombed positions in the eastern Shuf mountains - where the Syrians and Druse have 130-millimeter artillery and multiple rocket launchers. The air strike was supported with naval gunfire from the frigate Garcia. **********By late Monday night, the Lebanese Army began to abandon many of its outposts in West Beirut. **********There were reports of defections by Moslem soldiers from the Lebanese Army. One group identifying themselves as army deserters issued a communique over a clandestine radio station. **********A communique issued by the Lebanese Army stated that its forces had managed to cut off a supply route running through Shuweifat that linked the Druse enclaves in the mountains with the Shiite enclave in the south of the capital. But amid the frequent breakdown of telephone lines, this report could not be independently confirmed. **********Druse gunners in the mountains overlooking the city also clashed Monday with Lebanese Army units around the village of Suk al Gharb, firing rockets into the predominantly Christian area of East Beirut. **********Officials said the fighting raised serious questions about how long President Amin Gemayel would be able to remain in power since it appeared unlikely that any Sunni Moslem would now agree to serve as his Prime Minister in a new government. Shafik al- Wazzan resigned as Prime Minister Sunday along with the entire Lebanese Cabinet. The post of Prime Minister in Lebanon has traditionally gone to a Sunni Moslem.   Shiite and Druse Reject Appeal **********Both the Druse leader, Walid Jumblat, and the Shiite Moslem leader, Nabih Berri, rejected an appeal from Mr. Gemayel Sunday night to return to the Geneva talks on national reconciliation, where all of their differences would be open to negotiation. **********''Now he must try to prepare another government, while I will try to prepare another President,'' Mr. Berri said, referring to Mr. Gemayel's appeal. **********''I have only one condition,'' Mr. Berri said from his Amal militia office in the southern suburbs of Beirut, ''that there be a new president not from any party. If Reagan bombarded New York City, do you think the people would elect him?'' **********Mr. Jumblat said in a statement issued from Damascus that ''no national unity can be established as long as Amin Gemayel remains President.''  Ex-Premier Issues Statement **********The most serious statement Monday night, however, may have been from former Prime Minister Selim al-Hoss, who is one of the most popular Moslem leaders in West Beirut and who is currently leading a delegation of Sunni Moslems from Beirut to Damascus.  After a meeting with Syria's Foreign Minister, Abdel Halim Khaddam, Mr. Hoss appeared to hint that he, too, may support calls for Mr. Gemayel to resign. **********''The problem now goes way beyond the formation of a new Cabinet,'' Mr. Hoss was quoted as saying. ''The problem now is to save Lebanon.'' **********There was no immediate reaction to the events from Mr. Gemayel. The Lebanese President met Monday with the Ambassadors from the United States, France, Britain and Italy, the four nations which make up the 4,000- man international force in Beirut, to discuss the situation. The United States special envoy to the Middle East, Donald Rumsfeld, also attended the discussions. No statements were issued after the meeting.   Cease-Fire Efforts Fail **********According to the Beirut radio, repeated efforts to arrange a cease-fire Monday failed. Beirut International Airport once again was forced to close because of the fighting. **********Western military authorities said Monday that the Lebanese Army was still largely intact and considering a large-scale counteroffensive along the lines of the one it mounted last August, when Shiite militiamen also seized control of wide areas of West Beirut. **********The suddenness with which Monday's fighting engulfed the city caused pandemonium. It was shortly after noon when the first crackle of machine- gun fire was heard in West Beirut, resulting from a shootout between Moslem gunmen and a jeep full of Lebanese Army soldiers on a main boulevard. **********Minutes later small groups of Druse and Shiite youths ran wildly through the streets or careered around corners hanging out the windows of cars, firing automatic weapons into the air and then at Lebanese Army checkpoints and bunkers.   Curfew Is Announced **********The army immediately interrupted radio programs to announce a curfew at 1:30 P.M. and warned that ''violators will be shot without warning.'' **********The army announcement, coupled with the whistle of bullets being fired from every direction, sent motorists and pedestrians into a panic. **********Residents began running through the streets to their homes, sometimes stopping for a few moments to quickly buy a basket of fruit or loaf of Arabic flat bread before all the stores rolled down their steel shutters. The noise of explosions, wailing sirens and honking horns burst from every direction. **********People sealed themselves into their homes, occasionally peeking from behind curtains or balconies to watch the fighting. **********Typical of what was happening around the city was the situation in Ras Beirut, a neighborhood on the eastern tip of the western half of the capital where many foreigners live and a small army base is situated. At about 2 P.M. a group of Druse gunmen arrived at an apartment building on a hill overlooking the army base. **********The gunmen ordered the landlord to open up all the empty apartments in the building so they could shoot down on the army base next door. The landlord told them that he did not have the keys and that the steel doors on each apartment were almost impossible to blow open. **********Dissuaded, the Druse gunmen, who were armed with rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles, marched across the street to a new building, the biggest and most luxurious apartment house in West Beirut, where many American diplomats reside.  The lone Lebanese Army soldier stationed there to guard the building from suicide car-bombers ran away, leaving the Druse free to occupy the balconies and fire down on the army base, while the building's residents hid in the basement. **********Before long, the army troops pulled out of the base and scattered, leaving the Druse in control of the area."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/30/business/l-stock-market-182589.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-12-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 352, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stock Market", "print_headline": "Stock Market", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********In several key instances, your piece on the institutional dominance of the stock market (''How the Institutions Rule the Market,'' Nov. 25) used unsubstantiated generalities to make key points. **********For example, in referring to the flow of pension assets into equities, it says ''The money has been going into stocks because managers of pension funds fear that they will lose their large management fees if they park all their funds in fixed-income securities.''

Regan said yesterday that the Treasury is studying the possibility of issuing zero-coupon bonds that pay no interest. He spoke at a conference in Washington sponsored by the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********Securities dealers now earn a profit from buying Treasury notes and bonds and repackaging them as zero- coupon issues. Sales of such issues have been brisk the past two years. **********The zero-coupon securities, which sell at a discount from face value, are comprised of the semiannual interest payments or the principal amount of a note or bond. Participants estimate that more than $50 billion of Treasury notes and bonds have been repackaged and sold as zero-coupon securities. **********Joseph E. Plocek, a money market analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei, noted that sales of zero-coupon securities by the Treasury would require much larger increases in the debt ceiling than Congress is accustumed to granting. For example, to raise $4 billion of cash with the sale of 20-year securities, the Treasury would have to issue about $70 billion of zero-coupon securities. **********Another possible change could be in the Eurobond market, where trading activity has fallen off while securities dealers wait for Treasury action leading to increased sales to foreigners. The tax act passed by Congress this week halts the withholding of 30 percent of the interest paid on Treasury notes and bonds to foreign investors. **********The Treasury, for its part, is considering issuing so-called bearer securities, for which the issuer does not keep a record of ownership. Since the start of 1983, the Treasury has issued notes and bonds only in registered form, with records of ownership, as required by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982.

The Democrats, for example, are advocating an industrial policy that would imitate what the Japanese have been doing for half a century. Demands for protectionist legislation have been mounting. The White House has already tightened controls on textile imports and negotiated an extension of ''voluntary'' quotas on Japanese car imports. **********The most important question, of course, is that of the fiscal-monetary policy mix, which has produced such a wildly overvalued dollar that American producers are being decimated in markets at home and abroad. **********How these questions are finally resolved will enormously affect America's economic future. For the fact is that the United States is in the midst of a great historical shift in its economic interests from the Atlantic to the Pacific. In 1982, our two-way trade with those countries totaled $165 billion, compared with $115 billion with Europe. As President Reagan has noted: ''The Pacific Basin is the area of the future.'' Although most news articles about Japan and the Pacific Basin accent trade conflicts, these are actually manifestations of a rapid interpenetration of societies across the Pacific. In no other area of the world has the United States been so successful. **********By contrast, United States trade relations with the European Common Market have reached a critical stage, particularly with regard to soybeans and specialty steel. Moreover, the Europeans are threatening to take action against the high United States interest rates, which they blame for the stagnation of their economies. And even though the deployment of the Pershing II missiles is proceeding, the Euromissile debate has resulted in a further shift of West Germany toward a more neutralist stance. At bottom, these manifestations of European malaise partly reflect the shift of economic power from the Atlantic to the Pacific. **********As other areas of the world are stagnating, the Pacific Basin has entered a new phase of the economic boom that has been transforming America's trade relations since World War II. While American spending related to the Korean War had much to do with Japan's initial recovery from the ashes of defeat, the outlays associated with the Vietnam War provided a tremendous lift to the entire region. **********Advances in transportation - jumbo jets, supertankers and container ships - have dramatically lowered shipping and warehousing costs. Along with trade has come the rapid spread of technology and management ideas, much of it via American businesses. And now the Pacific Basin - extending out from the American West - has become the primary arena for the high-tech industrial revolution.  The Pacific Basin boom is reflected in far-ranging shifts in economic and population growth within the United States. Under the impact of increased competition from the Pacific and increased energy costs, the Northeast quadrant has been steadily losing ground. The loss of competitive power has led to an outmigration of population, which in turn has produced a loss of political power. One result is that the rapidly growing West has become a new stronghold of Republicans. Except for Gerald Ford, who reached the White House via appointment, every Republican presidential candidate since Barry Goldwater has been from the Pacific Basin side of the United States. **********THE stimulus provided by expanding trade and competition **********across the Pacific is undoubtedly one reason why the American economy is now faring better than Western Europe, which is suffering problems of obsolescence similar to those of the Northeast quadrant. Along with trade and heightened technological competition has come new ideas about labor relations and industrial organization. As demonstrated by the Nissan truck plant in Smyrna, Tenn., the Japanese have shown that their style of participative management can be highly productive in this country as well. **********At the same time, more and more American corporations are establishing joint ventures with Japanese companies both in this country and in Japan. In addition to its small-car venture with Toyota, General Motors has formed a robotics subsidiary with Fanuc Ltd., Japan's top company in the field of numerical controls. Within a year or two, G.M.-Fanuc is expected to become America's leading producer of industrial robots. In these and numerous other instances, industrial and technological advances made in Japan are now being introduced in the United States. **********Yet, there is considerable danger that these constructive developments will be undermined by the failure to recognize the fundamental nature of the challenge that we face. For example, the policies of the Reagan Administration show little recognition of the fact that the primary source of Japan's powerful economic thrust is its extremely effective educational system, which is producing more engineers and other trained pesonnel than is the United States. Moreover, given the importance of the Asian countries to our economic future, it is surprising that this country has not taken any special measures to increase the supply of officials, scientists and businessmen trained in Japanese and other Asian languages. **********In no other way can we take full advantage of the high-tech industrial revolution that is taking shape in the Pacific Basin. **********Sam Nakagama is chief economist and managing director of Nakagama & Wallace Inc."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/20/business/seabrook-utility-s-notes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 258, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Seabrook Utility's Notes", "print_headline": "Seabrook Utility's Notes", "body_text": " **********The Public Service Company of New Hampshire has sold $90 million in one-year notes, and its financial adviser said today that the cash infusion could be the first step toward resuming work on the Seabrook nuclear plant. **********''We're one step out of the woods,'' said Robert Hildreth Jr., the managing director for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, which has been hired to advise the utility on how to complete the nuclear project. **********Mr. Hildreth said the notes were sold to ''9 or 10'' institutional investors, which he said included pension funds and insurance companies.

But if the buoyant retail season just ended showed anything, it is this: Americans will probably save less of their disposable income in 1984 than they did in the past two years. **********The reason? ''Americans traditionally save less when they sense good economic times ahead, and more when they worry about their jobs and the economy generally,'' says Philip Braverman, chief economist at Briggs, Schaedle & Company, Government securities dealers.  In 1981, when the latest recession took hold, the annual rate of savings jumped to 6.6 percent of disposable income from 6 percent the year before. It then declined to a cyclical low of 4 percent in the second quarter of last year, Mr. Braverman says, and rose to 5 percent in the last quarter of 1983. **********''When people save more it helps keep a lid on interest rates and inflation,'' he says, ''especially today when we have record Federal budget deficits.'' His outlook for savings in 1984? ''With luck it won't drop below the fourth-quarter 1983 rate of 5 percent.'' **********Attitudes and Appliances **********Sales of small appliances usually soar at Christmas time. But fewer people are buying them as gifts these days because they are no longer considered the luxury items they once were, industry experts say. Changing attitudes and relationships between spouses are also being reflected in the demand for small appliances. **********For example, only one in 10 electric irons is now bought as a gift, according to Harold F. Rosenbaum, director of marketing research and planning at Sunbeam Appliances. A husband giving his wife an iron and an ironing board today would probably get a pick and shovel in return, but new irons ''for the house'' are still strong sellers. **********''Men are doing more cooking these days,'' he adds, ''and this is why we expect food processors, the new electric fry pans and hand-held mixers will be even stronger sellers in 1984.'' **********Shutting Out the Neighbors **********Because most homeowners don't like dancing to their neighbors' music, gypsum wallboard manufacturers expect 1984 to be another boom year - even if the number of new housing starts doesn't rise above last year's 1.7 million units. **********Not only does sheetrock made from gypsum help reduce outside noise levels in homes, but penny-pinching construction companies also find it far less expensive to install than brick or wood paneling. **********Gypsum is in such short supply that manufacturers are carefully parceling it out among customers - ''the only housing material on allocation in many parts of the country,'' says Barbara Alexander, building industry analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. **********With the gypsum industry running at near capacity, prices jumped 20 percent in 1983, while other materials costs were stable, she notes. Further price rises may be ahead this year, she adds, for two reasons: ''One, dry- wall paneling in commercial buildings has only recently become popular as a means of reducing construction costs. Secondly, many private homeowners are now using two 5/8-inch sheetrock panels to deaden outside noise levels and reduce fire hazards. Both trends will continue in 1984.'' **********Counting on Paper Profits **********Few industries enjoyed the Christmas retail season as much as paper manufacturers. For one thing, their fourth-quarter 1983 profits were estimated to be up 50 percent from the depressed year-earlier level. **********Better still, 1984 promises to raise their profits by 75 percent over the dismal 1983 performance, according to an industry specialist, H. C. Bowen Smith, managing director at Salomon Brothers. **********''Whenever the paper industry's operating capacity climbs above 90 percent, it can raise its prices,'' he says. ''The industry operated at 85 percent in the last quarter of 1982 and was at 93 percent'' in the quarter just ended. **********Aside from the rising demand for liner board, which is used in packaging materials, and uncoated free sheets, or copier paper, paper makers also benefited late last year from a 25 percent drop in fuel costs, a 10 percent rise in productivity that more than covered wage raises of 5 percent and very little foreign competiton, Mr. Smith said. **********The only weak spot he sees is newsprint, because of recently expanded capacity that has not yet been matched by demand."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/28/world/around-the-world-polish-bishops-cite-continued-social-tension.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 166, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Polish Bishops Cite Continued Social Tension", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Polish Bishops Cite Continued Social Tension", "body_text": " **********Poland's 27 Roman Catholic bishops pledged today to continue their struggle against domestic oppression but combined the statement with an appeal to Poles to cooperate with the Communist authorities. **********The bishops' statement was made after a two-day conference presided over by Jozef Cardinal Glemp. **********Apparently alluding to the outlawed Solidarity union, the bishops said Poles ''should stay in solidarity and strive to help each other'' when food price rises decreed by the authorities take effect Monday. **********''Social tension has not disappeared,'' the bishops said in their statement.

And at least one utility, Seabrook's main builder, may be forced into bankruptcy. **********In the 1970's, Seabrook was the site of many antinuclear protests, some violent, with thousands of arrests. **********Now the plant is the center of a financial tangle that threatens the Public Service Company of New Hampshire with bankruptcy, and may ruin the financial health of other utilities. Originally budgeted at less than $1 billion, the completion cost for the project's two units is now estimated at $9 billion. Finishing just one unit, the utility has estimated, would cost $6 billion. **********Seabrook is already blamed for the defeat of one New Hampshire Governor, Meldrim Thompson, in 1978, and will almost certainly be the main issue this fall in the re-election bid of Gov. John H. Sununu, an advocate of the Seabrook project. **********Although the mass protests by environmentalists appear to be over, the operation of the twin 1,150-megawatt reactors appears less certain now than when 2,000 demonstrators occupied the construction site in the spring of 1977. **********The capital costs are so high - perhaps $5,000 per kilowatt of capacity, compared with a mere $300 for earlier nuclear plants such as Maine Yankee, finished in 1972 - that the reactors on the New Hampshire coast are now the latest and most likely casualties in the nuclear triage which, in recent years, has canceled more than 100 reactors worth in excess of $11 billion. **********Most work on Seabrook 2 stopped in September 1983 after what Public Service called ''the nearly unanimous determination of the other Seabrook participants and regulatory authorities that Unit 2 should be canceled.'' **********The company has embarked on a frantic search for new lines of credit. Its bankers said last week that without such ''backup,'' they would not renew Public Service's existing $163 million line of credit. And the utility's auditors, Peat Marwick, said Monday that Public Service might be forced into bankruptcy proceedings if it could not find new creditors soon. **********The company responded that it believed it could secure the credit, but would not say where. ''While the company is in a very serious situation, we remain hopeful that a solution can be reached,'' Robert J. Harrison, president, said in a statement. **********Some longstanding opponents of the Seabrook project are not so sure. **********''It looks to me like Public Service is going to beat the Long Island Lighting Company to be the first utility to take refuge in Chapter 11,'' said Robert A. Backus, a Manchester attorney who has been representing the Seacoast Anti-Pollution League in its fight against Seabrook for 14 years. Lilco has said that it faces bankruptcy if it cannot pass the costs of Shoreham on to its customers. **********Utility experts say that even if the Seabrook units are scrapped, as at least one of them seems certain to be, consumers will still be on the hook. **********''We're talking about billions of dollars,'' said Paul F. Levy, the chairman of the Department of Public Utilities in Massachusetts. ''Whether or not the plant is completed, assuming rate payers end up paying most or all of that money, there'll be a substantial rate impact.'' **********'It's an Ongoing Fiasco' **********''It's going to cost a bundle to somebody,'' agreed Peter Bradford, the chairman of the Public Service Commission in Maine and a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ''It's an ongoing fiasco at this point.'' **********Estimates are hard to come by, because prices are in flux. Lea Aeschlimann, one of three members of New Hampshire's Public Utilities Commission, complained that only Public Service had the computer programs capable of estimating the financial impact of Seabrook, but that the utility had refused to share them. **********''Now we seem to be at a crisis point where we really don't know what is best for the people of the state of New Hampshire,'' she said. **********Some experts estimate, however, that the wholesale cost of power from Seabrook 1 would be about 20 cents per kilowatt-hour, at least in the early years of operation, compared with a current average residential charge of 9 cents for Public Service. **********Some of the burden for the unfinished plants could be shifted from rate payers to company shareholders if, as appears likely, regulators determine there has been ''imprudence'' in the construction. Regulators generally try to split costs between rate payers and shareholders. **********Impact Will Vary The effect on customers will vary sharply, depending on the size of each partner and the size of its share of Seabrook. **********Here in New Hampshire, Public Service, which serves 80 percent of New Hampshire's population, puts the rate increase at 65 percent, if Seabrook 1 is finished, and another 20 percent if the second unit is completed. But Michael Love, a former chairman of the state Public Utilities Commission, put the increase at up to 140 percent for both reactors. **********In Massachusetts, Mr. Levy said, municipal lighting companies, which have no stockholders to absorb any of the cost overrun, will face increases ranging from 35 to 100 percent. **********Also Involved in Another Plant **********Michael L. Jones, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Company, which represents 28 participants, said many of his consortium's members were also involved in another overbudget nuclear plant, Millstone 3 in Waterford, Conn. Like Seabrook 1, it is scheduled for operation later in this decade. **********Assuming that the increases could be spread over several years, Seabrook 1 and Millstone 3 together, along with general inflation, would require the municipal electric companies to raise their rates about 9 percent every year from 1986 to 1992, for a total increase of more than 80 percent, according to Mr. Jones. **********Mr. Bradford, the Maine regulator, said some consumers in his state would see increases of 20 to 30 percent. In Connecticut, Barry Zitser, the state consumer counsel, said Bridgeport and New Haven customers of the United Illuminating Company, which owns the second-largest share, would see increases of 50 percent for Seabrook if the first reactor was finished and the second reactor could be canceled soon, but higher increases if both were built. He said it was unlikely either would ever operate. ''Nobody really believes that Seabrook 2 is going to be built,'' he said. ''The only question is, will Seabrook 2 take Seabrook 1 with it. I believe that point may have been reached.'' **********Bonds Are Speculative **********The bonds and preferred stock of Public Service of New Hampshire are considered speculative by rating agencies. The company must borrow money to pay dividends on common stock, and it no longer has a pressing need for all the power that the twin reactors will produce, especially at the prices now projected. And many of the company's 15 construction partners in the other New England states face the same troubles. **********Under the circumstances, a majority of the co-owners, along with the state public service commissions with jurisdiction over them, have said it would be sensible to abandon at least Seabrook 2, which is 25 percent complete after the expenditure of $800 million. **********They would like, however, to concentrate all their resources on completing Seabrook 1, which is about 75 percent done and where interest charges, $1 million a day, will pile up until the moment the plant enters commercial operation. Public Service, the lead utility in the project, has used its veto to block such a move. **********''We cannot cancel the way things are,'' said Nicholas J. Ashooh, a spokesman, in an interview in the company's 20-story headquarters overlooking the Merrimack River here. Just as financial constraints appear to make it impossible for the company to go forward, he said, it cannot afford to stop, either.  ''We don't know if we can get any of our investment back,'' he said. **********On Wednesday, the New England governors will hold a meeting in Providence, R.I., to discuss the impasse."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/17/business/patents.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1984-03-17", "snippet": "A System To Help Robots See \n\n\n\nWASHINGTON \nA NEW vision system for robots enables the machines to grasp objects that may be in unexpected positions.

Yuri V. Andropov, the Soviet leader who died last February, issued a statement less than a month after the plane's downing, saying it was impossible to do business with the Reagan Administration. **********Some Agreements Reached **********His successor, Konstantin U. Chernenko, has maintained the chilly attitude toward the Reagan Administration. But with the exception of Moscow's refusal to resume negotiations on limiting nuclear missiles, the Russians in recent months have agreed to talks and agreements on a spate of less important issues, such as modernizing the hot line and new cultural exchanges. **********''When you look back on the KAL affair,'' a senior White House official said, ''there is a temptation to say it worsened relations. That's not the real significance. The real significance is that it provided a groundswell of criticism of the Russians here and everywhere that put them on the defensive and gave us some flexibility.'' **********A senior State Department official said, ''It was a black eye of collossal proportions to the Soviets.'' **********He added that to this day he could not understand why the Soviet Union did not promptly accept responsibility and then apologize for the incident, instead of first denying it happened and then maintaining that the airliner was on a spying mission for the United States.   'Took the Heat Off Reagan' **********''The way the Russians handled it, they took the heat off Reagan,'' a State Department specialist on Soviet affairs said. He said the affair ''provided a political boon'' to the Administration. **********He pointed to two important developments in the months after the incident that he said had backfired for the Soviet Union. The first was the Soviet decision to walk out of the negotiations in Geneva on limiting medium-range missiles. The other was the announcement last spring that the Soviet team would boycott the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. **********Because the Soviet image was so tarnished by the airliner disaster, there was no longer the tendency in this country and abroad to blame Mr. Reagan for the chill in relations, he said. The Geneva and Los Angeles walkouts seemed further instances of Soviet ''irresponsibility,'' he said. **********''Until the KAL, Reagan was blamed for the bad relations,'' one senior State Department official said. ''Everyone remembered he had called them 'liars and cheats.' But after the KAL shooting down, the President seemed to make sense to a lot of people.'' **********Another official said: ''I'd almost go so far as to say it created a consensus in this country about the Soviets. A basic kind of anti-Soviet mood was created that is fairly supportive of the President.''  Off Course for Unknown Reasons **********The Korean airliner was shot down on Sept. 1 as it was leaving Soviet airspace. Flying from Anchorage to Seoul, it was off its regular course, for reasons still not known with certainty. American and Japanese intelligence, going over recorded radio and radar signals, deduced within 12 hours that it had been downed by a Soviet Su-15 fighter, which fired an air-to-air missile at it. **********The Russians, however, did not admit to downing the plane for nearly a week. After they did, they maintained it was on an American spy mission. The charge has been denied repeatedly by the United States and South Korea. The International Civil Aviation Organization's report this year speculated that the plane was off course because of pilot navigation error. **********In the summer of 1983, Secretary of State George P. Shultz had gradually carried out a policy of repairing relations with Moscow, which had been severely strained in the first years of the Administration. Talks were resumed on several matters that had been put in abeyance by the Carter Administration because of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. Moscow and Washington agreed on a timetable that could have led to a summit meeting in 1984. **********Mr. Shultz and Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko were to meet in early September while in Madrid for the conclusion of a meeting on European security and cooperation. At that session, they were to hold extensive talks on all outstanding issues, including the stalemated negotiations on limiting medium-range missiles in Europe. The NATO allies had said they would deploy at the end of 1983 the first of 572 new American missiles if an accord was not reached on curbing both those missiles and the Soviet SS-20's, already deployed. Moscow had threatened to cancel the talks if the American missiles were deployed.   Further Talks Were Planned **********The plan had Mr. Shultz and Mr. Gromyko continuing their discussions in New York later in September, when they would be at the United Nations General Assembly session. If progress was made there, Mr. Gromyko would come to Washington to see Mr. Reagan, in the President's first meeting with a high Soviet official. **********But the downing of the Korean airliner led Mr. Shultz to insist at Madrid that he and Mr. Gromyko talk only about that incident. When New York Port Authority officials refused to allow Mr. Gromyko's Aeroflot plane to land at a civilian airport in the New York area, Mr. Gromyko canceled his regular trip to the United Nations, the first time he had missed such a session in 26 years. **********''We, of course, had hoped that out of those talks with Gromyko a breakthrough might have taken place to pull the I.N.F. talks out of the hat,'' a senior State Department official said, referring to the medium-range missile talks by the abbreviation for Intermediate- Range Nuclear Forces. **********''But I think that was only a long shot at best,'' he said this week. ''The Russians had said they would not agree to letting us put up one missile, and so the chances were that even without the KAL, we'd have had a lot of tension in November when it was clear we were going to deploy.''  Left Without Sympathy **********The difference, he said, was that because of the airliner incident the Russians could not garner much support or sympathy in Europe when they did walk out of the Geneva talks. If the plane had not been shot down, the Russians might have been able to spread the blame for the collapse of the talks to the Administration, he said. **********As to the future, Mr. Shultz is preparing to meet Mr. Gromyko in New York at the end of September for what promises to be a holding action as the two sides await the American elections in November. Administration officials say that if Mr. Reagan is re-elected, Mr. Shultz will move quickly to try to resume constructive relations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/20/business/gm-callback.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 60, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.M.

But on Sept. 7, that state's Supreme Court threw out the approval, agreeing with plant opponents that the commission chairman had created questions about whether he had improperly prejudged the issue. **********Approval Was Reinstated **********The commission, sitting with a temporary replacement for the chairman, reinstated the approval Wednesday, and the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the registration statement Thursday. **********Plant opponents, however, have 20 days to challenge the ruling, and yesterday the state's Supreme Court denied a motion by Public Service to declare the sale legal and allow it to go forward despite the possibility of challenges later. Challenges have been promised by plant opponents. **********Before the court acted yesterday, the company had been seeking an extension from its creditors until the middle of next month. After the court's decision, it was not immediately clear how long an extension would be needed.

Paul McGrath, first moved to block the marriage. Then two Cabinet officers and the President said it should go forward. Finally, after the companies agreed to sell off some assets, it did. **********Now Mr. McGrath, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, is preparing to clear the air with some new merger guidelines, which are expected to be published by the division on June 14. They would update the last revision, issued nearly two years ago by his predecessor, William F. Baxter. **********The 1982 guidelines represented the first revision in 14 years. **********Rick Rule, deputy to Mr. McGrath, said the exercise provides an opportunity to ''work out the bugs'' from 1982. **********Added one antitrust lawyer, Philip L. Verveer, a 1970's alumnus of the division: ''The recent steel case provided a strong impetus for more clarity.'' **********The new guidelines are expected to provide somewhat more marketplace pragmatism. Global market conditions were cited by both Malcolm Baldrige, the Commerce Secretary, and Bill Brock, the United States trade representative, in taking exception to Mr. McGrath's initial decision to block the steel merger. **********The division may become more flexible in its so- called failing-company doctrine. Mark Sheehan, a spokesman for the division, said that under the current policy a company has to be almost ''at the door of the bankruptcy court'' before an otherwise unlawful merger will be permitted. **********Also to be clarified: the extent to which improved efficiencies will weigh against the loss of competition in the division's merger decisions, and the way the Government will factor imports into its definition of markets. **********''We intend to give lawyers and businessmen the most accurate possible idea of what kinds of mergers the Government will challenge,'' Mr. Sheehan said. **********The Cost of Protectionism **********Import curbs on cars, motorcycles, textiles, steel and myriad other products result in higher prices and represent a hidden tax on consumers that now ranges between $1,500 and $2,000 per family in the United States, according to new calculations by an organization known as Consumers for World Trade. **********Doreen Brown, president of the Washington- based group, said that the next time a protectionist bill comes before a Congressional committee, the Congressional Budget Office should be instructed to assess its cost. ''The consumer has a right to know, at the very least, how much of a tab he is expected to pick up for protectionist measures,'' she observed. **********Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware and chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, called for a change in terminology from ''free and fair'' trade to ''equitable and expanding'' as a way to get a less restrictive trade policy under way. **********''The term 'free and fair' is at best obscure and at worst a code for protectionism,'' said the legislator, who is holding hearings next Thursday on ''How to Save the International Trading System.'' **********Should the new terminology be accepted, the softball team of the Office of the United States Trade Representative would be affected. The ''Free Traders,'' as they are now known, would probably have to change into T-shirts emblazoned with the words ''Equitable Traders.'' **********Heritage Foundation Exemption **********During the recent Senate debate on the $47 billion tax bill, the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research institute, lobbied for a specific exemption that would help it finance a new headquarters here. **********The Senate's self-appointed tax cop, Howard M. Metzenbaum, a liberal Democrat from Ohio, fought many of the tax breaks, including the one for Heritage. He got it removed from the bill by threatening a filibuster. **********The institute's lawyer, William Lehrfield, professed to be unworried. The exemption is assured under general language in the House bill, and he thinks there's a good chance it will stick through conference. **********Regulatory Census **********Staffing of Federal regulatory agencies is again on the rise, although it is far below the record levels reached in 1980. The 77,507 full-time employees projected for fiscal year 1985 compares with 77,005 for 1984, but is still down sharply from the 90,495 in 1980. **********Kenneth W. Chilton and Ronald J. Penoyer of the Center for the Study of American Business at Washington University in St. Louis said the largest reductions since 1980 have come in the social regulatory area.

The decline has spurred increasing talk of belt-tightening, but, to Trinidadians, it is all a matter of degree. **********A secretary says she still plans to fly occasionally to Miami to shop, but perhaps not as often. A cab driver, who has bought a new car every year since the late 1970's, says he plans to keep his 1984 model for another 12 months. And at the next party one civil servant throws in this lively capital city, a good wine will be served instead of the usual champagne. **********''We're not as badly off as we were before or as we would have been if we hadn't had the oil boom,'' said Carmena Baird, general manager of the local Chamber of Industry and Commerce. ''I'm not saying we're not going to have hard times compared to the last 10 years, but our hard times are nothing like what 90 percent of the developing countries are passing through.'' **********Boom-Town Appearance **********Trinidad and Tobago, a multiracial two-island nation seven miles off the coast of Venezuela, was almost bankrupt in 1973 when its economy was resuscitated by the Arab oil embargo. When the Middle Eastern oil became scarce, the oil companies tapped fields in Trinidad and Tobago. The country benefited from higher oil prices, greater production and increased use of its refineries. Soon it was awash with oil dollars, producing a boom-town appearance and attitude that is still evident. **********Trend-chasing consumers cram modern shopping malls along the noisy streets of Port of Spain, the main commercial center in the eastern Caribbean. Automobiles - it seems that every family has at least one - cause surreal traffic jams on the smooth highways cutting through sugar cane fields. Airline ticket offices overflow with travelers. Sleek condominiums and ambitious construction projects dot the lush, tropical landscape in this wealthiest nation in the Caribbean. **********But the petroleum industry is now suffering from declining production and softening international prices. The country's oil revenues dropped more than 26 percent last year, from about $3.3 billion to $2.4 billion. In 1983, the last year for which complete statistics are available, unemployment rose to 11.1 percent in the first half, from 10.2 percent in the same period the year before. The real gross domestic product, which had an annual growth rate of 3.3 percent during the previous three years, declined 2.7 percent. According to a report by the country's central bank, 1983 ''clearly marks the end'' of the economic expansion that began in 1974. **********Government Subsidies Cut **********San Fernando, Trinidad's second- largest city and the heart of the petroleum industry, first felt the economic squeeze two years ago. Now, the rest of this nation of more than one million people is starting to feel it. In measures to reduce spending, the Government has slashed subsidies on basic foodstuffs, gasoline and cement. The state-owned telephone and electricity companies have been told to become self-supporting. **********As a result, consumer prices increased 16.7 percent in 1983, and some utility rates jumped several hundred percent. Last year, motorists paid about 88 cents a gallon for premium gasoline. Today they pay nearly triple that. **********But whittling expectations to fit current realities is not always easy. There was labor unrest in recent weeks stemming from a demand by oilfield workers, accustomed to substantial raises, for a 40 percent wage increase in the first year of a three- year contract with the Texaco Trinidad refinery. Texaco offered only a 5 percent increase, as the decline in the international oil industry makes the refinery a financial burden. **********Members of the Oilfields Workers Trade Union briefly struck the company last month and occupied Texaco's bond department, halting deliveries of gasoline and producing long lines at gas stations. Fuel was eventually sent out under police escort. **********Political Ramifications **********Some Trinidadians believe that current economic problems could lead to increasing dissatisfaction with the ruling People's National Movement, which has controlled the Government since 1956. Tied to such a possibiity is the issue of race in a country roughly 42 percent black and 40 percent East Indian, with mixed, European, Chinese, Syrian and other ethnic groups rounding out the populace.  The People's National Movement receives much of its support from urban blacks; it first won election as an anticolonialist party, offering hope to black people. But major opposition parties, appealing to black, Indian and middle-class voters, joined to dominate the last local elections. There is concern among some blacks that the Government will eventually be controlled by the Indians. **********''The races get along here,'' said one black Government worker. ''But some people say that the country is not ready for an Indian leader, meaning that blacks would feel they no longer ran things.'' **********Diversification Attempts **********The downturn is going on as the Government continues a major push to diversify the nation's economy, so that declining petroleum reserves do not translate into financial ruin. The country's vast quantities of natural gas, enough to meet domestic needs for more than a century, are being used to fuel high-technology and export-oriented industries, including fertilizer and iron and steel products. **********Yet for now, oil remains king and is inextricably tied to the rising and falling fortunes of the nation, which gained full independence from Britain in 1962. **********''We now have to cut our sails to suit the cloth,'' said John C. Rooks, who has worked in the oil industry since 1945 and is managing director of Rooks Oilfield and Engineering Supplies in San Fernando, on Trinidad's southwestern coast. ''The unlimited money supply is no longer there and we have to start worrying about prices instead of buying something just because we want it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/14/business/us-and-europe-in-steel-curb-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1984-09-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 401, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. AND EUROPE IN STEEL CURB TALKS", "print_headline": "U.S. AND EUROPE IN STEEL CURB TALKS", "body_text": " **********The United States and the European Economic Community are discussing limits on shipments of steel pipe and tube to the United States as part of a protection plan that President Reagan may announce next week. **********Etienne Davignon, the Common Market's Commissioner for Industry, made a secret trip to Washington Monday and Tuesday to discuss the surging pipe and tube exports from Europe with key members of the Reagan Administration. **********The Administration regards protection for makers of steel pipe and tube as important to winning a favorable, or at least less disapproving, response from the domestic steel industry when the package is announced. **********The industry wants mandatory global quotas, to be imposed unilaterally by Washington, that would reduce the imports' penetration of the American market from the present one-quarter to a little over 15 percent. **********The Administration is considering a plan that is much less restrictive under which new quotas, so-called Orderly Marketing Agreements, would be negotiated only with South Korea, Brazil and Spain.

They thus joined a select group of Iowa farmers who are test-marketing a computer service being developed by Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc., the nation's leading seed company. **********Pioneer, based in Des Moines, plans to introduce its Farm Information Management System early next year. The company got into the business, according to Thomas N. Urban, Pioneer's president and chairman, as a result of its extensive use of computers in seed development. **********''Data processing has become the sinew and bone of our genetic research,'' Mr. Urban said. ''We can't separate it from classical plant breeding now.'' **********Nor is Pioneer's involvement in computers confined to research. In 1977, it acquired the Norand Corporation, a Cedar Rapids company that adapts portable computer systems for delivery trucks, and computerized cash registers for retailers. Pioneer has also developed a computer system that permits seed salesmen on the road to record orders. **********'Hard Times for Customer Base' **********But with low commodity prices reducing farm income, not many farmers may be able to afford computers these days. ''Pioneer's customer base for these systems is really up against the wall, trying to make money,'' said Al Jackson, an analyst with the First Boston Corporation. **********''So many companies are caught up with the mystique of cracking these new markets,'' noted Alfred R. Berkeley, an analyst with Alex Brown & Sons in Baltimore. ''But they're finding that the volume of business just does not justify creating a sales force.'' Still, he noted, ''if a company is well capitalized in this for the long-term, and puts its toe in very carefully at first, it just might run away with the market.'' **********John D. James, president of Pioneer's new data systems unit, said research shows that only 3 to 5 percent of the nation's farmers have computers. ''The market is just beginning to open up,'' he said. ''The key to our success will be our local relationship with farmers and the training and service we will provide.'' **********That farmers represent a potential computer market is evident from the case of David Williams of southwestern Page County. Mr. Williams, who farms 750 acres of corn and soybeans and raises hogs and cattle, brought an I.B.M. PC onto his farm in May - at the instigation not of Pioneer but of his 19-year-old son, a computer science major at Iowa State University. **********Using Computers, Up to a Point **********Steven Williams used the computer last week to select the farm's best heifers to keep for breeding next year. ''He plugged in data on birth weight, calving ease and mothering ability, and it spit out which were the top 15 females in the herd,'' the elder Mr. Williams said. ''Of course, we're going to eyeball the winners to make sure they have four legs.'' **********Mr. James, who declined to divulge Pioneer's farm computer sales targets, said other companies trying to market computer services to farmers include the Sperry Corporation's New Holland division, the Ralston Purina Company and the A. O. Smith Corporation, all agribusiness companies. **********Pioneer has the staying power to succeed at marketing information services to farmers, Mr. Urban said. **********''With 10-year lead times for producing some of our seed hybrids, we have never been able to think quarter-to-quarter or even year-to- year,'' he said. ''We also can't worry about what the cost of interest is, or whether there will be drought or P.I.K.,'' he added, referring to the payment-in-kind program last year in which the Government paid farmers with surplus grain for keeping certain amount of acreage out of production. ''All we can do is go it alone, making sure we've got an aggressive marketing organization and that we're at the leading edge of the technology.'' **********A Patient Approach **********''Pioneer gives a new definition to the word patience,'' Mr. Jackson of First Boston agreed. ''This is a stock you tuck away for the kids.'' **********Mr. Jackson is forecasting a 64 percent increase in earnings for the fiscal year 1984, which ended Aug. 31. Pioneer's 1983 sales of $505.4 million and earnings of $43.7 million were both depressed by the payment-in-kind program, which reduced corn acreage by 27 percent. **********Pioneer was started in 1926 by Henry A. Wallace, an early experimenter with corn hybridization who later became Secretary of Agriculture and Vice President under Franklin D. Roosevelt. **********In hybridization, two or more crop lines are crossed, producing more vigorous offspring. For more than 50 years, corn hybrids have dramatically increased harvestable yield by combining such characteristics as stalk strength and resistance to disease, insects, heat and drought. **********Hybrid corn seed sales worldwide approach $2 billion annually, with more than half in the United States. Pioneer's corn seed sales were $376 million in 1983, amounting to 74 percent of the company's total sales and contributing 90 percent of earnings. **********In the United States hybrid corn seed market, Pioneer dwarfs its nearest competitors, which include DeKalb/Pfizer Genetics, a joint venture of De Kalb Agresearch Inc. and Pfizer Inc., and the Northrup King Company, a unit of Sandoz Ltd., the Swiss pharmaceutical house. **********In marketing computer services, however, Pioneer will have to learn a different set of rules. The Kalsems, for example, have already made one suggestion to Pioneer: make the computer assistance hot line available in the evening.

Mr. Bhindranwale was killed in the attack on the temple. **********Mr.  Singh, recently released from police custody, said that just before his arrest at dawn June 6, soldiers brought about 40 young men from the second floor and terrace of the building to an open courtyard downstairs and shot them to death. He said the 40 included both innocent devout and Sikh extremists who had been firing and hurling grenades from the rooftop. **********He said that as soldiers were taking Sikh leaders out to an armored personnel carrier, extremists hurled a grenade from the roof at about 50 other Sikhs trying to surrender. **********Enraged by the attack, which killed two soldiers and one Sikh, troops rushed to the upper floors of the buildings and sprayed bullets on the hundreds of faithful who had taken shelter there, he said. ''Nearly 500 people were killed in a matter of two to three hours,'' Mr. Singh said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/12/business/newsprint-shift-international-pine-bluff-ark-jan-11-ap-international-paper.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Newsprint Shift At International PINE BLUFF, Ark., Jan. 11 (AP) - The International Paper Company said it plans to add to its capacity to produce white papers, used for envelopes and business forms, but that it is ending production of newsprint.", "print_headline": "Newsprint Shift At International PINE BLUFF, Ark., Jan. 11 (AP) - The International Paper Company said it plans to add to its capacity to produce white papers, used for envelopes and business forms, but that it is ending production of newsprint.", "body_text": " **********The shift was announced as the company disclosed plans to spend more than $300 million to modernize a paper mill at Mobile, Ala., which was built more than 50 years ago.

Volcker, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, contained no surprises for the credit markets. But interest rates rose anyway, as many market participants agreed with Mr. Volcker's assessment that Federal deficits cast a shadow over hopes for a sustained, non-inflationary economic expansion. **********''Once again, concern is mounting that the fundamental incompatibility of huge budget deficits and an inflation-fighting monetary policy will soon be sending interest rates higher,'' Irwin Kellner, chief economist of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, notes in the latest issue of Financial Digests. **********Recent economic news, particularly the lower unemployment rate announced earlier this month, have led many economists to predict that the economy may grow faster this quarter than it did in the last quarter of 1983, when real gross national product grew at a 4 1/2 percent rate. January data for retail sales, industrial production, personal income and housing starts are to be released this week. **********Big Supply of New Issues **********Those analysts who expect rates to decline by mid-year as economic growth slows were inclined to attribute the lower prices and higher yields to the big supply of new issues. Government securities dealers said the outlook was not entirely bleak, adding that while demand was not strong, the market was not hit with large-scale selling by institutions. **********''The timing was not good for the Treasury's auctions, since all the economic data coming up is expected to be strong,'' one Government securities dealer said. ''The level of interest rates is not the problem, it's just that buyers are waiting for the bad numbers to pass.'' **********The caution of large investors was evident at last week's Treasury note and bond auctions, where the strongest demand was for the least risky, shortest maturity. By last week, the 10 7/8 percent notes due in 1987 were offered at 99 26/32, to yield 10.96 percent, about unchanged from the average price set at Tuesday's auction. **********Long-Term Issues **********Demand was much weaker for longer-term issues that would suffer the largest price declines if interest rates move higher. The 11 3/4 percent notes due 1993 were offered Friday at 99 21/32, to yield 11.81 percent, down from an average auction price of about 100 6/32, while the 12 percent bonds due 2013 were offered at 100 5/8, to yield 11.92 percent, down from an average of about 100 31/32. **********Despite the strong economic data expected to be released this week, many analysts see a slowdown ahead. Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Philadelphia's Fidelity Bank, said recent patterns in money supply growth continue to point toward less rapid economic growth. **********Although the Fed's recently revised money supply data show that M-1 grew at a 7.2 percent rate in the second half of 1983, rather than at a 5.5 percent rate, Mr. Levy said the rate of growth still represented a slowdown from the first half ''and is a good predictor of a slowdown in the economy.'' **********The Fed's quarterly data show that the M-1 growth rate slowed from 12.8 percent in the first quarter to 11.6 percent in the second, 9.5 percent in the third and 4.8 percent in the fourth. **********Pointing to a Slowdown **********Frank Mastrapasqua, chief economist at Smith, Barney, Harris Upham, said there is more than just slower growth of money supply and bank reserves pointing toward a slowdown in the economy. **********''The sharp decline in the stock market in recent weeks has produced a $158 billion decline in equity values'' that should dampen consumer spending patterns, he said. In addition, he noted that while the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence set a high in January, the index of consumer buying plans fell to 98.6, from 108.5, and has fallen over four consecutive months. **********Even if the economic growth slows, as Mr. Mastrapasqua and Mr. Levy expect, some analysts doubt that the slower growth will be enough to produce lower interest rates. In the February issue of Financial Market Perspectives, Robert M. Giordana, senior financial economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, concluded that ''just about any slowdown in real G.N.P. growth short of recession may be insufficient to prevent upward pressure on private credit demands and interest rates.'' **********He said Treasury bond yields could rise to around 13 percent, from 11.9 percent recently, and 90-day commercial paper rates could rise to 11 percent, from 9 1/4 percent recently."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/13/business/business-people-chief-taking-leave-at-michigan-bank.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 310, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHIEF TAKING LEAVE AT MICHIGAN BANK", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; CHIEF TAKING LEAVE AT MICHIGAN BANK", "body_text": " **********Stanford C.

The report did not say when the two men would be released but indicated it would be soon. **********Over the last weeks, as the amnesty wound toward its end-of-the-year deadline, Polish Government officials reacted to questions about Mr. Lis from diplomats and Western visitors with silence or scorn. **********One Government official told a Western visitor last week that demands for the freedom of the underground operatives as a condition for improving relations with Poland were humiliating and would not be met. **********Before the kidnapping and killing in October of the Rev.

The statement fell short of the effusive expressions of gratitude by officials in Ethiopia that Tass has been reporting in its effort to create the impression that Soviet assistance has been critical to the Ethiopian relief effort. **********Colonel Mengistu's mission was not specified, and the fact that his trip was not announced here in advance suggested that he had come on his own initiative.

It is 40 feet wide and 100 feet deep, and it stands directly north of the Sutton Park synagogue and Greenacre Park, a 6,360-square-foot park on East 51st Street. The developer is Britton Development Ltd. **********Last year the city effectively banned future construction of this kind of building, which resulted from the explosion in Manhattan real estate values. Thus, along with perhaps as many as 30 other buildings in luxury-district neighborhoods on the East and West Sides, the Britton project stands as an example of a particular moment in the history of real estate development in Manhattan. **********Barry E. Fallis, Britton's president, and Marvin H. Meltzer, vice president, say sliver buildings in general have been maligned. They believe that the outcome in some instances has poisoned consideration of whether any sliver buildings can ever be acceptable. **********Not surprisingly, they contend that Townhouse 52, which is between Second and Third Avenues, shows that the main problem the sliver concept introduces - how to minimize the intrusiveness of a tall structure amid low-rise buildings - can be solved. **********One way they did it, said Mr. Meltzer, who is an architect, was in the treatment of the building's exterior. Their purpose was to ''fit'' the building into the block by minimizing people's perception of its height as seen from ground level on East 52d Street. **********In a block of largely three-story town houses and four- to five-story apartment buildings, the facade of Townhouse 52 is set back at the eighth and 10th floors. The pink stucco, with its color and material softening the building's visual mass, covers nearly all of the part of the facade most visible from the street. And the pink stucco, along with the brown brick of the rest of the facade, echoes the colors of the other residential buildings in its block on East 52d Street. Finally, the railings of the open balconies look similar to the fire escapes on the facades of adjacent apartment buildings. **********Undoubtedly, one thing that helped Townhouse 52 fit in is the fact that that part of East 52d Street is not a pristine low-rise block. Its northeast corner is occupied by 875 Third Avenue, a 29-story glass- sheathed office tower that dwarfs the Britton project as well as other nearby buildings. **********Still, the midblocks in that part of the East Fifties remain predominantly low-rise. The views from Townhouse 52's balconies offer a striking mosaic of these low buildings and midtown office and residential skyscrapers. **********Because the building is so visible, with its northern and southern facades clearly seen and parts of its sides also seen, Mr. Meltzer said they sought to give it ''a sculptural quality that would distinguish it as more than just a block of stone.'' **********That meant cutting out a slice of the sides to make room for angled kitchen windows, making most of the balconies semicircular, and changing the fenestration of the facade facing East 51st Street to allow more southern light and, in Mr. Fallis's words, to ''attempt to open the building to Greenacre Park.'' **********This effort to capitalize on natural light led to the use of glass-block walls within the apartments themselves as well as over the two ground- floor entrances. One entrance leads to the apartments, the other to the building's medical offices in the basement and on the first and second floors. **********Townhouse 52 has a total of 25 apartments, arranged on either the northern or southern side of the building. Twelve are one-bedroom units facing the park and East 51st Street, of 900 square feet and costing from $282,000 to $378,000. Seven are two- bedroom, two-bath apartments of 1,210 square feet facing 52d Street and costing from $415,000 to $455,000. And five are studio apartments of 665 square feet, also facing East 52d Street and costing from $220,000 to $245,000. All but one of the studio apartments have balconies or terraces. **********There are just two apartments per floor. Only the residents of a particular floor, by using an elevator key, will have access to that floor. **********The top apartment is a 1,500- square-foot duplex penthouse.

But when the front's activities faltered, he retired to Costa Rica to operate a small fishing business. **********In 1978, however, the Sandinistas changed their strategy and after forming an alliance with non-Marxist political, religious, business and intellectual groups they persuaded Mr. Pastora to return to arms. In August that year Mr. Pastora led an attack on the national palace in Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, seizing dozens of hostages and obtaining the release of jailed Sandinista leaders. **********Earning the nickname of ''Commander Zero'' in that attack, he used his popularity and renown as a fighter to draw recruits into an invasion army being prepared in Costa Rica.

But he later complained that the National Directorate had blocked his efforts to fight with Guatemalan leftists and in April 1982 he publicly denounced the radicalism of his former Sandinista colleagues. **********In the year that followed, Mr. Pastora claimed that he made repeated attempts to negotiate ''a return to the original principles of the revolution'' - which he described as political pluralism, a mixed economy and a nonaligned foreign policy - but that his peace efforts were ignored.

The statement was issued today by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve Board. **********Financial Assistance Program **********Loan Purchase **********The bank has a substantial volume of troubled loans. The first major element in the financial assistance program involves removing most of those loans from the bank. **********The loans in question have a face value of over $5.1 billion and a May 31, 1984, book value of approximately $4.5 billion, based on earlier charge- offs by the bank of over $600 million in face value. **********The F.D.I.C. will purchase these loans in two installments. Loans with a May 31, 1984, book value of $3 billion (face value of over $3.6 billion) will be purchased by the F.D.I.C. upon implementation of the program at a price of $2 billion with the bank absorbing a $1 billion charge-off. The bank will have a three-year period to select other loans outstanding on May 31, 1984, with a book value of $1.5 billion and sell them to the F.D.I.C. for $1.5 billion. **********The F.D.I.C. will pay the $3.5 billion purchase price for the loans by agreeing to repay an equal amount in bank borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. The Federal Reserve borrowings assumed by the F.D.I.C. will bear interest at 25 basis points above the three-month Treasury-bill rate, established at the beginning of each quarter. The F.D.I.C. will repay the Federal Reserve borrowings by making quarterly remittances of its collections, less expenses, on the troubled loans. If there is a shortfall at the end of the five years, the F.D.I.C. will make up the deficiency from its own funds. **********The troubled loans will be managed for the F.D.I.C. by the bank under a servicing contract. The F.D.I.C. will have the right to terminate the servicing arrangement, in whole or in part, at any time. The bank may terminate the servicing arrangement upon six months' notice to the F.D.I.C. **********Capital Infusion **********Assuming an immediate transfer of $4.5 billion in book value loans and the $1 billion charge-off in connection with the transfer, the bank would have total assets approximating $30 billion, equity exceeding $800 million and a reserve for loan losses approximating $325 million. To replenish the $1 billion charge-off, the F.D.I.C. will acquire $1 billion in preferred stock in the bank's parent, Continental Illinois Corporation, which must be downstreamed to the bank in the form of equity. Thus, the bank's regulatory capital, which includes reserves, will approximate $2.2 billion, or over 7 percent of assets. **********The $1 billion capital infusion by the F.D.I.C. will be divided into two permanent, nonvoting preferred stock issues. The first issue, in the amount of $720 million, will be convertible into 160 million newly authorized shares of common stock (based upon the average closing price of $4.50 per share from July 10, 1984, through July 16, 1984). This issue will pay no dividends except to the extent dividends are paid on the common stock, in which event the preferred issue will be entitled to dividends equivalent to that which would be paid on 160 million shares of common stock. The second issue, in the amount of $280 million, will be an adjustable-rate, cumulative preferred stock, callable at the option of Continental Illinois. The dividend on the issue will be determined by the highest of three Treasury rates as published by the Federal Reserve. During the first three years, Continental Illinois will have the option to pay this dividend in additional adjustable-rate preferred stock or cash. **********Shareholder Dilution **********Under the $720 million convertible preferred stock issue, the F.D.I.C. will have the right to convert into 160 million shares, or approximately 80 percent, of Continental Illinois Corporation's common stock. The remaining approximately 40 million shares owned by the current shareholders will be transferred to a newly formed corporation. The new corporation will be owned entirely by the current shareholders. At the end of five years, an estimate will be made of the losses, if any, incurred by the F.D.I.C. in connection with its purchase of loans and assumption of Federal Reserve debt. The estimate of losses will be made by three referees, one appointed by the F.D.I.C., one by the new corporation and a third appointed by the other two referees. **********If the F.D.I.C. suffers any loss under the loan purchase arrangement, including carrying costs and expenses of collection, those losses will be compensated for by granting the F.D.I.C. the option to acquire common stock in Continental Illinois Corporation held by the new corporation. The transfer of common stock will be done on the basis of its approximate book value of $20 per share (i.e., the $800 million in shareholder equity at May 31, 1984, after taking into account the $1 billion loan charge-off, divided by 40 million shares). For example, if the F.D.I.C.'s losses are estimated at $800 million at the end of the five-year period, the F.D.I.C. will have a perpetual option to acquire, at $0.00001 per share, all of the 40 million shares of Continental Illinois Corporation common stock held by the new corporation. After this option is acquired by the F.D.I.C., the new corporation could be dissolved and the remaining shares of common stock it holds in the Continental Illinois Corporation, if there are any, distributed to its shareholders. If the F.D.I.C. does not suffer any losses under the loan purchase arrangement (disregarding any profit or loss from its interests in the preferred and common stock), all remaining loans and other assets acquired under the loan purchase arrangement will be returned to the bank. **********The new corporation will not be permitted to pay any dividends until after a final settlement is made with the F.D.I.C. Any dividends received by the new corporation will be available to cover potential F.D.I.C. losses under the loan purchase arrangement. **********Rights Offering **********The current shareholders will be issued a transferable right to acquire, on a pro rata basis, approximately 40 million share of Continental Illinois Corporation at the benchmark market price of $4.50 per share if exercised with 60 days of the effective date of the transaction, or $6 per share if exercised during the subsequent 22 months. If all of the rights are exercised at $6 per share, they will raise an additional $240 million in equity for Continental Illinois Corporation, which must be downstreamed to the bank, and will represent 16Z percent of 240 million authorized shares. The rights and the shares they represent will not be subject to the ''make-whole'' arrangement described above. **********Interim Financial  Aid Program **********Pending approval by the shareholders and consummation of the permanent aid package, the interim $2 billion subordinated loan to the bank from the F.D.I.C. and a group of banks remains in place. Upon consummation of the permanent transaction, this loan will be repaid. Further, the assurance given by the F.D.I.C. on May 17, 1984, that ''all depositors and other general creditors of the bank will be fully protected and service to the bank's customers will not be interrupted'' remains in full force and effect until this permanent aid package is consummated. If the Continental Illinois shareholders should reject the permanent aid transaction, it is intended that the current Federal financial assistance will be withdrawn, which would result in the Comptroller of the Currency declaring the bank insolvent from a liquidity standpoint. In this event, a newly chartered successor bank would be immediately and adequately recapitalized by the F.D.I.C. with liquidity support from the Federal Reserve. Depositors and all other general creditors of the bank would be fully protected against any loss of principal or interest or any delay in funds availability. However, the current shareholders of Continental Illinois would no longer be involved in the ongoing bank. **********Continuing Liquidity  Support **********As part of the interim financial aid program, the Federal Reserve stated that it was prepared, in accordance with customary arrangements, to meet any extraordinary liquidity requirements of the bank pending more permanent arrangements. In light of the F.D.I.C.'s commitment of capital resources to the bank, the Federal Reserve will continue its lending assurance for the period during which F.D.I.C. capital is supplied to the bank. The $5.5 billion funding facility provided by a group of major United States banks will remain in place. **********Cost to the F.D.I.C. **********The F.D.I.C.'s total cash outlay after consummation of the permanent financial assistance program will be $1 billion, $500 million less than under the interim aid program. The ultimate gain or loss to the F.D.I.C. of the permanent assistance package depends on the price it receives when it sells its stock interest in Continental Illinois Corporation and on any losses it incurs under the loan purchase arrangement. At this time, it is not possible to make an accurate forecast of any eventual gains or losses. It is hoped an estimate will be available during 1985, which estimate will be revised from time to time as conditions warrant."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/03/business/wallen-wallis-free-market-believer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 723, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FREE-MARKET BELIEVER", "print_headline": "W.ALLEN WALLIS; FREE-MARKET BELIEVER", "body_text": " **********ONE of George P. Shultz's first moves when he became Secretary of State in late June 1982 was to appoint W. Allen Wallis to a key position in the department. That should have been no surprise. The two economists had developed a fast friendship in the mid-50's, when Mr. Wallis, then dean of the Chicago Graduate School of Business, hired Mr. Shultz to be a professor of industrial relations. **********After the stormy days of his predecessor, Alexander M. Haig Jr., as Secretary of State, ''George Shultz wanted to bring in several people in whom he had great confidence and whose loyalty he did not doubt in the slightest,'' recalled another noted Chicago professor, Nobel laureate economist George Stigler. **********In Allen Wallis, his Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, Mr. Shultz had by his side a true believer in free-market enterprise and minimal government intervention - as well as a staunch supporter of President Reagan. **********That befits the person who, among his other duties, serves as the President's guide - or sherpa - for the annual economic summit meetings, where the governmental chiefs of the seven leading industrialized nations and the European Economic Community meet to try to solve the world's economic puzzles. Mr. Wallis has responsibility for managing the United States sherpa team and negotiating the agenda for the summit conference with the other seven sherpas. Perhaps most important, he will prep President Reagan for the event. The 10th such economic extravaganza - a three-day affair - will begin next Thursday in London. **********At 71, the six-foot four-inch, white- haired Mr. Wallis has the bearing of a old-line New Englander - formally polite, careful of speech, forceful in his opinions, even biting in a gentlemanly way, and quietly doctrinaire. ''He's a Yankee type,'' said Professor Stigler. ''I always thought of him coming out of Maine or New Hampshire, despite the fact he's really from Minnesota. He doesn't suffer fools. He can be both tough and kind.'' **********Mr. Wallis's dabblings in government reach back to New Deal days, when he headed the Government's National Resources Committee studying consumer income and spending. During the Eisenhower Administration he worked with then Vice President Nixon on the Cabinet Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth. It was the first of 11 such Presidential commission on which he served. **********In fact, the man who Professor Stigler credits with saving the Chicago business school from years of neglect - ''It was in wretched condition,'' Professor Stigler said - and substantially upgrading the University of Rochester, never received an advanced economics degree. ''All I have is a B.A. in psychology from the University of Minnesota,'' Mr. Wallis said, who was president of Rochester for 8 years and chancellor for 12, until he went to Washington. **********He didn't begin studying economics until he went to Chicago as a graduate student in 1933, where his classmates and friends included young George Stigler and another free-market thinker and future Nobel laureate in economics, Milton Friedman. Mr. Friedman, in fact, persuaded Mr. Wallis to spend a year of graduate school between 1935 and 1936 at Columbia University in New York studying statistics, a discipline that is considered one of Mr. Wallis's great academic strengths. ''I did have two doctoral theses accepted at Chicago,'' Mr. Wallis added, ''but I had not met some of the minor requirements for a degree.'' An appointment to a full professor of statistics and economics at the Chicago school the next year ended any prospect of completing his advanced economics degree. **********As to his commitment to President Reagan's economic policies, Mr. Wallis claims that he was thinking free- market long before Mr. Reagan, a former union president, took up the cause. ''If we started scrutinizing all the President's policies now, I could find things over which we differ,'' Mr. Wallis said. ''But his emphasis on controlling money and his tax policies I've strongly favored.'' **********His free market spirit has at times even exceeded that of Mr. Friedman. As Professor Stigler tells it, Mr. Wallis sold Mr. Friedman his '57 Plymouth when the professor left Chicago University for a year at Stanford in the late 50's. ''And the car fell apart in a week,'' Professor Stigler said. ''Milton thought he had been taken by Allen. Allen contended that Milton could destroy any car in a week.'' Mr. Wallis still thinks the free market works just fine."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/27/world/inquiry-opens-in-bonn-on-ouster-of-general.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 499, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INQUIRY OPENS IN BONN ON OUSTER OF GENERAL", "print_headline": "INQUIRY OPENS IN BONN ON OUSTER OF GENERAL", "body_text": " **********A committee of Parliament opened an investigation today into the ouster of a four-star general on the ground that he is a homosexual and thus a security risk. **********The general, a deputy commander of NATO, was dismissed by Defense Minister Manfred W\"orner. **********At the same time, the position of the Defense Minister was jolted by a disclosure that he met last week with a Swiss actor who had once falsely called an Austrian Foreign Minister a homosexual. **********Mr. W\"orner has come under increasing pressure to justify his decision to retire Gen.

The general has denied the imputations of homosexuality and sued the Defense Minister to clear his name. **********The Defense Ministry acknowledged that last Friday, the Defense Minister received Alexander Ziegler, an actor, who produced what he said was a tape recording of a young man named Achim, who asserted that he had sexual relations with General Kiessling in 1979. **********Mr. Ziegler reportedly said that he had obtained the tape at a time when he was editing a Swiss homosexual magazine called Thou and I but had been unable to meet the young man's demand for $12,500 to publish it. **********A Defense Ministry spokesman said that in the West German military homosexual activity is banned in the barracks and between soldiers on active duty, though it is not in itself an offense. **********However, the spokesman said, a 1979 ruling by a West German military court upheld the policy of not promoting officers whose homosexuality is ''known and constant.'' He said the authority of such soldiers was ''weakened.'' **********The Swiss actor, according to the daily Frankfurter Rundschau, wrote a political novel in 1975 in which a prominent West German Christian Democratic legislator, thinly disguised, was portrayed as a homosexual.

Occidental Petroleum has pocketed $400 million; Celanese, $300 million; Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea, $200 million (final approval is still pending); Reynolds Metals, $130 million, and AMAX, $100 million. **********While those companies and most others that have killed off a plan to get at the cash have subsequently set up new plans, the terminations have not pleased the employees, most of whom think of money in the pension fund, even surplus money, as belonging collectively to them. **********Most corporations see that money as their own, however, and, despite the employee furor such a move can generate, almost every company with an overfunded plan is at least considering whether to end the pension plan and take the cash. (Sometimes, the motivation is less a need for cash than a fear that such an enticing pool of money will make the company a takeover target.) **********But some people in Congress - including Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat who last month lost his fight to freeze for nine months any pension termination involving the recapture of $1 million or more - believe further action should be taken. **********Others say new restrictions would be inappropriate. ''What we have in this country is a voluntary pension system,'' said David M. Walker, deputy executive director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. ''Regulations forbidding the termination of pension plans could serve as a disincentive to setting up a pension plan in the first place.'' **********Still, the likelihood of more pension terminations is an unpleasant prospect for Federal regulators to ponder - and an enormously interesting one for cash-hungry corporations, as was evident from the enthusiastic turnout for a recent seminar on the topic given by William Mercer-Meidinger Inc., an employee benefits consulting firm. **********As recently as 1981, the big problem with pension funds was underfunding, but these days a combination of factors - among them, the 1982-83 stock run-up, high interest rates, and conservative accounting procedures that value pension assets below their current market value - has left most major pension funds with substantially more assets than needed to pay employees' current benefits. In many cases, it is only a paper surplus, since, if the plan were to continue, most of these companies would still need funds to cover the increased benefits that would be due after continued years of employment - at ever-higher salaries - by the current work force. But if a company terminates the plan and buys annuities to cover the benefits already accrued, it can take back any assets not needed to make the immediate payout. **********Under the new guidelines established by the Labor Department, the Internal Revenue Service and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, termination is allowed as long as the company purchases an annuity for every employee who has accrued pension benefits - whether vested or not. **********As a practical matter, most corporations have tried to soothe employee anger about pension terminations by setting up a new plan to take the place of the old one. In some cases, the company has split its plan into two parts, with retirees getting annuities, while a new pension plan is established for active employees. But since the company pockets surplus assets, the retirees lose money that might have been used for cost-of-living adjustments, and the active employees lose the financial cushion that would keep the new plan healthy in the face of future financial setbacks. Furthermore, pension plans set up in the wake of a termination are usually defined-contribution plans, which are less beneficial to older workers than the defined-benefit plans - guaranteeing retirees a specific level of payments - they tend to replace. **********Under the new guidelines, corporations are not allowed to keep starting and stopping pension plans; such a move will be permitted only once every 15 years. **********''If it's against public policy to do it more than every 15 years, I don't understand why it isn't against public policy to do it at all,'' said a staff aide at the Special Committee on Aging, headed by Senator John Heinz, a Pennsylvania Republican. **********''The fact that there is now a financial incentive to terminate overfunded plans disrupts the private pension system - and since, over the last 10 years, there has been a substantial shift in retirement income so that a smaller portion comes from earnings, and a larger portion from pensions, anything that destabilizes the pension system is a serious problem,'' the aide added."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/03/world/helms-bids-envoy-to-salvador-quit.html": {"writer_name": "Lydia Chavez", "pub_date": "1984-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 927, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HELMS BIDS ENVOY TO SALVADOR QUIT", "print_headline": "HELMS BIDS ENVOY TO SALVADOR QUIT", "body_text": " **********A rightist candidate for Vice President said today that Senator Jesse Helms had demanded the resignation of the United States Ambassador, accusing him of manipulating this country's elections. **********A spokesman for the United States Embassy called the charges ''absolutely false.'' **********The candidate, Hugo Barrera of the Nationalist Republican Alliance party headed by Roberto d'Aubuisson, called a news conference to read a letter he said had been telephoned to the party from the office of Senator Helms, Republican of North Carolina. **********(In Washington, an aide said Senator Helms had written to the President Wednesday urging that Ambassador Thomas R.

Charges Concern Veto **********The letter as read by Mr. Barrera specifically accuses Mr. Pickering of demanding that the provisional President, Alvaro Magana, veto legislation that would have allowed the elections to proceed without an electoral registry. The use of the registry means that voters have to go to an assigned booth; without it, they would have been able to vote anywhere. **********''The charges are absolutely false,'' said Gregory Lagana, a spokesman for the United States Embassy. ''Neither the Ambassador or anyone else in the embassy tried to influence the President in his decision to veto the electoral legislation or that we have favored one party over another.'' **********Only the parties of the far right in the Constituent Assembly supported the legislation, which the President vetoed last week. Moderate politicians said that the credibility of the elections could not be assured without the registry. **********United States Embassy officials said before the first round of elections on March 25 that they had discouraged the Salvadorans from using the registry, which they believed would lower voter turnout. An embassy official said today that they had remained neutral on the issue of whether to drop the registry for the elections Sunday. **********On March 25, many people were unable to find their assigned voting places. But Mr. Magana, in vetoing the legislation, said that many of the problems that occurred then had been solved by the Elections Council. **********In a recent interview Mr. Pickering said the embassy had ''jumped through hoops'' to remain neutral in the elections. He said he had met with both candidates several times in the last month and had told them the United States would support whoever won. **********Western diplomats said the publicity surrounding the letter suggested that the far right was aware that it was in a tough race and was looking for places to put the blame. The voting in the runoff elections Sunday is between Mr. d'Aubuisson and Jose Napoleon Duarte, the candidate of the moderate Christian Democratic Party. **********''Jesse Helms has not yet realized what the rest of the extreme right has realized, that they have lost the election,'' one diplomat said. Mr. Helms has long been a strong supporter of the far right here. **********State Dept. Has No Comment **********WASHINGTON, May 2 - A State Department official said he had no comment on Mr. Helms's letter because the department had not been informed of it. When asked whether Mr. Pickering had expressed a position on the outcome of the Salvadoran elections, the official replied: ''The State Department as well as the Ambassador have repeatedly made it clear that the United States Government supports a democratic electoral process in El Salvador and that the decision on who should be President is entirely a matter up to the Salvadoran people.'' **********The White House also had no comment.

Egypt and Jordan sent military advisers, and the Soviet Union, after some delay, resumed its supply of arms to Baghdad. French contributions to Iraq's armory included advanced fighter aircraft, Super Etendard fighter-bombers and Exocet missiles. **********Iran's revolutionary Islamic Government, headed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, on the other hand, has fought the war in virtual isolation. As its resources dwindled, the Government has sought help from North Korea and Eastern European countries with little success. As a result, the analysts here say, Iran is outnumbered in tanks by a ratio of 2 to 1 and in armored personnel carriers by about 4 to 1. **********Iran Outnumbered in the Air **********Teheran's situation, the analysts say, is even worse in the air. United States intelligence sources say they believe Iran has 75 to 90 operational aircraft, and intelligence estimates are that Iraq has at least 400 operational aircraft, a majority of them Russian- and French-built. The British, who still have a diplomatic mission in Teheran, put the number of Iranian aircraft at about 60 planes and say there is a drastic shortage of spare parts for aircraft. **********Iran's weakness in the air is considered here to be a prime reason for its failure to begin the long promised ''final offensive.'' Without more air power, the analysts said, the Iranian forces are unable to stir out of their forward positions on North and South Majnoon Islands. **********The islands, approximately 13 miles west of the frontier in Iraq, were taken by the Iranians in February in a series of large-scale, costly infantry attacks with a minimum of air support. The losses in this offensive are believed by Western analysts to be another reason for the postponement of the offensive. **********Neither side has disclosed casualty totals. One American intelligence estimate is that the Iranians have suffered more than 50,000 dead and wounded thus far. British and other NATO analysts believe the total is much higher, perhaps 100,000 to 125,000.    Iraqi Casualties Reduced **********Iraq's losses, estimated at about 35,000 in the first two years of the war, are believed to have been sharply reduced since its armies went on the defensive in the middle of 1982. At present Baghdad is concentrating on attacking Iran's oil ports and storage installations in the gulf and on tankers operating there. **********Today, an Iraqi warplane hit a loaded tanker south of Iran's main oil terminal of Kharg Island with an Exocet missile, according to a dispatch from Bahrain carried by The Associated Press. The news agency quoted the captain of the vessel, the Liberian- registered tanker St. Tobias, as saying that the missile caused a fire that was quickly put out by the crew, and that his entire crew escaped injury. **********Earlier today, Iraq announced that it had attacked two ''naval targets'' south of the island; on Monday, Iraq said it attacked ''a large naval target'' south of Kharg, and British intelligence sources said they believed the target might have been an oil tanker. **********These relatively minor actions, intelligence analysts say, constrast sharply with Iraqi operations in the first months of the war. Then a force of at least three divisions smashed into Khuzistan province, a center of the Iranian oil industry, shelled the huge refinery at Abadan to rubble and thrust into Khorramshahr.    Iranian Counteroffensive **********The Iraqi Army, however, was unable to follow up this initial success largely because of losses in equipment and the absence of trained reserves, according to Iraqi sources in Baghdad. In late 1981 and early 1982, the Iranians, employing the remains of the old imperial army and units of Revolutionary Guards, surprised the Iraqis and drove them back across the frontier in most areas.  Since then, according to the intelligence analysts, thousands of Iranians have been killed in what are viewed as futile attacks in three areas - around Basra at the head of the Shatt al Arab, at the frontier east of Al Amarah and, once, in the hills northeast of Baghdad. **********According to Western analysts, none of these offensives, save perhaps the one directed at the Majnoon Islands, produced any true military advantages. One expert here characterized the Iranian losses as ''prohibitive.'' **********In most cases, the analysts said, ill- armed and untrained young soldiers were thrown against well-entrenched and equipped Iraqi regulars. Thousands were killed in action or died from wounds as they lay in blistering heat, which in the actions around Basra reached 120 degrees. **********Iranian Prospects Thought Bleak **********The consensus among Western intelligence officials who have followed the war since the outset is that Iran's prospects for military success must be considered minimal. Iraq, on the other hand, with about half the population of Iran, is believed by intelligence analysts to be reluctant to begin offensive operations because casualties would be greater than those caused by the present defensive strategy. **********The Soviet Union, Iraq's main source of weapons, in the last year has raised the quality of the armaments shipped to that country. The Iraqis, according to British sources, now are receiving Soviet T-72 tanks, other modern armored fighting vehicles and personnel carriers and more MIG jet fighters and fighter-bombers. **********There are also reports here that the Russians, incensed by Iran's treatment of Communists, have recently begun to give covert aid to Baluchi separatists in southeast Iran and to dissident Kurds in the north of the country. One NATO source said the Russians ''have abandoned their last pretences of neutrality in the war.'' **********British sources also report that Teheran, looking almost desperately for friends in the Arab world, has approached Syria to supply more than the light weapons it has already passed on to the Iranian forces. **********Iran's President, Hojatolislam Ali Khameini, these sources said, recently visited Damascus and asked President Hafez al- Assad to join in the struggle against Iraq. Syria's major contribution to Iraq's problems thus far has been to close the larger of the two oil pipelines through which Iraq's oil reaches the Mediterranean and Western markets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/07/business/c-3-army-suit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 69, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "C 3 Army Suit", "print_headline": "C 3 Army Suit", "body_text": " **********C 3 Inc. said a chief trial judge for the Army had found in favor of the company in regard to its suit to lift a temporary Army ban preventing C 3 from receiving new contracts.

The last time we had rains - and they were big rains - was Sept. 30.'' **********''The rains,'' he said, ''are very rare.'' **********Harvest Is Hard to Gauge **********It is virtually impossible for an outsider to know for sure whether much has been harvested in these parts compared with times considered sufficient, and outsiders, too, are targets here for those seeking the benevolence that barren skies and dried lands deny, by habit, to those who live in the belt of countries south of the Sahara. **********But Mr. Diabate, a figure in stained white robes whose eyes are sharp with a kind of humor, insists that this year is different. **********''I am in my 54th year of life,'' he said, ''but I have never seen a year like this.'' The crops have largely failed, he said, and there is no relenting. ''This year it is worse than 1973'' - the year of the last great drought in the region - ''because then we could sell cattle, but now there is no price for cattle. The markets have disappeared. After the many years of drought, people have nothing left to sell.'' **********Each year, he said, this region of 120,000 people requires 20,000 tons of grains, millet and sorghum. ''But since 1968 we have had less and less,'' he said. The harvest this year was 5,500 tons, and the state cannot cover the shortfall, he said, so the trader's markup will blossom with the needs that will worsen into 1985, and those most poor will be those who suffer most. **********In Ouagadougou, Western officials said the estimate was that Burkina Faso, previously called Upper Volta, would need 200,000 tons of emergency food this year to avoid disaster, particularly in areas to the west of here on the Mossi Plateau. Rains, the officials said, have been poor for two years. **********Fears of a Disaster **********According to Western officials, the United States Agency for International Development here has told Washington that it believes the situation could be a disaster unless food aid is received. **********In Mali the prognosis reflects greater hardship, and the estimated need of imported emergency food is 400,000 tons. But once such figures gain currency, the arguments and questions begin. **********Food aid is widely reckoned to have been started by the United States in 1954 to dispose of American farm surpluses. Since then, it has burgeoned and is now divided into three categories: food that is given free to accompany development projects in health or reconstruction or education; food given or sold on concessional terms to developing countries, and food to cope with emergencies and disasters like drought. **********Although few question emergency aid, its manners and modes are the subject of fierce debate because, it is argued, the food often comes too late to be of use and people try to enrich themselves from it. Somalia, for instance, gained a reputation a few years ago for inflating the number of refugees in its camps so that more food would be donated from outside. The aid would then go astray. **********'It Produces Dependence' **********In other areas the issue of food touches on more profound political issues. ''It produces dependence on outsiders, it disrupts the country's own production because it undercuts the local markets and peasants cannot compete,'' a West European aid worker said, reflecting the views of many private aid groups. ''There is no guarantee that it will ever go beyond the cities.'' **********By this argument, imported food changes people's tastes, providing a market for the farmers in donor countries whose surpluses are paid for by their own taxpayers. **********Such are the sensitivities that few aid or relief officials in the sub-Saharan region would publicly criticize, for fear of offending, host governments perceived to be seeking political gain and stability from foreign food shipments. **********Each year some $2 billion worth of food is sent to developing countries from the United States, the European Economic Community and other nations, including Australia and Canada. In this region the level rarely falls below 100,000 tons of food aid a year. ''It has weakened natural forces of self- defense,'' the West European official said. ''You have got to a stage where women won't go to a vaccination center unless they are given a gift of powdered milk.'' **********A Western aid official said there had been instances of governments creating whole sets of statistics around their calculations of the level of food aid they wanted to receive that year. **********In a 1982 study called ''Food Aid and the Developing World,'' however, a British researcher, Christopher Stevens, argued against some of the wholesale condemnation of food aid and suggested instead that food aid was more of a means of financial aid that was too sensitive to acknowledge than a means of development. **********Direct Deliveries **********Around 70 percent of concessional or free food sent to developing countries, according to most estimates, is delivered directly to governments for sale on local commercial markets, thereby relieving those governments of the need to spend hard cash on food and, supposedly, creating revenue for use in other ways. Thus the food aid shipments help stabilize governments, some critics say, but erode their will to improve their own farm techniques or tend the needs of the distant poor who are far from the cities. **********While American and European farmers benefit from food aid, Mr. Stevens says, ''deciding on who the ultimate donors and beneficiaries are is as much a matter of art as of science.'' **********In the tired lands of northern Burkina Faso, there do not seem to be any beneficiaries at all. **********Mr. Diabate and Mr. Emile belong to a private volunteer organization called the Fraternal Union of the Faithful, a mixed Christian-Moslem body that, in small ways with modest wells and feeds that are too expensive for most people, is proving that lost lands can be reclaimed to life if land is tended properly and not overused. **********Their efforts, rooted in villages like Soufoukel, seem all the more striking for their rarity. **********The oases are few and the hard lives are many in places brushed, but not changed, by distant notions of imported modernity. ''Even at the best of times,'' a Western aid worker familiar with the area said, ''things are hard but people get by. That is not always easy for an outsider to understand.'' **********By the standards of those used to great heat, it is the cold season now, a time, in theory, of happiness when crops are harvested and the grass provides pasture. But, Mr. Emile said, during a drive on drifting sand-clogged tracks, there is not much of either this year. **********People talk of ''the exodus,'' the migration of young men to the south to seek food and relief. Up to a third of the people in the Dori region, Mr. Diabate says, may already have gone. **********On the Mossi Plateau, some villages are half-deserted, and the granaries are said to be nearly empty. At a village near Soufoukel called Urarsaba, a 27-year-old man named Hamma Hamadou said, ''We do not know where we will go, only that we will go south to look for food.'' **********An Exit From Hardship **********By noon the sun has turned the dry land between stunted trees to a shimmer of mold and bleached ocher so that the figures from a distance seem spectral - young men in Western clothes with cheap plastic satchels balanced on their heads, marching toward Dori and the tough ride south. Traditionally, in Burkina Faso, migration provides an exit from hardship, so, over the years, hundreds of thousands have left for the Ivory Coast and elsewhere. **********There are other migrations, too. At a water reservoir, one of the few in the region, men from Mali have driven their cattle south to drink, leading long- horned bulls at the head of the herd. **********They will stay and drink, Mr. Emile said, and destroy what little pasture there is by consuming it. And then, they, too, will move on to the south, and, come the early months of next year around April, there will not be much of anything to eat."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/29/business/dow-drops-10.05-points-economic-report-cited.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 540, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Drops 10.05 Points; Economic Report Cited", "print_headline": "Dow Drops 10.05 Points; Economic Report Cited", "body_text": " **********ALEXANDER R.

On the one hand, Carl E. Bagge, president of the National Coal Association, says we shouldn't pass a law until we've satisfied all doubts about several lingering uncertainties. Congressman Henry A. Waxman says we know enough about the problem to do something about it now. On this question, I side with Mr. Waxman. **********But the real battle over acid rain legislation will be fought over another question: Who should pay for acid rain controls? Either the polluters will pay or everyone will, through a Federal tax on electricity. **********Understandably, members of Congress from high-polluting states prefer the cost-sharing option, and say that acid rain is a ''national problem'' which demands a ''national solution.'' Acid rain does cross state lines, and sulfur dioxide from one state may cause acid rain in another state. But is that any reason to tax citizens in states that aren't contributing to the problem? **********Opinion polls say no. The most recent Cambridge Reports Inc. survey (Third Quarter, 1984) found that only 13 percent of those questioned nationwide think the costs ought to be shared by everyone. The overwhelming majority think the polluters should pay. **********Not all states have made the same progress in controlling air pollution. Cost-sharing programs will reward the states that have done the least. **********According to the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, coal- fired utilities in Montana produce very little sulfur dioxide for every unit of electric power they produce. Similarly, utilities in New York State have a relatively low average emission rate - and New York has just passed a law to cut those emissions by one-third more. Montana and New York have cleaned up at their own expense. If every state's utilities were as clean, the overall sulfur dioxide goals in most acid rain bills would aready have been met. **********Just seven of the Ohio Valley states, by contrast, produce more sulfur dioxide than all the rest of the states combined. Utilities in these states have been spared pollution control expenses, so they produce power at lower cost - so much lower that they find it profitable to export power to other states. **********It's simply unfair to ask consumers in Montana or New York, who've already paid their share of pollution control costs, to pay for cleanup in other regions. Up to now, our environmental laws have worked on the principle that the ''polluter should pay.'' It's hard to see why the solution to the acid rain problem should be any different.

Many doctors themselves were choking and shedding profuse tears because of the fumes. **********The superintendent of Hamidia Hospital, the largest and closest to the scene of the leak, was coughing so badly he could not take telephone calls for a critical half hour at the start of the crisis. **********Yet somehow, starting from chaos in the dark of night, the medical system here managed to cope, and cope very well. **********Situation Was Desperate **********According to virtually all experts, both Indian and Western, who have reviewed the handling of the crisis, the medical response was a prodigious success - a fast, intelligent, comprehensive marshaling of manpower, supplies and equipment to meet a need that at first seemed desperate beyond belief. Even a 21-hour strike a few days later by junior physicians protesting an altercation between a senior doctor and a politician did not disrupt the effort. **********More than 2,000 people died as a result of the disaster, most of them in the early hours, but it was agreed that the toll in deaths and permanent impairment could have been vastly higher in the absence of quick and effective medical treatment. **********Many Westerners wonder if the supposedly more advanced medical systems of the industrialized world would have performed any better, or even as well. **********The crisis brought out the best and worst in medical personnel. There were countless unrecorded examples of heroism, hard work and self-sacrifice as hundreds of professionals struggled through the long night and succeeding days to relieve the pain around them. There were also not a few instances of panic as young health workers fled the advancing gas.   One Doctor's Story **********Dr. Pradeep Chourey, a physician in training at Hamidia Hospital, was typical of hundreds of young doctors who responded to the crisis. He was sleeping in a nearby hostel for medical personnel when he awakened shortly after 1 A.M. because he found it difficult to breathe. Thinking the room stuffy, he opened a window to let in fresh air and was hit with a whiff of the toxic gas, known as methyl isocyanate. **********Breathing became more difficult, he said, and his eyes felt as though chili powder had been thrown into them. **********With dozens of his colleagues, Dr. Chourey ran to the hospital for help. There they found the doctors on duty suffering from the same problems. They washed their eyes out with cold water and doused themselves with eye drops to gain some relief. Most also put wet cloths or handkerchiefs over their faces for protection against the gas. **********Then they settled down to a nightmare. For the next four days, Dr. Chourey worked around the clock ministering to thousands of patients, snatching only two or three hours of sleep at a time wherever he could find free space in the crowded hospital.   Others Fled in Panic **********Dozens of other students and doctors fled in panic before the advancing gas. One group of 15 to 25 students begged the hospital superintendent to send them to safety in a bus. When he pointed out that the driver was not available so early in the morning, they virtually hijacked an ambulance and told the driver to take them to a place of refuge five or six miles away. **********Another young doctor, a resident in internal medicine, acknowledged that, after discovering the gas invading the hospital, he took a whiff of oxygen to ease his breathing difficulties, then roared away on a motorcycle to ''a faraway place,'' a small community on a distant hill. After a few hours' sleep, he said, he returned and plunged into a continuous round of hospital duties. By that time, the gas had dissipated. **********The medical team was aided by a fortuitous circumstance; the Union Carbide plant is less than two miles from Hamidia, the main teaching hospital for Gandhi Medical College, which is perhaps the leading medical school in Madhya Pradesh, the state of which Bhopal is the capital. **********The school has 1,000 undergraduate and graduate medical students and 150 faculty members. The teaching hospital has additional hundreds of health professionals, all of whom were close by and easily summoned in an emergency. The hospital had plenty of medicines. And its sophisticated administrators knew precisely how to tap into India's medical network and quickly produce additional manpower, drugs and equipment.   Hospital Is Region's Biggest **********The gas victims were lucky that the nearest hospital happened to be the biggest, the best staffed and the best stocked in the area. Had the accident occurred at a rural site, the death toll would presumably have been far lower, but medical aid for the victims would also have been far less effective. **********Western experts who have reviewed the medical steps taken here have been unanimous in their praise. ''I have nothing but the greatest admiration,'' Dr. G. Peter Halberg, head of clinical ophthalmology at New York Medical College, said at a news conference recently. ''The fact that we are not faced with an enormous disaster in ophthalmology is due to the readiness, to the very intelligent way'' in which the emergency was handled, said Dr. Halberg, who came here at the invitation of Union Carbide and the Indian Government to study the situation. **********A team of experts from the United States Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta also told reporters they were impressed with the Indian response to the crisis. And Philip E. Schambra, the science attache at the United States Embassy in New Delhi, concluded after extensive briefings and a visit to Bhopal that ''the medical teams did as good a job as could be expected under the difficult circumstances.''  No Count of Patients Kept **********The first victims began streaming into Hamidia around 2 A.M., and by 4:15 military trucks and buses were dropping off scores of patients every five to seven minutes. Nobody knows how many victims came to the hospital that day; the crush was so great that no count could be kept. The informed estimates range from that of the medical department's chief - 15,000, he guessed - to 25,000, the estimate given by the head of ophthalmology. **********At the four other hospitals in Bhopal, meanwhile, there were similar scenes. Dr. M. N. Nagu, director of medical services for Madhya Pradesh, was driving toward the United Carbide plant to survey the accident scene when his eyes started to water, his throat began to choke and a mob suddenly surrounded his car. **********Some 40 panicky people climbed into the car, sat on the hood and roof and squeezed into the luggage compartment, Dr. Nagu said. He drove them slowly to a small hospital nearby where groggy doctors, still in their sleeping gowns, provided care. **********At Jayaprakash Hospital, the leading public hospital here, thousands of people began arriving by 2:30 A.M. The staff quickly discharged all patients who were not seriously ill, and somehow squeezed 800 of the newcomers into the hospital, which has 150 beds, while treating thousands of others outside.   Medical Care Teams Formed **********At Hamidia, doctors quickly threw up counters on the grounds outside the building. Each was manned by 8 to 10 doctors, supplemented by students, nurses, paramedics and volunteers. They provided immediate care to the victims and decided which cases were severe enough to require admission to the hospital. **********By the count of one department head, 1,900 patients were admitted to the hospital that first day, even though it has only 760 beds. The patients were put down everywhere, on the stone floors, on the veranda, in the hallways, often without blankets to lie on, jammed shoulder-to-shoulder. The doctors had little room in which to step. **********At its best, Hamidia has the battered, peeling look of an aging urban high school in a depressed area. On the night of the tragedy, it looked like a war zone, particularly after two dozen large tents were pitched outside to house the overflow.   An Influx of Helpers **********Somehow, despite some anxious moments at the height of the early crush, there always seemed to be enough staff, drugs and equipment to meet the demand. According to Dr. Nagu, the 500 physicians who live in Bhopal, a city of 900,000, were supplemented at one time or another by 350 doctors from other districts. **********There was an influx of nurses, paramedics and other health workers. Well over 1,000 volunteers from civic groups helped fashion makeshift stretchers from poles and blankets and performed the myriad menial chores required to keep a hospital functioning. **********Often, the medical help from outside was proffered without request. The Indian Health Organization in Bombay, a private voluntary group, sent four doctors, eight nurses and three medical social workers who operated almost as an independent unit. **********Critical equipment needs were met by the central Government and nearby cities. Bhopal had only about 100 oxygen cylinders for those with severely injured lungs, but the Government quickly flew in 120 more, and nearby medical centers sent in a like number.   Equipment Flown From Europe **********A shipment of ''flow regulators'' allowed the cylinders to be used for several patients at a time, and a local company kept recharging the empty cylinders. Respirators, suction machines to clear the lungs and oxygen masks, initially in short supply, were flown in from Britain and France. Drugs flooded in from other Indian medical centers. ''There was never a shortage of medicine at any time at any stage,'' said Dr. N. R. Bhandari, the superintendent of Hamidia. **********During the second and third days after the accident, some 35 mobile teams, each consisting of two doctors, a nurse, a pharmacist and paramedics, were out looking for victims too weak to be able to get to the hospitals. **********Most doctors here say there was never a critical lack of anything and that all patients were treated, even during the worst of the crush on the first day. ''No patient can say that he or she was not attended to,'' said Dr. Brij B. L. Mathur, dean of the Gandhi Medical College. Hamidia alone treated more than 70,000 victims. And Dr. Nagu estimates that, in all, more than 150,000 were treated by health personnel in Bhopal or neighboring cities. **********The chief medical problems were eye injuries and respiratory distress. Almost all victims experienced at least minor eye irritation, and some were temporarily blinded. The eye victims were told to wash their eyes in clear water, then were given eye examinations and antibiotic drops to prevent secondary infections.   Threat of Blindness Combated **********If there was danger of damage to the cornea, they were given fast-acting atropine drops to dilate the pupils and thus block the formation of a membrane that might cause permanent blindness. And, if necessary, an array of other eyedrops and anti-inflammatory steroids was brought to bear. **********For those having trouble breathing, there were drugs to reduce inflammation of the lungs, other drugs to dilate the bronchial tubes and ease breathing, oxygen for those most severely affected and, in cases where the larynx had swelled unbearably, surgery to insert a tube through a small hole in the trachea. **********By the end of the first week, it was clear that the medical challenge had been met, and doctors here began to relax and enjoy the acclaim for their accomplishment. Some even joked about the secret of their success. **********In a laughing gibe at India's reputation for endless bureaucratic delay and confusion, Dr. Krishan P. Mehra, director of medical education for Madhya Pradesh, commented: **********''In a crisis, we do our best work. There was no confusion here because there was no time to have it planned out. There was no confusion here because no one was issuing orders and no one was following orders. It was all functioning without central command.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/22/business/japan-s-wary-financial-revolution.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 614, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JAPAN'S WARY FINANCIAL REVOLUTION", "print_headline": "JAPAN'S WARY FINANCIAL REVOLUTION", "body_text": " **********Steve Loh r TOY TRADE talks between two nations typically have **********their theatrical aspect, as both sides position for **********advantage. Understatement is not part of the formula. Even so, Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan's fist-pounding performance in Tokyo last month was extraordinary. **********The subject of his broadside was the slow pace of Japan's program to open up its financial markets to outsiders - particularly to American banks and brokerage firms - and to permit the yen to be more widely used in international transactions. Last November, when President Reagan had visited Tokyo, the Japanese Government had agreed to take steps to strengthen the yen's value against the dollar in an effort to reduce the huge American trade deficit with Japan. **********But that promise has not been carried out, Mr. Regan charged. So far, the Japanese Government's approach has been all conversation and little action, he said. Then, thumping the rostrum for emphasis, he added, ''We find it intolerable that Japan cannot move faster in opening up its financial markets.'' **********Undoubtedly, Mr. Regan is far more accustomed to the headlong speed at which the United States has been deregulating its financial markets since 1980. But despite his impatience, the Japanese are deregulating, too - responding not only to American pressure, but also to domestic demands to revamp a system that pays low interest on savings and keeps the yen too much at home for a major trading nation. **********The Japanese are also responding to the upward pressure on interest rates exerted by a growing Government budget deficit. Specifically, the major banks are becoming increasingly rebellious about rules that require them to buy millions of dollars of Treasury bonds to finance the deficit at low, Government-set rates. They want to let those rates fluctuate with market forces. **********So the Japanese are embarking on their version of the financial revolution that in America liberated bank rates, created fresh ways for the small saver to earn high interest on his money and lifted many of the restrictions that kept banks, insurance companies and investment firms out of new enterprises. In Japan, however, the march into the new era will not, by all accounts, go as far as it has in the United States toward truly free financial markets - the sort of freedom that permits a Citibank or an American Express or a Prudential- Bache to become a financial service giant offering ''one-stop'' financial shopping and an array of investments. **********Still, the direction is much the same. The Ministry of Finance, an elite bureaucracy that carefully regulates the Japanese economy, is finally letting bank interest rates rise. Among the signs of this: Consumers, for the first time, are being allowed to open money market deposit accounts at commercial banks that pay market level interest rates, which in Japan are 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 percent. Starting this month, the Ministry is taking steps to allow wider use of the yen by foreigners. And the lifting of other regulations over the past two years has quickened the flow of money sent out of Japan, usually by Japanese investors buying bonds in America. **********How fast further changes should come is a hotly debated topic in Tokyo. Mr. Regan wants the Japanese Government to permit American banks and investment firms to set up shop in Japan, so they can get in on brokerage and underwriting activities here, as well as the management of Japan's $52 billion in pension funds - an amount that is likely to grow to $300 billion by 1995.

Mr. Singh and other officials had expressed anxiety over what could happen during the process. **********Three basic methods of disposal are understood to have been considered. These include feeding small amounts of the chemical through a ''scrubber,'' a device that neutralizes it; packing the residue, which apparently is in liquid form, into drums for shipment elsewhere, and converting it into pesticide. **********Though all three methods were considered to involve some risk, Mr. Singh said today that the pesticide-conversion approach was chosen by scientists because it was ''the most practical and safer way.'' **********Scientists at Work in Plant **********The procedure is to be supervised by Dr. S.

The most important of them, he told reporters, will be the use of a helicopter to spray water all around the factory. He said it was likely that a ''foul smell'' would be produced during the conversion, but that this would not signify any danger. **********As Mr. Singh spoke, an exodus from the city estimated by Indian news agencies to have amounted to 40,000 people over the last four days continued to grow. **********The main bus station was in pandemonium - though there were no signs of anything approaching panic - as whole families arrived to take buses to somewhere else. **********Extra Buses Requisitioned **********The number of bus passengers has doubled in the last four days, officials said, and 90 buses have been requisitioned from other parts of Madhya Pradesh to handle the rush.

Before the order takes effect, President Reagan will have 60 days to accept or alter it. **********Yesterday's ruling was another major victory for Apple and other computer makers that have been fighting imitators, both foreign and domestic. In September, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that the Franklin Computer Corporation of New Jersey had violated Apple's copyrights on computer programs known as operating systems, which are etched on a computer's circuitry. **********That case was the first to establish that all computer programs, or software, can be copyrighted, even if they are indistinguishable from a computer's hardware. Franklin has agreed to pay Apple $2.5 million in damages and to design its own programs for its Apple-compatible machines. In the last month, the International Business Machines Corporation has obtained consent decrees in Federal court against two manufacturers of machines compatible with the I.B.M. Personal Computer. **********The commission ruling yesterday, which involved copies of the Apple IIe, means that computer makers may have a more powerful weapon against the foreign manufacturers, primarily in Taiwan and South Korea, whose relatively inexpensive machines are sold under names such as Pineapple and Orange. **********''To the extent that other manufacturers have valid copyrights on their software, this means they will also be able to seek protection,'' Michael Stein, the commission's general counsel, said last night. **********The commission's ruling was unusual because traditional import restrictions on products such as steel or televisions are usually based on a finding of unfair pricing. Relatively few have involved copyright issues. **********''It was a extraordinarily difficult question for us,'' Mr. Stein said. ''But the Franklin case offered some guidance.'' **********The ruling may prove most important for the precedent it sets. The number of imitation Apples appears to be declining, primarily because Apple has been forced by competition to cut the Apple IIe price almost in half, to about $1,400. Foreign-built machines cost from $800 to $1,100. **********Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., has pursued foreign manufacturers overseas, as well. Last month in Taipei, Taiwan, the owners of six local companies were sentenced to eight months in prison for illegally reproducing Apple designs. **********Nevertheless, Albert A. Eisenstat, Apple's vice president and general counsel, said: ''The impact of this is that we no longer have to fight imitators case by case. We can now have Customs issue a blanket order to seize the machines.'' **********It was unclear, however, whether yesterday's order also covered Apple imitations that do not contain the computer chip, known as a ROM, for ''read only memory.'' The chip contains the copy of Apple's program that tells the computer where to store information and how to perform other essential functions. **********To evade Customs officials, machines have been imported without the offending ROM chip. The chips are inserted later. **********Apple has sought to exclude the ROM-less computers as well. ''We will have to wait until the judgment is issued before we determine if that was a success,'' Mr. Eisenstat said. **********The move to ban imitations was vigorously opposed by several importers. **********One of the companies inserting ROM's in the United States is the Collins International Trading Corporation of Los Angeles, which sells a $1,100 computer called the Orange Plus II.

''What does a 1 percent change in market share mean in a $50 billion industry? About $500 million. It has enormous financial consequences.'' **********Under the concept known as equal access, Charleston customers will be the first in the nation to be able to connect with A.T.& T. or its rivals simply by dialing ''1'' before the telephone number. Now, customers wanting to use a rival carrier must dial as many as 11 extra numbers. **********The changes result from regulatory rulings and the antitrust settlement breaking up A.T.& T. in January and ordering local telephone companies to provide all long-distance carriers with the same quality connections as A.T.& T. enjoys. **********As a result customers, after decades of dealing with Ma Bell as a regulated monopoly, must designate which long-distance company will handle their calls. And with a unique opportunity to win a big block of customers at once, the carriers are offering rate cuts, certain free calls and other incentives to get people, particularly businesses, to enlist. **********Savings Promised **********The competitors are trying to woo A.T.& T.'s high-volume, profitable customers with promises of savings of 20 to 25 percent off A.T.& T.'s rates. On the counterattack, A.T.& T. says the savings are temporary because its competitors' rates are headed up, and that customers may be taking risks turning to less-established suppliers. **********In Charleston, 11 of the 25 city exchanges will get equal access on July 15, accounting for 34,000 customers and $10.5 million in annual long-distance revenues. The MCI Communications Corporation, the nation's second-largest long-distance supplier, the No. 3 GTE Sprint Communications Corporation and three smaller companies are vying with A.T.& T. for those customers with a barrage of sales calls, advertising, direct mail and telephone marketing. **********MCI is spending $20 million this year - a third of its total marketing budget - to market equal access in those areas where it will become available this year. Of that, $500,000 is being spent in Charleston alone. MCI is seeking 10 percent or more of national toll revenues, about double its current share.  At last count, 771 exchanges in 134 locations, including Chinatown, Little Italy and Wall Street in Manhattan, were scheduled to get equal access this year, and marketing campaigns are already under way in those areas. Most other exchanges will have it by 1986, and A.T.& T. estimates it will have 400 competitors nationally. **********''A.T.& T. has got a lot to lose in this thing,'' Mr. Doll said. ''All of their maneuvers have got to be to shore up and protect their existing market.'' **********Market Share Eroding **********A.T.& T.'s market share is already eroding. In 1982, when it operated the nation's long-distance network with independent and Bell local telephone companies, it controlled almost 93 percent of the nation's toll revenues. MCI had about half of the rest. **********Now, according to A.T.& T. figures, it has 57.3 percent of total long-distance revenues. The competitors' share has jumped to 10 percent, and local telephone companies, now independent, collect the rest. **********Since April 15, when the sign-ups began in Charleston, A.T.& T. has won about 12,000 customers, or 35 percent, while MCI has captured about 5,200 customers, or 15 percent. With three weeks remaining in the sign-up period, the figures suggest that as many as a third of the eligible phone users have yet to pick a carrier. **********The sales efforts range from slick promotions, directed at residential callers, such as MCI's ''Dial-a-Dad,'' a free call home on Father's Day, to earnest calls on large and small corporate clients. **********The businesses in Charleston that will soon get equal access account for 12 percent of equal access customers but 42 percent of the revenues, with average annual long-distance bills of $1,107, according to A.T.& T. Residential customers, in contrast, make up 88 percent of the customers but generate only 58 percent of the revenues. The mean residential toll bill is $207 a year. **********Emphasis on High Volume **********No one is turning away residential customers. But sales efforts are generally directed at higher-volume callers, those who make more than $10 in long-distance calls a month. Indeed, 1.7 percent of the businesses in Charleston account for 58 percent of business long-distance revenues; 10 percent of households account for 51 percent of residential long-distance revenues. **********''The high-volume line is the plum all the competitors are reaching for,'' said MCI spokesman Don Campbell. **********''It's just a free-for-all to see who can get the profitable business,'' said Neil Yelsey, telecommunications analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. **********Sprint claims to have signed up 20 percent of all Charleston business customers with monthly toll bills of $250 or more. But A.T.& T. it scored an early victory by signing up Union Carbide's three Charleston plants, the area's largest business account, with toll billings reportedly exceeding $18,000 monthly, in addition to its Wide Area Telephone Service, or WATS line service. **********Many bigger customers are still up for grabs, however, including the top prize - the $5 million-a-year state Government contract. **********Cleaning Shrimp **********So aggressive is the free-for-all that one MCI salesman cleaned shrimp for an hour recently to get the attention of a busy restaurant owner. Three pounds later, he left with the account. ''It was unreal,'' the salesman, Gary Whittington, said. **********Mr. Whittington, as well as his counterparts at Sprint and the other rival carriers, is selling mainly low rates. For example, customers with monthly bills of $25 or more who make a 10-minute call after 5 P.M. from New York to Los Angeles will pay $2.52 on Sprint, and $3.09 on A.T.& T. **********But rate differences are likely to be narrower in the future. A.T.& T.'s competitors now pay local operating companies 55 percent less than A.T.& T. for handling long-distance calls in the local network. As equal access and equal quality are phased in, A.T.& T.'s rivals will surrender that discount. **********Because customers who decide to switch carriers later will only have to pay $5, the risks for the smaller competitors may be as great as the rewards. If the carriers add customers too fast and overload their networks, for example, or do not measure up to performance promises, disgruntled customers would likely return to A.T.& T. **********'A Very Big Test' **********''This is a very big test for them,'' said Joseph Raymond, vice president of operations at the Kanawha Banking and Trust Company, which picked MCI. ''If they can't come through with the service and the savings aren't there, we'll find another way to do it.'' **********For its part, A.T.& T. is trying to build ''brand loyalty'' among current customers. It is telling corporate clients that its technical expertise, service and proven track record are worth the extra, if not temporary, cost of its service. **********To customers in Charleston, where the salt producers who built this city formed the nation's first monopoly in 1817 but later saw it dissolved by court order, the battle over long distance is getting tiresome. **********''Everywhere you turn, they're sticking something in your hand. We're getting junk mail all the time,'' said John C. Dixon, a dentist. ''I figure it's all going to even out in the end.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/30/business/japan-s-push-in-fiber-optics.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1984-07-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2173, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JAPAN'S PUSH IN FIBER OPTICS", "print_headline": "JAPAN'S PUSH IN FIBER OPTICS", "body_text": " **********Posters of pinup girls dot the walls, and a giant picture of a Playboy bunny is painted on the side of the Van de Graaf accelerator. **********This laboratory, which takes up only one floor of a nondescript Fujitsu Ltd. building, hardly seems like the kind of place that would unnerve American industry. But the Optoelectronics Joint Research Laboratory is indeed the center of one of those industrial efforts funded by Japan's Government for which the nation is known. **********The mission of the laboratory's 50 researchers, who pad about the place in slippers, is to spearhead Japan's thrust into the emerging field of optoelectronics - the combination of light, usually from lasers, and electronics. **********Optoelectronic technology is used now mainly to provide long-distance telephone communications through hair-thin glass optical fibers that can transmit information hundreds of times faster than conventional copper wires. **********But Japan envisions much broader uses. It hopes that light will do many of the things now done by electronics, only faster. The nation, which is somewhat behind the United States in electronics, is making a wholesale commitment to leapfrogging to the next generation of technology using light, bringing about what some avid boosters here have called ''Optopia.'' **********The nation's phone company, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, hopes to extend optical fibers to every home and business in the nation, allowing for two-way television, computer communications and electronic newspaper delivery. **********Wide Variety of Applications **********Industrial planners envision optical control networks in factories. Optical fibers could transmit images from the inside of furnaces, where cameras cannot now peer; optical sensors could monitor pressure of industrial processes, while optical imaging devices could inspect products rolling off the assembly line and optical fibers could funnel the information at the speed of light to control computers. **********Optical disks, which use lasers to read information stored on shiny platters, can store huge amounts of information. Digital audio disks, a consumer application of such technology, can provide an hour of music on one side of a disk the size of a 45-r.p.m. single with much higher quality sound than on conventional records. The laser videodisk, can store 54,000 pictures and allow any of them to be viewed in an instant. In the future, such optical disks will be used to store hundreds of times more computer data than the magnetic disks used now. **********But for optics to compete fully with electronics, the optical equivalent of the electronic integrated circuit must be developed. That is the mission of the Optoelectronics lab. **********''Unless we succeed in getting these devices, the future optics applications will be limited,'' said Masahiro Hirano, head of research planning at the lab. **********Impressive Gains Made **********Japan, a rather late starter behind the United States in electronics, is making impressive gains in the newer field. One indication of that came earlier this month when a team of Pentagon scientists came here to look at Japanese technology for possible military use and focused on optoelectronics. **********''It's a well known fact that the Japanese industry is very capable in this area,'' said one member of the mission. ''The Japanese have captured a large part of the world market in commercial high technology electro-optics.'' **********The worldwide market for optical- fiber communications equipment is expected to grow from $756 million in 1984 to more than $3 billion by 1989, according to Kessler Marketing Intelligence in Newport, R.I. **********The Japanese companies have won major contracts around the world and in the United States. Fujitsu Ltd., for instance, is supplying components to the MCI Corporation and Pacific Bell, a unit of the Pacific Telesis Group. **********The Japanese also have about 40 percent of the $1 billion world market for optoelectronic components, compared with 35 percent for American companies, according to Dataquest, a market research concern. The components are the devices that either emit or detect light at either end of the fiber. **********Lead in Consumer Items **********Much of the Japanese lead in market share stems from the relatively easy-to-make consumer items, such as low-performance lasers used in compact disk and videodisk players, and light-emitting diodes, the tiny devices that were once common in displays of watches and calculators and that are now used in electronic appliances. **********But the Japanese are also strong in high performance semiconductor lasers, which emit pin-prick-sized pulses of light that travel through the optical fibers. Even the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, an American leader in optoelectronics, is using Hitachi semiconductor lasers in some of its systems. **********Japan's skill has been developed largely at two Government-owned laboratories: the Electro Technical Laboratory in Tsukuba, and N.T.T. Laboratories, the Japanese counterpart of Bell Laboratories in the United States. **********New Process Developed **********N.T.T. labs, together with three cable manufacturers, developed a new way of mass producing optical fibers. **********The previous processes, pioneered by A.T.& T. and Corning Glass Works, involve forming glass rods, known as preforms, which are drawn into thin fibers by melting one end. To make the preform, glass is deposited, layer by layer, on the inside or outside of a tube that serves as the foundation. But the preform can be only as long as the foundation tube and the size of the preform limits the amount of fiber that can be made at any one time. **********The technique developed by the Japanese, called vapor-phase axial deposition, involves depositing glass at the bottom of the preform rather than along the sides. There is thus no limit to how long the preform can be. It is even possible to make fiber manufacturing a continuous process, with fiber drawn from one end of the preform while new glass is deposited at the other end. **********''The method is hard to control, but once you control it you can get a continuously and endlessly long preform that way,'' said Tsuneo Nakahara, executive managing director of Sumitomo Electric Industries, Japan's largest producer of fiber-optic cables. **********Japan's thrust has proven controversial. American companies, particularly Corning, have accused N.T.T. of paying inflated prices for optical fiber, virtually all of which is purchased from Japanese companies. These higher prices, Corning claims, subsidize cable exports by allowing Japanese companies to sell fiber abroad at less than cost. N.T.T. and the cable companies counter that N.T.T. has special specifications that account for the higher price. **********Patent Infringement Charged **********Corning also claims that Sumitomo's fiber infringes on Corning's patents. Corning has won its case in Canada and is pursuing an action with the International Trade Commission in the United States to keep Sumitomo fiber out of the country. **********Corning's basic patents are ''big trouble for us,'' said Koichi Kujirai, executive director of the Optoelectronic Industry and Technology Development Association, a trade group with 180 members that was formed in 1980. **********The Japanese have also suffered other problems in trying to penetrate the American market, which is the world's largest for optical fibers. A.T.& T. in 1981 rescinded a big contract to Fujitsu Ltd. for part of a fiber-optic link between Boston and Washington. Some Government officials objected to a foreign company's providing such a vital communications link. A.T.& T. has since said it will award contracts only to domestic suppliers. But the NEC Corporation and Fujitsu, both of which supply electronic parts for fiber communications, are building plants in the United States to get around that barrier. **********Domestic Use Encouraged **********Japan is also encouraging optical technology development at home. N.T.T. is installing an optical fiber ''information highway'' that will cross the nation from north to south and eventually branch off into every home. **********Japanese companies are also using optical fibers in more complex networks to provide everything from cable television programs to office computer networks. Many of these functions are performed adequately in the United States using coaxial cable. But the Japanese hope that greater use of the technology will bring more expertise. **********''The applications are much broader right now than they are in the United States,'' said John Kessler, president of Kessler Marketing Intelligence. **********The Tokyo Electric Power Company, for instance, is stringing optical fibers along its power lines along with the usual electric wires. When there is a break in the power line the optical fibers transmit the information back to central control and to relays that isolate the broken line. Such communication has been done in the past with microwave radio, which is subject to electromagnetic interference from the power cables. **********The Nippon Kokan Company's Fukuyama Works, the largest iron mill in the world, uses optical fibers to relay information from the basic oxygen furnaces and blast furnaces to control computers. The optical fibers can transmit a thousand times more information than conventional wire and are immune to the electrical interference. **********Use in Traffic Control **********As cars cascade down the Hanshin Expressway to Osaka each rush hour they are watched by video cameras spaced every two kilometers. The images from the cameras are carried back to the traffic control headquarters by optical fibers. **********Some of the cars on the expressway also use optical fibers. The Nissan Motor Company uses optical fibers in its high-priced Cedric and Leopard models to transmit control signals for the radio, air conditioner and cruise control. Since one tiny fiber can replace several bulky wires, it is possible to mount the control buttons for all those appliances in the steering wheel rather than on the dashboard. **********Inefficient Routing **********The headquarters buildings of the Toshiba Corporation, Hitachi Ltd. and many other companies are using optical fibers to connect computers throughout the building. But to use such optical fibers in complex networks, the light signals must be properly routed, like telephone signals are routed through a switchboard or electronic signals routed through a computer. This is where the development of the optoelectronic integrated circuit comes in. **********So far, such switching is done by converting the light signals back to electric signals, switching the electric signals, and then converting them back to light signals. Such a process is expensive and inefficient. **********Moreover, today, each optical component is a separate part, like transistors were in the 1950's. The electronics industry did not start making great strides in power and reductions in cost until hundreds and thousands of such components could be produced on a single chip, the integrated circuit. **********The optoelectronic integrated circuit would do for its industry what the integrated circuit did for microelectronics. **********The lab's sole purpose is to develop basic technology for such a circuit so that optical devices and electronic circuits could be combined on a single chip, making conversions from light to electricity and back to light cheap and efficient. **********The optoelectronic integrated circuit project, which began in 1981, is a six-year endeavor, with funding of $80 million for the entire period. Nine corporate sponsors and one national laboratory contribute personnel and a small amount of additional funding. **********Gallium Arsenide Chips **********Much of the lab's concentration is on developing the material out of which the chips will be made. Silicon, the material used in electronic chips, cannot emit light and so cannot be used for the optical circuits. The most likely candidate is therefore gallium arsenide, a somewhat difficult material that can be used for both electronic and optical circuits. **********But while silicon technology is well advanced, gallium arsenide technology is in its infancy. The joint laboratory is concentrating its efforts on producing pure gallium arsenide, free of tiny defects that can render a circuit inoperable. Currently, gallium arsenide has 10,000 or more crystalline defects, known as dislocations, per square centimeter, meaning that the vast majority of devices made from a wafer of gallium arsenide would defective. The optoelectronic lab has reduced that number to 1,000 and hopes to have dislocation- free gallium arsenide by the end of the year. **********Others are making similar progress. Sumitomo Electric Industries, which claims to be the world's largest supplier of gallium arsenide, has recently said it had produced material with low levels of dislocations. The Hughes Aircraft Company in the United States has made similar accomplishments. **********Other progress is taking place in private companies. The Toshiba Corporation recently announced the manufacture of an optical multiplexer, a device with five laser diodes. This device would feed five separate light signals, each at a different wavelength, into a single optical fiber. NEC also recently announced the development of what it claimed to be the fastest optoelectronic circuit - a light source that can flash on and off 2 billion times a second, making it possible to send even more information through a fiber. **********Eventually it will be possible to make circuits that process light directly, without having to convert it to electricity. That would lead to extremely fast computers that operate on light. But such optical computers are decades away."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/10/world/brazil-s-rulers-await-defeat-in-vote.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Riding", "pub_date": "1984-12-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 826, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRAZIL'S RULERS AWAIT DEFEAT IN VOTE", "print_headline": "BRAZIL'S RULERS AWAIT DEFEAT IN VOTE", "body_text": " **********Five weeks before Brazil's indirect presidential election, the departing military Government seems to have accepted the anticipated defeat of its candidate and has begun working to insure a smooth transition to opposition civilian rule. **********Although the opposition candidate, Tancredo Neves, has long been favored to win the vote Jan. 15 in the Electoral College, there had been speculation that the Government might alter the succession rules in a last-minute effort to gain an official victory. **********But over the last three weeks, the Government of President Joao Baptista Figueiredo has seemingly abandoned the Democratic Social Party's candidate, Paulo Salim Maluf, with leading officials now openly referring to his defeat as unavoidable. **********The Supreme Electoral Tribunal has also blocked moves to require Electoral College delegates to vote along party lines. The ruling party held a 36- seat majority in the Electoral College, but a large group of its congressmen who opposed Mr. Maluf's candidacy will be permitted to support Mr. Neves. **********Private Contacts **********Perhaps most crucial to avoiding tensions between the old and new regimes, the Figueiredo Government has initiated private contacts with Mr. Neves and his team to discuss crucial political, military and economic questions related to the transition. The new administration will take office March 15. **********The Government's new approach was illustrated late last month when the strongly conservative army commander in Brasilia, Gen. Newton Cruz, was reassigned to a bureaucratic post without troop command. The move reassured the opposition that no unpleasant surprises would await them during the meeting of the 686-member Electoral College next month. **********Coincidentally, word leaked out that Mr. Neves, a 74-year-old former Governor of Minas Gerais state, had met twice in private with the Army Minister, Gen. Walter Pires, who has frequently warned of the dangers of a resurgence of the leftist agitation that provoked the 1964 military coup. **********Opposition sources said that Mr. Neves used the occasions to pledge that he would permit no reprisals against members of past military regimes, easing fears among the armed forces that Brazil's first civilian administration in two decades would follow the example of Argentina's new Government in prosecuting former junta members.   Economic Transition Team **********At the same time, the appointment of Jose Serra, Sao Paulo state's Planning Secretary, to head Mr. Neves's economic transition team has reassured foreign and domestic business circles that the next government will adopt no radical or populist measures. Mr. Serra is said to have warm relations with the military Government's Planning Minister, Ant^onio Delfim Netto. **********On the most important economic question to be decided over the next three months, Mr. Neves has privately endorsed Mr. Delfim Netto's strategy of seeking a multiyear renegotiation of almost half of Brazil's $98 billion foreign debt so that repayment will be stretched over 12 to 14 years. **********As a result of the sudden warming of relations between Government and opposition, Mr. Neves has emerged clearly as the consensus candidate for the Presidency, with even the armed forces joining leading bankers and industrialists and the political establishment in viewing him as a figure of conciliation and moderation. **********In contrast, while Mr. Neves also has the support of leftist groups and the overwhelming majority of public opinion, many politicians who favor a drastic break with the past have resigned themselves to an opposition administration that will maintain many of the austere economic policies of the Figueiredo Government.   Criticism by Maluf **********Other political premises have also been overturned in recent weeks. Although Mr. Neves continues to speak at well-attended public meetings, the sharpest criticism of the Government is now coming from Mr. Maluf, a wealthy 53-year-old businessman and former Governor of Sao Paulo. In a speech to Congress last week, Mr. Maluf sniped at two decades of military rule by noting that ''after 20 years, the country is gravely ill.'' He also blasted party dissidents as ''opportunists'' and ''political trapeze artists.'' **********Similarly, having endorsed the Government's veto of an opposition call for direct elections earlier this year, Mr. Maluf has now proposed direct elections in the apparent hope of avoiding defeat in the Electoral College. The opposition, which long described the Electoral College as illegal, has replied that it is too late to organize direct presidential elections. Instead, they will be held in 1988. **********With Mr. Maluf increasingly isolated from his natural constituency, the opposition has even begun praising General Figueiredo as he prepares to leave office, applauding him for keeping his six-year-old promise to ''turn this country into a democracy'' and paying tribute to some of his achievements. **********Several state governors in the opposition have offered to honor General Figueiredo at public meetings before he leaves office, while the President, who barely six months ago seemed to be a lonely and unpopular figure, has taken to traveling around the country and speaking in public daily."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/20/world/around-the-world-police-question-students-after-seoul-protests.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 115, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Police Question Students After Seoul Protests", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Police Question Students After Seoul Protests", "body_text": " **********The police said today that they were questioning 59 students accused of leading anti-Government demonstrations in Seoul on Friday, the fourth anniversary of the violent uprising in Kwangju. **********About 5,000 students from 14 universities in Seoul clashed violently with riot policemen after holding memorial services for the 189 people officially reported to have died in the revolt four years ago.

Apple, the president of the Central Storage and Transfer Company, remembers clearly the financial beating he took when truck freight rates collapsed as the industry exploded with new entrants after it was deregulated in 1980. **********uf812 ''They cut rates so fast and so drastically that even if you were in negotiations with your union you couldn't get the new lower rates in, since by then they had already cut your price,'' he said. ''I just decided to get out.'' **********Medium-sized trucking companies such as Central Storage had been making their money with a combination of full-load and partial-load business. In no time, Mr. Apple said, his full-load business dropped from 30 percent of revenues to less than 1 percent. Luckily, he said, his partial loads, where rate-cutting and new competitors were less rampant, held up sufficiently to keep him going. **********A Nonunion Subsidiary **********But Mr. Apple is now on the road to restoring his full-load business. And he, like many of his competitors, is doing that by keeping labor costs down by setting up a nonunion subsidiary that employs drivers who own their own trucks. **********That subsidiary, Pyramid Lines, is an example of a growing industrywide phenomenon. It is, in fact, essentially the same cost-cutting strategy that established airlines are also pursuing: a two-tiered wage structure that keeps an older company competitive with the upstarts. **********''It would appear to be a trend,'' said Robert D. Long, an analyst for the First Boston Corporation. For example, Consolidated Freightways Inc., which owns the nation's largest trucking company, set up a division called CR Arrowhead Services that employs about 300 owner-operators to run full-truckload freight. **********Last December, Mr. Apple got full rights to operate Pyramid Lines Inc. in 48 states, becoming one of about 18,000 new carriers to be granted authority since the Motor Carrier Act was passed in July 1980. **********Doesn't Use Teamsters **********Instead of using drivers and help from Central Storage, which is organized by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, he is building Pyramid Lines with owner-operators, nonunion drivers who often own a tractor and trailer and operate much the same as independent businessmen. **********Mr. Apple said that his new company would not be viable with teamster drivers, who earn $12 to $13 an hour, get overtime and earn another $3 an hour in fringe benefits. But he said he could afford such unionized help in his less-than-truckload business, which, because of the healthy initial investment in warehouse, administrative and dispatching facilities, has had few new competitors. **********Despite several phone calls, teamsters' union officials were not available for comment. **********Central Storage and Transfer, now with about $11 million a year in revenues, is a company dating back to 1920, with large warehouse facilities. Mr. Apple uses them to store and sort the less-than-truckload freight that is gathered by his fleet of 65 tractors and 180 trailers from a radius of about 125 miles around Harrisburg and then redistributed to various destinations. **********Lease Agreements **********His full-load operation, on the other hand, employs about 25 owner-operators who sign a 30-day lease agreement to work only for Pyramid Lines for that period. **********Ross Hall, one such owner-driver, who was getting his papers in order for a load at the Spartan office of the company, said he had decided to join Pyramid because ''they get you the loads; you don't have to worry about running empty.'' **********He said that when he operated on his own, he often returned empty after taking a load someplace. That ate up much of his profit. **********But Pyramid can load and ship more efficiently by coordinating with Central Storage and Transport, because both companies share the same computer system. And besides getting its owner-drivers more full loads, Pyramid pays them weekly, a welcome change in a business were drivers complain they wait months for payment on any given run. **********As the economy picks up, Pyramid has been able to charge its customers about $1.10 a mile for its shipments. Before the industry's recovery, those per-mile rates often ran well below $1 a mile. **********The driver receives 70 percent of the revenue for his run; the remaining 30 percent goes to Pyramid. Mr. Apple said a driver could gross between $50,000 and $60,000 a year, and that about 30 percent of this would be his profit - meaning an income from $15,000 to $18,000 a year. Five to six years ago, Mr. Hall recalled, such an income would have been scoffed at by drivers, who often made double those amounts. **********But the huge influx of new carriers under deregulation and the lingering effects of the recession have cut owner-operator rates severely, and made a reliable $15,000 to $18,000 income look more attractive. **********Most industry experts say that deregulation, though designed to increase competition, has probably helped the established carrier more. Paul Schlesinger, an analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, argued, for example, that deregulation had given the existing companies new freedoms to expand. ''While it gives somebody a shot at the American dream,'' he said, the impact of the thousands of new start-up trucking companies has been small. **********Mr. Apple, in starting Pyramid, had several advantages that his newer competitors did not, including a client list. He was able, for instance, to turn to oldtime Central Storage customers, such as Gillette, Reliance Electric and Rubbermaid, to find loads for Pyramid. **********Central Storage hauls goods in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and parts of Delaware and New Jersey. **********From Beauty Aids to Shoes **********Generally its trucks carry anything that is packaged, crated or cartoned including beauty aids, paper products, major and small appliances, confectionery products, records and tapes, floor coverings and shoes. **********The main problem for Mr. Apple is finding enough owner-operators to join Pyramid to handle the growing business. ''There is a shortage of equipment out there,'' he said. **********Three years of a severe industry slump, plus deregulation, have forced many owner-operators to turn to other pursuits. And although rates have now improved, they are still not high enough to entice many again to hit the road and drive freight. ''There are just fewer operators out there,'' Mr. Apple said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/06/business/business-people-227469.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 289, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE", "body_text": " **********Midland Director Is Off to Crocker **********John G.

Five More Years? **********But in announcing it, in an unexpected television address last weekend, President Zia said that a ''yes'' vote would be interpreted as a public call for him to stay in office for five more years. ''I will not only respect your decision, but will also act upon it,'' the President said. **********Since Pakistan's 85 million people are overwhelmingly Moslem and increasingly fundamentalist, it would be difficult for anyone to advocate voting ''no'' to the referendum question, which is why, as a West European diplomat here put it, ''the whole plan is so devilishly clever.'' **********When General Zia, then the army Chief of Staff, took power and suspended the Constitution in July 1977, he promised to hold elections and return the country to civilian rule within 90 days. But he has repeatedly pushed back that deadline, citing economic adversities and political instability. **********The latest deadline he set for parliamentary elections is next March, and he promised in the speech a week ago that these elections would go ahead on that schedule. But diplomats said they now expected that his personal election in the meantime would pre-empt much of the power that the new Parliament subsequently assumes.   Some May Be Banned **********It was also still not clear who might be banned from running for Parliament in the elections.

For many, the experience has engaged their pro-Palestinian political sympathies, but it has also reinforced the American side of their dual identities, showing them how steeped they are in American values and how far they stand from Arab society. **********'Raised as an American' **********''I was raised as an American with virtually no knowledge whatsoever of the Middle East,'' said David Hamod, a graduate student at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. ''More than anything else I just wanted to see with my own eyes and feel for myself what was happening here.'' **********Mr. Hamod's grandfather, a Moslem of the Shiite branch, emigrated from Lebanon's Bekaa region 70 years before, and his father, brought up ''in a fairly Arab atmosphere'' in Iowa, seemed to regard his Arab origins as ''something of an embarrassment,'' Mr. Hamod recalled. **********''He sought to be an American,'' Mr. Hamod said of his father. ''At that point in American history, cultural relativism was not what it is today.'' **********As a result, Mr. Hamod's year living in the Old City of Jerusalem and traveling in Egypt, Jordan, Syria and other Arab countries has been a process of discovery. ''When I got here,'' he said, ''I started to recognize how my father's psyche fit into the whole Middle East and how he was part of the Middle East.''  Mixed With Jews and Arabs **********David Hamod devoted himself to studying Hebrew as well as Arabic, to mixing with Jews as well as Arabs. He wanted to learn about both sides, he said. **********His year has brought him to a conclusion. ''I recognize now that I don't intend to make the Palestine question my life,'' he said. ''This was the test for me. Coming here and seeing the situation and better understanding just how complicated it is and how deeply ingrained the stereotypes and racism are - in all candor it's just too frustrating and heart-wrenching.'' **********Stephen Tamari, 23 years old, who was born in Philadelphia, attended high school in Iowa and went to college in Indiana, said he was also drawn by the history of his father, Elias, who fled in 1948 from Jaffa to the West Bank city of Ramallah, and then in 1952 went to the United States.   'Part of My Own Heritage' **********''I wanted to learn more about my father's background, which is part of my own heritage,'' Mr. Tamari said. ''I wanted to learn Arabic.'' **********At home, his father spoke Arabic only occasionally, ''when he was angry,'' Mr. Tamari said, and he now talks about old times in what used be Palestine. ''It's bittersweet. It's sad. It gets sadder the longer it gets. He always talks about the suffering of the people on the West Bank.'' **********For Christopher Mansour of Flint, Mich., who came to Israel in March 1983 after receiving a master's degree at Georgetown University in contemporary Arab studies, the search has produced a schism between politics and culture. **********His grandfather, who emigrated in 1928 from Nazareth - an Arab city now in Israel - was determined to be American, Mr. Mansour explained.   'Hassled' in High School **********Only when Mr. Mansour was in high school in the early 1970's, he said, did he begin to identify himself as Palestinian. ''I got a little hassled,'' he said, ''like this kid would come up to me in gym class and say, 'Hey, Chris, here's your machine gun that you left in Munich.' I didn't laugh it off. I just ignored it.'' **********But it bothered him, he conceded. **********Having finished his master's, he said, ''I wanted to live in an Arab cultural environment, understand Arab society and see maybe if I could live here for an extended period. **********''And also,'' he added, ''do a kind of search for roots, my being a Palestinian.'' **********''It's been an interesting year,'' he said. ''But I think I've come to the realization that I'm definitely an American sociologically and culturally. I feel much more comfortable in an American environment than I do in an Arab social context. But at the same time politically I feel myself Palestinian. That's how I resolve the conflict within myself.''  Hospitality Overwhelming **********Mr. Mansour lived in the West Bank for a while and is now in an Arab village in Galilee. He said he had felt somewhat stifled by elaborate Arab rituals of hospitality and intricate family traditions. **********''I was just up in Nazareth visiting relatives,'' he said. ''They're very nice people. But you come in and you can't just come in and sit down and say: 'Hi, how ya doin'? How's things goin'? Everything's exciting,' talk a little bit and then leave. **********''You've got to come in and sit down and eat and sit and stay the whole five days. I mean, it's kind of nice, I like the hospitality, but it's taken to the nth degree. It can get to be painful.'' **********Some Arab-Americans come here trying to find a mate, Mr. Hamod said. But the cultural differences usually frustrate them. **********''I've come to the conclusion that it's too difficult,'' Mr. Mansour said. ''The whole courting process is something so alien to American culture. You really don't get a chance to sit and talk with the girl or the woman to know what she thinks or know that she's going to be compatible.'' **********He says he has ruled out living here permanently.  ''Jewish Americans can come over, and if they do decide to stay they can take citizenship without any problem, being Jewish,'' he said. ''But for Palestinian Americans it's almost impossible to stay here on a permanent basis.''  Arab Name Means Trouble **********Israeli officials do not seem to be especially welcoming. An Arab name on a passport is enough for a session in an interrogation room at the airport upon arrival, according to some of the Arab-Americans who say they have gone through such questioning. Then the bureaucrats make renewing visas unpleasant, the visitors say, and soldiers often pick them up for identity checks or questioning. **********''I've been harassed by Israeli troops and things of that nature,'' Mr. Hamod said. ''Walking around the Old City at night for example, troops will say: 'Ya himaar, you donkey, come over here! Let's see your identification.' I tend to ignore that kind of stuff and just keep on walking, and in the event they grab me, which they sometimes do, I just flash my American passport and everything is roses.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/01/business/pension-switch-to-bonds-at-bethlehem-chrysler.html": {"writer_name": "Fred Bleakley", "pub_date": "1984-08-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 630, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PENSION SWITCH TO BONDS AT BETHLEHEM, CHRYSLER", "print_headline": "PENSION SWITCH TO BONDS AT BETHLEHEM, CHRYSLER", "body_text": " **********Two of the nation's largest corporations, the Bethlehem Steel Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation, sold huge amounts of stock held in their pension funds last month to switch into high-yielding bonds. The moves will enable them to save hundreds of millions of dollars in pension fund contributions they must make over coming years. **********The continued opportunity to lock in yields of higher than 13 percent on a mix of high-grade corporate bonds and Government securities is tempting many other corporations to make similar moves, said James F. A. Biggs, a pension fund actuarial consultant with Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. **********Bethlehem liquidated more than $700 million in equities on its way to revamping its $2.4 billion pension plan, Arthur J. Roth, a company spokesman said yesterday. Bethlehem said last week in its quarterly earnings report that the company had increased the fixed-income portion of its pension fund portfolio, which would result in a $50 million savings in annual pension fund contributions. **********Bethlehem's purging of stocks undoubtedly contributed to the poor performance of the stock market last month. So did Chrysler's liquidation of $450 million in equities, which the company announced yesterday. Both sales were transacted through Salomon Brothers, which subsequently invested the proceeds in bonds structured to pay interest and principal in amounts equal to future pension fund obligations. **********Frederick W. Zuckerman, Chrysler's treasurer, said in an interview that the selling took place July 19. That day the Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 9 points, to the 1,102 level. Similar moves by other corporations, of course, would put further downward pressure on stock prices. **********What Bethlehem and Chrysler have done was to set up a so-called ''dedicated'' bond portfolio whose total investment return matches their obligations of payments to their pension funds. By establishing a fixed rate of return from bonds that is higher than the expected rate of return from stocks, they are thereby able to reduce their future pension fund contributions. **********Chrysler's Costs to Be Cut **********As a result of Chrysler's action, for instance, Mr. Zuckerman said the company's annual $250 million contribution to its defined benefit pension plan would be reduced ''significantly'' beginning in 1987. He declined to be more specific. **********Mr. Zuckerman did say, however, that that by switching into a portfolio of corporate and Government bonds yielding better than 14 percent annually, Chrysler over coming years would save about $475 million in payments it would have had to make because its pension fund was currently underfunded in relation to its future obligations. **********The move to a dedicated bond portfolio plus a recent cash contribution to the pension fund has cut in half Chrysler's $950 million underdunfunded liability, Mr. Zuckerman said.  Chrysler's underfunded status stemmed from not making pension fund contributions in 1980 and 1981, when the company was near bankruptcy, and from a series of past labor contracts raising retirement benefits. **********Chrysler's aim is to dedicate virtually all of its $1.6 billion pension fund to fixed-income securities whose principal and interest payments will match the company pension obligations for 80,000 current employees and 60,000 retirees, Mr. Zuckerman said. The company's pension fund still has $200 million in real estate and $150 million in nondedicated fixed income securities that it may sell and reinvest in bonds that more accurately match pension obligations. **********Fixed-Income Portion Raised **********Bethlehem raised the fixed-income portion of its pension fund to 60 percent from 27 percent previously. Together with the principal that will be paid back on maturity, the better than 14 percent interest income from the fixed-income portfolio will be sufficient to match the expected pension payments of 60,000 currently retired Bethlehem pensioners, Mr. Roth said. **********The big switches from stocks to bonds apparently are less a reflection of negative expectations about the stock market than eagerness to lock in high interest rates before they tumble."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/13/world/taiwan-seems-uneasy-about-zhao-s-visit-to-us.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1984-01-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 826, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TAIWAN SEEMS UNEASY ABOUT ZHAO'S VISIT TO U.S.", "print_headline": "TAIWAN SEEMS UNEASY ABOUT ZHAO'S VISIT TO U.S.", "body_text": " **********The visit of Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang of China to the United States has aroused unease in Taiwan that it may portend new setbacks when President Reagan visits Peking in April. **********Officials and newspaper editorials have expressed satisfaction that Mr. Reagan reaffirmed United States commitments to the island when he met with Mr. Zhao.

Mr. Murkowski said that the United States should provide Taiwan with better combat jets if Peking deployed more advanced jets. Taiwan officials express bitterness that the United States has been unwilling to sell sophisticated FX jet fighters because it would offend Peking. **********The conference on United States Congressional-executive relations and the Taiwan Relations Act was attended by 40 ''renowned scholars,'' as the local press describes the local and American participants. The conference featured speeches by Senator Murkowski, Representative Tom G. Loeffler, Republican of Texas, and Representative Thomas A. Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota. **********Mr. Chang, the institute's director, told the session he hoped the Congress would ''ultimately enhance relations between the United States and Taiwan, regardless of the nonexistence of diplomatic relations.'' **********The China Times, one of Taiwan's largest newspapers, summed up the reaction to Mr. Zhao's visit in an editorial on Wednesday. ''We do not believe that President Reagan and his Administration will consciously betray or do things that harm the Republic of China,'' it said. **********It then went on to caution that the Chinese Communists ''are the most treacherous group in the world.'' **********''Any gentleman will fall into their trap,'' the editorial said, ''if he is careless while negotiating with them and makes irrecoverable mistakes.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/11/world/french-official-is-target-of-car-s-driver.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 640, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FRENCH OFFICIAL IS TARGET OF CAR'S DRIVER", "print_headline": "FRENCH OFFICIAL IS TARGET OF CAR'S DRIVER", "body_text": " **********The brother of one of nine French soldiers killed Saturday in Chad tried to run down Defense Minister Charles Hernu with his car today at the funeral of the men.

Polls in France showed support for the involvement at first, but recent polls have indicated more opposition. **********There has been confusion about how the men died. At first, the Defense Ministry said an explosion killed the soldiers while they were clearing the wreckage of vehicles abandoned by rebel forces. Later Saturday, the ministry said the soliders were killed after one apparently stepped on a land mine during a reconnaissance mission. On Monday, it said they were on a mine-clearing mission. **********The French Defense Ministry is investigating the explosion. Conservative opponents of the country's ruling Socialists have called for a separate, independent inquiry.   Soviet Makes Accusations **********Meanwhile, the Soviet press agency Tass on Sunday denounced what it called an ''escalation of the French intervention'' in Chad and said the nine soldiers died ''from injuries received during a combat operation'' against rebel forces loyal to Chad's former President, Goukouni Oueddei. Tass also contended that the French soldiers had crossed the unofficial cease-fire line into rebel-controlled territory in northern Chad. **********France denied the Soviet contentions.  Mr. Hernu said Saturday that the deaths were not the result of a rebel attack. ''It was a tragic accident, but it was not an attack,'' Hernu said. **********The Defense Minister also said there was ''no question of modifying'' the French military contingent in Chad because of the accident. **********The Chadian rebels began an offensive in northern Chad last June in the latest round of civil war, which has raged almost continuously since the country's independence from France in 1960. **********There has been virtually no fighting since France intervened and stopped the rebel's drive to Ndjamena. Since then, French and Government troops have controlled the southern half of Chad and the rebels the barren northern half of the landlocked central African nation. **********There has been only one French combat casualty reported since the August intervention.

During the four-week period, the yield on 30- year Treasury bonds has fallen by slightly more than a percentage point, to 12.56 percent. Currently, bond yields are closer to the year's low of 11.6 percent in mid-January than to the year's high of 14 percent set in late May. **********The trend toward higher bond prices and lower yields got an assist late in the day when the Federal Reserve announced a suprisingly large $1.7 billion decline in the nation's basic money supply for the week ended July 23. **********Money Growth Slows **********After expanding at a 12.2 percent rate in May and June, money supply growth has slowed sharply recently ''and July's growth may be about zero,'' said Elliott Platt, a money market economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities. After the money supply report, bond prices rose slightly more than half a point. **********Slower money supply growth helps lower interest rates because it reduces the chances that the Federal Reserve could find it necessary to tighten monetary policy to curb money growth. The M-1 money supply measure, consisting of currency plus all kinds of checking accounts, averaged $544.9 billion in the July 23 week and is now at about the middle of the Fed's 1984 growth target of 4 percent to 8 percent. **********Yesterday's price gains were particularly impressive, analysts said, because they came in advance of three Treasury note and bond auctions next week totaling $16.75 billion. In advance of Tuesday's sale of new three-year notes, dealers offered the issue with a yield of 12.47 percent, down from 12.64 percent Wednesday. The 10-year notes to be auctioned next Wednesday were offered at 12.63 percent, down from 12.86 percent, and the 30-year bonds to be sold Thursday were offered at 12.53 percent, down from 12.77 percent. **********''The Street does not have many securities, and the demand is there,'' said Allan Leslie, a vice president at the Discount Corporation of New York, a government securities dealer. ''People are finally coming around to believe that the economy is slowing, inflation will remain low, and that bond yields are attractively high.'' **********Employment Data Awaited **********According to traders, fresh evidence of moderating economic growth may emerge this morning when Government officials announce employment data for July. After months of a falling unemployment rate and strong gains in the number of employed workers, economists expect the unemployment rate to be unchanged at 7 percent or rise slightly, at the same time as the number of employed workers rises by a smaller amount than in earlier months. **********One harbinger of slower economic growth that attracted attention yesterday was the level of initial claims for unemployment during the week ended July 21. Although the 380,000 claims were down from 386,000 a week earlier, the level of claims remains well above the 354,200 average for the four weeks ended June 30. **********Other Fed data published yesterday showed that there was no significant change in the availability of bank reserves. Excluding extended loans to troubled banks, primarily Continental Illinois, financial institutions borrowed $1.057 billion from the Federal Reserve in the two weeks ended Aug. 1, and at the same time held $651 million of excess reserves. **********Net Borrowed Reserves Steady **********The combination of borrowings and excess reserves produced a net borrowed reserve position of $406 million, or not much changed from the $351 million of net borrowings according to revised data for the previous two-week period. **********Because the reserve data showed no change in the Fed's monetary policy and because of good investor demand, traders were little alarmed by the higher-than-expected rate for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market. The funds rate traded around 11 5/8 percent yesterday, and the 11.53 percent average for the week ended Aug. 1 was 11.53 percent, the highest level in about a year. **********The trend toward a higher funds rate has prevented other short-term interest rates from declining in line with bond yields. Rates for Treasury bills were about unchanged yesterday, while the Treasury sold new one- year bills at an average rate of 10.79 percent, down from 10.99 percent four weeks ago. **********Business credit demands were mixed in the week of July 25 as Fed data showed that business loans outstanding at 10 large New York City banks fell by $132 million, while business borrowings in the commercial paper market rose by $1.021 billion. **********Following are results of yesterday's auction of new one-year Treasury bills: PICK UP TREASURY BILL AGATE **********Fed table, Page D4"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/16/world/polish-primate-to-see-pope.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 77, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Polish Primate to See Pope", "print_headline": "Polish Primate to See Pope", "body_text": " **********Jozef Cardinal Glemp, the Roman Catholic Primate of Poland, will visit Rome Monday for talks with Pope John Paul II, an aide said today.

When such a declaration is made, the department cannot give potential competitors the technical data they need to produce the same part, thereby forestalling any competition. **********Views Shared **********Mr. Thayer resigned his Defense Department position today, but a variety of Pentagon officials said that his views were widely shared by the military ''procurement community,'' and that his departure was unlikely to resolve the controversies. **********The same memorandum said that, in the search for ways to control the rising prices of spare parts, the ''least preferred'' option found by Mr. Thayer was the approach whereby the machine shops of Air Force logistic centers had begun making spare parts themselves at savings of tens of millions of dollars. The document said Mr. Thayer had said he did not want the Defense Department to compete with the private sector. **********The memorandum, which was written by James P. Wade, the principal Deputy Under Secretary for Research and Engineering, was addressed to the Secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force and to the director of the Defense Logistics Agency. A Pentagon official made an unauthorized disclosure of the memorandum to the Project on Military Procurement, a nonprofit private organization that seeks to monitor problems in the costs and quality of military equipment. **********Spare Part 'Horror Stories' **********Considerable attention was focused last year on military spare part ''horror stories'' that told of relatively simple parts of apparently low monetary value being purchased by the armed services for hundreds or thousands of dollars. Many members of Congress demanded major changes in purchasing practices, and in August Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger declared that vigorous steps were being taken to improve past procedures. **********However, the Wade memorandum and interviews with Pentagon officials who declined to be identified indicate that considerable resistance to fundamental change remains. **********In one practice condoned by military purchasing officers, contractors have been permitted to declare ''proprietary rights'' to a given item. According to some Pentagon officials, this is often accomplished by simply stamping the item into the company's catalogue and assigning it a part number. In many cases, the prime contractor does not even make the part, but purchases it elsewhere. **********The main drawback of the system, according to its many critics, is that it can preclude ''breaking out'' a part for competitive bidding because the military purchasing offices say that they cannot furnish the engineeering data a potential competitor needs to prepare a bid. **********Secretary of the Air Force Verne Orr recently suggested that regulations be changed so that proprietary rights would lapse after five years, citing the fact that some parts on B-52 bombers built more than 20 years ago were still covered. **********Other Suggested Changes **********Other officials, such as A. Ernest Fitzgerald, a high-ranking Air Force civil servant, are advocates of even more sweeping change. Mr. Fitzgerald said he doubted that any proprietary ''right'' exists and added, ''if it is not a right, why give them five years or any time at all?'' **********However, Mr. Wade's memorandum of Nov. 10 advised the service Secretaries that Secretary Thayer had ''expressed concern with actions having either the appearance or effect of pre-empting'' rights properly vested in contractors. **********The memo did add that ''this is not to say, however, initiatives in this area should not be pursued,'' but urged that steps be ''tailored'' and warned that ''well-intentioned actions'' could create problems worse than those they were meant to solve. **********Other sources said, however, that a meeting of senior officials on the spare parts problem was more acrimonious than the memo suggested and that the leadership of the Pentagon was unlikely to embrace a change in proprietary rights procedures. **********The Wade memorandum said that ''of equal concern'' were ''intended actions'' to make spare parts ''in- house,'' or at such Government-operated facilities as the five Air Force logistic centers where planes and other equipment are repaired."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/05/business/business-people-chief-departing-warner-lambert.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1984-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 373, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHIEF DEPARTING WARNER-LAMBERT", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; CHIEF DEPARTING WARNER-LAMBERT", "body_text": " **********Ward S.

Since Lord Weinstock became managing director of the faltering company in 1963, G.E.C. has not only absorbed two large rivals, but has become an envied and imitated model of industrial organization. **********''He probably influenced Britain more than any other single businessman, not just by restructuring its chaotic electrical industry, but by providing a model for financial discipline and decentralization which others followed,'' observed Anthony Sampson two years ago in ''The Changing Anatomy of Britain,' his highly regarded portrait of the nation. **********So what's next? Well, some expect a new round of takeovers. Lord Weinstock's soaring profits and his careful acquisitions and investment policy have left G.E.C. with an accumulation of cash reserves of more than $2 billion in the fiscal year that ended last March 31. And it is in large part that ''cash mountain,'' as analysts and investment managers call it, that has created the intense interest in Lord Weinstock's next move. **********Lord Weinstock, a tall 60-year-old with thinning gray hair and glasses, is annoyed by all this speculation: **********''People think that you aren't doing anything unless you are buying something,'' he said in a recent telephone interview from his country home in Wiltshire, 100 miles west of London. ''I see G.E.C. as put together now. We have to secure growth. We also have to find a judicious mixture of prudence and boldness.'' **********Lord Weinstock also points out that large cash reserves are not unusual in the electrical equipment industry. G.E.C.'s cash reserves, he says, are smaller in proportion to cash flow than that of such rivals as Siemens of West Germany and Toshiba of Japan. **********But despite all Lord Weinstock's protestations, The Times of London has described the question of when G.E.C. will do something dramatic with its cash hoard as ''one of the longest- running enigmas in the City.'' **********Indeed, speculation in the City over Lord Weinstock's next move has been dampened only slightly by the news that G.E.C. will seek its shareholders' permission at the annual meeting Sept. 14 to spend up to half its reserves on a share repurchase scheme, an investment strategy that has rarely been used here since changes in the tax laws in 1981 made it possible. G.E.C. would still have huge reserves by British standards following such a buyback, not to mention the borrowing power to raise considerably more. **********True, it's been years since Lord Weinstock set out on the kind of takeover binge that, in the 1960's, built G.E.C. to its present size. But Lord Weinstock is still quite willing to throw G.E.C.'s weight around. That much was demonstrated in late May after Thorn-EMI P.L.C. announced that it hoped to merge with British Aerospace P.L.C., an aircraft and defense equipment maker that is one of G.E.C.'s largest customers. Lord Weinstock responded by starting his own merger talks - confronting Thorn, a consumer electronics and entertainment company, with the prospect of a bidding war with G.E.C. To no one's surprise, Thorn decided to drop the whole idea as soon as British Aerospace formally said it wasn't interested. And by the end of June, talk of a G.E.C. bid for British Aerospace had also evaporated. **********LORD Weinstock's plans for G.E.C. **********are also something of an enigma **********to those who work for him. Workers and managers at the 120 operating units that he controls rarely catch a glimpse of him. The managing director is openly skeptical of how much executives can find out about their businesses by leaving headquarters and going on factory tours. Instead, he spends his time scrutinizing progress reports in which the operating companies are required to provide a series of ratios, such as sales to capital, sales to inventory, sales to debt, sales per employee, and sales in relation to each pound paid out in wages. **********According to colleagues, Lord Weinstock typically arrives at headquarters in midmorning, having read newspapers and magazines, and works into the evening. He has a bottle of mineral water within reach on his desk throughout the day. (Gone, though, are his beloved Havana cigars: When his doctor recently convinced him of the need to cut down on his smoking, he decided to quit altogether.) **********The most prominent item on his desk in his fifth-floor office is a large telephone console, allowing him to quickly contact any executive whose figures are departing from the guidelines and projections thrashed out in the annual budgets set up for each company. The key, according to G.E.C. executives, is what he can ferret out of the details. **********''Arnold Weinstock has a financial mind, but he's got that something extra you might call flair,'' said Lord Carrington, the former Foreign Minister who was G.E.C.'s chairman for a year before leaving in May to become the new secretary-general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. ''His mind works in an original, exhilarating way.'' **********Indeed, Lord Weinstock's flair - and the story of his rise at the company - have become the stuff of British management legends. Raised by his elder brother after his parents died, he entered the London School of Economics at the age of 16, graduated at 20, and immediately went to work as an administrative official in the Admiralty. **********He honed his financial skills working for a London property developer from 1947 until 1954, when his father- in-law, Michael Sobell, asked him to manage a television manufacturing operation. The television company, Radio & Allied Holdings, grew steadily while others stumbled. By 1961, it attracted a takeover bid from G.E.C. that left Mr. Sobell and his son-in-law with a 14 percent stake in G.E.C. and put the young Mr. Weinstock on G.E.C.'s board of directors.  Mr. Sobell and his son-in law are involved in another joint enterprise these days - a stable of racehorses that so engage Lord Weinstock that he will step out of a board meeting to get the track results when one is running. **********IT is frequently noted here that in horse racing, as in business, Lord Weinstock seems to consistently make money where others fail. But that, he says, misses the point. **********''One doesn't set out just to make money,'' he said. ''The thing is to do something right and one hopes to do well out of that.'' **********Lord Weinstock did very well indeed with G.E.C. At the time he joined the board, the company was floundering. Despite steady sales increases from 1956 to 1961, profits had fallen 50 percent. Bloated and administratively lax, G.E.C. was typical of the English electric companies that were to fail, by the dozens, in the coming years. But after a two-year power struggle, Lord Weinstock was invited to become managing director, and turned the company around, slashing overhead and dividing the company into 53 operating units. From 1962 to 1967, sales rose by 33 percent - and profits jumped by 262 percent. **********By 1967, G.E.C. was on the prowl for the major acquisitions that would make it pre-eminent in the industry. First came Associated Electrical Industries. The following year, after a bidding war initiated by Plessey, GEC took over English Electric. The mergers were followed by unprecedented layoffs and controversial factory closures. Headquarters staff was abruptly reduced from 2,000 to 200 and consolidated at the unprepossessing G.E.C. headquarters building on a side street in the Mayfair section of London - while the more imposing premises of the acquired companies were sold. Lord Weinstock was described by a journalist of the era as a man with ''an almost physical revulsion against inefficiency.'' **********During the days in which Arnold Weinstock was laying the foundations for today's G.E.C., he described himself as a man on a crusade. Lord Weinstock today dismisses such language as ''too romantic.'' He prefers to talk about the teamwork in G.E.C.'s achievement. But his beliefs about how to run a business haven't changed, according to those who know him well. **********''He has been surprisingly consistent in his approach and his dedication to it,'' said Lord Nelson, who joined the G.E.C. board of directors and became chairman after G.E.C. took over the English Electric Company, which Lord Nelson headed, in 1958. Lord Weinstock has never joined any of Britain's business groups and has shown no interest in combining business with politics as chairman of one of the state-owned industries like steel or coal. **********For all the attention it commands in Britain, Lord Weinstock's corporate empire is modest-sized compared with others in the international electrical engineering industry, including America's General Electric Company (no relation to G.E.C.) and the Westinghouse Corporation, Germany's Siemens, Sweden's ASEA, and Japan's Mitsubishi, Toshiba and Hitachi. G.E.C.'s pretax profits were about $885 million on sales of $7.4 billion in the year ended March 31 - that is, almost twice the profits of Westinghouse on less than three- quarters the sales. **********G.E.C.'s largest division is Electronic Systems and Components, which makes everything from radar to torpedoes. Other major divisions include Telecommunications and Business Systems, Automation and Control, Medical Equipment, Power Generation, and Electrical Equipment. A smaller consumer products group makes a variety of lighting and appliances. **********G.E.C. is so decentralized that some analysts describe it as a federation of operating companies. Lord Weinstock himself periodically mentions in interviews that he has been intrigued with the idea of breaking up the company. **********Whether or not Lord Weinstock's suggestions become policy depends on the reaction they get from both the operating executives and trusted colleagues at headquarters, most notably Sir Kenneth Bond, the deputy managing director who has been a Weinstock associate since arriving at Radio and Allied as an accountant before the GEC takeover. **********''Lord Weinstock turns out lots of ideas, many of which are hopeless,'' said Lord Catto, a merchant banker who has been a longtime outside member of G.E.C.'s well-connected board of directors. ''Ninety percent of them are fielded by Kenneth Bond before they go any further.'' Whatever the source of the idea, Lord Catto added, Lord Weinstock is driven to make sure that it is examined from every conceivable angle. ''He is not a great risk taker.'' **********Lord Weinstock says of G.E.C.'s decision-making style: ''We have an open door policy and everyone is always walking in and out of each other's room. The struggle is to define our objectives and then decide objectively. If we have the facts, we cannot disagree about the solutions.'' **********But sometimes, G.E.C. has discovered, belatedly, that it didn't have the right facts. In 1979, G.E.C. bought the A. B. Dick Company, a Chicago-based office equipment maker that had a nationwide distribution and sales system G.E.C. hoped to use as a basis for extending its presence in the United States. In retrospect, G.E.C. admits, it not only paid too much for the family- owned business but allowed it to be mismanaged following the takeover. The figures received in London did not reveal the extent to which A.B. Dick had ignored its bread-and-butter graphics reproduction business while overinvesting in word processing and advanced office electronics - products that were mysteries to its sales force, according to David Powell, the executive G.E.C. finally dispatched from headquarters last year to halt the losses. **********''It was a case where our decentralized style hurt us,'' conceded Lord Weinstock. **********In the long run, Lord Nelson said, G.E.C.'s long-running battle against centralization may create another challenge - namely, who will take the reins after Lord Weinstock's retirement. **********''The problem of succession doesn't have a clear answer,'' Lord Nelson admitted. **********One intriguing possibility arose this year when Lord Weinstock lured his 32-year-old son, Simon, away from his international banking position at S. G. Warburg & Son. The younger Weinstock is working with his father and Sir Kenneth Bond on strategic planning. **********This is not to say Lord Weinstock is planning to retire soon. For all his love of his racehorses and music - he and his wife, Netta, journey to the Salzburg festival each year to hear the Mozart performances that are his chief musical joy - Lord Weinstock said the prospect of a retirement that would allow him to pursue these interests is ''not my idea of a good time.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/28/business/no-headline-094769.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 304, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Headline", "print_headline": "No Headline", "body_text": " **********The Sources Of Bank's Aid WASHINGTON, July 27 - Of **********the Federal Deposit Insurance **********Corporation's $4.5 million **********assistance package to help Continental Illinois National Bank **********and Trust Company, the $1 billion cash portion will come **********from insurance premiums paid **********by the nation's 14,700 insured **********commercial and savings **********banks.

Scharffenberger, chairman and chief executive of City Investing, who will be 65 years old on May 22, would be invited to remain as head of the company's top-executive staff. **********Stock Rises Sharply **********City Investing stock had jumped $4.25 on Monday, to $37.25, prompting the company to ask the New York Stock Exchange to halt trading pending an announcement. Shortly after the 10 A.M. opening bell yesterday, City Investing said it had been ''approached by a major financial institution which expressed interest in presenting an offer to purchase the company.'' It said it expected to receive the offer by this morning. **********By the close of trading yesterday, City Investing gained another $5.875, to $43.125, with more than a million shares changing hands. Thus the stock has soared more than $10 in 48 hours and, depending on the size of the offer, could rise still further. **********Wall Street sources estimated Merrill's offer at about $50 a share. On the basis of City Investing's 36.5 million shares outstanding, a deal at that price would involve some $1.8 billion. **********Brokers Acting as Packagers **********One of the sources who reported the possibility that Oppenheimer might also bid said Oppenheimer, which like Merrill would act as a packager of the deal for a fee, was considering a bid ''in the 50's.'' Oppenheimer executives are understood to have met with Mr. Scharffenberger two months ago about a deal, but decided then not to procede. Jeffrey P. Beck, merger chief at Oppenheimer, declined to comment on the report. **********Neither Merrill Lynch nor Oppenheimer would be buying City Investing on its own behalf. **********Since most of the money for such management takeovers is borrowed, they have come to be known as leveraged buyouts. They usually call for top management to remain, therefore practically guaranteeing a friendly reception to the bid. And big stock market premiums to investors, also encourage stockholder support. **********Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, one of the nation's best-known packagers of such buyouts, is currently trying to buy Esmark Inc., the big Chicago conglomerate, for $2.4 billion. If it succeeds, it would be the biggest such venture in history. **********Signode Buyout **********Merrill Lynch, which has been active in such buyouts for years, acted as packager in 1982 for the $430 million management buyout of the Signode Corporation. It was also adviser in the more than $1 billion buyout last year of Wometco Enterprises. **********Although a substantial amount of City Investing shares is in the hands of big financial institutions, it has two significant investors. **********Tamco Enterprises, whose chairman is Lyman C. Hamilton Jr., former president of the ITT Corporation, tried to buy the company three years ago on behalf of Victor N. Goulet, the Chicago real estate man. Tamco owns 3.3 million shares, or 9.04 percent. Victor Posner, the Miami businessman, owns 3.1 million shares, or 8.5 percent. **********He has authorization from the New Hampshire Insurance Commission, which regulates Home Insurance, to increase his interest to 24.9 percent. Industry sources said they thought that Mr. Posner would like to own City Investing but had not received encouragement from the company. **********In a statement made by a spokesman on Mr. Posner's behalf yesterday, he said that if reports of a buyout were correct, he would review his position ''as soon as he hears the price and the terms being offered and make a decision as to what actions he will take.'' **********City Investing, whose revenues totaled nearly $6 billion last year, has 63,000 employees. Food services, lodging and insurance provide 43 percent of operating profits. It 365 motels cover 39 states and its printing presses turn out everything from Good Housekeeping and Forbes to Cosmopolitan and Rolling Stone. **********Home Insurance, which has some 6,600 brokers and agents, is among the top 15 sellers of auto and home coverage.

And efforts to overcome it have assumed an urgency that reflects growing concern over an information technology lag some fear could crimp German chances in growth sectors where new jobs are needed to replace those in dying smokestack industries. **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl recently characterized the sentiment as ''irrational hostility to technology,'' which, he said, fostered a ''fear of the future.'' **********Subtle Objections Seen **********Discomfort with the information age surfaces in subtle ways, from court cases challenging computerized data gathering because of the purported invasion of privacy, to Government delays on the development of cable television because of its perceived effect on family life. **********But there are more obvious signs as well, with relatively fewer computers installed in West German offices, banks and factories than in other major industrialized countries. **********The severity of the problem can be seen in a Bundesbank study that showed that Germany's share of high technology exports among the world's six leading exporting nations dropped to 17 percent in 1983, from 26.3 percent 10 years ago. **********For some, there is the fear that computerization means lost jobs; for others, the new technologies are a threat to traditional German values. **********''Germans have never really reconciled the two cultures of technology and humanism,'' said Helmut Winkler, an engineering professor at the Technical College in Kassel. ''From the start, humanism was at the basis of our educational system. There was a reluctance to admit that some of our thinking could be taken over by machines.'' **********The resistance, of course, is not total. The Government has a campaign to install a computer in every classroom with the help of several manufacturers, including the International Business Machines Corporation and Texas Instruments, which have donated computers to schools and granted student discounts. **********School Program Criticized **********But when Education Minister Dorothee Wilms recently urged computer industry officials to try to generate computer enthusiasm in the schools, the appeal was chided by the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper in an editorial as ''one-sided subordination of our schools to obvious economic interests'' and the teachers union warned against exposing pupils to the ''private sales and profit interests of the computer industry.'' **********But the criticism has not brought the Government's efforts to a halt.

The size of the financing - $17.5 billion - was slightly greater than some analysts expected, but was not important enough to cause any serious weakening of prices for outstanding issues. **********The $17.5 billion package is a record financing for the Government, and will test the willingness of investors to absorb new securities at interst rates which are lower than those which prevailed earlier this year. **********Next week's note and bond financings by the Treasury will start next Monday with a 1:30 P.M. auction of $6.5 billion of new three-year notes due Nov. 15, 1987.

The overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market has fluctuated around 10 percent the past two days, well above the 9 percent to 9 1/2 percent rate that analysts expect could result from an easing of Fed monetary policy. **********Expectations of additional Fed easing have been heightened in recent days as surveys of bank deposits pointed toward a decline of about $2 billion in the nation's basic money supply to be reported today for the week ending Oct. 22. A decline of close to that amount would suggest that the closely watched money supply measure has fallen at an annual rate of about 5 percent during October. The drop in the nation's money supply, combined with weak economic data, might lead the central bank to make bank reserves more available and thereby put downward pressure on interest rates. **********Among those expecting an easier Fed policy, Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman/American Express said in the latest issue on Perspectives on Money and Credit that ''there should be another notch of easing by the Federal Reserve'' perhaps coming at the Nov. 7 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. By that time, employment data for October will be available, and ''odds are that the economy will be presenting a picture of continuing weakness.'' **********The effect of any easing by the Fed must be weighed, however, against strong demands for credit in major sectors of the credit markets. Besides the Treasury's heavy borrowings, corporations sold nearly $8 billion of bonds in October, more than twice the monthly average of the past two years. Borrowings by state and local governments have also been extremely heavy and are expected to remain large through the end of the year.

The railroad earned $313 million in 1983. **********The Norfolk Southern Corporation, the CSX Corporation and Santa Fe Industries all have begun studies to see if they want to bid.

''I don't think there is any reason to be fearful that we have any bust ahead in the consumer marketplace,'' she added. ''All this shows is a bounce-back from unsustainably strong growth in January.

With the agreement, the banks undertook to issue only Visa-linked credit cards - called Carte Bleue in France - and promised not to make any deals with other credit card organizations without permission from the rest of the group. **********Other Accords Seen **********American Express says the pact with Credit Lyonnais only benefits the roughly two million holders of its card with an ''express cash'' feature. But the company said the agreement is intended to be the first of a series of similar accords with leading banks in other European countries. Such agreements are expected to be signed soon with British, Italian, Spanish and German banks. **********At present, holders of ordinary American Express cards, as well as of Visa, Diners' Club and Eurocheque cards, can draw cash at many European banks, but only by waiting on line and dealing with a human teller. **********The agreement signed by the French banks in July ended a somewhat confused situation in which different groups of the banks had been issuing their own credit cards. The banks said the agreement was intended to prevent France from developing along the United States pattern, with banks, big stores and gas station chains all issuing their own credit cards. **********The introduction of a single national card linked to Visa, the banks claimed, would give clients better service at home as well as the right to obtain credit at shops, restaurants and hotels accepting the Visa card all over the world. **********But critics warned that the July agreement could stifle competition among the state-owned banks, encouraging them to fix standardized charges and services for the credit cards. **********'Extremely Perturbing' **********Jean Gagne, deputy director general of Banque Nationale de Paris, one of the biggest nationalized banks, called publicly for Credit Lyonnais to cancel its deal with American Express, saying the arrangement was ''extremely perturbing both for members of our group and for our international partner, Visa.'' **********At a meeting of French bankers last week, several nationalized banks urged that Credit Lyonnais be expelled from the credit card group established by the July pact, sources said. However, other banks suggested inviting American Express to extend its agreement to all French banks instead. **********''If Credit Lyonnais gets away with this, then what is to stop another bank doing a deal to issue Diners' Club cards, say,'' one French banker commented privately. **********Under the American Express agreement with Credit Lyonnais, qualifying cardholders would be able to draw up to 3,000 francs, about $320 at current exchange rates, from any of the bank's 600 Cesar automatic teller machines throughout France. **********American Express says the new service is intended to help tourists and business travelers who run short of local currency. **********The company hopes the arrangement will become operational in January. **********Foreign Bankers Amused **********Foreign bankers in France, whose banks were not nationalized by the Socialist Government, appear amused by the dispute, saying it shows that France's newly nationalized banks are reluctant to compete with each other now that they are state owned. **********These sources also point out that the state-owned banks' distaste for competition appears to run counter to recent declarations by France's new Prime Minister, Laurent Fabius, who has emphasized his Government's commitment to develop a competitive, free-market-oriented economy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/23/world/18-die-in-colombian-clashes-as-most-rebels-await-truce.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "18 Die in Colombian Clashes As Most Rebels Await Truce", "print_headline": "18 Die in Colombian Clashes As Most Rebels Await Truce", "body_text": " **********At least 18 Colombian policemen and members of a pro-Cuban guerrilla group died in clashes today as members of other rebel groups prepared to sign a truce with the Government, Defense Ministry sources said. **********The sources said about 50 members of the National Liberation Army attacked a police barracks near the Venezuelan border, killing eight policemen and wounding seven, and pursuing troopers later killed at least 10 rebels. **********The National Liberation Army has rejected peace proposals by the Government, which has arranged to sign truce agreements with the Maoist People's Liberation Army the leftist M-19 guerrilla movement.

Of the tens of thousands of neglected and abandoned children that inhabit this city, the downtown urchins known as ''gamines'' (the word is taken directly from the French gamin) are the most visible reminder of the problems of family disintegration accompanying Colombia's urbanization process. **********Yet the urchins, mainly boys between the ages of 8 and 18, in fact comprise an elite. They have learned to survive and even prosper on their own. They are tough, wily and well embarked on a life of crime, likely to be interrupted only by spells in jail. **********Further, the urchins are distinguished by their strong sense of freedom. Most opt to leave home, they travel widely around the country, they speak a slang unintelligible to outsiders and they accept only the internal rules of their gangs.   'Taming' Methods Fail **********Rejecting a society that rejects them, the urchins have therefore long been considered beyond rehabilitation, with orthodox ''taming'' methods - police roundups, juvenile detention centers or reform schools - merely feeding their instinct to rebel. **********But in the early 1970's, the Rev. Javier de Nicolo, a 56-year-old Italian-born Roman Catholic priest, decided to test a different approach, respecting rather than repressing the urchins, treating them as normal rather than mentally disturbed and wooing rather than coercing them to change their ways. **********''I used to visit inmates in the juvenile prison,'' he recalled, ''and I found that I was reaching out to a hand that was handcuffed. So I thought, what if I reach out when it is not handcuffed? The change was dramatic. In a spontaneous situation, it was so much easier to form a friendship.'' **********Since making what he describes as ''this discovery,'' Father Nicolo has built up Bogota's one successful rehabilitation program for street urchins around the principle of voluntary participation. ''The essential thing for a gamin is his freedom,'' he said. ''Education without freedom and affection simply cannot work.'' **********Distrust is the principal obstacle. From the moment young children walk out of their homes, either fleeing violence, neglect and hopeless poverty or following the example of brothers or friends, they learn the rule of ''every boy for himself.'' Already at the age of 6 or 7, they keep themselves by begging, shining shoes or singing on buses and street corners. They also start traveling and, if born in the provinces, many are eventually drawn to Bogota. **********Before becoming a gamin and being accepted into a gang, however, the young wanderer must prove his mettle, not only by regularly using some drug or intoxicant but also by demonstrating he can steal.   Street Life Gets Tougher **********''The rules are very strict,'' said Saul Jose Robles, a 17-year-old former gamin. ''The key thing is the law of silence. If a body is found on the street, no one can say a word. Informants may be killed or doused with gasoline when they're asleep and set alight.'' **********Although Father Nicolo's program has enrolled over 1,000 urchins, life has become tougher for those who stay on the streets. In the past, citizens were less alert to the threat of pickpockets, watch snatchers and petty assailants, while the urchins needed less money to sustain their gasoline-sniffing and marijuana habits. But today the higher cost of the cocaine paste known as bazuka forces the urchins into more ambitious and perilous crime. **********''The bazuka problem is very serious,'' said Manuel Ospina, who has worked with street urchins for 20 years. ''When they smoked marijuana they were happier and always hungry. Now they're more aggressive and undernourished. Bazuka takes away their appetites.'' **********It is in this hostile world that Father Nicolo and his assistants try to spread word of the program, visiting the children at night on the streets with food and a guitar and telling them about El Patio, a protected yard where they can get a free meal, wash their clothes and fix their wounds.   Building Up Motivation **********From 50 to 100 boys and a handful of girls show up there each day. Then, at the end of the afternoon, they return to sleep on the streets. But at El Patio they sense the warmth, understanding and respect of the educators and their interest in the rest of the program is often awakened. **********''When they ask to join the program, at first we always tell them that there is no room,'' said Mr. Ospina, who is in charge of El Patio. ''It's important to build up their motivation.'' **********In a house known as Liberia, where the urchins taking part in the program sleep after a day at El Patio, no weapons or drugs are allowed. After one month they are sent back to the streets for a long weekend exposed to the temptations of their former environment before moving to a two-month stage at a residence known as Bosconia. If they show up, their old clothes are burned in a ceremony and they join educational and training programs. **********The concepts of freedom and community, however, continue to be emphasized at the so-called Boys' Republic at La Florida, on the outskirts of Bogota, where the former street urchins may spend up to six years and where discipline and organization are entirely in the hands of teen-age leaders elected by the community.   Basic Skills Taught **********In the well-equipped centers of the Republic, the boys have an orchestra, sports teams, a cooperative shop, a cafeteria, a bakery, weekend movies, a bank and even their own currency. At the same time as they take part in primary and secondary school, they learn basic industrial and farming skills, although 30 alumni have so far gone on to university. **********But the program has not been shielded from the effects of Colombia's current economic crisis. About 90 percent of financing for La Florida comes from the Government, but it has been forced to reduce expenditure. **********''We're in terrible economic straits,'' Father Nicolo said. ''A couple of years ago there were few gamins left on the streets, but the economic crisis has produced more and we can't receive them all. Still, one must be optimistic.  When I started, the police and judges said I was corrupting minors by feeding them and sending them back into the streets to steal. Now, at least, that debate is over.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/15/world/estonian-ex-official-and-wife-are-said-to-defect-to-sweden.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 88, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Estonian Ex-Official and Wife Are Said to Defect to Sweden", "print_headline": "Estonian Ex-Official and Wife Are Said to Defect to Sweden", "body_text": " **********A former Deputy Justice Minister of the Soviet republic of Estonia and his wife, a pop singer, have defected to Sweden, the police said today. **********A National Police Board spokesman said requests for asylum by the former official, Valdo Randpere, 26 years old, and his wife, Leila Miller, 23, were being investigated.

The one that has received the most attention is the one that would be paid by a customer for connection to the telephone network. The other is a charge to be paid by the long-distance companies - such as A.T.& T., MCI Communications and GTE-Sprint - for connections to the local telephone companies. **********The rate of return has emerged as a key issue in the debate about the second type of access charges - those the local companies would charge the long-distance companies. **********The Bell companies want those fees pegged to yield the traditional 12.75 percent rate of return - established when the phone system was a regulated monopoly. **********A.T.& T., in an emergency petition to the commission, has asserted that such fees would severely reduce its earnings.

Wilson, some 30 years ago. But the evidence surrounding the General Motors-Toyota joint venture in California to produce a subcompact car with American labor and Japanese technology and production-line know-how suggests that this old equation simply does not compute. **********In this case, what is good for General Motors' bottom line is not good for the competitiveness of the United States. Moreover, the role played by the Federal Trade Commission in deciding this case only demonstrates how deficient this country still is in recognizing the national stakes that are involved in today's global economic competition. **********Unquestionably, the deal will help G.M. Faced with a gap at the important low end of the product line and the prospect of a permanent loss of this market to the Japanese, G.M. has rebounded brilliantly. The venture with Toyota will give G.M. a low- cost, high-quality, technologically up- to-date vehicle with a minimum of investment. **********Never mind the claim from the G.M. and F.T.C. staffs that the project represents a chance to learn more efficient production techniques from Toyota. G.M. already knows how Toyota builds cars. It has an ownership position in Isuzu and Suzuki of Japan, as well as access to all the information it wants or needs on the layout of Japanese auto plants, management-labor relations and management-supplier relations. This is a pragmatic business decision, a strategic move that will help G.M. make money in the one place it is weakest. **********Unfortunately for the United States, G.M. will be making money rather than cars, and it is this difference that has potentially far-reaching implications for the future competitiveness of the American auto industry. Taken as a whole, the operation at an idle G.M. plant in Fremont, Calif., will amount to little more than a site for the assembly of 250,000 knockdown kits a year from Japan. The car itself will be Japanese designed and Japanese engineered. A predominance of the high-technology components will come from Japanese suppliers. Even a large share of the machine tools in the assembly plant will be Japanese. Then, at the end, the familiar Chevrolet ''bow tie'' will go on the front. **********The fundamental meaning of the G.M.-Toyota deal is that America's largest manufacturer has decided that it cannot compete against the Japanese in small cars. Stripped down to its bare essentials, G.M.'s response is to redefine a part of its business: From car maker to car importer and wholesaler. **********The ramifications are potentially staggering - not only for the American auto industry but also for much of American industry now entering global competition. If G.M. cannot compete against the Japanese in small cars, will it be able to compete in the future in mid-size cars, where the Japanese are already beginning to press their cost and quality advantages? **********IF G.M. cannot compete, is there **********any reason to think Ford and **********Chrysler can? If the United States auto makers cannot compete with their own American-made cars, then what is the future for the thousands of American suppliers whose components actually make up the finished product? **********The auto industry in America represents the hinge on the door of the economy. It not only has forged links with the traditional ''smokestack'' industries of the past, but it is also increasingly tied into the high-tech industries of the future. A determined effort by the auto makers, led by G.M., to reassert American manufacturing strength through investment in new plant and equipment, in research and development, and in restructured labor and government relations would have economywide benefits for old and emerging industries. **********American management, labor and government need to negotiate a national competitive strategy for global competition in which all three are committed to high quality, low-cost and free trade. But the G.M.-Toyota deal moves the auto makers away from this goal into a far different role - marketing foreign-made products. **********For G.M. to join the service economy may be the worst news of all. The result may be that G.M. prospers - but the opportunity for the manufacturing base, for the work force and for systemwide American competitiveness is diminished. **********Finally, the inability of the Federal Government to look at the G.M.- Toyota deal in a strategic fashion represents the biggest failure. After all, in an industry undergoing major changes because of international competition, G.M. is merely looking after its own interests. But who in the Federal Government is looking after America's interests in the new global competition? Not the F.T.C. It's not their job. They are merely passing judgment on the narrow jurisdictional grounds that are in their charter. **********And so the larger questions of America's long-term manufacturing position in the world again go unasked - and unanswered. **********Alan Webber is senior research fellow at the Harvard Business School and an associate editor of the Harvard Business Review."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/22/business/nui-loses-bid.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NUI Loses Bid", "print_headline": "NUI Loses Bid", "body_text": " **********The NUI Corporation lost its bid to take control of the board of the New Jersey Resources Corporation. **********Both are holding companies for gas utilities in New Jersey.

Tass gave no details on damage. **********The dispatch said the earthquake had been felt from Ashkhabad near the Iranian border through Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tadzhikistan to Tashkent, a city devastated in 1966 by an earthquake that measured 10 on the Soviet scale and left many dead. **********According to Tass, the quake today registered 7, or ''very powerful,'' in Chardzhou in Turkmenistan, and readings of 6, or ''powerful,'' in two other Turkmenian cities, Mary and Tashauz, and in the Uzbek city of Samarkand. **********Tashkent and other Uzbek cities registered between 5 and 6, as did Ashkhabad.   Necessary Assistance' Given **********''The population of the areas rocked by the earthquake is being given the necessary assistance along by national and republic agencies,'' Tass said, giving no further details. **********The quake was centered in an area long affected by earthquakes, and Soviet publications have reported construction techniques designed to withstand quakes. **********A series of minor quakes and tremors have been reported in recent weeks, a pattern that has preceded major jolts in the past. **********Gazli, the settlement reported hardest hit today, was destroyed in the 1976 quake, which also caused damage to Bukhara's delicate minarets and blue- tile monuments. **********Though the Soviet press normally minimizes reports of disasters, it described tent and trailer cities around Gazli and Bukhara at the time of the 1976 quake, as well as the dispatch of bulldozers, machinery, food and medicine to the area. **********The Bukhara-Gazli region lies on a fault along the convergence of the Indian and Asian continental plates, making it susceptible to tremors. **********The biggest quake in modern history struck Tashkent in 1966, when a series of devastating jolts leveled a fifth of the city, left 300,000 homeless and 15 dead, according to official figures. The city has been rebuilt with quake-resistant structures. Major earthquakes also destroyed Ashkhabad in 1948 and in 1868."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/31/business/broken-hill-goal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Broken Hill Goal", "print_headline": "Broken Hill Goal", "body_text": " **********The Broken Hill Proprietary Company said it hopes to acquire an American oil company and a direct interest in a North Sea oilfield within two years.

The needed reforms are far from complete, but substantial progress can already be seen: the burden of regulation has been reduced, tax rates have been lowered and the tax structure improved, Government spending on a wide range of domestic programs has been curtailed, and a sound monetary policy has been established. **********Although the full favorable effect of those reforms on our nation's rate of economic growth will take time to develop, some of the benefit of our economic policies is already visible in the current recovery. The economy's performance in 1983 was very gratifying to me. The 3.2 percent rise in consumer prices between 1982 and 1983 was the lowest rate of inflation since 1967. The recovery produced a sharp drop in unemployment and a substantial increase in the income of American families. The number of people at work increased by more than 4 million and the unemployment rate fell from a high of 10.7 percent in December 1982 to 8.2 percent in December 1983. The 6.1 percent rise in real gross national product last year means that real annual income per person in the United States rose $700. **********Reducing Unemployment **********Despite the substantial reduction in unemployment, the number of unemployed workers remains unacceptably high. Continued economic recovery will mean millions of additional jobs in the years ahead and further declines in the rate of unemployment. In 1984 alone, the American economy is expected to add more than 3 million additional jobs. By the end of the decade, we will need 16 million new jobs to absorb a growing labor force. Only a strong and expanding economy can provide those jobs while achieving a progressively lower level of unemployment over the next six years. **********Although economic growth is by far the most important way to reduce unemployment, special policies to help the structurally unemployed and particularly disadvantaged groups can also be helpful. To assist these individuals in developing job-related skills that will lead to productive careers in the private sector, I proposed the Job Training Partnership Act that I signed into law in 1982. Last year I proposed additional measures to increase opportunities for training and retraining. Although the Congress has enacted some of my employment proposals, I am still waiting for Congressional action on others. **********Of particular concern to me is the unemployment among teen-agers. Such unemployment is not only a problem in itself, but is also indicative of lost opportunities to acquire on-the-job training and job-related skills. It is widely recognized that the minimum wage law is a substantial barrier to the employment of teen- agers, especially minority teen- agers. I have proposed that during the summer months the minimum wage for teen-agers be reduced to 75 percent of the regular minimum wage. This reform would give many teen-agers the opportunity to get a first job and acquire the skills needed to help them with subsequent employment and would not hurt adult employment. With an unemployment rate of nearly 50 percent among black teen-agers and with only about 20 percent of black teen-agers employed, we must act. The Federal Government must not be the source of barriers to employment. **********Inflation and  Monetary Policy **********Reducing the rate of inflation was my most immediate economic goal when I arrived in Washington. In the preceding 24 months, the consumer price level had increased more than 27 percent. Many people feared the United States Government had lost its ability to control inflation. Until inflation was brought under control, a healthy recovery could not get under way. **********The inflation rate has declined dramatically over the past three years. Between 1982 and 1983, the Consumer Price Index rose only 3.2 percent. Americans can again have confidence in the value of the dollar, and they can save for the future without fearing that the purchasing power of these savings will be destroyed by inflation. I am firmly committed to keeping inflation on a downward path. We must never relax in our pursuit of price stability. **********The basic requirement for a continued moderation of inflation is a sound monetary policy. I continue to support the Federal Reserve in its pursuit of price stability through sound monetary policy. Last year was a particularly difficult time for monetary policy because of the substantial changes in financial regulations. I am pleased that, in spite of these difficulties, the monetary aggregates at the end of the year were within their target ranges. I expect that in 1984 the Federal Reserve will expand the money stock at a moderate rate that is consistent with both sustained recovery and continuing progress against inflation. **********There are those who advocate a fast rate of money growth in an attempt to depress interest rates. Experience shows, however, that rapid money growth inevitably leads to an increased rate of inflation and higher interest rates. The only monetary policy that can bring interest rates down, and keep them down, is one that promotes confidence that inflation will continue to decline in the years ahead. **********The Dollar  And the Trade Deficit **********The high interest rates in the United States and our low rate of inflation continue to make dollar securities an appealing investment for individuals and businesses around the world. In addition, the United States has been an attractive place for stock market investment and for direct business investment. The result has been a continued rise in the dollar's exchange value relative to other currencies of the world. **********The sharp rise in the value of the dollar since 1980 has made it cheaper for Americans to purchase products from overseas, thereby helping us fight inflation. But the dollar's sharp rise has made it difficult for American businesses and farmers to compete in world markets. The decline in U.S. exports and the substantial rise in our imports has resulted in record trade deficits in 1982 and 1983. The trade deficit has been temporarily exacerbated by the international debt problems and by the more advanced stage of recovery in the United States than in the world at large. **********Despite these problems, I remain committed to the principle of free trade as the best way to bring the benefits of competition to American consumers and businesses. It would be totally inappropriate to respond by erecting trade barriers or by using taxpayers' dollars to subsidize exports. Instead, we must work with the other nations of the world to reduce the export subsidies and import barriers that currently hurt U.S. farmers, businesses and workers. **********I am also firmly opposed to any attempt to depress the dollar's exchange value by intervention in international currency markets. Pure exchange market intervention cannot offset the fundamental factors that determine the dollar's value. Intervention in the foreign exchange market would be an exercise in futility that would probably enrich currency speculators at the expense of American taxpayers. A combination of exchange market intervention and expansionary monetary policy could reduce the dollar's exchange value, but only by causing an unacceptable increase in the rate of inflation. The dollar must therefore be allowed to seek its natural value without exchange market intervention. **********Regulation **********One of the four key elements of my program for economic recovery is a far-reaching program of regulatory relief. Substantial progress has been made during the last three years. The growth of new regulations has been reduced by more than a third. The demands on the private sector of Government paperwork have been reduced by several hundred million hours a year. The Congress approved legislation that has led to substantial deregulation of financial markets and intercity bus transportation. The Federal Communications Commission, with our support, has reduced the regulation of broadcasting and of new communications technology, and the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Civil Aeronautics Board have gone far down the path of deregulation of competitive transportation markets. The benefits of these and other deregulation measures are now increasingly apparent to American consumers and businesses. **********It is also apparent that substantial further deregulation and regulatory reform will require changes in the basic regulatory legislation. I urge the Congress to act on the several measures that I proposed last year on natural gas decontrol, financial deregulation and reform of private pension regulation. I remain confident that there is a basis for agreement on measures that would reduce the burden of Federal regulations, while protecting our shared values and not jeopardizing safety. **********Tax Reforms **********The final installment of the three- year personal tax cut took effect in July, giving a helpful boost to the economic recovery. The income tax rate at each income level has been reduced by about 25 percent since 1980. In 1984 a median-income four-person family will pay about $1,100 less than it would have without these tax reductions. And, beginning in 1985, the tax brackets will be adjusted automatically so that inflation will no longer push taxpayers into higher brackets and increase the share of their income taken in taxes. **********The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 went beyond reducing tax rates to establish important reforms in the structure of the tax system. For businesses, the Accelerated Cost Recovery System increased the after- tax profitability of investments in plant and equipment. The sharp fall in inflation has also increased after- tax profitability. As a result, investment in business equipment has recently been quite strong despite the high real interest rates. **********For individuals, the Economic Recovery Tax Act reduced the marriage tax penalty, the estate tax burden, and tax discrimination against saving. The response to the universal eligibility of Individual Retirement Accounts has been far greater than was originally expected. It is estimated that more than 15 million individuals now use I.R.A.'s to save for their retirement. Last year, I proposed to expand the opportunity for all married couples to use I.R.A.'s fully by allowing them to contribute up to $2,000 each per year to an I.R.A. even if only one has wage income. **********Further improvement and simplification of our tax system are sorely needed. The burden of taxation depends not only on the quantity of tax revenue that is collected but also on the quality of the tax system. I have asked the Secretary of the Treasury to develop a plan of action with specific recommendations to make our tax system fairer, simpler, and less of a burden on our nation's economy. By broadening the tax base, personal tax rates could come down, not go up. Our tax system would stimulate greater economic growth and provide more revenue. **********Government Spending **********One of my principal goals when I came to Washington was to reverse the dramatic growth of Federal spending on domestic programs and to shift more resources to our nation's defense. Although many doubted this could be done, both goals are being achieved. We must do everything that we can to avoid waste in defense as in other areas of Government. But we must also be willing to pay the cost of providing the military capability to defend our country and to meet our responsibilities as the leading nation of the free world. Outlays for defense had declined to only 5.2 percent of G.N.P. in 1980, less than one-fourth of total Government outlays. By the current fiscal year, defense outlays have increased to 6.7 percent of G.N.P and 28 percent of total outlays. Real defense outlays have grown 39 percent since 1980. Our spending on defense, however, remains a far smaller percentage of our national income than it was in 1960, when defense outlays took 9.7 percent of G.N.P. **********Real spending has been cut on a wide range of domestic programs and activities. Many wasteful bureaucratic activities have been eliminated and the number of nondefense employees on the Federal payroll has been reduced by 71,000. We have examined every area of Federal Government spending, and sought to eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending while protecting the benefits needed by the poor and the aged. As a result, total nondefense spending now takes a smaller share of our G.N.P. than it did in 1980. Moreover, under present law, nondefense spending will continue to take a declining share of our G.N.P. in the years ahead. **********This reduction has been accomplished without any decrease in existing Social Security benefits or any change in the Medicare benefits for the elderly. Spending on all other nondefense activities and programs has actually declined over 12 percent in real terms since 1980. Even with no further reductions in these activities and programs, their share of G.N.P. in 1986 will be nearly back to the level of 1965. **********I am committed to continuing the search for ways to reduce Government spending. The budget that I am submitting to the Congress identifies significant savings in entitlement programs and reductions in outlays for other programs that are excessive or that are not the proper responsibility of the Federal Government. The Grace Commission has given us some 2,500 ways to reduce wasteful spending that could save billions of dollars in the years ahead. **********Budget Deficits **********I have long believed that our nation's budget must be balanced. A pattern of overspending by the Federal Government has produced a deficit in 22 of the last 23 years. My most serious economic disappointment in 1983 was therefore the failure of the Congress to enact the deficit reduction proposals that I submitted last January in my budget for fiscal 1984. We would be much closer to a balanced budget today if the Congress had enacted all of the spending cuts that I have requested since assuming office, and if the long recession and the sharp decline in inflation had not substantially reduced real tax revenue. In last year's budget I proposed changes in outlays and revenues that could put the deficit on a sharply declining path that, by 1988, would have been less than 2 percent of G.N.P. and on its way to a balance of revenues and outlays. **********The unwillingness of the Congress to accept the proposals that I offered has made it clear to me that we must wait until after this year's election to enact spending reductions coupled with tax simplification that will eventually eliminate our budget deficit. But we cannot delay until 1985 to start reducing the deficits that are threatening to prevent a sustained and healthy recovery. I have therefore called on the Democratic and Republican leaders in the Congress to designate representatives to work with the Administration on the development of a ''down-payment'' deficit reduction program. **********I believe that this bipartisan group could develop a package that could be enacted this spring which would reduce the deficit by about $100 billion over the next three fiscal years. The package could include a number of the less-contentious spending cuts that are pending before the Congress plus additional outlay savings based on the proposals of the Grace Commission. Additional revenue could be provided by measures to close certain tax loopholes - measures that the Department of the Treasury has previously said are worthy of support. **********These deficit reductions can increase the public's confidence in our economic future and their faith in the ability of the political system to deal satisfactorily with the deficit. The down-payment package can be a first step toward full elimination of the remaining deficits. Even with a three- year $100 billion package, the deficits projected for fiscal 1986 and beyond are totally unacceptable to me. They would be a serious threat to our nation's economic health and a heavy burden to future generations. I am committed to finding ways to reduce further the growth of spending and to put the budget on a path that will lead to a balance between outlays and receipts. In 1985 I will submit a budget that can achieve this goal. But we must go further and make basic structural reforms in the budgetary process - including the line-item veto and the balanced budget amendment - that will keep spending under control and prevent deficits in the future. **********Looking Ahead **********As I look ahead, I am very optimistic about the prospects for the American economy. Substantial progress has been made in reforming the economic policies that will shape our economic future. If we continue to develop and pursue sound policies, our nation can achieve a long period of strong economic growth with low inflation, and the American people can enjoy unprecedented prosperity and economic security."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/02/business/cbs-records-reported-near-mtv-video-pact.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Music", "pub_date": "1984-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 569, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CBS RECORDS REPORTED NEAR MTV VIDEO PACT", "print_headline": "CBS RECORDS REPORTED NEAR MTV VIDEO PACT", "body_text": " **********Neither company would confirm or deny yesterday that such a accord was in the works.

Shanxi Province is China's leading source of coal, accounting for well over one-fifth of the 715 million tons produced last year. **********But a potentially mammoth joint venture between the Occidental Petroleum Corporation and the Chinese Government to exploit Shanxi's new Pingshuo mining area has yet to materialize after four years of strenuous negotiations and no fewer than three interim contracts. **********Notwithstanding the optimistic predictions from Occidental's venerable chairman, Armand Hammer, and a highly publicized contract timed to coincide with President Reagan's visit to China last April, the concluding agreement, promised for last July, has still not been signed. **********''We've got a lot of criticism on this deal with China,'' Dr. Hammer said last week in New York at a meeting of securities analysts. ''You've got to learn a lot of patience and learn to say no'' to the Chinese. **********He attributed the delays mainly to dealing with China's bureaucracy. ''It would be a shame if we got cold feet,'' he said, ''and I assure you, we're not going to get cold feet.'' **********John J. Dorgan, Occidental's executive vice president for finance, said that the July date for completing the contract had now been extended to Dec. 15. ''There is no cash input from Occidental and no exposure after completion,'' Mr. Dorgan said, assuring the analysts that even if the project never goes through, Occidental won't be hurt financially. **********The joint venture, which is expected to cost $600 million, has been plagued by a shortage of financing, despite a $160 million credit line stitched together by the Bank of China and six other Western banks. **********More problems developed this month. Peter Kiewit Sons Inc., an Omaha-based construction company, backed out of its earlier agreement with Occidental to assume half the financing obligation. The Bank of China was persuaded to cover the gap, increasing China's share to three-quarters of the cost. **********Both sides have attributed the delays in part to a drop in world coal prices during the protracted negotiations. The China National Coal Development Corporation and Occidental each tried to use this to get the other to scale down its share of expected profits. **********This dropping of the coal prices affects the prospects of the joint venture, said Gong Kunsheng, the deputy manager of the China Pingshuo Surface Coal Company, as he led some visiting Chinese and foreign journalists to a broad valley where work had begun to prepare Pingshuo's first open pit coal mine, Antaibao No. 1, for excavation next spring. **********Mr. Gong said that the world coal price sank from $52 a ton in 1982 to under $40 a ton. With such a decline, Mr. Gong complained, ''we have no way to make money, we have no way to recover the cost.'' **********The deal is still afloat because neither side can afford to see it fail. For Dr. Hammer, 86 years old, building the world's biggest open pit coal mine in China would cap an impressive career spent trying to turn a capitalist profit with Communist governments, notably the Soviet Union, over the last six decades. **********For China, more hangs on the Pingshuo coal project than just the acquisition of Western coal-mining technology and experience. Other United States companies, which know Dr. Hammer's reputation for taking a gamble in Communist countries, may be hesitant to invest in China themselves if Occidental gave up. **********Coal, which already accounts for 70 percent of China's energy consumption, is central to China's strategy for modernizing itself. China ranks after the Soviet Union and the United States as the world's third-largest coal producer, digging out 2 million tons a day. Yet, according to the State Economic Commission, about 20 percent of factory machinery stands idle for lack of power. **********To meet a target of nearly doubling national production, to 1.2 billion tons of coal a year before the end of the century, China has encouraged the development of many small, inefficient rural mines with outdated equipment and safety hazards that one study described as appalling. **********Coal production with this approach increased by 30 million tons in 1983, but the Chinese know that the small mines are too inefficient to be more than a stopgap. China must have Western help to meet its 1.2-billion- ton target. **********China's coal production also suffers from the kind of malaise that afflicts other sectors of the state-run economy. Officials of the Ministry of Coal Industry were considered so out of touch with what happened below ground that edicts went out a couple of years ago ordering them to spend some time in the mine shafts or in other physical labor and to stop assigning their children and relatives cushy jobs above ground. **********China has given greater priority to coal production to help free petroleum, whose onshore production has stagnated, for export to earn hard currency. Coal itself is also viewed as a potentially lucrative export. **********Shanxi Province, an arid region of north China slightly larger than New York and New Jersey combined, has been designated as the base of China's energy drive, with the goal of nearly quadrupling its coal production, to 600 million tons, by the year 2000. **********To meet such targets, China has looked to Western companies with the necessary capital and know-how. For example, both the Fluor Corporation and the Bechtel Corporation have been engaged in their own respective studies of possible coal mining ventures with the Chinese in Inner Mongolia. **********Shanxi's Pingshuo mining area, 220 miles west of Peking, is considered promising because it sits atop a bed of wider-ranging bituminous coal reserves that have been estimated at 1.4 billion tons. **********The area, so named because it straddles the Montana-like terrain of Pinglu and Shouxian counties, contains seams of coal up to 50 feet thick, ranging mostly from 300 to 700 feet below ground. **********When Occidental signed its protocol in March 1982 to study the feasibility of developing the area, Dr. Hammer said that Occidental could recover its investment fairly rapidly. It was understood then that the coal output would be split until Occidental recouped its investment, after which China would get 60 percent and Occidental 40 percent. **********In March 1983, Dr. Hammer returned to Peking to sign an agreement that, after last-minute wrangling, was euphemistically called interim. By the following winter, the absence of new progress prompted rumors around Peking that the deal might collapse. The China daily newspaper took the rare step of reprinting a letter from Dr. Hammer to Deng Xiaoping, China's top leader, denying that Occidental was quitting.Last April 29, a project agreement was signed amid much fanfare in the Great Hall of the People. **********THE Chinese had said last summer that China would contribute **********$249 million to the project while Occidental and Kiewit together would provide $340 million in financing. With Kiewit out, the Chinese share of Pingshuo would exceed $400 million, including the Bank of China involvement. **********Dr. Hammer also used his visit to solicit backing from Mr. Deng, the architect of China's open door policy, in a private meeting. Some economic analysts here believe that the personal approach, which Dr. Hammer used with the Soviet leadership, insured him the support of the Bank of China. **********The Chinese have been developing Pingshuo's facilities in expectation that the mine will open as scheduled. A new residential town for 17,000 inhabitants is being built a dozen miles from the mining site. Mr. Gong said that China will have invested 200 million yuan - about $80 million - in all of its preparations by the end of this year. **********Occidental's problems have been typified by the dispute over wages. Initially, Occidental agreed to pay the equivalent of United States union scale wages to the 1,100 to 1,600 Chinese miners who will work at Pingshuo. After the world price of coal fell, Dr. Hammer implied that this was renegotiated to link the pay to productivity. **********Mr. Gong knew of no such changes in the wage scale, which he said would be $14.28 an hour, or nearly 50 times what a Chinese miner normally earns. As it has done with other joint ventures, the Government would keep most of this, passing on less than 3 percent to the miners in actual wages. China could reap up to $50 million a year in earnings on the side if such a wage structure remains unchanged. **********Of 15 million tons expected annually from the Antaibao No. 1 mine, the first scheduled for development, 8.7 million tons will be exported after washing to Japan and Southeast Asia. What remains will go to fuel local power stations. **********But production seems far off. ''There won't be a lump of coal come out of the ground for a long time,'' predicted a United States businessman in Peking familiar with the deal. **********Some Western business specialists in Peking also doubt that the China National Coal Development Corporation has the financial and technological capability to develop such a large open pit mine by itself. It has given no indication of soliciting other potential Western partners. **********At Pingshuo, Mr. Gong said that China only turned to Occidental to save time. If it became necessary, he said, ''we have confidence that we can also build this mine by ourselves.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/20/business/michelin-layoffs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 63, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Michelin Layoffs", "print_headline": "Michelin Layoffs", "body_text": " **********Michelin, the world's second-largest tire maker, told labor representatives here that it would lay off 4,920 of its 46,000 workers by the end of next year because of a depressed world tire market.

But this time we think there is a lot of substance behind the talk.'' **********Indeed, negotiations to merge the New York Futures Exchange and the Commodity Exchange have been under way for some time.

Horowitz, president of the N.Y.F.E., whose parent is the New York Stock Exchange. ''The brokers want to avoid duplicative paper work, but thus far they haven't used their clout.'' **********While stressing that negotiations between his exchange, which mainly trades stock index futures and options, and the Comex, the largest metals futures market, ''are still in the exploratory stage,'' Mr. Horowitz noted: **********''I think the best way to approach consolidation would be to first unify the clearing and other paper work of the five New York markets. After that, if the exchanges really want to take the final step, it would be an easy one.'' **********For his part, Alan J. Brody, president of the Comex, agreed, but pointed out: ''Unlike the two big Chicago markets, the five in New York face high walls of tradition as well as product diversity that would have to be surmounted before any moves toward unification could take place.'' **********He added: ''There are also extremely complex problems that have to be solved, such as differences in the values of exchange seats, apportionment of the precious physical trading space and, not the least, what to do about about the surplus of exchange officials that would result from any merger. If consolidation happens at all, it will require time and a few miracles.'' **********Michel D. Marks, chairman of the New York Mercantile, echoed this view, adding: ''Exchange politics and vested interests are the main blocks toward unification. It took 15 years of negotiations just to get four of the five New York futures markets under one roof at the World Trade Center in 1976. At that time, many thought consolidation was just around the corner. Today, we still don't have a single clearing mechanism or even joint processing of trading data.'' **********Member broker's clout? ''They used it to get us under one roof, after decades of spending money and time running their people around lower New York,'' Mr. Marks said, ''Since then, they haven't pushed for the further savings that would result from unifying the exchanges.'' **********The last merger of New York futures markets took place in 1979, when the small New York Cocoa Exchange, which did not join the move to the World Trade Center, was absorbed by the New York Coffee and Sugar Exchange. **********James J. Bowe, senior vice president of the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, said the merger proved to be a relatively simple matter, explaining: ''It was a logical merger because, for one, our markets were quite similar and to a large extent dependent on each other. For the cocoa members, it removed costly overhead; for us, the merger gave us a product that helps smooth out the cyclical nature of all agricultural futures markets.'' **********By the same token, wouldn't a merger of his market with the Cotton Exchange, whose only other product is frozen orange juice concentrate futures, be logical? ''Yes,'' Mr. Bowe replied, ''and we have talked with them about such a move from time to time, but nothing solid ever materialized and we are presently not discussing any merger move.'' **********Still, Adolf Reinhardt, chairman of the Cotton Exchange, believes that his pact with the New York Merc ''will be the first of many joint ventures between New York futures exchanges.'' **********If so, the joint-access arrangements could eventually pave the way for what most industry leaders hope would be one big New York futures exchange."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/14/business/economic-scene-argentina-s-ban-on-beef.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Silk", "pub_date": "1984-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 686, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; Argentina's Ban on Beef", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; Argentina's Ban on Beef", "body_text": " **********BUENOS AIRES **********ARGENTINA, famous as a nation of beef eaters and exporters, is going without beef and veal this week. The Government of Raul Alfonsin, in an effort to check the soaring rate of inflation, has imposed a weeklong prohibition on sales of beef and veal to Argentine consumers. **********Restaurants and hotels are forbidden to serve steaks. Foreign sales are still permitted, however, to help the country cover its enormous foreign debt, now estimated at $45 billion. **********The meat ban was sparked by a 17 percent increase in the consumer price index in February - 658 percent at an annual rate, which economists consider hyperinflation. **********Prices of fresh meat jumped 30 percent last month, and Commerce Secretary Ricardo Campero said the Government decided on the meat prohibition as an emergency measure. He attributed the emergency to heavy rains that prevented cattle raisers from bringing their animals to market. The Government also blames the preceding military Government for the short supply of cattle. **********The meat prohibition is being severely attacked by butchers, cattle raisers and the meatpacking industry. Some see it as a yielding by the Government to what they call ''housewife power.'' **********The National Housewives Movement, complaining of ''greedy middlemen and price-gouging shopkeepers,'' had begun a boycott last Friday and Saturday. Following a meeting with Secretary Campero, the president of the Housewives, Ana Maria Pizzurno de Giovanni, hailed the Government for acting ''in defense of consumers.'' **********But the butchers are in a rage. ''This measure is a shame,'' said one butcher, Norberto Carnovale. ''It is we, the butchers, who pay for this in the end. Will you tell me how I will pay taxes and rent? They must let us work in peace - it is impossible to stand a 100 percent rise in three months. On top of this, we have to stand the protests of the clients, who think we are the guilty ones.'' **********Another butcher, Ricardo Laterza, said: ''They eliminate our work source. The National Meat Board should implement a strict price control. The slaughter men and the intermediaries should be eliminated to end the speculation.'' **********Some customers also want stronger price controls. An elderly gentleman standing in a food line said, ''Price control - that is what they should implement, something rational that does not make all the meat cuts vanish from the counters.'' **********The prohibition on beef, which the Government has enforced by reducing the slaughter of cattle, appears to be effective but is having a perverse effect on other food prices. Chicken, pork, vegetables and other foods have been going up by an average of 15 percent to 20 percent in the last two days. **********The Government imposed a ceiling of 75 cents a pound on chicken but housewives found a shortage in the market, and the under-the-counter price has soared as high as $1.20 a pound. **********The theory behind the Government's move appears to have been that, as beef goes, so goes the Argentine cost of living. Indeed, it is estimated that meat makes up 25 percent of the consumer price index. **********Some economists feel, however, that meat no longer bulks that large in the Argentine cost of living. Nevertheless, Argentines remain very large meat eaters; it is estimated that they consume 165 pounds of beef apiece per year, compared with 99 pounds a person per year in the United States and 33 pounds in Brazil. **********Beef prices here are sensitive to rises in real wages, and with recent wage increases, some economists here blame the bulge in consumer demand for the climbing price of beef. **********Businessmen are also critical of the Government's move. Roberto Favelic, president of the Industrial Union, which is Argentina's equivalent of the National Association of Manufacturers in the United States, calls the beef prohibition a ''mistake, one that has been made before.'' **********He calls it ''ruling the country by index'' - that is, making political moves in reaction to monthly changes in the price index. The beef prohibition is supposed to end Saturday. Many Argentines have not suffered at home, since housewives, after the ban was announced last weekend, rushed out to buy in time."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/27/business/business-people-chief-of-bellsouth-gets-chairman-s-duties-too.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1984-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 215, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": ";  Chief of BellSouth Gets Chairman's Duties, Too", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; ;  Chief of BellSouth Gets Chairman's Duties, Too", "body_text": " **********John L.

Here comes audiotex.  Videotex, in which people retrieve information using computers or specially equipped television sets, has not really caught on, partly because most people do not have computers. But virtually everyone has a telephone. So now many companies are trying to offer information services using electronic voices. **********Such an idea is not entirely new. Dial-it services have long provided callers with time, weather and other information. But those systems usually use tape recorders and give everyone the same message. The new electronic systems allow the computer to respond to requests made by punching buttons on a tone telephone keypad. **********Dun & Bradstreet recently introduced a system that gives credit ratings of companies over the telephone.

Despite advances in electronic speech, the voices still sound somewhat mechanical. In some systems, according to George J. Finney, vice president of advanced development for Dun & Bradstreet, ''there is the unconscious notion that you're hearing from a retarded individual.'' One reason is that the person doing the recording must speak in a flat tone of voice because the phrases will be strung together in many different combinations. **********In addition, speech is costly to store in digital form. Recording and reproducing one second of natural-sounding speech requires the same amount of computer storage as is needed to store two pages of text. To reduce the memory required, system providers either skimp on speech quality or limit the vocabulary. **********Also, while speech response might be suitable for small pieces of information, like stock quotes, it is less suitable for large amounts of information. And the telephone keypad is not as versatile as a computer keyboard, as used in videotex systems, for entering requests for information. **********To use U.S. Quotes, for instance, the caller punches in an identification number for billing and then the ticker symbol. The letter ''I,'' for instance, is represented by pushing the 4 key and then the 3, because I is on the 4 key and is the third letter on the key. ''M'' is 6,1 and so on. **********The voice, while understandable, sounds like a scratchy recording of a person with a lisp. The service costs 12 cents a minute during trading hours and 6 cents otherwise, with a single quote taking about 30 seconds. Individuals can also program in their portfolios and receive quotes on all those stocks at once. **********Dun & Bradstreet's system has a better-sounding voice. To get a credit rating, payment history and other data, the user types in the phone number of the company being checked. Nevertheless, because of its limited vocabulary, Dunsvoice spells words rather than speaking them. For instance, after punching in the phone number of The New York Times, and waiting 20 to 40 seconds, the system responds that it is a publishing company in New York, whose name is spelled N-E-W-Y-O-R-K. Other keys must be hit to get the computer to spell out the full name and address (2-2-9-W-4-3-R-D-S- T). **********To get around the limited vocabulary, other companies, such as the Digital Equipment Corporation, have developed systems that convert text to speech, rather than playing back recorded speech. Digital's new DECtalk system can pronounce virtually any text stored in a computer, using phonetic rules and a list of exceptions covering words that are not pronounced phonetically. **********The system produces voices that vary from a booming bass to a squeaky child's that are usually understandable but that sound as if they have a foreign accent. (Hear for yourself by dialing the demonstration, 617-493-TALK.) Shawmut Bank is experimenting with the system to give account information. MCI is planning to use DECtalk to allow customers of its electronic mail service to have their messages read to them."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/25/jobs/computers-print-out-a-brand-new-industry.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Reinhold", "pub_date": "1984-03-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Job Market", "type_of_material": "Series", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPUTERS PRINT OUT A BRAND NEW INDUSTRY", "print_headline": "COMPUTERS PRINT OUT A BRAND NEW INDUSTRY", "body_text": " **********STRANGE as it seems, one of the areas least touched by the computer revolution has been the engineering and design of the very silicon chips and integrated circuits that are the motor force of the revolution. The design and testing of these circuits have traditionally been done only by mechanical means, almost by hand, with only partial help from mainframe computers. **********Now, however, an entire sub-industry is evolving to provide electronic engineers with computerized ''work stations'' that enable them to do everything from working out the original schematic design of an integrated circuit to testing it on a computer screen, with tremendous advantages in productivity. As such, this sub-industry is growing even faster than the computer industry as a whole, opening vast new career opportunities. **********The field is called computer-aided engineering, or C.A.E. in the argot of ''Silicon Valley.'' It is difficult to predict with precision what the C.A.E. job prospects will be, but by most accounts they are bright indeed. The three leaders in the industry employ a total of only about 600 people today, but they are growing so fast that some estimate that tens of thousands will be working in the industry within five years. The companies, unable to find enough qualified help, are vigorously recruiting engineering students, offering stock options to sweeten their already very competitive salary offers. **********Companies in aerospace, computer design, semiconductors, telecommunications and consumer goods are all beginning to use and buy the new systems, which save a great amount of time and give a substantial competitive edge in industries where innovation is so rapid that even a few weeks' lead time can make the difference between success and failure. **********''The field is red hot,'' said Jared Anderson, 46-year-old president of one of the three leaders of the C.A.E. industry, Valid Logic Systems of Mountain View. ''It will change everything. Nobody will ever do things the old way again. '' **********Logic has grown to 220 employees from 26 in just one year. The staff at another of the three leaders, Mentor Graphics of Beaverton, Ore., has swelled to nearly 200 from 50 over the same period, although some came by way of a merger. Daisy Systems of Sunnyvale, Calif., the third of this big three, has grown to 390 from about a dozen in three and a half years and expects to hire 100 to 150 more before year's end. **********All three companies became profitable last year and all went public in recent months. Sales at Daisy, for example, were $17 million for fiscal 1983; for the first quarter of 1984 they were $13 million. The industry expects even better results over the next few years. **********There is much room for growth. Michael Bosworth, spokesman for Mentor, said the three leaders had sold only about 2,000 systems in a potential market of 400,000. Other companies are expected to enter the fray soon. **********Though these companies sell complete systems, consisting of both hardware (the machines) and software (the instructions to run them), it is the software that is their specialty. Thus they are looking, above all, for engineers well grounded in software. Once the stepchild of the computer industry, software is quickly coming of age as the driving force in C.A.E. and other aspects of the industry. ''There is likely to be a greater premium on software people,'' Mr. Bosworth said. **********Representatives of all three companies said they were looking for good general training in electrical engineering and computer science rather than for any special skills in C.A.E. when hiring ''NCG's,'' jargon for new college graduates. **********Thomas H. Schaeffer, staffing manager at Daisy, said his company was recruiting at such schools as the University of Michigan, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., California Institute of Technology, Stanford and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, seeking graduates ranging from B.A.'s to Ph.D.'s. The recruiters also consider physics and mathematics majors, who have proved useful in the ''simulation'' aspect of the business, in which certain arithmetical procedures and equations are essential to verifying the adequacy of designs. He said Ph.D.s were often hired for the graphics, a specialty in which universities have been particularly strong. **********At Mentor Graphics, Mr. Bosworth said the company was recruiting hardware designers in two areas: development engineers to design products, and applications engineers to counsel customers on how to use them. The applications area generally requires more experience, but the company looks mostly for general education in electrical engineering, perhaps with specialization in data communication. But the those people who are hardest to find and most prized by Mentor are those with experience in both hardware and software. ''We are moving toward recruiting masters in computer science or bachelors with some experience in hardware design,'' said Mr. Bosworth. **********SIMILARLY, Mr. Anderson at Valid said that his company sought a ''broad background'' in computer science, ''good programmers with a demonstrated breadth of knowledge in both software and hardware problems.'' **********These companies pay salaries slightly above average for the computer industry. Mentor pays $25,000 to $35,000 for new graduates, and $30,000 to $40,000 for more experienced applications engineers. Valid starts new graduates at about $27,000. Daisy pays the same for inexperienced graduates, and $29,000 to $30,000 for those with master's degrees; remuneration for Ph.D.'s varies widely according to specialty and experience. **********In addition, for now at least, all three offer stock options that can mean great wealth if the company prospers. At Valid, for example, a new engineer is given options to buy stock worth $50,000 to $100,000 at current market value. He cannot exercise the options until he has worked for the company at least six months, then invests gradually over three years. If the stock goes up over the years, he stands to realize profits that can far exceed salary. **********C.A.E. systems provide a single means to design and test integrated circuits from concept of the logic to final test of the prototype. Usually, the system links a dozen or more engineers working on the same project in a ''network'' that ties them all into one data base. Circuits are becoming so complex that they are usually designed by large teams. The buyers of these systems include Digital Equipment, Rolm, Hewlett-Packard, I.T.T. and I.B.M. **********Recruiters for C.A.E. companies visit major engineering schools regularly. They also send representatives to the annual Design Automation Conference, to be held this year in Albuquerque in June. **********Further information can be obtained from the companies: Daisy Systems, 139 Kifer Court, Sunnyvale, Calif. 94086; Mentor Graphics, 8500 S.W.

And no sector has escaped. Wage cuts have prompted hundreds of the Government's best-trained employees to leave for jobs with multinational corporations. University budgets have fallen by 60 percent in real terms since 1981, prompting many professors to strike. Small companies that export oranges or shoes are flourishing, while auto makers, appliance manufacturers and food processors trying to sell their products to Brazilians are in crisis. **********Every morning, the flights to Brasilia from Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are still full of businessmen. But a few years ago, they were arriving to compete for lucrative Government contracts; today, they fly to the capital to plead for long overdue payment on those contracts, which were completed months ago. **********For most Brazilians, then, ''austerity'' - the standard medicine prescribed by the I.M.F. for ailing third- world economies - requires no proving. For them, the evidence that Brazil is being ''governed'' from abroad is overwhelming. Even in the two areas of special interest to the I.M.F. - Government spending and exports - the country is behaving well, pushing up exports at the expense of domestic consumption and spending less on a variety of Government programs. But what Brazilians have yet to see are the rewards - the economic recovery - promised by the I.M.F. in exchange for the sacrifice that is permitting the country to keep up with its foreign debt payments. **********Brazil is a good case study of how an austerity program works, not only because of the country's size and complexity and its disciplined and successful response to the I.M.F. of late, but also because the impact of austerity on its economy and society is dramatically visible. Brazil is also a fair case to study because, at the time the fund entered the picture, Latin America's largest nation had already experienced two years of recession accompanied by tumbling per-capita income. **********That raised and still raises the question whether the Government would have been forced anyway to impose unpopular austerity measures to revive the economy - even without the prodding of the I.M.F. The passions stirred in Latin America by the mere mention of the I.M.F. complicate the search for answers to this question. **********THE clouds began to gather over **********Brazil's economic ''miracle'' - **********its years of rapid economic growth and industrialization - as early as 1973 with the first sharp rise in world oil prices. But, despite its overwhelming dependence on imported oil, it chose to keep growing, depending increasingly on foreign borrowing to pay the oil bill. After the second oil price shock of 1979, however, a growing current account payments deficit forced the Government to retrench by cutting back Government expenditure and imports. **********Like many developing countries, Brazil had required a high level of imports - and a permanent trade deficit - in order to sustain its rapid economic expansion during the 1960's and early 1970's. With the oil crisis, it was forced to accept a slower growth rate to keep the trade deficit under control. It achieved this partly by slashing imports needed for growth, including machinery and raw materials for its new factories, and partly by stimulating exports through a currency devaluation. The devaluation had the additional effect of feeding inflation and eroding local purchasing power. **********The 1979 oil price rise had one salutary effect in that Brazil was at last prompted to invest heavily in developing alcohol as a gasoline substitute and in increasing domestic oil output. As a result, five years later, Brazil's oil import bill has fallen by half, to an estimated $5 billion this year. But new ''external'' shocks awaited the country, principally when Mexico's financial collapse in August 1982 led nervous foreign banks to cut back on new loans here. **********Brazil still did everything possible to avoid turning to the I.M.F. It argued that it was voluntarily taking all the necessary austerity measures, but merely needed ''new money'' to deal with ''cash flow'' problems aggravated by high interest rates. Only when foreign banks linked disbursement of this money to an agreement with the fund did Brazil's long-time economic czar, Planning Minister Antonio Delfim Netto, swallow his pride and call in the I.M.F. **********The fund arrived with the same prescription it has applied in developing countries for the past three decades - to reduce the public-sector deficit and to record a trade surplus large enough to finance foreign interest payments without excessive new borrowing. But to achieve these goals implied pushing the economy into a still deeper recession. **********With no available alternative, the Government went about squeezing the economy into a different shape. Eighteen difficult months later, on the eve of the I.M.F.'s visit this month, Finance Minister Ernane Galveas was able to proclaim, ''We're fabulous, aren't we?'' because Government spending was down from $19 billion last year to an estimated $12 billion in 1984 and a $6.1 billion trade surplus in 1983 should be followed by an $11 billion surplus this year. Brazil was also up to date on its foreign debt interest payments - $12 billion is due this year - despite rising interest rates, while the Government was confident of negotiating new postponements for payment of the principal on its $93 billion debt maturing in 1985. **********But Mr Galveas's euphoria was shared by few Brazilians. In order to smother demand for imports and create the trade surplus, a ''maxi- devaluation'' of the cruzeiro early in 1983 and regular devaluations since then have pushed up the price of foreign goods. Cutbacks of public spending in a country where federal, state and municipal governments account for 50 percent of the gross domestic product have further reduced demand, and, with the elimination of many subsidies, fed inflation. **********Last October, overriding strong protests from Congress, the Government also directly attacked wages, permitting twice-yearly increases equivalent to only 80 percent of inflation during the previous six months. With real wages falling ever farther behind an inflation rate that exceeded 200 percent in 1983 and will do so again this year, the cycle was repeated: Falling demand and production created new unemployment, which in turn affected demand and production and so on. **********Only businesses involved in exporting and substitution of essential imports flourished. For example, farmers producing oranges for export to the United States and sugar cane for use in the alcohol fuel program did better than ever, while shoe manufacturers were encouraged to find new markets abroad to replace those that had collapsed at home. But their impact on the economy was limited. **********The automotive industry - as in the United States, a sector that is highly sensitive to economic cycles - has suffered badly, with sales of new cars down 18 percent during the first six months of this year compared with the same period last year. But more than just General Motors and Ford, with big factories here, were affected: Hundreds of smaller suppliers of parts and services were also forced to lay off workers and shut down assembly lines. **********Similarly, tumbling demand for domestically made appliances and other electrical goods and processed food - down 15 and 11 percent, respectively, between January and June this year - had a multiplier effect that was felt sharply in commerce. Rather than close their gates permanently, however, many manufacturing companies have declared themselves technically bankrupt and have suspended payments on their cruzeiro debts. Nationwide, industrial production has dropped by 22 percent since 1980. **********One unexpected consequence of the slump is that the national confederations of industry and commerce have recently begun campaigning against the Government's wage law, which has put the legal minimum wage at the equivalent of $47 a month, about half its dollar value two years ago. The confederations argue that the law has deepened the recession without slowing inflation. ''With wages losing 7 percent of their real value each month, how can we think about a recovery?'' one businessman said. **********The Government itself has not escaped the bite of ''a crise,'' as the slump is known here. The budgets of such huge state enterprises as the Vale do Rio Doce mining company have been reduced by 15 percent, resulting in a slowdown of investment. In dollar terms, even the salaries of senior officials have fallen drastically, provoking a ''brain drain'' to better-paying jobs in multinational corporations. ''The central bank must be working with its third team,'' one foreign bank representative complained. ''You go in there and it's chaos, with papers piled high on desks. Many of the best people have deserted the ship.'' Reductions of federal and state budgets have in turn affected myriad other areas. Federal universities have been on strike for the past two months because the Education Ministry cannot meet the wage demands of professors who already ''moonlight'' to make ends meet. Three months ago, doctors in several states struck for the same reason, while police in Rio de Janeiro have threatened to stop work if their wages are not soon increased. **********Brazil's social fabric has been particularly strained in congested urban areas. In Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, unemployment - one million youths reach working age each year, but few can find jobs - has spawned an unprecedented crime wave which, more than anything, has brought home the reality of the crisis to the middle classes. They, too, have been forced to cut their spending - from trips abroad to visits to the movies - but the fear and reality of assaults and robberies have created a siege mentality and added to class tensions. **********One recent morning, three men dressed in the uniforms of municipal bus drivers climbed on a bus in Rio de Janeiro and announced they were unemployed. The passengers immediately feared they were victims of a ''routine'' bus assault. ''Look, we have children to feed,'' one said. ''We don't want to rob or assault, but we need money. Whatever you can give will help us.'' Another man then passed around a shopping bag and most passengers dropped in the equivalent of a nickel or a dime. **********In the absence of welfare payments for the unemployed, others who have lost their jobs - including not a few white-collar workers and professionals - improvise an income by selling everything from kites to candies on the streets, swelling an ''underground'' economy that includes many wives making clothes or shoes at home for sale to friends and relatives. The Government puts the unemployment rate at about 13 percent, but this does not attempt to count the under- employed. **********The reduced real wage - the $47-a-month minimum is about one-third of what is considered necessary to support a family of four - have brought increased malnutrition and related ailments to a country that suffered from these problems even in the boom years. ''The population has less access to food and medicines,'' Eduardo Costa, Secretary of Health for Rio de Janeiro state, said. ''In the past, it was rare for our clinics to receive cases of extreme malnutrition, but we're getting more and more. At the same time as our budgets are being cut, there is a growing demand for medical attention. One emergency clinic we studied is handling twice as many patients as a year ago.'' **********At all levels, then, since Brazil turned to the I.M.F., its social crisis has worsened, but is this an unavoidable consequence of a ''stabilization'' program? In a recent article, the I.M.F.'s Managing Director, Jacques de Larosi ere, implicitly denied responsibility by noting that ''the fund cannot take upon itself the role of dictating social and political objectives to sovereign governments.'' **********The institution would support financially squeezed governments willing to limit domestic consumption, increase domestic savings and expand exports, he said. ''It is up to you, within the framework of macroeconomic parameters negotiated by mutual agreement, to arrange your own social and political priorities.'' **********Clearly, the I.M.F. cannot be blamed for the economic troubles that force governments to appeal for its help. But once it becomes involved, many Latin economists believe it is unrealistic for the fund not to participate in setting the ''social and political priorities'' required to preserve stability during a period of austerity. This feeling is particularly strong in countries like Argentina where new civilian administrations are trying to consolidate democracy in the midst of economic disorder and meeting stiff public resistance to austerity measures.

Esmark, which acquired Norton Simon Inc. last July for $1 billion, agreed to a takeover bid for $55 a share, or a total of $2.4 billion cash, from Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, a New York firm specializing in leveraged buyouts. **********Why, then, did Esmark's stock finish above 55? Some arbitragers are betting that an even higher offer may be coming, although insiders consider that unlikely. **********Blue Bell Inc. said it was holding talks on a proposed leveraged buyout at $50 a share with Kelso & Company, another New York investment house. Shares of Blue Bell, a maker of jeans and other apparel based in Greensboro, N.C., ran up 11 3/4 points, to 50 7/8. **********Such leveraged, or management, buyouts have the effect of taking a publicly owned company private. Typically, these buyouts utilize the corporate assets as collateral for loans to finance the purchase of at least a major part of the company's stock. Buyouts usually provide for a company's top management to remain in control and share in future profits. **********Binney & Smith Inc., the crayon maker that in recent years has been the object of frequent takeover rumors, rose 14 1/4 points, to 54.

The indicator spent much of last week above the 1,180 mark, and some Wall Street analysts entertained hopes that, finally, it was drawing a bead on 1,200. But the Dow ran into a selling squall on Friday, plummeting 16 points in response to weakness in its recurring nemesis, the bond market. **********Haven in Treasury Bills **********Investors who are perplexed about how to play the stock market might want to consider the strategy suggested by a money manager from Munich, West Germany, interviewed during a recent visit to New York. Ekkehard Scheid, a partner in a firm called Portfolio Management, said he regarded most stocks in the United States now as over- priced. **********So what are the choices? One alternative, Mr. Scheid said, is to keep money in Treasury bills until late 1985, by which time he expects ''a short and sharp recession'' to have made its appearance. And that, according to his rationale, could be a good time to buy stocks at depressed prices. **********He thinks interest rates and the inflation rate will climb this year and in most of 1985, with this dual acceleration proceeding much further than most Americans currently envisage. If this scenario unfolds and stock prices decline as a result, Treasury bills could afford a safe haven. After all, six-month Treasury bills backed by the full faith and credit of the Government already yield more than 10 percent on a discounted basis. The interest, moreover, is free of state and local income taxes. One can simply roll over three-month or six-month bills until the time comes to invest in equities. **********Mr. Scheid's firm takes a global view and manages the equivalent of $150 million for pension funds and other clients based mainly in West Germany. ''Currently, 60 percent of funds under our management is in money market instruments, while 40 percent is in precious-metal and other metal stocks,'' he said. ''We basically moved out of the U.S. market at the end of 1982, but then we're always six months too early.'' **********Portfolio Management owns some stocks in North America, including Hecla Mining, Sunshine Mining, Homestake Mining and Asarco Inc.

Both have been living as fugitives in Switzerland, where their business is based. **********But officials said the companies indicted with Mr. Rich and Mr. Green - Marc Rich & Company A.G. and Clarendon Ltd. - would both plead guilty to some of the charges against them and would pay the Government more than $100 million in back taxes, fines, penalties and other charges in order to resume normal operations in this country. **********Officials and others familiar with the negotiations said they believed the settlement could be concluded within two weeks, barring any further dispute. **********The case against Mr. Rich, a reclusive, self-made multimillionaire, began more than two years ago with an investigation into accusations that he had participated in a scheme to violate Energy Department oil price regulations and to evade $48 million in income taxes. **********But the case quickly developed into an international tug-of-war over subpoenaed documents that ultimately pitted Switzerland against the United States. In the intervening years, it has sparked extensive, sometimes novel litigation involving scores of lawyers in both countries. **********The Government's legal battle, led by United States Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani in Manhattan, has also resulted in the largest contempt-of- court fine ever collected. **********At first, the defendants contended that, because their operations were based in Switzerland, they did not have to comply with a subpoena in this country. But this argument was rejected by Federal District Judge Leonard B. Sand. On June 29, 1983, he imposed a fine of $50,000 for every day the subpoenaed papers were not produced. **********Swiss Seized Papers **********The fine continued to be assessed even after the Swiss Government seized the documents from the Marc Rich headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, in August 1983. The Swiss Government said it was trying to assure that its strict corporate secrecy laws would not be violated by a decision on the part of Marc Rich to relinquish the contested papers. **********According to Jane W. Parver, Executive Assistant United States Attorney, the defendants have thus far paid almost $21 million in fines for their failure to produce the documents. Both she and Mr. Giuliani declined to comment on the settlement talks. **********The negotiations were facilitated by Switzerland's rejection last Tuesday of the Justice Department's request to extradite Mr. Rich and Mr. Green to face trial in New York. **********The two men fled from America in the summer of 1983. Mr. Rich, who was born in Belgium, has renounced his American citizenship and has become a citizen of Spain. **********Extradition Treaty **********The Swiss Government, in rejecting the extradition request, said the tax and fraud charges lodged against Mr. Rich and Mr. Green when they were indicted last fall were not covered by its extradition treaty with the United States. Spain does not extradite its citizens in tax evasion cases. **********Officials familiar with the situation explained that neither Mr. Giuliani's office nor the defendants were ready to agree to the proposed settlement on behalf of the companies without knowing whether Mr. Rich and Mr. Green could be brought to this country to face trial. **********The trial of the companies and a third person, Clyde Meltzer, was to begin this month but has been postponed until December, Mr. Giuliani said today. If the settlement becomes final, the companies would be dropped as defendants. Under American law, Mr. Rich and Mr. Green cannot be tried in absentia. **********Another official familiar with the case explained that the Justice Department would not have accepted a guilty plea from the companies while a chance existed to try Mr. Rich and Mr. Green. Also, he suggested, Mr. Rich and Mr. Green would not have agreed to have the companies enter the settlement if there were a chance they could be brought back to face trial and risk imprisonment. **********The indictment against Mr. Rich, Mr. Green and the two companies charged them with 51 counts, including racketeering, income tax evasion, the filing of false statements, mail fraud and wire fraud. Mr. Meltzer was also charged with participating in the conspiracy. **********In an interview in July, Mr. Giuliani said he would not accept a guilty plea from either Mr. Rich or Mr. Green as individuals to any charge except one that would ''expose them to substantial prison terms.'' The racketeering charge, he noted, carries a maximum penalty of 20 years and many of the other charges carry five-year terms. **********Approval by I.R.S. Needed **********The negotiations toward a settlement of the charges against the companies - which would have to be approved by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service - have involved several issues, some of which remain unresolved. **********The companies have been unwilling to plead guilty to racketeering or fraud charges; the Government has insisted that they plead guilty either to racketeering or to multiple counts of tax evasion. The settlement is therefore likely to involve the tax evasion counts. **********Another issue has been whether existing restraining orders obtained by the Justice Department against the companies' property and assets would be lifted, including a restraining order against a half interest held by a Marc Rich-related company in TCF Holdings Inc., the holding company that owns the 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation. Under the proposed settlement, sources familiar with the case said, these orders would be lifted. **********Accord Would End the Fine **********The proposed agreement would also seek to end the $50,000-a-day fine. But it was unclear tonight whether the Government would give back the $21 million in fines already collected. **********Also under negotiation is whether the interest on back taxes owed by the companies would be tax deductible. Normally, taxpayers may take a deduction for interest on back taxes. **********In its efforts to negotiate a settlement, the Government is determined to collect far more than the $48 million it asserts was lost in the tax evasion scheme. The settlement, officials said, must cover the lost taxes plus penalties and interest, money owed to the Energy Department and punitive charges. **********According to the indictment, Mr. Rich and Mr. Green were principal shareholders and directors of Marc Rich & Company A.G., of which Marc Rich & Company International Ltd. was a wholly owned Swiss subsidiary. The indictment said Mr. Rich was chairman of Marc Rich International and that Mr. Green was president. **********Details of the Accusations **********The indictment charged that, in July 1983, Marc Rich A.G. purported to sell Marc Rich International to the Marc Rich A.G. shareholders, except Mr. Rich and Mr. Green, and that Marc Rich International became Clarendon Ltd. **********The Government has charged that the purported sale was a sham transaction to avoid complying with the subpoena and that Clarendon is still related to Marc Rich A.G., a point that Marc Rich disputes. **********The Federal indictment charged that, beginning in 1980, the defendants diverted profits from crude oil transactions by pretending to buy domestic oil from other companies at a high market price, when they and the other companies had secretly agreed on a lower price. **********Lawyers for the companies did not return calls to their offices today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/25/business/boesky-increases-fishbach-stake.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Boesky Increases Fishbach Stake", "print_headline": "Boesky Increases Fishbach Stake", "body_text": " **********Ivan F.

Andropov, then the Soviet leader. **********The Pravda article did not indicate why it was raising the cruise missile issue at this time. However, it follows an announcement in Washington in late June that the first long-range nuclear- armed cruise missiles were being deployed on United States Navy ships. **********The deployment of the sea-based missiles, known as Tomahawks, has been a subject of debate in Congress. Opponents of deployment contend that the missiles pose arms-control problems because nuclear and conventional versions cannot be readily distinguished so that any treaty curbs on the nuclear version cannot be verified. **********In the Geneva talks on strategic arms, suspended since November, the Soviet Union proposed a ban on cruise missiles with ranges greater than 600 kilometers (370 miles). The Tomahawks, designed to be fired from surface ships or submarines, have a range of 1,500 miles. **********Today's Pravda article, titled ''Dangerous Illusions in Washington,'' said the United States was seeking to achieve military superiority with its long-range cruise missiles. **********''The United States is mistaken, fundamentally mistaken, on a most important point,'' Pravda said. ''Its plans to achieve superiority over the Soviet Union, including the field of long-range cruise missiles, are not only dangerous, but illusory. **********''It once sought to overtake the Soviet Union in ballistic missiles, and that did not work. It tried with independently targetable multiple re-entry vehicles, and again that did not work. It won't work this time either. Since the United States did not want to forgo this new type of weapon, long-range cruise missiles are already being tested in the U.S.S.R.'' **********Pravda said the deployment of cruise missiles would ''undermine the process of limiting and reducing nuclear weapons, creating major difficulties for effective control, increasing the potential opportunities to evade and violate agreements.'' **********Cruise missiles can be launched from the ground, from planes and ships. **********Air-based cruise missiles were part of weapon ceilings established in 1979 by the second strategic arms limitation treaty, which remains unratified. But the treaty merely placed a three-year moratorium on deployment of ground- based and sea-launched cruise missiles. Although the United States has abided by the unratified treaty, it considers the moratorium to have lapsed. **********Last year, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization began placing the first of 464 ground-launched cruise missiles in Western Europe as part of its medium- range missile deployment. It was the start of that deployment, ordered by NATO to counter the Soviet SS-20 missiles, that led Moscow to suspend talks on arms limitations. **********According to reports from Washington, the Soviet Union began developing long-range cruise missiles in 1981, with ranges of up to 2,000 miles. Mr. Andropov referred to the weapons in a speech on Dec. 21, 1982, when he said: **********''We will be compelled to counter the challenge of the American side by deploying our own long-range cruise missile, which we are already testing, to counter the United States' long-range cruise missile.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/19/business/us-sets-trade-curb-for-digital.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-03-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 819, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. SETS TRADE CURB FOR DIGITAL", "print_headline": "U.S. SETS TRADE CURB FOR DIGITAL", "body_text": " **********The Commerce Department has quietly imposed major restrictions on the Digital Equipment Corporation to control the export of its computers, several months after one of the company's most sophisticated machines was seized en route to the Soviet Union. **********The move requires Digital to go through the time-consuming task of obtaining individual export licenses from the Commerce Department before it can ship any of its computers to West Germany, Norway or Austria. All three countries are considered prime ''diversion points,'' where a major computer system can change hands quickly and be smuggled into Eastern bloc nations. **********Digital, the world's second-largest computer maker after the International Business Machines Corporation, is also being required to furnish the Government with detailed information about all of its overseas customers for its sophisticated line of VAX computers, and how those customers intend to use the equipment. The VAX is suitable for numerous military applications. **********Digital Appears Blameless **********Industry experts say that Digital is the only company currently operating under the Government-imposed restrictions. And they say that is not clear whether the Commerce Department move was directly linked to the shipment seized in November - an incident in which Government investigators say Digital appears blameless - or whether it is part of the broader effort under way in Washington to stem the flow of Western technology to countries aligned with the Soviet Union. **********But the tightening has prompted concerns from other manufacturers who believe the restrictions will soon be applied to them - perhaps even before the current debate over revising high technology export controls is complete. The requirement for individual licenses, they contend, will drive European customers into the hands of Japanese and other foreign manufacturers. **********''This is the first step in a series that could make all the U.S. manufacturers less competitive in the world marketplace,'' said Tom Christiansen, the chairman of the computer industry's Coalition on Technology Transfer, and the manager of international trade relations at the Hewlett-Packard Company. **********Confidential Document **********A Commerce Department spokesman, saying that the export distribution licenses granted to an individual company is a confidential document, declined to discuss the action against Digital. But the company confirmed last week that it has been operating under the new restrictions since Feb. 29, when its general export distribution license was renewed - for a two month period instead of the usual two years. The licenses of several other major manufacturers, including I.B.M., will be up for renewal in the next several months. **********''At this point there is no research to believe there will be any material impact on our earnings,'' said Richard Berube, a Digital spokesman. So far, he said, no licenses have been denied, and the ''first batch we submitted to Commerce resulted in licenses and certifications issued within a week.'' **********Still, Digital and others are concerned that should the restrictions embrace the entire industry, the Commerce Department could become so deluged in paperwork that deliveries would be significantly delayed. Reports from Europe already indicate shipment delays of two weeks on Digital computers because of the new requirements. The company terms those delays ''minor.'' **********A Shock to Digital **********The Commerce Department move reportedly came as something of a shock to Digital, whose European sales account for about a quarter of the company's revenues. In October, according to sources close to the negotiations with the Commerce Department, Digital provided information to government agents about suspected diversions of Digital computers through West Germany, Norway and Austria, among other places. **********Some of that information was reportedly critical in the seizure, the following month, of a VAX 11/782 superminicomputer. Part of the shipment was seized in Hamburg, and part at its next transfer point, the Swedish port of Helsingborg. **********When Digital's export license came up for renewal, however, the same information was apparently used by the Commerce Department in designing restrictions on the company. **********'Feds Step on Them Later' **********''Here was a case of a company doing what they were supposed to be doing - cooperating with the Government in a smuggling case - only to have the Feds step on them later using the same information,'' said an official of a Digital competitor, who asked not to be named because his own company's export license will soon be up for renewal. **********Others, however, say that Digital was simply unlucky enough to have its general license expire at a time when the debate over how to keep high technology goods away from the Eastern bloc has reached a peak. **********This week, both semiconductor and computer manufacturers are scheduled to submit their comments on the Commerce Department's proposed regulations, which would prevent the sale or resale of high-tech goods to countries other than the 16 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Japan, Australia or New Zealand.

Petersen, the company's president and chief operating officer. **********Mr. Caldwell said he would step down as head of the nation's second- largest car maker on Feb. 1, four days after his 65th birthday. **********Ford has never had a mandatory retirement policy. Henry Ford - who founded the company, invented the Model T and pioneered the modern assembly line - was in his 80's when members of the Ford family forced him to retire during World War II. **********High Technology Cars **********Mr. Petersen, a 58-year-old engineer whose specialty is planning new cars, has been Ford's No. 2 executive for four years. **********Automotive industry analysts said today that they expected him to continue Mr. Caldwell's policy of rapidly developing high-technology cars. **********Harold A. Poling, 59, will succeed Mr. Petersen as president and chief operating officer. Mr. Poling has been the executive vice president for Ford North American Automotive Operations since 1980. In addition to being named president as of Feb. 1, he was appointed, effective immediately, to be a member of the office of the chief executive. **********Mr. Petersen will be the fourth chairman since Ford became a publicly held company in 1955. Mr. Caldwell replaced Henry Ford 2d, the grandson of the company's founder, as president in 1979 and as chairman in 1980. **********Smooth Transition **********Mr. Caldwell's decision to retire at age 65 and the promotion of Mr. Petersen represents a smooth transition at a company with a history of squabbles in its executive suites. **********''This is an orderly succession in a company where that has not always happened,'' said Malcolm Salter, a professor at the Harvard Business School. ''It connotes a stability in the management structure.'' **********The most notable of Ford's high- level dismissals came in 1978, when Mr. Ford dismissed Lee A. Iacocca, the company's president and his apparent successor. Two weeks after leaving Ford, Mr. Iacocca joined the Chrysler Corporation as president and became chairman in 1979. **********The changes announced today at Ford continue the company's pattern of promoting executives who made their reputations overseas, where they made the kinds of fuel-efficient Fords that the company was hard- pressed to deliver in this country in the late 1970's. **********Mr. Poling joined Ford as a college trainee in the steel division 34 years ago and rose to be president and chairman of Ford's European subsidiary in the 1970's. He is credited with erasing the the losses of the North American Automotive Operations division, estimated at $1 billion a year when he took charge in 1980. The division makes cars and trucks and parts for sale in the United States, Canada and Mexico. **********Other Promotions **********The company also announced three other executive changes: **********- Louis R. Ross will become executive vice president for operations of Ford's North American Automotive Operations division. Mr. Ross will succeed Mr. Poling in February. **********- John A. Betti will become executive vice president, Technical Affairs, replacing Mr. Ross. **********- William E. Scollard will become vice president for manufacturing and business development operations in the North American Automotive Operations, succeeding Mr. Betti. **********Mr. Petersen joined Ford in 1949, and in the 1960's managed the unit that developed the Mustang and the Maverick, two of the best-selling models in Ford's history. He has also headed Ford's highly profitable International Automotive Operations group, which provided the cash to support Ford's domestic operations in the wake of the Arab oil embargo and the sudden demand for small cars in this country in the 1970's. **********During his 31-year career at Ford, Mr. Caldwell was never considered a brilliant salesman, a maufacturing expert or a financial genius, but he mastered all three disciplines. **********Knack for Labor Relations **********He is also credited with having greatly improved the company's labor relations. With Peter J. Pestillo, a former executive with the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, as his vice president for labor relations, Mr. Caldwell is credited with developing advanced employee involvement programs to improve working conditions and increase product quality. **********Mr. Caldwell took charge of Ford when its reputation was suffering. The company's Pinto, its first small car intended to compete with imports, had been the subject of a highly publicized trial over whether its gas tank was improperly designed and could catch fire in rear-end collision. **********On the day that Mr. Caldwell succeeded Mr. Ford, an Indiana jury found the company not guilty on three counts of reckless homicide in connection with a Pinto crash. **********But the publicity itself was damaging. Ford had also been troubled with family disputes and allegations of payoffs to Asian government officials. **********As Ford's chairman, Mr. Caldwell became one of the most outspoken American executives on foreign import quotas. **********He has contended that the Japanese enjoy a substantial cost advantage over American companies in the form of tax breaks and exchange rates that favor the yen. Until those two factors change, he believes, the domestic auto makers need protection. **********After it became apparent that Mr. Caldwell would succeed Mr. Ford, he became known as ''the prince'' in the corridors of Ford headquarters. **********Turnaround for Trucks **********Mr. Caldwell earned his reputation in truck operations in the 1960's at a time when truck buyers' tastes were changing and an increasing number of small trucks were being built for recreation rather than work. **********Without benefit of marketing surveys, Mr. Caldwell is said to have listed 25 reason why customers buy trucks. Then he ranked Ford trucks against the competition from the Chevrolet division of G.M. and concluded that Ford had better heaters and better visibility, but Chevy was better on the other 23 items. Within five years, Ford had introduced a new truck that took sales from Chevrolet. **********Mr. Caldwell was transferred in 1970 to Ford's Philco division in Philadelphia, which makes televisions, refrigerators and other appliances, to iron out its long-standing troubles. **********An International Gamble **********In 1973, he was named chief of Ford's international operations. There he gambled that expanding the company's investment in cars overseas would pay off despite the deepening recession. The strategy produced the successful Fiesta, Ford's first small car in Europe. **********Mr. Caldwell drew considerable criticism from labor and Government officials early this year when the company's proxy statement disclosed that he had been paid $7.3 million in salary, stock options and bonus for 1983. On the strength of its rebounding domestic sales, Ford posted record profits of $1.9 billion last year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/11/world/europeans-plan-new-jet-fighter.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1984-07-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 518, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EUROPEANS PLAN NEW JET FIGHTER", "print_headline": "EUROPEANS PLAN NEW JET FIGHTER", "body_text": " **********The Defense Ministers of five Western European countries have agreed in principle on joint development of a new fighter plane, for service in the mid-1990's. **********The agreement on the plane and on a new jet engine to power it was reached Monday in Madrid by Britain, France, West Germany, Italy and Spain. The accord calls for feasibility studies by March. The ministers will then meet in Rome to take a final decision. **********Military officials say the decision was reached despite United States misgivings over the exclusively European nature of the project, which challenges the American aircraft industry's traditional domination of the Atlantic alliance market. **********American officials said the United States had been urging for nearly a year that American companies be included, particularly in developing the engine, avionics and the weapon guidance system.   U.S. Foresees Cost Overruns **********The Americans said costs would be raised by the small size of the European defense industries and by demands from each country for the biggest possible share of work, leading to duplication. The Americans contended that United States contractors would make management more efficient.  The United States fears that any cost overruns on the project will reduce the Europeans' combat readiness either by cutting the number of planes they order or by economizing in other fields. Either way, the United States would be forced to make up the resulting gap. **********In a communique, the European Defense Ministers said they were now ''convinced in principle of the need jointly to develop and produce a new European combat aircraft for 1995 as well as an engine for this plane.'' **********Defense Minister Charles Hernu of France called the pact ''the first military cooperation agreement of such a scale to be studied and brought to fruition since the end of World War II.'' **********Building the plane, he said,''is a real international challenge that will make Europe an aeronautical power on a world scale.''  Twice the Speed of Sound **********The new twin-engine single-seat fighter, provisionally called Future European Fighter Aircraft, would fly at twice the speed of sound and is intended to replace the F-4 Phantoms in service with the British and West German Air Forces as well as France's Mirage fighter fleet and the Jaguar fighter-bombers developed by Britain and France. **********A total of about 800 planes are likely to be needed by the participating countries, with Britain, France and West Germany taking 200 each and the remainder divided between Italy and Spain. The five countries hope to sell 200 planes to other members of the Atlantic alliance. **********The plane will incorporate the latest technologies. A computerized guidance system would keep it flying at optimal speed and flight angle, eliminating any risk of the plane's getting out of control through pilot error and allowing changes in fusilage design that increase agility. **********The British Aerospace Corporation and Dassault, the French aircraft maker, are working on prototypes and have exhibited models in public.

In the Bechtel case, for example, it took almost two years for Federal agents to interview the person whose complaints triggered the inquiry. **********In early 1982, Daniel E. Charboneau, a former official with Bechtel in Korea, wrote to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in San Francisco about his suspicions about possible improper payments by Bechtel's Korean agent. **********His letter also mentioned another former Bechtel Korean employee who, according to Mr. Charboneau, had told the Internal Revenue Service under oath that he carried cash payments from a Bechtel agent to a Korean official. Mr. Charboneau was subpoenaed to appear before a Federal grand jury investigating the case last October, but was unable to appear and was interviewd by Federal agents in January. **********Little Attention **********The Justice Department is currently investigating Mr. Charboneau's allegations, but officials say privately that up to now the case, and the act, received little attention within the department. Bechtel and its Korean agent have denied any wrongdoing, but the company began its own inquiry after newspaper reports of the case. **********''The Bechtel case obviously raises a question mark about proceeding with a bill at this time,'' said James Lamble, legislative assistant to Representative Daniel A. Mica, Democrat of Florida, a leading proponent of amending the act. Mr. Lamble added, ''How far we can get in these negotiations remains unclear.'' he said. **********The act, passed in late 1977 in the wake of disclosures by many corporations of foreign bribes and questionable payments, prohibits payments or gifts to foreign officials by American companies in an attempt to win business. One key provision, which many in the business community have sought to weaken, prohibits payments to an agent while ''knowing or having reason to know'' that it will be passed on to a foreign official to obtain business. **********The Reagan Administration has long supported loosening the law, claiming it is vague and inhibits American business dealings overseas. Although any amendments would involve rewriting the criminal statutes, Justice Department prosecutors have never testified about the law and Bill Brock, the United States trade representative, has been the leading lobbyist for the Administration. **********One of the chief opponents of writing a new bill that would dilute the act is Timothy E. Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, who favors retaining the law with only minor revisions. Mr. Wirth is chairman of the subcommittee on telecommunications, consumer protection and finance of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has joint jurisdiction over any proposed changes. **********Sharing jurisdiction with Mr. Wirth's subcommittee is the subcommittee on international economic policy and trade of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which many business lobbyists originally thought was more likely to vote out a bill more sympathethic to their position. Mr. Wirth has pledged to consider within 60 days any bill that is approved by the trade subcommittee, which is chaired by Representative Don Bonker, Democrat of Washington. **********Issues Unresolved **********The leading proponent for amending the act on the trade subcommittee is Mr. Mica, while Representative Howard L. Berman, Democrat of California, has sided with Mr. Wirth in opposing significant changes. Mr. Lamble, Mr. Mica's legislative assistant, says that despite months of discussions among Mr. Mica, Mr. Berman and their staffs, several key issues remain unresolved. **********One such issue, according to Mr. Lamble, is the ''reason to know'' standard, which Mr. Mica favors loosening. Mr. Berman sent a memorandum to Mr. Mica and Mr. Bonker recently saying he did not want the standard lessened so much that it would create a ''loophole'' in which company agents would be free to bribe and headquarters would know nothing because it had avoided asking questions about the agents' behavior. **********A second issue under discussion involves so-called grease payments, which involve small payments or favors. Mr. Mica wants to exempt from the anti-bribery law token payments made to officials for ''routine'' official actions. Mr. Berman feels that the wording is vague and has proposed a limit of $2,500 or $5,000 and a better definition of routine, according to Mr. Lamble and Mr. Berman's memo. **********Even before the Bechtel case came to light, however, some members of Congress expressed concern about what they saw as lax enforcement by the Justice Department of prohibitions against foreign bribery. **********Last month, Mr. Wirth distributed a letter to members of the subcommittee and a memo by staff aides who had reviewed Justice Department documents justifying the closing of some 90 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases since 1981. In the letter, he said the review raised ''serious questions concerning the failure of the Department to adequately pursue investigations.'' **********Justice Department Criticized - **********The memo criticizes the Justice Department for failing to adequately investigate some cases and for providing Congress inaccurate information about the closing of some cases. In subsequent discussionss with Justice Department attorneys, the staff has found further inadequacies in the investigations, acccording to a staff aide, who declined to discuss any specific cases or elaborate on the inadequacies. **********Robert W. Ogren, chief of the fraud section of the Justice Department's criminal division, defended the department's handling of foreign bribery cases, saying they are pursued as vigorously as any other case, even though they present unique investigative problems. **********The Justice Department has brought 11 prosecutions under the 1977 act. Most of those cases stem from one investigation, which began during the Carter Administration and involves allegations of payoffs to officials of Petroleos Mexicanos, the Mexican national oil company known as Pemex. **********Mr. Ogren, the Justice Department official, said department policy was to investigate all ''serious allegations of violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and if the evidence is developed to bring those cases.'' He added that the Department had opened some new investigations during the last few years, but he declined to talk about specific cases. In 1981 Attorney General William French Smith spoke in favor of loosening the 1977 anit-bribery act. **********Mr. Ogren says that an average of fewer than 20 complaints per year about foreign bribery are brought to the department's attention. Still, he said, these cases are difficult to investigate because much of the evidence and witnesses are overseas and outside the American legal process."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/28/business/advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-02-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 30, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; People", "body_text": " ***********  Stephen Bayer has joined Chiat/ Day New York as a senior vice president. ***********  J.

Getty and Texaco both own refineries in California, and their networks of gas stations overlap somewhat in the Northeast. **********If the takeover by Texaco goes through, it will be far bigger than the Du Pont Company's $8 billion purchase of Conoco Inc. in 1981, until now the largest merger. **********It was unclear how much of the $10 billion offer would be in cash, but it is expected to be at least half, with the rest paid in Texaco securities. One problem, according to executives involved in the talks, is how the Sarah Getty Trust should be paid for tax purposes. Sources said the trust's tax bite could be close to $800 million, or 20 percent of the nearly $4 billion the trust would collect.  Another problem is that Gordon Getty is currently under an injunction in a California court preventing him from selling his shares, part of a dispute among family members. But accountants who have examined the Texaco offer say there would be financial gains for all, and the injunction would probably be lifted. **********Other stockholders would be paid within 60 days after the majority stockholders approved the merger. **********If Texaco is successful in landing Getty Oil, the merged company would come close to displacing the Mobil Corporation as the nation's second-largest oil company, behind the Exxon Corporation. Mobil's sales in 1982 totaled nearly $60 billion, while Texaco's and Getty's together approached $59 billion. **********Weakness in the oil market and the increasingly high cost of finding new oil resources is forcing the industry into consolidations. The Gulf Oil Corporation, for example, is also the object of a takeover battle, which is being led by the Mesa Petroleum Company. **********Texaco is the newest participant in Getty Oil's tangled corporate affairs.  For the past year, Gordon Getty and other family members have quarreled with management and among themselves about the future of the company. The family quarrel centers on whether various family trusts should increase current revenues or accumulate wealth for the next generation. **********Accord Apparently Breached **********The parties put the dispute with management to rest in October, but this agreement apparently was breached in November. opening the door for various outsiders to bid for control of Getty Oil. **********Last week, Pennzoil made an offer for part of Getty Oil, which the company rejected. **********Then on Tuesday, after barely three days of talks, Pennzoil reached an agreement in principle to join Mr. Getty in buying the company, an offer that Getty Oil approved Wednesday. The partnership of Mr. Getty and Pennzoil planned to buy the stock they did not own for about $112.50 a share. **********In a key part of the Pennzoil deal, Getty Oil agreed to give Pennzoil an option to buy eight million new shares of Getty at $110 each, so that if Pennzoil lost to a higher bidder, it could walk away with a huge profit - in this instance, $120 million in cash. But because Pennzoil had only an agreement in principle on this option, it was unclear whether it could collect. **********Mr. Liedtke of Pennzoil said in his telegram to the Getty Oil directors that he would hold them specifically to the agreement on this option. **********The swirl of activity around Getty Oil quickened yesterday. Two hours before the New York Stock Exchange opened trading, John K. McKinley, chairman of Texaco, announced that his company had signed an agreement to buy 11.8 percent of Getty stock from the J. Paul Getty Museum for $125 a share, or nearly $1.2 billion in cash. Neither Getty, Texaco nor Pennzoil stock traded yesterday. On Thursday, Getty closed at $104.375. **********In the events leading up to Texaco's announcement, as pieced together from Wall Street executives familiar with the situation, Texaco phoned the First Boston Corporation on Wednesday night to say that it wanted to retain First Boston to help it buy Getty. By Thursday, Texaco's directors, after listening to a presentation by Bruce Wasserstein, an investment banker at First Boston, had authorized paying $125 a share. **********Many Wall Street firms had studied Getty closely, feeling that it would become a takeover target eventually, largely because of the feud between Gordon Getty and the company. Among the oil giants that reportedly wanted to bid for Getty were the Standard Oil Company of California, Phillips Petroleum and Atlantic Richfield. **********By Thursday evening, concluding that the museum represented a key block of stock, Mr. Wasserstein and Joseph R. Perella, another merger expert for First Boston, joined the museum's advisers, Jay F. Higgins of Salomon Brothers and Martin Lipton, the New York lawyer, to work out a deal. **********First Boston is understood to have said it could not make an offer until it had met with Mr. Getty. Mr. Lipton is said to have replied that the museum wanted $125 a share. **********Williams Celebrates Birthday **********Harold M. Williams, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and now president of the museum, was celebrating his 56th birthday with his children Thursday evening and had given Mr. Lipton, a friend of long standing, authority to negotiate on the museum's behalf. **********Mr. Lipton and Mr. Wasserstein then took taxis to the Pierre Hotel, where Mr. Getty maintains an antique-filled apartment. **********By then, it was 11 P.M. In the Pierre lobby were Mr. McKinley of Texaco; Laurence A. Tisch, chairman of the Loews Corporation, who had come to know Mr. Getty well since joining Getty's board two months ago, Mr. Wasserstein and a number of lawyers. **********Mr. Lipton and Mr. Tisch went upstairs to talk to Gordon Getty; his Wall Street adviser, Martin A. Siegel of Kidder, Peabody & Company, and Thomas Woodhouse, Mr. Getty's San Francisco lawyer. **********Mr. Lipton and Mr. Tisch went back to the lobby, where Mr. McKinley offered to pay $122.50 a share. Mr.  Lipton replied that Mr. Getty wanted $125. Mr. McKinley said he was prepared to pay $125 but only if he could get acceptance that night so he could block Pennzoil. Mr. Lipton and Mr. Tisch said they would try to get prompt acceptance. **********In a subsequent meeting with Mr. Getty until 1 A.M. yesterday, the parties finally reached agreement to sell the museum's stock to Texaco with the support of Mr. Getty. **********First Boston, one of Wall Street's most successful merger makers, has been involved in four of the nation's biggest takeovers. It helped Du Pont buy Conoco for $8 billion, aided Marathon Oil in its $6.6 billion sale to United States Steel and advised Cities Service when it was bought for $5 billion by Occidental Petroleum. **********First Boston would earn an estimated $12.5 million for advising Texaco, while Goldman, Sachs and Kidder, Peabody would each collect fees of $15 million to $20 million for helping Getty Oil and Mr. Getty, respectively."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/15/business/vat-held-unlikely-by-reagan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 571, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "V.A.T.

Regan said during a meeting of the Business Council in Hot Springs, Va. The council is a group made up of chief executives of the nation's largest companies. **********''I would doubt that we'd ever get to that,'' said Mr. Regan, when asked if a V.A.T. - a national sales tax added to each stage of production and distribution, not merely at the retail sale - might be advanced in combination with a modified ''flat'' tax overhaul of the personal income tax. **********Mr. Regan, speaking Saturday, the last day of the meeting, also said that a V.A.T. would not be proposed to take the place of the income tax. ''I know one thing,'' he declared. ''It'll never be a substitute for personal income tax.'' **********For one thing, Mr. Regan said, the V.A.T., which is widely used in Europe, is ''so contentious.'' Liberals have argued that the V.A.T. is regressive, in that it ignores ability to pay, while conservatives worry that it is too powerful a revenue-raising tool since, once in place, its rate could easily be increased. **********The Question of Cheating **********Mr. Regan also said that a V.A.T. was not needed to combat tax cheating. ''I think we could get at the tax cheating in a different way - without the V.A.T.,'' he declared. **********The Treasury is now completing a wide-ranging study of possible tax changes that President Reagan ordered it to conduct earlier this year. The study is expected to be released in early December, after the Presidential election. **********Mr. Regan said ''we've made some tentative conclusions'' about what to propose, and that the Treasury staff is now playing ''what if'' games on computers to see how the various possibilities would work out in terms of revenues, equity and efficiency. **********The Administration's position is that the deficit should be reduced through spending cuts, with tax increases of any kind a ''last resort.'' **********Meanwhile, Russell B. Long of Louisiana, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, who was also at the Hot Springs meeting, endorsed a broad-based tax such as a V.A.T., a national sales tax at the retail level or a tax on energy. **********A Call for a Commission **********Mr. Long said that necessities, such as food and drugs, should not be exempted in any such national tax, but that the money could, in effect, be rebated to those with incomes of, say, less than $25,000. He also called for creation of a bipartisan commission to deal with the budget deficit. **********Mr. Long rejected the Administration's contention, restated at the Business Council meeting by Mr. Regan, that the economy could ''grow'' itself out of deficit by 1989 if national output climbed by 4 percent a year and spending was limited to a 5 percent annual increase. **********This, countered Mr. Long, ''doesn't begin to meet the problem.'' **********Mr. Long said his top choice to head his proposed commission would be Henry Fowler, Secretary of the Treasury in the Johnson Administration. **********''I think Henry Fowler's the most effective lobbyist I've seen operate in the 36 years I've been here.

By 67 percent to 13 percent, the respondents disapproved of American involvement in the mining. **********Those findings of the poll of 1,367 adults reflect a general unease that Americans were found to feel toward Mr. Reagan's conduct of foreign affairs. **********Skepticism on China Trip **********At the same time, one of the initiatives that Reagan Administration officials had hoped would bolster public support of the President's foreign policy, his current trip to China, may already have been substantially discounted in the public's mind. Two out of three of those questioned said they saw a political motive in Mr. Reagan's trip. The telephone interviewing began Monday and ended Thursday, during Mr. Reagan's first full day in China. **********In an area where Presidents ordinarily command support, and in one that Republican strategists consider a potential Reagan weakness as the 1984 election nears, Americans are split evenly on their assessment of how the President is conducting foreign policy. Forty-three percent say they approve and 43 percent say they disapprove. The President's standing with the public on foreign policy has been lower, but his current approval rating is 11 percentage points lower than it was two years ago this month. **********More than half of those questioned said they believed that the Reagan Administration was too quick to resort to the use of the military in dealings with foreign nations. Only a third said the Administration tried hard enough to reach diplomatic solutions with other countries. **********Despite this degree of discontent, the poll did not show foreign policy to be producing many potential votes against Mr. Reagan at this time. Buoyed by credit he receives for a strong economy, Mr. Reagan continued to enjoy comfortable leads over both former Vice President Walter F. Mondale and Senator Gary Hart.  Those who object to the way Mr. Reagan conducts foreign policy often voice reservations about his personal style and about what they describe as his inability to make decisions and his lack of a clear policy. **********Mr. Reagan continues to receive less support from women than from men on important foreign-policy questions. Men, by a margin of 48 percent to 42 percent, supported the President's overall conduct of foreign policy, while women, by a margin of 44 percent to 39 percent, disapproved. **********Men, by a margin of 53 percent to 40 percent, said they did not fear that Mr. Reagan's Central American policy might lead to war. Women, by a 51 percent to 37 percent rate, believed that it might. **********Despite continued efforts by the Administration to build a consensus around its policies in Central America, the public still resists the belief that the United States should assist efforts to overthrow what the Administration describes as the pro-Soviet Government of Nicaragua. More than half of those interviewed said the United States should not help overthrow the Sandinista Government, a position that is nearly unchanged since last June.   Republicans Critical of Mining **********Although President Reagan often presents the debate on Central America in partisan terms, Republicans are resistant to some elements of his policies. By a ratio of 62 percent to 17 percent, they reject American involvement in the mining of Nicaraguan harbors and, by a rate of 44 percent to 39 percent, believe that the United States should not help overthrow the Sandinista Government. Overall, however, Republicans favor the President's Central American policies by a ratio of 49 percent to 28 percent. **********At the same time, Americans continued to show little knowledge of the situation in Central America. Only 19 percent of those surveyed could answer that the United States supported the opponents of the Nicaraguan Government. Although the figure is an increase of 6 percentage points since last June, 62 percent of those who were interviewed said they had not been following events in the region carefully enough to identify which side the United States supported. **********This spring the American people are being presented with two different explanations for the unrest in Central America: the view of Senator Hart that ''the principal threat in Central America is not Communism, but poverty,'' and the position of President Reagan, who said early this month that the United States faced a choice: ''Either we help America's friends defend themselves and give democracy a chance or we abandon our responsibilities and let the Soviet Union and Cuba shape the destiny of our hemisphere.''  Public Is Not Dogmatic **********The public is divided evenly between those two positions, but it is not as dogmatic as its political leaders. By substantial margins, those who chose one of the explanations agreed that the other was also an ''important factor'' in the unrest in the region. **********Views on the issue differ along both racial and party lines. Republicans, by 45 percent to 34 percent, attribute the region's problems to the influence of Communists, while Democrats were divided almost evenly. Whites, by a margin of 40 percent to 35 percent, blame Communism for the region's troubles, while blacks, by a margin of 46 percent to 27 percent, blame poverty. **********Mr. Reagan's critics on Central American policy are concerned that it might involve the United States in military conflict. Two-thirds of those who disapprove of the President's policies in the region believe that the policies might lead to war. At the same time, more than half of those who approve of the President's Central America policies do not approve of American involvement in the mining of the Nicaraguan ports. **********Only about a fifth of the public believes that Mr. Reagan's current trip to China is prompted by important foreign policy reasons. Democrats, by a 5-to-1 margin, believe that the trip is motivated by domestic political considerations, while Republicans are divided evenly between those who believe it is prompted by politics and those who believe Mr. Reagan is making the trip now for foreign policy reasons. **********Among the public as a whole, 52 percent believe that Mr. Reagan is making the trip now because it will help him politically. Twenty-two percent believe he is in China because of important foreign policy reasons."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/07/world/rebels-capture-west-beirut-us-gunfire-supports-regime-reagan-denounces-syrian-228718.html": {"writer_name": "Leslie Gelb", "pub_date": "1984-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 934, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REBELS CAPTURE WEST BEIRUT;U.S. GUNFIRE SUPPORTS REGIME; REAGAN DENOUNCES; SYRIAN AID", "print_headline": "REBELS CAPTURE WEST BEIRUT;U.S. GUNFIRE SUPPORTS REGIME; REAGAN DENOUNCES; SYRIAN AID", "body_text": " **********With the political and military situation deteriorating in Lebanon, the Reagan Administration is becoming ever more deeply committed to the Christian-led Government of President Amin Gemayel. At the same time, it is beginning to wonder whether Mr. Gemayal can continue in power.  President Reagan has fallen back on the increased use of American military power as the only way to hold the situation together, having decided that Syria has ignored American warnings against stepping up the fighting. **********More force and more one-sided commitment are not what Mr. Reagan wants. But officials say they are coming to feel that these factors are inherent in the circumstances. Nothing else, they say, seemed to be working. **********The Problem for U.S. **********Mr. Gemayel did almost everything the Administration asked of him in making proposals Sunday for broadening his Government. But the Syrian- backed Druse and Shiite Moslems are not going along. To make matters worse, Shafik al-Wazzan, Prime Minister and Sunni Moslem leader, resigned. So the Administration is in no position to dump Mr. Gemayel and at the same time is frustrated in its efforts to broaden his political base through negotiations. **********Syria's price for helping Washington is for Lebanon to break its agreement of last May with Israel and to give Syria predominance in Lebanon. The Administration - given Mr. Reagan's conviction that vital American interests are at stake in Lebanon and pressure from Israel and moderate Arab leaders - will not pay that much. So the Administration issues warnings to Damascus not to raise the level of fighting, and Damascus ignores them. **********Mr. Gemayel's Government and armed forces are far from strong enough to deal with the increased fighting on their own. Thus, the President's decision today to use muscle to fill the gaps and prevent the Government's collapse appears to be the inevitable result. **********Administration officials say they are less and less confident that they know how to break this cycle of ever-deepening American military involvement. But all they are thinking about today is sending out the strongest possible message of support for Mr. Gemayel. **********''In the short term, if matters don't improve and Syria through its surrogates tries to topple the Lebanese Government and kill Americans, you'll see a very substantial U.S. response,'' one high White House official said.   Firm Stand on Marines **********Administration officials said the response would come from the American fleet, with attack aircraft and heavy ship guns. They indicated that American firepower would not be restricted to the mountain area around Beirut but might extend to Syrian military positions deeper in Lebanon. The one thing that will not be done, they said, is to move the marines out of their entrenchments in the Beirut airport. **********Officials reported that even top civilian and military leaders in the Pentagon had softened their insistence on early withdrawal of the Marines. **********The President is said to feel that the credibility of the United States is at stake, that he gave the Syrians fair warning not to further stimulate the fighting, that they treated this as a bluff and that he has no choice now but to increase American military efforts. **********While the officials interviewed indicated that there was no high-level dissent from Mr. Reagan's decision to use more force, many questioned whether the fundamental situation would be changed. The general view seemed to be that once Syria and Syrian-backed forces felt the weight of the American riposte, they would scale down the fighting. But then, in the next weeks or months, the same thing would happen again. **********When the fighting dies down, State Department officials expect to renew efforts to negotiate a new and more broadly based government in Beirut. But they are already concerned that Mr. Gemayel has gone about as far as he can go.   Waiting for a Response **********''He is a little feudal lord,'' one key Administration official said, ''but we are impressed by how far he has been willing to go in a situation where it is not easy to compromise and survive.'' **********White House, Pentagon and State Department officials spent the day in meetings and communicating with the American Embassy in Beirut. They were all waiting to see if the tough, new military measures ordered by the President would cause Mr. Wazzan to withdraw his resignation - as he has done before - whether Syria would agree to the participation of other Moslems in the Government and generally how intransigent Damascus would be this time. **********Administration officials said Mr. Reagan was against voiding or renegotiating the Lebanese-Israeli accord but that Mr. Gemayel might be looking for some room to maneuver on this issue. ''This would drive the Israelis crazy and we don't want it ourselves,'' one key official said, ''but at this point we are hardly in a position to deny Gemayel a little bit of flexibility.'' **********Even though officials continue to insist that Mr. Reagan will not withdraw all the marines before the political conventions this summer or even before the end of the year, there has been what officials call serious planning for redeploying some of them to the ships off Lebanon and to other less exposed positions. This planning has come to a halt. **********''As long as the situation is bad, we will keep them right where they are,'' the official said. **********For now, the Administration's overriding aim is simple - to get things back to where they were a week ago and start all over."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/31/world/iraq-says-its-jets-hit-another-ship.html": {"writer_name": "Judith Miller", "pub_date": "1984-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 579, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IRAQ SAYS ITS JETS HIT ANOTHER SHIP", "print_headline": "IRAQ SAYS ITS JETS HIT ANOTHER SHIP", "body_text": " **********Iraq said today that its jet planes had attacked and hit another large ship in the Persian Gulf south of Iran's principal export terminal at Kharg Island. **********There was no independent confirmation of the attack, which an Iraqi military spokesman said was carried out in the war zone declared by his Government in the Kharg Island area.

No independent confirmation of those strikes was available last week.   Turks Said to Offer Mediation **********Meanwhile, Turkey's Prime Minister, Turgut Ozal, was quoted in Baghdad tonight as saying that his Government was ready to mediate an end to the Iran-Iraq war provided that both sides consented. **********Iran has consistently resisted efforts at mediation. It has insisted that before it can consider entering talks, Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein, must be removed from office, that Iraqi forces withdraw from Iranian territory and that compensation be paid Iran for the damage it has suffered since the war began in September 1980. **********The official Iraqi press agency said the Turkish Prime Minister met Tuesday with President Hussein and today with Deputy Prime Minister Taha Yassin Ramadan. **********Among the topics reportedly discussed were the possibility of building a new oil pipeline through Turkey to the Mediterranean and expansion of the capacity of the existing pipeline, through which about 800,000 barrels of Iraqi oil flows each day. This is expected to be increased to one million barrels by July.   Syria Closed Pipeline to Iraq **********Before the Iran-Iraq war, Iraqi oil had also flowed through a pipeline across Syria. But Syria, which supports Iran in the war, closed this pipeline to the Iraqis last year. **********Also in Baghdad today, the Iraqi military high command said in its daily communique that strikes by its forces had inflicted ''heavy losses'' on Iranian troops in the Misan area, east of the Iraqi port city of Basra, and on the central front. **********All Iraqi planes involved in the strikes on the tankers and land returned to base safely, Iraqi official sources said. **********Reports of the latest air strike came amid repeated speculation here in the Persian Gulf area that Iran might be about to launch a new ground offensive against Iraq during Ramadan, the Moslem holy month of prayer and fasting from dawn to dusk. It is expected to begin tomorrow, depending on the sighting of the new moon. **********In other developments, Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, arrived in Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia, with a message from President Hussein to King Fahd. **********There were reports that, with Iraqi attacks on Persian Gulf shipping slowing oil shipments through the Gulf, Iran had offered a discount of $1.50 a barrel to shippers willing to load at Kharg Island."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/13/world/prisoner-release-hailed-by-walesa.html": {"writer_name": "Ben Franklin", "pub_date": "1984-08-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 418, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PRISONER RELEASE HAILED BY WALESA", "print_headline": "PRISONER RELEASE HAILED BY WALESA", "body_text": " **********Lech Walesa, founder of the banned Polish union Solidarity, said in an interview broadcast today that if the Polish Government continued to release political prisoners ''it will be a sure sign that something is really changing'' in his country. **********Mr. Walesa had a generally conciliatory and optimistic tone in an interview surreptitiously taped by CBS News last Wednesday in a church rectory in Poland, after Mr. Walesa momentarily dodged his police surveillance.

The officials included tank and armored fighting vehicle crews, infantry and artillery noncommissioned officers, and company commanders and divisional and corps commanders. **********In the case of the American Seventh Army, senior officers agreed, reporting procedures have not kept step with the arrival of new weapons. As a result, the levels of weapons, ammunition, spare parts and fuel are actually higher than reports forwarded to Washington a year ago may indicate, the officers said. **********Readiness Encourages Officers **********In interviews, two battalion commanders said they were encouraged by the readiness of the Abrams tanks and the Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. **********Lt. Col. Jerry D. Malcolm said that 56 of his 57 Abrams tanks were ''ready to roll'' and that he had adequate spare parts. The Abrams has a high fuel consumption rate, he admitted, and as a result tankers were moved closer to advance tanks and training in refueling en route was emphasized. **********The Abrams is one of three new tanks deployed by the allied armies. The British Challenger is now reaching the Army of the Rhine and West Germany is deploying the Leopard II. Intelligence sources rate the three as superior in firepower, speed and agility to the Soviet T-72. **********One overall logistic weakness, however, is that each uses a different type of ammunition for its main gun.   Tanks Go 40 m.p.h. in Fields **********Crews are testing the limits of their tanks. Two Abrams drivers reported that they had pushed their vehicles to 60 miles an hour over German autobahns. Speeds of 40 miles an hour over fields are not unusual, crewmen reported. **********The Bradley first reached Seventh Army forces last year. It has the speed to keep up with the Abrams, a 25-millimeter gun heavy enough to engage hostile vehicles of its type and the TOW antitank missile. The only complaint among soldiers is the Bradley's height of 117 inches, which, they think, makes it an easier target. **********The Bradley's speed across country is up to 45 miles an hour. **********Col.

Crews concede that ammunition levels may be lower than they would like, but they say that the kill ratio of the Abrams, Challengers and Leopard II's will be higher. **********Commanders and crews said maintenance problems were many and intricate when the vehicles were delivered, but representatives of the manufacturers have successfully instructed maintenance crews. **********The Army has purchased 2,929 Abrams tanks since 1981. In the same period, it has acquired nearly 2,200 armored personnel carriers. **********The change in weapons affects all three armies. The Seventh Army is receiving the Multiple Launch Rocket system, the Army of the Rhine new armored cars and antiaircraft missiles, and the West German forces a new light armored vehicle and a heavy duty antiaircraft tracked vehicle. **********The Americans also have received thousands of five-ton trucks to replace vehicles that in many cases were older than their drivers. **********The state of training and morale is said to be high in all three armies.

Reunification Held Essential **********Several Palestinians argued privately that reunification was essential for the P.L.O. because Mr. Arafat remained extremely popular on the Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan River valley, and among Palestinian communities in most parts of the Arab world. **********The sources described the Palestinian dissidents as having little support and said they had been viewed mainly as tools of Syria. **********Meanwhile, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine - two of the most prominent guerrilla organizations outside of Al Fatah, the largest P.L.O. group, headed by Mr. Arafat - are conducting talks aimed at reunifying their movement. **********Some Palestinians said the Democratic Front and the Popular Front were well positioned to play a mediating role within the P.L.O., because, unlike the dissidents, neither group had called for Mr. Arafat's ouster.   'Clarifications' to Be Sought **********Jamil Hillal, a member of the Democratic Front, said the two groups would meet with members of the Fatah central committee in Aden later this month. Mr. Hillal said the Democratic Front and the Popular Front would seek ''clarifications'' from the 10- member Fatah central committee about its stand on issues such as Mr. Arafat's recent discussions with King Hussein of Jordan and his relations with Egypt. **********Both groups and the dissidents have strongly criticized Mr. Arafat's visit in December to Egypt, a country that has been boycotted by Arab nations since it made peace with Israel in 1979. They have also been concerned that Mr. Arafat might try to authorize King Hussein to enter negotiations with Israel on behalf of the Palestinians, a step that they maintain a majority of the P.L.O. would oppose. **********''What we are trying to do,'' Mr. Hillal said, ''is to get Fatah's central committee to discipline Arafat, to restrain him.''  Doubt Voiced on Syrian Role **********Another Palestinian figure here said he doubted that efforts by the Democratic Front and the Popular Front to smooth relations within the P.L.O. would succeed. The official said nothing could happen without Syria and he expressed doubt that Syria would ''be there.'' **********Thus far, Syrian officials have maintained that despite their support for the dissidents and for Mr. Arafat's ouster from Lebanon, the split within the ranks of Fatah was an internal Palestinian concern that must be resolved by Palestinians. **********Some Palestinians here argue that Syria will inevitably decide that a reconciliation with Mr. Arafat is in its best interests. **********One pointed out that after months of accusing Mr. Gemayel of being a traitor and a ''stooge,'' the Syrians had welcomed the President here. Syria could make the same decision regarding Mr. Arafat, he said.

(Page 7.) **********In Santa Barbara, Calif., Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said that Mr. Reagan, in a message of condolences, called on the Kremlin to ''join in peaceful purpose for all mankind.'' **********Prompt Signal to Moscow **********Mr. Shultz appeared before reporters in Washington to read an Administration statement that incorporated some of Mr. Reagan's message and some additional thoughts. The purpose of the publicity given the Administration's messages, State Department of ficials said, was to send a prompt signal to the Soviet leaders that Washington was more ready than ever for a significant improvement in relations, in keeping with the Administration's conciliatory policy of the last month. **********Mr. Shultz was reported to have favored Mr. Reagan's going to the funeral, although other senior officials saw more merit at this time in Mr. Bush and Mr. Shultz heading the delegation, as they did at the funeral for Leonid I. Brezhnev in November 1982. In a telephone conversation with Mr. Reagan this morning, Mr. Shultz laid out the differing advice and left it for the President to decide. **********2 Visitors From Mideast **********A senior White House official said a consideration that Mr. Reagan had to take into account was that King Hussein of Jordan and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt both have scheduled meetings in Washington next week with Mr. Reagan at a time when the Middle East is in crisis, and a cancellation of those meetings would cause problems in relations. **********The White House did not say tonight who would accompany Mr. Bush. The Vice President was flying to London tonight for a previously scheduled meeting. State Department officials said Mr. Shultz might not join Mr. Bush because of the Lebanon crisis and the visits here next week of King Hussein and President Mubarak. **********The official said Mr. Bush would be able to convey the Administration's message. There was concern that if Mr. Reagan went, the substance of the Administration position might be overshadowed by speculation that he was going purely for political reasons at home. **********In 1982, Mr. Shultz advised Mr. Reagan to go to the funeral of Mr. Brezhnev and meet with Mr. Andropov. This time, those in the State Department advocating a Reagan visit to Moscow argued that American policy was more directed toward improving relations with Moscow, and a Reagan trip would be seen by allies as a confirmation of that policy. **********Mr. Shultz, in his statement, said that ''there are opportunities at hand'' for better relations with the Soviet Union. ''Let us find common ground and let us make the world a safer place,'' he said. **********Mr. Shultz said that ''we have reaffirmed with the most seriousness of purpose our own readiness to engage the Soviet leadership in solving problems, in developing those things that are needed to make the world a safer place, and we invite their response, and we hope very much that whoever emerges as the new leader or leadership group will want to respond in kind.'' **********As to a summit meeting, Mr. Shultz said Mr. Reagan remained ready for one if there was ''the reasonable opportunity for some substantive accomplishment.''  Relations Deteriorated **********Under Mr. Andropov, relations between the United States and the Soviet Union turned chilly. They worsened with the strong American reaction to the Soviet downing of a South Korean airliner last September and with the Soviet decision to leave the negotiations on medium-range missiles in November after the Western allies began deploying new American missiles. The Russians have also refused to set a date for resuming negotiations on strategic arms reduction. But they did agree to resume East-West negotiations on March 16 on troop reductions in central Europe. **********In a speech on Jan. 16, Mr. Reagan called for improved relations. This was followed on Jan. 18 by a meeting between Mr. Shultz and Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko that American officials said was conducted in a businesslike and serious way even though the major differences remained. Mr. Andropov, in the last foreign policy statement attributed to him, said the Russians remained ready for better relations but again said that negotiations on medium-range missiles were impossible as long as the new American missiles were deployed. **********Thus, in the Administration view, an early test will be whether the new Soviet leader decides to stick strictly to the Andropov policy or agrees to resume substantive discussions with the United States in some way. None of the candidates that may succeed Mr. Andropov have had much international experience. There was no Washington favorite, officials said.   Thoughts on a Successor **********A senior State Department Kremlinologist predicted that Konstantin U. Chernenko, a former Brezhnev protege and the senior member of the Communist Party Secretariat, would be chosen General Secretary. But Central Intelligence Agency analysts were reported to be leaning toward a younger Politburo member, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who was close to Mr. Andropov. **********Mr. Shultz read the Administration statement himself to impress the Russians with the intensity of the American desire to resume fruitful contacts, department officials said. **********In addition to Mr. Reagan's message to the Kremlin, Mr. Shultz sent a similar one to Mr. Gromyko. **********''At this time of transition in Moscow, let me reaffirm the basic principles of our policy toward the Soviet Union,'' he said in his statement. ''We remain ready for a constructive and realistic dialogue with the Soviet Union. In this nuclear age, the United States will work to build a more stable and more positive relationship.'' **********He said that, as Mr. Reagan had stressed, ''we seek to find solutions to real problems, not just to improve the atmosphere of our relations.'' **********''This applies, in particular, to the task of reaching equitable and verifiable agreements for arms reduction and reducing the risk of war,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/26/business/perlmans-to-sell-regent-air.html": {"writer_name": "Lee Daniels", "pub_date": "1984-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 511, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PERLMANS TO SELL REGENT AIR", "print_headline": "PERLMANS TO SELL REGENT AIR", "body_text": " **********A New York investment banker has purchased controlling interest in the Regent Air Corporation, the financially troubled luxury air service. **********J.

He was in Manhattan to attend the General Assembly session of the United Nations. **********''My Government has grown impatient with the lack of a concrete response from the United States,'' he added. **********High-Level Panel Sought **********Mr. Paz said Honduras formally asked the United States at the end of July to appoint a high-level commission to discuss changes in the relationship between the two countries. He reported that the Reagan Administration had resisted the suggestion, although he said senior American officials, including Secretary of State George P. Shultz, had told him the Administration was willing to talk about increasing economic aid. **********State Department officials said they were surprised by Mr. Paz's comments. They said that representatives of the United States and Honduras talked often and that although the Administration had not set up a special commission, it had no objection to exploring possible changes. **********Honduras has taken several steps recently to distance itself from the United States on security issues, including the announcement last month that it would no longer permit the training of Salvadoran troops at a regional military center in Honduras that is operated by the United States. **********Mr. Paz's comments were the most forceful statement of Honduran concerns since relations with Washington began to chill after Gen. Gustavo Alvarez Martinez, the commander of the Honduran military and an advocate of close ties to the United States, was ousted by fellow officers in March. **********Until the recent cooling in relations, Honduras was the principal base for United States military activities in Central America, including large-scale exercises. The Reagan Administration has invested millions of dollars in building and improving military installations in Honduras, including airfields, and Defense Department planners have assumed that Honduras would be the primary staging area for United States forces if direct American military intervention in the region was necessary.   Consequence of the Ban **********Honduras has also been a sanctuary for Nicaraguan rebels supported by the Central Intelligence Agency. Reagan Administration officials have expressed concern in private about any major change in relations with Honduras. **********A senior Defense Department official said last week that the Honduran ban on training Salvadoran troops at the military center in Puerto Castilla on the Atlantic coast had prevented 500 Salvadoran soldiers from enrolling in September and would block the arrival of another 500 later this fall. He said the United States would try to offer alternative training. **********El Salvador and Honduras fought a border war in 1969, and distrust between them remains a serious obstacle to Administration efforts to increase military cooperation by pro-American governments in the region. Honduran officials have said that General Alvarez's willingness to permit Salvadoran troops to be trained at Puerto Castilla was one reason for his removal. **********Mr. Paz said Honduras, because of its ''important geopolitical position'' in Central America, deserved greater economic aid from the United States.   The Level of Aid **********''The political costs of what we have done have been high,'' he said, speaking of Honduras's cooperation with El Salvador, its support of Nicaraguan rebels and, in general, its position as a close ally of the United States. **********''We want greater economic assistance, regardless of our military role,'' he said. **********In the fiscal year 1984, which ended on Sept. 30, the United States gave Honduras $77.5 million in military aid and $168.9 million in economic aid. For the current fiscal year, the Administration requested $62.5 million in military aid and $138.8 in economic support. **********Mr. Paz said: ''American economic assistance has been substantial but not sufficient. The friendship between us would improve if the relationship were more balanced and the United States appreciated the vital role that we have played.'' **********He added: ''We want American help to stabilize our political system and our social system. Without that, our ability to provide military cooperation with the United States would be meaningless.'' **********He said Honduras, like the United States, objected to some provisions of a Central American peace treaty proposed by four Latin nations and endorsed by Nicaragua last month. **********The draft treaty was developed by the Contadora group, which consists of Mexico, Panama, Venezuela and Colombia. **********Mr. Paz said Honduras objected to mechanisms to insure that provisions of the treaty are carried out.

Officials of the Reagan Administration and members of Congress have made it clear that the country will have an easier time obtaining continued support from the United States if Mr. Duarte defeats Mr. d'Aubuisson, who has been linked to the country's right-wing death squads. **********Election workers were finishing last- minute preparations to avoid a repetition of the chaos in the first round, when thousands of people were kept from voting by a shortage of ballots and ballot boxes and by confusion over a new system that assigned them to specific voting places. **********Little Military Activity **********''Everything is already in place,'' Eliseo Rovera, an official of the elections council, said. He said revised voting lists - including the names of people who were turned away on March 25 - had been sent to voting places. **********The country was largely calm today, with only scattered incidents of military activity in the countryside. The leftist guerrillas, however, today renewed their vow to ''continue fighting before, during and after the elections.'' **********In the province of San Vicente, leaflets dropped overnight warned that the guerrillas were planning political and military activities there on election day and advised people to stay at home. **********In a broadcast on the clandestine Radio Venceremos, the guerrillas warned all drivers that they ''should refrain from driving on the principal highways because these are being mined by our military units.'' **********The Salvadoran military, meanwhile, moved to a condition of ''active defense'' to protect voters, according to a military specialist here.   Military Vows Neutrality **********Defense Minister Eugenio Vides Casanova promised that the country ''will see the most absolute apoliticism, as our Constitution orders,'' from the armed forces. **********The armed forces, a critical factor in the transfer of power here in the past, have put advertisements in newspapers vowing that ''the armed forces guarantees that its mandate to the people will be fulfilled'' and declaring that ''El Salvador needs a democratically elected President.'' **********After the 1982 vote for a Constituent Assembly here, the armed forces were decisive in thwarting a plan by a rightist coalition, which controls the assembly, to make a candidate sympathetic to its views the Provisional President. **********The man who finally got the job, Alvaro Magana, a moderate former bank president, urged the nation in a speech tonight to turn out at the polls. He said, ''These elections mean that the Salvadoran has decided for peace and for the vote and has rejected violence and the bullet.'' **********''Despite this violence,'' he continued, ''a great political transformation is taking place in our country. This political transformation consists simply in surrendering power to a people that has the will to exercise it to reject violence.''  Senator's Charge Denied **********Mr. Magana also said that, contrary to a charge by Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, he did not veto an election law favored by Salvadoran rightists to favor the Christian Democrats or under duress from the United States. **********''I made my decision to maintain the rules of the elections without pressure from anybody,'' he said. ''It was a decision of conscience. I made it thinking only of my people and the future of our democracy.'' There is some concern about how the political right will react if Mr. Duarte takes power. ''Everyone has their fears,'' Mr. Duarte said in an interview, ''but I am conscious of the risk that we run and have taken precautions.'' **********Mr. Duarte has been staying near his well-protected home in recent weeks as the desultory second round of campaigning drew to a close. Much of the campaign consisted of efforts by him and Mr. d'Aubuisson to gain support of local units of the National Conciliation Party, which took third place in the March 25 voting and whose members could provide the winning margin. The party eventually decided to endorse neither candidate. **********The United States Ambassador here, Thomas R. Pickering, said he believed the Salvadoran people were becoming ''reconciled to accepting the results'' of the elections, at least for a while. **********''I think the mind-set is one of accommodation to a new Government rather than one of antagonism or abject fear,'' Mr. Pickering said in an interview. ''More and more people are saying things such as, 'We want to look carefully at the first month of the new administration to decide how it is going to act.'

O'Neill Jr. that such shelling was ''absolutely not'' permitted by the resolution. **********In addition to claiming broader powers for the President, Mr. Speakes seemed to contradict earlier statements that tied the new shelling policy to American support for President Amin Gemayel. **********Change of Emphasis Noted **********On Wednesday, Mr. Speakes had said that the resolution authorized ''whatever steps are necessary'' to back the Lebanese Government. **********Today, he said the resolution was considered to cover protection of the marines remaining on shore during the phased move from Beirut airport to the ships offshore. **********Administration officials said Mr. Speakes had been given ''erroneous guidance'' Wednesday when he stressed the need to protect the Gemayel Government. In clarifying this point, the White House is trying to avoid a confrontation with Congress, according to one official. **********Mr. Speakes rejected questions of why President Reagan had publicly criticized a ''surrender'' attitude among Democrats who had urged a pullback while he himself had already privately decided to move the marines back to the ships. **********''I cannot debate all those points,'' the spokesman said. Support for Gemayel at Issue **********On Wednesday, in seeeking to justify the decision to remove the marines from their airport compound, Administration officials said the United States had fashioned an inviting ''package'' for President Gemayel, including American air and naval support and additional military equipment and training for the Lebanese army. **********Today, however, Mr. Speakes emphasized that the President's announcement on Tuesday of the proposed pullback had tied the new shelling policy specifically to ''the safety of American and other multinational force personnel in Lebanon.'' **********The President also linked the promise of aid for Lebanon to President Gemayel's ability to build ''a broadly based representative government.'' **********Mr. Speakes insisted that there was no lessening of support for Mr. Gemayel and that President Reagan still hoped a viable government could be formed.    Impact of Shelling Policy The spokesman was asked how the new policy of increased shelling of Syrian-controlled territory would advance the willingness of Syrian-supported Lebanese factions to form a broad-based government. **********''Well, I think what you say may have the very fact to make them more tractable,'' Mr. Speakes responded, apparently alluding to the shelling. **********When asked how the marine contingent at the airport was a factor in the decision to begin shelling, Mr. Speakes said the gun positions in Syrian-controlled areas were ''capable'' of hitting the compound even if they did not. **********A question left unanswered today was how long any marines would remain at the airport. Mr. Speakes said there had been no decision and the timing would depend on ''future contingencies.'' **********Mr. Speakes was asked whether the shelling of targets in Lebanon would continue after the pullback of the four- nation force, which originally included units from the United States, Britain, France and Italy. Only France has yet to announce plans for removing its troops. **********''We will wait and make those decisions when the M.N.F. is gone,'' Mr. Speakes said.    Vague on 'Many Options' **********He was vague in describing the ''many options'' Administration officials feel the President has beyond the Congressional resolution for taking action in Lebanon. He said the President's obligation for the ''protection of American lives'' was one line of authority. **********The President's spokesman said the change in American policy had been distorted in some news accounts. Other officials said Mr. Reagan was known to be incensed at television newscasts that portrayed the pullback plans as a ''cut and run'' decision. **********As President Reagan spent a day of horseback-riding and brush-clearing intermixed with reports and telephone calls on the Lebanon crisis, he came under more criticism from Democrats for taking a vacation. Walter F. Mondale, the frontrunner for the Democratic Presidential nomination, said Mr. Reagan had ''not applied himself'' and should have returned to Washington. **********The White House has rebuffed the criticism, with Mr. Speakes saying: ''The President can do whatever he needs to do from wherever he is.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/25/business/san-diego-gas-electric-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SAN DIEGO GAS & ELECTRIC CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "SAN DIEGO GAS & ELECTRIC CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/23/business/your-money-when-a-loan-is-refused.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1984-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 834, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WHEN A LOAN IS REFUSED", "print_headline": "YOUR MONEY; WHEN A LOAN IS REFUSED", "body_text": " **********CAUTION: If you are a good credit risk, lenders may hold it against you. **********This can happen - even though the prospective borrower may have an impeccable credit history and a moderate debt load - because he is thought to have too much other credit available. Yet most or all of this credit capacity could be in the form of aline of credit that the borrower has not drawn on and does not intend to draw on. **********For example, consumers have been denied loans for such major purchases as a car, boat or recreational vehicle because the lender believes the line of credit on their bank credit cards or checking accounts is at, or close to, the overall debt they can handle. Even if the credit line or overdraft checking account is wholly or partly unused, the creditor may still be worried that the loan applicant could use it at any time and thereby be overextended with the addition of an installment loan. **********Thus, a middle-income consumer might have a $5,000 line of credit on a Mastercard account, another $5,000 line on a Visa account and a third $5,000 line on a checking account with overdraft capability. But because many banks and finance companies consider 40 percent of after-tax income to be the maximum allowable amount of debt service for an individual, the $15,000 credit line could put him at the upper limit of the prospective lender's permissible debt ratio. **********It should be noted, too, that the entire available line of credit is frequently taken into account when a credit application is being weighed, even though most credit card holders use less than half of their existing lines. **********'Any financial institution would look not just at the amount of credit that is outstanding, but at the potential available to the individual,' said Fred J. Peterson, senior vice president of Bank One of Northeastern Ohio and an executive committee member of the American Bankers Association's installment lending division. 'This is becoming more of an issue because more banks are soliciting credit lines outside their traditional territory.' **********Tom Lynch, vice president for direct response lending at the Chase Manhattan Bank, reminds consumers that credit 'is evaluated on the three C's: capacity, character and collateral.' And, he points out, 'Capacity includes: 'Does he have the capacity to pay if he runs all these lines to their maximum?' **********In many cases, moreover, the size of a line of credit is not necessarily the one desired by the card holder; it may have been raised automatically by the issuer after a periodic review of that customer's account. Yet the customer may be penalized by the increase in cases where he or she is unable to obtain a desired installment loan.  'Customers don't understand what's being done to them,' said Mark Leymaster, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center in Boston. 'It could severely retard your ability to shop for credit.' **********In being denied credit for this reason, borrowers may be forced to request cash advances on their credit card lines of credit or an overdraft lan on their checking account. But using a credit card for borrowing purposes, except for short periods of time, is a much more expensive means of obtaining credit than a collaterized installment loan. **********Mr. Peterson noted that the interest-rate differential between a nonsecured line of credit and a secured installment loan can be as high as eight percentage points. The cost of a fixed-rate auto loan today is typically at an annual percentage rate of between 13 1/2 percent and 14 percent, while the average cost of credit used through a credit card is about 19 percent. **********Bankers advise consumers whose credit has been rejected to either appeal the refusal to a lending officer or make a equest for a reduction int he credit lines associated with credit card and checking accounts. Such an inquiry carries no negative associations, they say, and will not adversely affect a credit record. **********'The educated consumer will go back to the bank where he has the $5,000 line of credit and ask that bank to reduce it,' said Newton P.S. Merrill, executive vice president of the Bank of New York. 'You then have the ability to reapply for the car loan after fixing what is perceived to be the deficiency.' **********When you have to move quickly on the automobile installment loan, however, there is a possible short cut to what could be a long process of dealing with two separate banks. Mr. Lynch suggests this approach: **********If Bank A refuses a loan because of potential debts, and the borrower's credit card lines of credit are at Bank B, ask Bank B to cut back on these lines and inform Bank A directly by letter. This bank-to-bank communication may shorten the process of getting the installment loan from a month or so to a relatively few days."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/15/business/phelps-dodge-sets-smelter-opening.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Phelps Dodge Sets Smelter Opening", "print_headline": "Phelps Dodge Sets Smelter Opening", "body_text": " **********The Phelps Dodge Corporation said its Ajo smelter, shut down two years ago, is being reopened with a work force of about 100 people. **********None of the smelter workers will be from among Phelps Dodge employees who have been striking at company facilities at Ajo, Morenci, Bisbee and Douglas since last July 1, the company said. **********The Ajo operation was closed in April 1982 as the copper industry began to slump.

It is also partly a result of consumers' reluctance to accept the innovation. **********Rather than providing head-on competition to the regular commercial banks, the consumer banks so far have posed little threat and might even be evolving into complements of the long-established banks. **********Using Regulatory Loopholes **********''It really hasn't amounted to a hill of a beans so far,'' said Perrin Long, an analyst at the Lipper Analytical Securities Corporation who follows the banking industry. ''But that doesn't mean that it won't in the future. It is still a very interesting area.'' **********The consumer banks were formed when financial service or other nonbanking companies used a regulatory loophole to buy banks, made modifications to put them beyond Fed purview and then began offering bank- like services. A varied group entered the field, including the Parker Pen Company, the J. C. Penney Company and the Prudential Insurance Company of America. **********Probably the most successful, according to analysts, is the Dreyfus Corporation, a money fund manager. Dreyfus has earned little from its consumer bank so far, but has demonstrated that it can market the unit's products - such as Federally insured accounts, home mortgages and auto loans - through direct-mail techniques. **********Most of these companies are following in the pioneering steps of Sears, Roebuck & Company, the merchandising and financial giant. Sears has not acquired a bank but it does own a thrift institution, an insurer and a stock brokerage as part of a strategy to create a network of financial ''supermarkets'' in its department stores. **********For the other entrants, such retail considerations as branch locations did not matter greatly, provided they could obtain a bank charter. With a charter, they could take deposits insured by the Federal Government and, more important, use the term ''bank,'' which has considerable marketing clout because the public associates it with stability. **********The Definition of a Bank **********Legally, a bank is defined as an institution that takes deposits and makes commercial loans. The acquired banks were stripped of their commercial loan portfolios to put them beyond the reach of the Fed's oversight. In response, the Fed last year broadened its definition of a commercial loan to include a bank's purchase of certificates of deposit, commercial paper and bankers acceptances. Shut out from these instruments, the consumer banks' return on their short-term cash has suffered. **********The change in what is known as ''regulation Y'' has stymied some of the new entrants and the bottom-line results for the consumer banks have been meager. **********For Dreyfus, the profits may have been disappointing so far, but the company has been able to accomplish something most of the others have not - sell banking services outside of a bank. **********Its secret, according to Daniel P. Collins, an analyst at Wheat, First Securities Inc. in Richmond, is years of experience in selling financial products, such as money market and equity mutual funds, through the mail. **********''Dreyfus is one of the few who can use direct mail because they have a history and learned how to do it,'' Mr. Collins said. ''People have got comfortable with them.'' The aim ''is to use the post office as their bank branch system,'' he said, reducing costs and extending their reach. **********Mortgages Through The Mail **********Howard M. Stein, Dreyfus's chairman, looks on the company's direct- mail expertise as perhaps its greatest asset, in addition to its ability to pass on its savings to the consumer. ''We found that you can market mortgages through the mail,'' he said. **********The Dreyfus Consumer Bank, formerly the Lincoln State Bank of East Orange, N.J., has originated about 625 home mortgage loans totaling $48 million since the beginning of this year. It also has 230 auto loans outstanding worth some $2.7 million. By industry standards, both figures are modest. **********Dreyfus's objective for the bank is to use the company's existing pool of customers. ''They want to leverage their customer base through these new products, and then leverage the products,'' said Mr. Collins of Wheat, First Securities. ''It hasn't hurt, but it hasn't yet had much impact on Dreyfus's earnings,'' he added. **********Other entrants in consumer banking have found the going to be even more frustratingly slow. **********Charles Lord, chairman of the Prudential Bank and Trust Company, formerly the Capital City Bank of Hapeville, Ga., said: ''We found that it was very difficult to sell some of the products through direct mail. It needs that personal touch.'' **********Prudential faced other problems, too. The consumer bank introduced its second mortgage, or ''home equity'' loans, at the same time many other financial companies did. The bank also found that its fees were too high to attract customers, Mr. Lord said. **********A Partnership Arrangement **********The Fed's restrictions are forcing the consumer banks to seek new outlets for growth and, once again, Dreyfus seems to be in the forefront. ''We weren't going to sit around and brood'' about the new rules, said Mr. Stein. So Dreyfus Consumer Bank now finds itself a partner of other banks, offering to market products for them. **********The first such cooperative effort is the Pacific Horizon mutual funds, marketed through direct mailings by Dreyfus Consumer Bank and managed by a subsidiary of Security Pacific National Bank. Mr. Stein promises other similar ventures in the near future. **********''Our products will keep the people at the banks, not take them away,'' Mr. Stein said.  These are, of course, intended to be soothing words, especially at a time when Congress is likely to look skeptically on further deregulation of the financial markets after the near-collapse of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company. **********Still, Dreyfus Consumer Bank is genuinely committed to these cooperative efforts, Mr. Stein said. **********''We've found new methods of banking through our experience with Dreyfus Consumer Bank,'' he said. ''Since we are limited in using these methods ourselves, it doesn't mean we can't use that knowledge with other institutions. Dreyfus will allow the banks to compete with Sears.'' **********Credit Card Venture **********Dreyfus Consumer Bank has also issued about 80,000 Mastercards with the accounts processed by European American Bank. Dreyfus claims its cards are a better deal for consumers because it charges about 17 percent interest compared with almost 20 percent at many other banks. Dreyfus also says that it offers lower upfront fees for its home mortgages, 1 1/2 points compared with up to 6 points at some commercial banks. **********Mr. Stein does concede that the results of the banking venture so far are skimpy. But the experience has given new ideas to a man known for his marketing creativity. **********''We're thinking about new questions, basic ones, like what is a bank depositor, is he different from a nonbank depositor?'' Mr. Stein asked. When he answers that question there are likely to be more products. ''We are tinkering all the time,'' he said. **********The lesson from this may be that while bankers look to such high technology as electronic home banking for market growth, such old-fashioned techniques as direct mail, if used properly, could prove a better way to reach more customers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/09/world/un-workers-plan-strike-over-budget-cuts.html": {"writer_name": "James Feron", "pub_date": "1984-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 602, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

They sought initially to eliminate the cost-of-living increase altogether. **********Alan L. Keyes, a United States representative, had said earlier in the budget committee that employees were not expected to make great personal sacrifices to work for the world organization and that Washington continued to favor an established standard of pay that is known as the Noblemaire system.   Salaries Called Too High **********Under that system, international civil servants should be paid at a level corresponding to the best-paid national civil service, in this case the United States, plus a ''small premium'' to insure that purely financial considerations do not prevent anyone from joining the United Nations staff. **********But salaries here, Mr. Keyes said, are now almost 40 percent higher than United States Federal salaries, rather than the ''historically'' acceptable 15 percent. He said the Secretariat staff had become an ''elite'' group in terms of living standards. **********But George Irving, head of the United Nations Staff Union, said last week that a study by the International Civil Service Commission, based on total compensation, showed a margin of only 10.6 percent and that the Staff Union would appeal the Assembly decision to the Administrative Tribunal, a United Nations appeals panel. **********Salaries of professionals here, representing roughly half the 7,000-member headquarters staff, range from $27,200 for an entry-level employee to $129,000 for an under secretary general, with a typical midcareer salary of $60,000. **********Mr. Irving said the United Nations staff was ''largely expatriate with no access to national social programs and often limited to a single-income source since family members are not permitted to work.'' He called the Assembly's action ''a political statement that some member nations are no longer willing to make contributions, financial or otherwise, to the organization.''  Congress Refused to Pay **********Mr. Irving said the Soviet position was consistent with its ''opposition to an independent international civil service,'' while Washington's action followed ''attempts to curtail the salaries of its own civil servants.'' He also noted that Congress had passed legislation ''saying they would simply refuse to pay the adjustment if it had gone through.'' **********He also questioned whether the United States Federal civil service was the ''proper comparator'' because the Washington salaries ''are now some 18 percent below comparable private-sector salaries.''

Y. Agnon. Now it is working its way through the code of Maimonides and the Midrash commentaries on the Bible. **********''For the first time,'' said Yaacov Choueka, director of the Responsa Project and a professor of computer sciences, ''the scholar in Jewish studies, the historian, the lawyer, the linguist or the rabbi will have immediate access to an enormous amount of information on any topic of Jewish interest that before would have either been impossible to collect manually or taken years. This will release the rabbis and scholars to devote the best part of their time to truly creative work. Our aim is to eventually put all of Jewish culture on computer.'' **********At first, conceded Mr. Choueka, Israeli rabbis were not exactly overjoyed about the idea, and raised the issue of Halakha, or Jewish law. **********''They saw it as some kind of competition,'' Mr. Choueka said of the rabbis. ''They would say: 'What can a dumb machine tell me about the teachings of rabbi this or that? How can it understand the Halakha?' But they quickly discovered how useful it could be.'' **********When Israel's former Chief Rabbi, Ovadia Yossef, who is widely regarded as one of the great Jewish scholars of the 20th century, came for a tour of the project, he could not resist asking, with just a hint of condescension, ''Ahh, but is it fast?'' **********''We told him, 'Oh yes, it's fast,' '' recalled Mr. Choueka with a grin, ''and while he was looking the other way we printed out in five minutes one complete volume of his responsa - about 300 pages. He was absolutely amazed.'' **********The Responsa Project, Mr. Choueka said, began in 1966 with a simple idea and an enormous agenda: Why not try to put all of the major works of responsa into a single computer where lawyers, scholars and rabbis from all over the world could consult it?   Old Standards, New Issues **********What are responsa? Ever since the Talmud - the huge compendium of Jewish religion, law, philosphy and ethics - was compiled and edited in the fifth century, Jews have been consulting the Talmud with problems ranging from the religious to the secular. Since people's problems were always changing with the times and the Talmud did not always address a specific new issue, Jews would approach their rabbis for a ruling in keeping with the spirit or letter of Jewish law. **********During the 1,500-year period of Jewish self-governing councils in the Diaspora, national Jewish group usually had one or two great learned rabbis to whom people could write for interpretations of thorny and novel questions. These rabbis, known as poseks, would respond in writing to queries sent to them, and these volumes of questions and answers became known as the responsa literature. **********It is estimated, said Mr. Choueka, that down through the ages 3,000 volumes of responsa containing at least 500,000 questions and answers were penned in Hebrew by different great rabbis from 10th-century Yemen to 20th-century Brooklyn. All of the laws that govern day-to-day behavior in Jewish life developed out of this constantly expanding body of rabbinical rulings.   47,000 Answers in the Computer **********Before the age of computers, however, the learned rabbi or jurist who wanted to consult the responsa literature in search of precedents for a ruling found himself confronted with half a million unindexed questions and answers. At best, he could consult the responsa volumes of only a few well- known rabbis, and even that would often take months of page-by-page sifting. **********No longer. The Responsa Project team at Bar Ilan has put the 248 major collections of responsa - 47,000 questions and answers - into the data banks of their one computer. By asking the computer any combination of key words in Hebrew, a rabbi - or any researcher - can retrieve within minutes all the responsa precedents. **********For example, if a rabbi wants to know how to address the problem of Siamese twins, he types into the computer terminal at Bar Ilan those two words and the computer tells him, among many other references, that in the 17th-century Rabbi Yaacov Hagiz dealt with that question in one of his responsa. **********''When I was once in Italy,'' the computer quotes from Rabbi Hagiz, ''I saw someone of 25 years who was born glued to his twin. One of the twins was more or less healthy and complete, while the other was an atrophying body.''  A Single Rule Applied **********The rabbi says he was asked if it was all right to destroy the dying half of the Siamese twins in order to save the healthy half. In his decision, the computer relates, the rabbi said, ''The atrophying half of the twins must be considered as a dying person, and as you can't hasten the death of a dying person you cannot destroy one Siamese twin to save the other half.'' **********The responsa were always involved in questions raised by technology, since anything new almost always created a problem for Jewish law that had to be referred to the rabbi. For instance, if the computer is asked to search for responsa on artificial insemination, the first reference it brings to the display screen is from the published responsa of the Polish Rabbi Shalom Mordechai Shabadron, who wrote in 1835: ''I was asked about a certain man who was living with his wife for more than 10 years, and they had had no children. A doctor told him he could put semen in a tube and insert it into the woman.'' **********Was this allowed? **********Rabbi Shabadron answered that this was permissible in Jewish law provided the doctor was a ''reputed physician.'' **********Then, of course, there were the complicated legal questions people posed, such as whether the only witness to the death of a man can marry the dead man's wife. When the computer is asked about this question, it refers to the responsa of the 13th-century Spanish Rabbi Asher Bar Yehiel.   The Marriage Was Barred **********''A man came and testified about the death of another man, and he was the only witness,'' the rabbi wrote. ''But he also wanted to marry the dead man's wife. We can trust him about his report of the man's death, but he cannot marry the man's wife.'' **********Putting the responsa literature into a computer proved to be no easy task for several religious and technical reasons. While typing the texts into the computer's memory, it was often necessary to type the name of God. According to Jewish law, it is forbidden to ever erase the name of God or destroy a piece of paper on which it is written. **********''We had to go to the rabbis,'' said Mr. Choueka, ''and ask if the name of God written on magnetic computer tape and disks or even on the video screen could be erased. Fortunately, they said a magnetic tape was not considered writing and that it was O.K. to erase it.'' **********The programming problem, however, went beyond anything the rabbis could rule on. The responsa were all written in Hebrew, and this is the language used in the computer. Hebrew has a very small number of roots and an enormous number of derivatives. This created serious problems for a researcher asking the computer to find responsa related to a key word. **********In English a search for the word testimony or any word beginning with testi might produce most of the relevant responsa. In Hebrew, however, testimony comes in so many derivations, with so many different suffixes and prefixes that to ask the computer for just testimony would produce only one percent of the total number of responsa references.   Grammar Is Part of Program **********''What we did was to create a software system that enabled us to put a full Hebrew dictionary and all the grammatical rules of the language into the computer,'' Mr. Choueka said. ''The computer can now conjugate any verb or noun in the correct grammatical style and give all the relevant variants of the word in the responsa.'' **********Two researchers are employed full time by the Responsa Project to deal with rabbis and scholars from Israel, the Israeli Rabbinical court and rabbis or anyone else from the United States or elsewhere who writes or phones seeking printouts on a particular subject. In addition, there are now on-line computer terminals at the Hebrew University Law School in Jerusalem and at the Ministry of Justice for instant reference by legal experts. Moreover, a complete copy of the computer's responsa system is now at Chicago's Institute for Computers in Jewish Life. **********One of the biggest impacts of the computer has been in Israeli courts. About three years ago Parliament ruled that Israeli lawyers could cite precedents from Jewish law, not just from secular European codes, in civil court to make their cases. **********As a result, Israeli lawyers and even the Supreme Court regularly consult the computer for precedents. The information delivered by the Responsa Project is admissible as evidence in Israeli courts and is frequently cited in written decisions. The Israeli Association of Insurance Companies even paid for a project to find out what the responsa had to say about insurance.   A Sociological Impact **********Not only has the computer revived the responsa literature as a source of law, history and linguistics, but it is having a subtle sociological impact as well. For years the works of many of the great Sephardic rabbis - particularly those from Arab countries - tended to be overlooked by the European or Ashkenazic Jewish establishment. **********''We think the computer is going to have a big impact on the self-image of Oriental Jews,'' said Mr. Choueka. ''By putting in one computer all of the responsa literature, we are making available works from prominent rabbis of Syria and Yemen who might normally have been overlooked. If you ask the computer a question, the responsa of the Sephardim come up right alongside those of the great Polish Ashkenazic rabbis. Students and lawyers who were not aware of the work of some of the Sephardic rabbis will now have to respond to it, refute it or accept it.'' **********Mr. Choueka is quick to explain that the Bar Ilan computer could never replace the human rabbi or judge. One must already be learned in Jewish tradition to understand how to get the most out of the computer and how to apply the information. **********''There is a verse in the Book of Daniel,'' Mr. Choueka said, ''that says God gives wisdom to the wise. The Talmud asks why. God should give wisdom to the fool. The answer is that it would be a waste to give wisdom to a fool.'' **********''People might think,'' he added, ''that with the computer they won't have to study Jewish law anymore and that any fool can use it. No. You must be wise already to use it. It only gives wisdom to the wise.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/25/world/salvadoran-guerrillas-called-rigid-in-talks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 182, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Salvadoran Guerrillas Called Rigid in Talks", "print_headline": "Salvadoran Guerrillas Called Rigid in Talks", "body_text": " **********The State Department said today that El Salvador's rebels had adopted an inflexible position in peace talks with the Government, possibly reflecting ''an emerging dominance'' of the leftist military command over the more moderate political leaders. **********The assessment was in a 26-page report on the political, economic and social situation in El Salvador that the State Department submits every three months at the request of Congress. **********The report said that at the most recent talks, on Nov. 30, the rebels set forth a ''very hard-line proposal'' that, among other recommendations, called for an end to United States military support and advisers, the formation of a new government and the incorporation of the guerrillas into the Salvadoran Army. **********The report, which covers the period between Sept. 1 and Nov. 30, said the position of the rebels ''contrasted with the more flexible statements made by the political front in the United States, Latin America and Europe.'' **********The report went on: ''Their inflexibility may reflect an emerging dominance of the military comandantes over the political front.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/13/world/salvador-divided-by-election-united-by-weariness-of-war.html": {"writer_name": "Hedrick Smith", "pub_date": "1984-02-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2338, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SALVADOR, DIVIDED BY ELECTION, UNITED BY WEARINESS OF WAR", "print_headline": "SALVADOR, DIVIDED BY ELECTION, UNITED BY WEARINESS OF WAR", "body_text": " **********After five years of guerrilla warfare, El Salvador is now hovering in precarious uncertainty, its people worried about a divisive election campaign, unsure about future United States aid and weary of the destruction wrought by the civil war. **********That is the opinion offered by Salvadoran politicians, some senior Salvadoran military officers, United States Embassy officials and other Westerners here. **********''The feeling here is the same as in the States - fatigue with the war,'' said Jose Napoleon Duarte, the Christian Democratic Party's candidate for president in elections scheduled for March 25. **********Discouragement on Both Sides **********''I was in the eastern part of the country recently and a young army commander asked me, 'Senor Duarte, how long do you think this war is going to last? One year? Three years?' I told him, 'At least three years.' He shook his head and said, 'I feel it's too much.' '' **********''On both sides, there is discouragement,'' Mr. Duarte said. ''The left has gotten discouraged because they can't advance. They can't get the support of the people. On our side, there is also discouragement because of the destruction, the bad economy, the unemployment, and the displacement of so many people.'' **********Within the Salvadoran Government and the United States Embassy, officials say they draw some encouragement from what appears to have been a decline in right-wing death squad killings and what they regard as improvements in the Salvadoran military command structure. **********Hope for Economic Recovery **********They assert hopefully that the Salvadoran economy, after a 25 percent decline in the past four years, should have a modest recovery this year if the world economy improves. Similarly, they voice the hope that the nation's first presidential election in seven years will produce a new leader with a popular mandate. **********But they acknowledge anxieties, most of all about the war. Despite a lull in the past six weeks and a pledge by a guerrilla spokesman in Mexico City on Thursday not to disrupt the elections, many people are braced for attacks before the voting. Late last year, guerrilla forces showed a greater capacity than before for mounting large-scale attacks and a greater willingness to stand and fight Government troops. **********So far, the current election campaign has not generated the kind of public optimism, especially about ending the war, that surrounded the 1982 elections for a Consituent Assembly, which the left boycotted. **********None of the major candidates talk openly about peace negotiations. Indeed, the political polemics between the right-wing candidate, Roberto d'Aubuisson, a former major in the Salvadoran Army, and the left-of-center Christian Democrats now worries other politicians and United States diplomats. **********''There's a lot of uncertainty about the conditions that will exist after the elections,'' a United States official said. The risk, he said, is that the schism between the right and Mr. Duarte, reflecting a decade-old antagonism, is producing ''an election campaign so rough that it would be difficult to put a ruling coalition together in the end.'' **********Officially, the armed forces, often a determining force in Salvadoran politics, has adopted a stance of neutrality and has even forsworn the right to vote. But Salvadoran politicians from both the left and right predict that there will be a military coup if the election results displease the armed forces.   Predict New Terrorism **********Mr. Duarte himself predicted that if he won, the right wing would seek to cause political chaos with a new round of terrorism in the hope of provoking a military takeover. **********But other politicians, like Ricardo Castaneda, a lawyer with close ties to the Provisional President, Alvaro Magana, said the military was more likely to intervene if the election were won by Mr. d'Aubuisson, who has been linked to the death squads, for fear that his taking office would prompt a cutoff of United States aid. **********United States officials, wanting a broad-based government, talk as if they would most favor a coalition of the Christian Democrats, the nation's largest party that polled 40 percent of the vote in 1982, and the National Conciliation Party, an old-line conservative party that has traditionally represented El Salvador's landlords and fought against the Christian Democrats, who have promoted land redistribution programs. **********The National Conciliation Party's candidate is Francisco Jose Guerrero, a former president and former foreign minister, whom United States Embassy officials regard as more of a conciliatory figure than either Mr. Duarte or Mr. d'Aubuisson.   Campaign Halts Peace Effort **********Whatever the outcome, the campaign itself has brought some important activities to a standstill. The Government's peace commission has essentially suspended its efforts to open contacts with the rebel coalition known as the Faribundo Marti National Liberation Front. **********Land redistribution, pressed by Mr. Duarte in an earlier term as head of a civilian-military junta, is now intended by the provisional Government to win political support among the peasantry. But the progrm has bogged down in administrative tangles, credit problems, lawsuits by former landowners contesting appropriation of their property, and what some peasant leaders like Samuel Maldinado, Secretary General of the National Union of Peasants, contend has been deliberate sabotage by officials in the land redistribution agency put into office by the right-wing National Republican Alliance Party of Mr. d'Aubuisson. **********In the face of pressure from the Reagan Administration and criticism from Democrats in the United States Congress and others, political terrorism by the right-wing death squads appears to have tapered off in recent months, though Salvadorans who monitor the human rights situation fear they will return once Congress approves more aid for El Salvador. **********Maria Julia Hernandez, who heads the human rights office of the Roman Catholic archdiocese, reports that death squad murders fell from 116 last August to 25 in December and that disappearances of people who were reported by their families to have been captured by security forces fell from 91 in September to 27 in January.   Civilian Deaths Remain High **********But the trend for all civilian deaths caused by Government forces, including army-inflicted casualties in combat zones, was no better last year than in 1982, she said. In 1982, Mrs. Hernandez gave that total figure as 5,339 compared to 5,142 in 1983. **********''In terms of death squads, it is evident that there has been an improvement numerically,'' Mrs. Hernandez said. ''But qualitatively there has been no improvement. Terrorization of the people continues. People don't expect any improvement after the election from any of the candidates. **********''They hope for some kind of justice,'' she said, ''but who is going to administer justice in El Salvador today? **********The economy also poses daunting problems. By various estimates unemployment ranges from 25 to 40 percent, or from 500,000 to nearly 900,000 of the nation's 2.2 million work force. The United States Embassy estimates that the disruption of war and the flight of capital abroad has been so severe that only about half of the industrial capacity of the nation is being used.   240,000 Refugees **********Church and Government agencies estimate that roughly 240,000 refugees have fled their homes because of the war and now live in refugee camps or ''marginales,'' squatter settlements that occupy sections of San Salvador and other cities, often next to some of the most elegant residences of El Salvador's wealthy land aristocracy. **********In 1979, El Salvador was enjoying a modest economic boom and showed a favorable foreign trade balance. But last year, imports were just over $1 billion and exports of cotton, coffee, sugar, shrimp and other products were $870 million. United States economic aid totalling $240 million helped narrow the trade gap and offset debt service of about $156 million. **********With the Reagan Administration contmplating a jump to more than $350 million in economic aid to El Salvador this year, some critics have contended that the country cannot absorb that much aid without an increase in inflation or rampant corruption. But United States Embassy officials disagree. **********''You're talking about restoring what was already there,'' said one embassy economic specialist. ''The Salvandorans have the training and the capacity. You're trying to build them back to where they were. If an economy is down 25 percent and we assume some population growth, that means a one- third drop in the standard of living. That's a long way down and it's a long way back up. So they can absorb the aid. You know they can handle it because they were at that level once.'' **********''It all depends on how we use it,'' said Ricardo Gonzalez Camacho, a Democratic Action Party deputy in the Assembly and a former specialist at the Central American Common Market office in Guatemala.   Exiles Return From Miami **********Like other businessmen, he reports some returning confidence, citing the return to San Salvador of some exiles from Miami and a slight rise in the value of the Salvadoran currency. **********But Mr. Camacho, like others, cites the civil war as the vital question mark blocking important new growth. **********''Just by having elections and having a new government, our problems will not disappear,'' he said. ''Whoever wins the election, his first task is to pacify the country. We can't go on like this for another five years.'' **********The most worrisome trend, according to United States Embassy and Salvadoran military officers, is that the scale of the civil war has risen over the past five years, an unfavorable sign for the Salvadoran Army.   Guerrilla Forces Increase **********The guerrilla forces have risen from a combat strength of between 3,000 and 5,000 in 1980 to 10,000 to 12,000 today, one official said. Over the same period, the Salvadoran security forces rose from about 17,000 to 38,000. **********Because such a large proportion of the Salvadoran Army and militia are tied down to defending Government buildings, bridges, power stations and other installations, the actual combat forces in the field are roughly equal, especially in the sharply contested provinces of eastern El Salvador, according to Lieut. Col. Domingo Monterosa, the army's Third Brigade commander based in San Miguel. **********Last Sept. 3, before he took over that garrison, the guerrilla forces massed 1,000 or more troops for an assault on San Miguel, a city of about 30,000 people, and pinned army forces down inside their garrison before withdrawing. **********In all, they mounted 75 attacks against towns and municipalities between September and December. Three times, guerrilla forces of 400 to 500 men each routed Salvadoran Army battalions - at Tenancingo in October, El Tablon in November, and Cacuatique in mid-December. At year'd end, they overran the army garrison at El Paraiso and blew up a bridge on Pan- American Highway at Cuscatlan. **********''They've improved their coordination among their armies and they mass much better,'' one senior United States official said of the guerrillas. **********''The subversives have succeeded to a certain degree in grouping their people together,'' agreed Colonel Monterosa, who was interviewed Friday during a nine-day field operation near the town of Chinomeka, where a guerrilla force entered boldly last weekend and showed propaganda movies on a video cassette recorder and put on a satirical anti-Government skit. **********''They're interested in extending their control down from the north close to San Miguel to improve their supply lines in Morazan Province,'' said the Colonel. ''We have been out here on a sweep since Sunday looking for the 'Z' brigade, one of their elite units.''  Rebels Hold 20 Percent of Country **********Overall, guerrilla forces are estimated to dominate or control the northern portions of Morazan, San Miguel, San Vicente and Chalatenango Provinces and the Pacific littoral of La Union and Usulutan Provinces, adding up to roughly 20 percent of the country, according to military officials. **********Yet the war seems distant in cities like San Salvador and San Miguel, where provincial buses run to outlying towns and the market square bustles with activity that seems little disturbed by the combat though it is frequently no more than 12 miles away. **********Life in the capital has an unreal air. It is a crazy patchwork of Salvadoran businessmen and Government officials lunching peacefully by the pool on the tree-shaded terrace of the Sporting Club and private squads of bodyguards racing around town in Cherokee Jeep station wagons, specially fitted with steel armorplating in the doors, one- inch-thick plastic windows and windshields, four-wheel-drive and heavy- tread tires.

Hayes, publisher, disclosed yesterday that he was bringing in Gilbert Rogin, his former associate at Sports Illustrated, where he is managing editor, to replace Leon Jaroff, the managing editor of Discover and the man given much credit for its concept. Yesterday Mr. Jaroff was named to the new post of science editor of Time magazine. **********Mr. Hayes is the magazine's third publisher and has been an ad salesman almost since joining Time's Sports Illustrated 23 years ago. He is obviously in the job because Time Inc.'s leadership saw the Discover problem as an advertising one. **********It made its debut with 400,000 circulation and it is now at 935,000, the biggest in the science field. And until this year, advertising pages and revenues kept increasing. **********Then came 1984, and Mr. Hayes said he expects ad pages to be down 15.3 percent from last year, to 431, from 509, and the Publishers Information Bureau estimates its revenues to be down to $10.4 million, from $11.8 million. The decline was already apparent in the first quarter, and Mr. Hayes was brought in in July. **********Discover's showing will be the poorest in the field in which only Scientific American and Omni have showed gains, while Science '84 and Science Digest have also been down. **********The field is an unusual one in magazine publishing, Mr. Hayes said, because it does not have a natural advertising support group. The closest thing to one is the computer industry, and that is not turning out to be so big a magazine advertiser as forecast. **********''Our cost per thousand was too high,'' the publisher said. ''Our out of pocket was too high. We were too expensive.'' **********To encourage advertiser action - and he is convinced it will - Mr. Hayes in January is reducing the cost per thousand of a black-and-white page based on audience to $12, from $18. For a four-color page, the cost will go to $21, down from $30. The black-and-white page rates will drop to $10,965, from $17,230, and the four- color to $15,905, from $24,990. **********To sweeten the pot further for regular customers, there will be a ''revenue renewal program,'' which will give a further 5 percent discount to advertisers who repeat their 1984 schedules in 1985. **********''We're going to sell 200 more pages of advertising next year, I'm positive,'' Mr. Hayes said. **********With the idea that the reader should be helping with more of the costs, the cover price is going to $2.50, from $2, and the subscription rate to $24, from $22, while the circulation rate base is to be cut to 850,000, from 935,000. **********Other cost-cutting measures will be small ones, like the paper stock's moving to 40 pound from 45 pound. Cutting the trade promotion advertising is pretty dramatic, even though the budget to get advertisers to advertise was less than $1 million, spent through Young & Rubicam. **********Mr. Hayes could immediately give an example of what was going to happen to his publication's efficiency rating as a result of the ad rate cuts. He pointed to a computer read-out of the Simmons Market Research Bureau syndicated research that ranked publications by the cost of reaching each 1,000 of its audience - not merely purchasers, but all readers. In total audience as well as in males aged 18 to 30 and 25 to 49, Discover moves out of the area where most of its competitors are grouped and closer to the top of the list. **********Mr. Hayes is a son of James V. Hayes, an active partner in the Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Irvine law firm at 85. The younger Mr. Hayes grew up in Manhattan, graduated from the Canterbury School and Georgetown University and went right to work for Time, most of the time with Sports Illustrated, selling, selling, selling, in New York, Philadelphia, Detroit and back to New York, before being named ad sales director of Money, a major Time success story, and was there when he discovered Discover. **********Time Inc.'s other magazines are, of course, Time, Life, Fortune and People.

Davis, who made a profit of $32,329 on his purchase of 15,000 chares of Campbell, according to the S.E.C.'s complaint, also recommended the stock to Hugh Sconyers. Mr. Sconyers, who the S.E.C. listed as a potential witness, was described by the commission as ''a private investor, rare coin dealer, competitive backgammon player'' in Los Angeles. Mr. Sconyers bought 3,000 shares. **********Mr. Davis also recommended the purchase of Campbell to James Halperin, who purchased 4,000 shares. ''Four other backgammon players who are friends of Davis, Sconyers, or Halperin purchased 15,000'' shares of Campbell, according to yesterday's filing. **********Another transaction about which the filing disclosed more details involved the acquisition of the Bendix Corporation by the Allied Corporation. Mr. Thayer was a member of the Allied board of directors. **********The merger of the two companies also involved Martin Marietta and United Technologies, both of which made tender offers for Bendix. **********'Uniquely Positioned' **********Mr. Thayer, ''by reason of his membership on the board of directors of Allied and his friendship with the chairmen of Martin Marietta and United Technologies, Thomas Pownall and Harry Gray, respectively, was uniquely positioned to monitor the takeover battle,'' the S.E.C. said in its court papers yesterday. **********From Sept. 8 to Sept. 12, 1982, Mr. Thayer was in Wyoming ''attending the annual convocation of the Conquistadores del Cielo, a private club comprised of executives in the aerospace industry,'' the commission said in its papers yesterday. Mr. Pownall, who is president of the club, and Mr. Gray were also present part of the time, and Mr. Thayer talked with both of them about the merger, according to the commission. **********'Telephone Records' **********In addition, the commission said, ''telephone records reflect several calls between'' Mr. Thayer and an Allied vice president. **********On Sept. 20, Mr. Thayer, by telephone from Dallas, participated in an Allied board meeting called to discuss the purchase of Bendix. On that day, Mr. Davis, one of the defendants, purchased 10,000 shares of Bendix, according to yesterday's filing. **********Two days later, Mr. Thayer attended a meeting of the Busch board in St. Louis, then flew to New York for an Allied board meeting, at which the directors approved a tender offer for Bendix. **********After the meeting, Mr. Thayer left for Bethesda, Md., with Edward L. Hennessey Jr., chairman of Allied, and another of the witnesses listed in yesterday's filings. ''By midnight,'' the commission said in yesterday's filings, Mr. Hennessey and Mr. Pownall ''agreed to a stock exchange transaction to facilitate the Allied tender offer for Bendix.'' **********30 Minutes Before Halt **********Less than 30 minutes before trading in Bendix was halted on Sept. 22, Mr. Harris, the Dallas broker, purchased 38,200 shares of Bendix for his own account as well as for his customers, including Mrs. Ryno, Miss Williams and Mr. Schroder. The aggregate net profit on these transactions was approximately $694,000, according to the S.E.C. **********Yesterday's filings also provide details about how Mr. Thayer, according to the S.E.C., benefited an insurance company owner, Fred Wison ''who had 'hired' Ryno as an insurance agent.'' **********Mrs. Ryno had been a receptionist with the LTV Corporation during part of the time that Mr. Thayer was chief executive officer and chairman of the Dallas-based company. **********According to yesterday's filing, Mr. Wilson purchased 6,000 shares of LTV stock one day before the company announced the reinstatement of its quarterly cash dividend policy, and record fourth-quarter earnings. **********Mrs. Ryno and Mr. Schroder also purchased LTV stock before the public announcements. And Mr. Thayer's daughter, Brynn Thayer, who lives in New York, also purchased shares through Mr. Harris, according to yesterday's filings."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/11/business/advertising-accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 16, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": " Accounts", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING;  Accounts", "body_text": " **********GEICO (Government Employees Insurance Company), Washington, to Doremus Direct for all auto insurance programs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/20/business/bertelsmann-venture.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bertelsmann Venture", "print_headline": "Bertelsmann Venture", "body_text": " **********Bertelsmann A.G. said today that it was negotiating with three major American film companies on a joint pay-television project in West Germany.

It **********cut its staff to save money on payroll. It trimmed its size to save money on paper. **********Considering all that, things look rosy this year (one year after Ebony made the list of hottest magazines) - the year its parent company, the Johnson Publishing Company, was ranked the No. 1 American black- owned business, and the year its founder/president, John H. Johnson, can trace his life with pride ''from the Chicago welfare rolls to the Forbes 400.'' That's the list of wealthiest Americans. **********And this was the pleasant climate that prevailed when the company decided to prepare for the magazine's 40th anniversary next year with a $1 million advertising trade campaign this year. It is the biggest such effort for Ebony since the 1960's. **********''We want to get talked about,'' Mr. Johnson said here the other day on a visit from Chicago headquarters. ''We want chief executive officers to ask their ad managers, 'What is this Ebony I keep hearing about?' '' **********Well, they will have a hard time missing those full-page ads with the big, bold graphics from Uniworld Group. And the new theme line, ''Nothing sells black consumers better.'' **********The campaign is running in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal as well as papers in Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles, and a long list of trade publications not only aimed at the advertising business, but also the businesses in which Ebony would like to increase its billings: liquor, automotive and consumer electronics. **********''We think we should be doing better,'' Mr. Johnson said, ''and we are trying to inform companies and agencies about opportunities missed by not making a special appeal to black consumers. Black people are begging for recognition and respect.'' **********Most of Ebony's advertising campaign takes on television. One ad in particular - with the headline ''Some people think all it takes is a black face to sell a black mind'' - talks about so-called black shows on TV where ''the faces are black but the shows are not.'' **********''This doesn't endear your commercial to blacks,'' the ad continues. ''In fact, many blacks see red while watching television.'' **********There was no popular television around when Mr. Johnson started Ebony in 1945. The magazine was upbeat and positive then, and it is upbeat and positive now - full of role models, people who made it within the system. **********''We want everything we do and see and publish to say something good about us and make us feel uplifted,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''That's why Jesse Jackson was so successful.'' With Mr. Johnson was Jeff Burns Jr., vice president, director of special projects, and a former agency man. In advance of the boss's arrival, Mr. Burns said of him: ''He's sort of the godfather of black advertising. The captain of the industry.'' **********The captain's flagship publication - with a circulation of more than 1.6 million, up from 1.3 million in 1980 - ran more than 906 pages of advertising in the first 10 months of the year, an increase of 4.2 percent from the same period in 1983. **********The magazine is a well-enough recognized advertising medium for its founder to say: ''If I don't sell an account, I don't think it's race any more. I think maybe I didn't sell well enough.'' **********But it frequently takes a little extra for Ebony to get on an advertiser's media schedule. **********''Our first automotive ad was from Chrysler when they were in trouble,'' Mr. Johnson remembered. ''When they were trying a comeback, they reached out to all markets. So we look for people who are in trouble.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/05/business/market-place-stock-choices-from-midwest.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1984-01-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 732, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STOCK CHOICES FROM MIDWEST", "print_headline": "MARKET PLACE; STOCK CHOICES FROM MIDWEST", "body_text": " **********O NE increasingly popular approach to investing is to pick companies doing a substantial amount of business abroad. The expectation is that the strong dollar will eventually weaken, and that this, in turn, will increase corporate profits after adjustments for currency translations. **********But do not count Elliott L. Schlang, a senior vice president of Prescott, Ball & Turben Inc. in Cleveland, among advocates of this strategy. ''I now avoid companies with significant foreign exposure,'' he said. ''There are enough unpredictable factors in buying any stock so that I want to immunize myself from possible risks overseas.'' **********Nearly three years ago, Mr. Schlang initiated the Great Lakes Review, wherein he recommends companies in his own backyard, so to speak, by concentrating on opportunities in the Great Lakes region. This consists mainly of selecting companies based in Ohio, Indiana and Michigan, as well as western Pennsylvania and western New York. **********So far, he has selected 29 stocks and, by and large, they have performed well. But Moog Inc., a producer of electrohydraulic control systems that does part of its business abroad, was the stock that convinced Mr. Schlang he should concentrate on investments without foreign exposure. **********''We added Moog to our list in March 1981 at a price of $19 and later recommended its sale in November 1982 at $14, which meant a drop of 26 percent,'' he related. ''At the time of the sale recommendation, we cited the unpredictability of the company's earning power because of fluctuations in foreign currencies.'' **********As it turns out, Moog's price has improved in the interim. On the American Stock Exchange yesterday, it closed at $17.50, up 12.5 cents. **********Eight other issues have been removed for various reasons from recommendations made in the Great Lakes Review. But the only other issue to show a decline was Union Metal Manufacturing, whose price dropped 40 percent between the purchase and sale recommendations. ''We removed this stock for two reasons - because of its small capitalization of slightly more than one million shares and because of the company's deteriorating earnings outlook,'' Mr. Schlang said. **********In picking stocks, he concentrates on medium- sized growth companies with a minimum of $100 million in market capitalization and the ability to finance expansion with internally generated funds. ''I look for companies which succeed in some specialty niche,'' he said. **********Two issues were removed from the regional list simply because their annual revenues exceeded $500 million. One was The Limited Inc., a specialty retailer of women's apparel, after the price of the stock climbed fourfold. The other was the Alltel Corporation, formerly Mid-Continent Telephone, following a 47 percent gain in the price of the stock. **********General Nutrition and Zurn Industries were recommended for sale because of a perceived slowdown in earnings or sales momentum. Before it went off the list, General Nutrition's stock climbed 125 percent, while Zurn was up 42 percent. **********Cooper Tire and Rubber was recommended for sale - due to a slowdown in earnings momentum - after its stock price had doubled. And Fabri-Centers of America was dropped after 14 months due to a ''flat sales outlook,'' according to Mr. Schlang. Its price gained 82 percent in this period. **********Some of the best-performing recommendations in the Great Lakes Review have included Dollar General, which operates self-service discount stores, and Philips Industries, a producer of motor homes and recreation vehicles. Another stalwart has been Hillenbrand Industries, a leading manufacturer of coffins, hospital supplies and luggage. **********''For new commitments at current prices,'' Mr. Schlang said yesterday, ''I would emphasize Phillips Industries, along with such stocks as American Sterilizer, Health Care and Retirement Corporation of America, Gibson Greetings and International Clinical Laboratories.'' **********The latest addition to the Great Lakes Review was Wolverine World Wide Inc. on Nov. 30, 1983, at a price of $15.75. The company primarily makes casual footwear, sold mostly under the Hush Puppies name. ''This is my first recommendation of a turnaround situation,'' the Prescott, Ball & Turben executive said. ''Normally, I hate turnarounds, because they often turn the wrong way and get even worse. But I took comfort from the fact that the stock was selling at half of its record high and had dipped below book value. So I thought it was worth the risk.''

The move ended a monthlong deadlock with the House of Representatives, which opposed the $21 million in aid being channeled to the insurgents through the Central Intelligence Agency as immoral and counterproductive. **********The spending bill, for a total of $1.1 billion, now goes to President Reagan, who is expected to sign it. **********The House Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., was jubilant. ''The Senate's action should bring to a close U.S. support for the war in Nicaragua,'' he said.   Supporters Vote for Deletion **********Since it was evident that the bill would be deadlocked as long as it contained money for the Nicaraguan rebels, even those supporting aid voted to delete the money rather than get themselves in a position of seeming to oppose summer jobs. **********Supporters and opponents of aid to the Nicaraguan insurgents, who are seeking to overthrow the Sandinista Government in Managua, agreed that the action might mean the end of the aid program in the face of dwindling Senate support and overwhelming opposition in the House. **********But the Republican leaders of the Senate pledged to revive the issue and said the rebels had sufficient supplies to last until Oct. 1, the beginning of the fiscal year 1985. **********The Administration has given different estimates on how long supplies will last. The suggestion of Repulican Senate leaders is that new efforts could be made to continue the aid in an appropriations bill for the next fiscal year.   Bill Seemed to Favor Aid Item **********The spending bill had seemed to favor supporters of aid to the Nicaraguan rebels since it linked the aid to several social programs sought by liberals. The supporters of aid to the insurgents argued that it was vital to prevent Central America from becoming Communist. **********Majority Leader Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee told the Senate the Administration now accepted the elimination of the Nicaraguan item. Critics of the aid said the White House had merely bowed to the inevitable. **********Senator Baker told supporters not to be disheartened. **********''Keep your powder dry, fight this fight where you have got a chance to win,'' he said.  But Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who opposed aid to the Nicaraguan insurgents, said: **********''This is a historic day, the day the tide was turned against the secret war in Nicaragua. In the effort to end this war, this Administration has finally blinked.'' A supporter of the aid program, Senator John East, Republican of North Carolina, told the Senate: **********''I have been here long enough to know what all these code words mean. It is over. It means there will be no more aid. **********''The most fundamental issue facing the nation and this Congress,'' he added, ''is whether we allow Central America to fall under Communist domination and control. This is a skillful way of deep-sixing this particular provision. Every bit of moral fiber in my being tells me it is wrong, wrong, wrong. It is morally wrong and geopolitically disastrous.'' **********With the advent of summer, senators said they had felt pressure from constituents who feared that the Nicaraguan issue, by holding up the spending bill, could mean that summer youth jobs would not be available. **********In addition, bipartisan Senate support for the program ended last week when Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who had previously supported aid, reversed their position. **********Meanwhile, Democrats accused President Reagan of blocking the money for summer youth jobs by linking it to assistance to the Nicaraguan insurgents, or contras, as they are called. Republicans feared that continued delay could become a campaign issue. **********Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia Democrat, the minority leader, said, ''Here we are already into the summer, and because of the Administration resistance to linking the two, some people are not going to get jobs.'' **********Senator Kennedy called the Administration's position ''unconscionable'' and said: **********''It is a disgrace that the Administration would tell the U.S. Senate that in order to provide jobs for urban teenagers, we had to send guns and bullets to the contras in Nicaragua.'' **********Aides to the House Democratic leadership indicated that they would accept the Republican position and not press for an explicit ban on aid, which has already passed by the House. The Administration objects to an explicit prohibition. **********The summer youth job funds would be in addition to $724 million already appropriated and would provide 100,000 summer jobs in addition to the 724,000 jobs previously financed. **********The spending bill also contains $545 million for child nutrition programs and $300 million for the Women, Infant and Children's program.

But, in some quarters, the robust growth statistics sparked worries that interest rates could be on the rise - even before March is over. **********First the Government reported that personal income grew 1.1 percent from December to January and that during the same period, personal spending grew 1.2 percent, housing starts surged 15 percent and retail sales climbed 2.2 percent. **********Then the Federal Reserve reported last Thursday that M-1, the basic money-supply measure, had jumped $2.5 billion, compared with an expected $1.8 billion. **********Surveying the scene, Kenneth Froewiss, financial economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said that ''all the pieces are falling together,'' increasing the odds that interest rates will go up sometime in the next month. **********But Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., doesn't foresee any change in Fed policy to boost rates in the near future. ''I don't expect the Fed to take any action because of one month's round of statistics,'' he said. Anyway, he added, the lags in M-2 and M-3 - broader measures than M-1 - are telling the monetary authorities not to tighten. **********No Bear Market in Options **********If the recent break in the stock market run-up proved anything, it was that more small investors are now doing their buying and selling in the stock options markets instead. With options, many investors apparently have found that they can not only protect their portfolios from a decline but also profit from one. **********In recent weeks, for example, stock options volume has averaged 760,000 contracts a day, compared with about 637,000 early last month. Because each option is for 100 shares, that means the equivalent of 76 million shares are traded each day on the nation's four stock options markets - the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and the American, Philadelphia and Pacific stock exchanges.  ''During the recent market decline, many small investors used the options to either hedge their portfolios or as an economical means of selling stocks short,'' says Harrison Roth, senior options strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert.  For example, selling 100 shares of I.B.M. short at, say, $110 a share would require a cash outlay of $5,500 (at 50 percent margin) plus commission, Mr. Roth notes. ''But for $550 plus commission, the investor can buy the right to sell that stock short up to mid-October,'' he says, ''or, for that matter, the right to buy it at $110 until mid-October.'' **********A Rise in Goods That Last **********Orders for durable goods are expected to show an increase of about 1.1 percent for January - about the size of last December's drop - when the Government announces the figures on Thursday. But not all industry sectors are expected to contribute to the gain. **********''We expect a strong rise in January non-defense durable goods orders, but most of the gain will be in the short lead-time items such as hand tools,'' says Steven J. Colbert, who monitors durable goods orders for Prudential- Bache Securities in San Francisco. ''We'll also see orders up for industrial items that wear quickly, such as oil and other drilling bits.'' **********His partner in New York, Mitchell I. Quain, agrees that companies are still holding off making major long- term commitments for heavy industrial durable goods. ''The orders will come after they have more sales on their books,'' he says, and the sales outlook is mixed. **********January farm machinery sales could be down 10 to 15 percent on a year-to-year basis, Mr. Quain says, but construction machinery sales may be up 5 to 10 percent.  Strategic Leasing **********Because the next best thing to using other people's money is using their property, the leasing industry has flourished in recent years. Today, a third of all automobiles and an even higher percentage of the trucks, railroad cars and aircraft produced are leased to users. **********In fact, transportation is the major industry serviced by leasing companies, followed by companies that lease computers, word processors and other office equipment. **********But Susan K. Skinner, leasing industry analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, now finds that the fastest- growing leasing sector serves dentists, doctors, hospitals and industrial users of high-technology equipment. They, too, seek to conserve capital and get bigger tax write-offs through leasing, Miss Skinner says. **********Still, someone has to buy the equipment in order to lease it to others. And the leasing companies, for their part, ''finance their equipment by selling a combination of equity and short- and long-term debt,'' she adds."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/27/business/excerpts-from-argentine-imf-text.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1038, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXCERPTS FROM ARGENTINE-I.M.F. TEXT", "print_headline": "EXCERPTS FROM ARGENTINE-I.M.F. TEXT", "body_text": " **********Following are excerpts from a Memorandum of Understanding between Argentina and the International Monetary Fund as released by Argentina : **********The constitutional Government that assumed office on Dec. 10, 1983, was faced with an extremely difficult economic situation, which was the result of years of economic mismanagement characterized by frequent turns in the orientation of policies. **********The Government is convinced that restoration of satisfactory economic performance and sustained growth will not be possible unless inflation is brought under control and external imbalances are corrected. A lasting economic expansion requires a revival of private investment. In turn, a revival of investment requires a marked reduction of the uncertainty generated by high and rising inflation. **********In recent weeks, the Government has been reassessing its economic policies in light of the experience of the past several months and has decided to strengthen the anti-inflation policies. The authorities have designed a plan aimed at reducing inflation progressively to no more than 300 percent in the year ending in September 1985 and to an annual rate of approximately 150 percent during the last quarter of that year. **********Monthly Wage Adjustments **********The Government is aware that attainment of the inflation objective referred to in the previous paragraph will require a major slowing in the pace of increase in costs, including nominal wages. Given the prevailing high rate of inflation, for the time being the Government will continue to decree wage adjustments for the public and private sector on a monthly basis, with catch-up increases from time to time to provide a measure of protection for real wages. **********The size of the monthly and catch- up wage increases and the length of the period between catch-up adjustments will be determined with a view to insuring that they are consistent with the Government's price objectives. **********It is the intention of the Government to apply the price controls flexibly in order to avoid adverse consequences for private investment and economic growth and with a view to preventing the emergency of shortages. **********Measures to Be Phased Out **********Controls will be progressively phased out as inflationary expectations become less volatile and competitive conditions in the economy are improved with the liberalization of the import system. It is expected that the emergency measures introduced in September will be eliminated before the end of the year. **********The Government is convinced that, if inflation is to be curbed, the deficit of the public sector will have to be brought down markedly. Accordingly, the Government has designed a fiscal plan that would reduce the cash deficit of the nonfinancial public sector to 8.1 percent of the gross domestic product in 1984. Furthermore, it is the intention of the Government to bring the deficit down to 5.4 percent of G.D.P. in 1985. **********The expenditure policy contained in the budget proposal now being considered by the Congress allows for a reallocation of resources, with military expenses being cut back while outlays for social services, health, housing and education are expanded.   Shifting Burden to Provinces **********It is expected that the provinces will rely increasingly on their own sources of revenue to meet their requirements; accordingly, Treasury transfers to the provinces would be substantially reduced in 1984 and 1985. **********Notwithstanding the efforts to control expenditure, it is probable that there will be a pickup in the ratio of expenditure to G.D.P. following approval of the budget by the National Congress. **********In preparing the budget proposal for 1985, the Government will aim at rolling back further the relative weight of government expenditure in the economy, with the intention of containing the ratio of general government spending to G.D.P. to no more than 32 percent in the first half of the year and of bringing it down to no more than 31 percent in the second half. **********Acting to Curb Tax Evasion **********The improvement in the fiscal position that is being projected for 1984 results from tax measures that are expected to have a total revenue-raising effect equivalent to some 4 percentage points of G.D.P. by the end of the year. The Government also is giving high priority to a tightening of tax administration procedures to curb tax evasion. **********To achieve the Government's inflation and balance-of-payments objectives, there must be a sustained reduction in the rate of growth of credit and money. As part of this policy, the rate of expansion of M-4 for the month of September was targeted at 14 percent, compared with rates of adjustment in other key policy variables of 16 percent. **********Argentina has already achieved a major adjustment in its external accounts, as is evidenced by the shift in the balance of goods and nonfactor services from a deficit of U.S. $3 billion in 1980 to a surplus of U.S. $3 billion in 1983. **********Over that period, however, interest on the external debt rose from about U.S. $2 billion to almost U.S. $5.5 billion, and the current account has remained in deficit.  Restraint in New Borrowing **********Upon taking office in December 1983, the Government was faced with an external debt of U.S. $45.5 billion, an amount equivalent to two-thirds of G.D.P.

As part of the export-oriented strategy, the import duty on fertilizers has been lowered, a significant step toward reducing the cost/ price distortions that restrain the expansion of agriculture in Argentina. **********Moreover, the Government is encouraging the formation of trading companies so as to promote the growth of industrial exports.

The prisoners are believed to number between 6,000 and 15,000. **********In the past the Administration reacted skeptically to the proposal by Hanoi. But at the urging of refugee groups, some members of Congress and some high-ranking American officials, Washington is said to have decided in principle to test Vietnam's sincerity and to be forthcoming in seeking the release of the prisoners. **********'No One More Deserving' **********''I personally feel that there is almost no one more deserving of admission to the United States as a refugee than the people who are suffering in prison because of their past association with us,'' said Paul D. Wolfowitz, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. ''Securing the release of these political prisoners is one of the foremost goals of the U.S. refugee program.'' **********Officials said in interviews today and earlier this week that details of the new American approach were being worked out so that they could be discussed by Secretary of State George P. Shultz when he meets with key Congressional committees on refugees on Sept. 11. **********On Aug. 10, 13 members of Congress, led by Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asian affairs, wrote to Mr. Reagan urging that the United States ''seize the initiative'' and ''send a clear signal to Vietnam that the United States is genuinely interested in freedom for those political prisoners'' by allocating 10,000 places for them and their families.  ''These political prisoners were people who worked for U.S. programs in Vietnam,'' the letter said. ''Computer programmers, drivers, language teachers, officials of the former Republic of Vietnam, officers of the army, policemen and Catholic, Buddhist and other clergy. These are people who were left behind in the evacuation when the war ended or who stayed behind to save their families. In some sense, for those Vietnamese who have spent the last nine years in Communist prisons, the war has never ended.'' **********''We must find room for this small, clearly defined group which has a legitimate claim to our attention,'' the letter said. **********Offer by Foreign Minister **********In 1982, Nguyen Cao Thach, Vietnam's Foreign Minister, said his Government would release all the prisoners if the United States would take them. **********The offer was repeated last May by Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, who said in an interview in Newsweek magazine: ''We are quite prepared to allow all of those left in the camps to leave tomorrow for the United States, but the U.S. Government has rejected that suggestion. They prefer to leave these criminals free in Vietnam but not in the United States.'' **********The United States actually had not rejected the offer, but officials dealing with refugee matters had expressed the view publicly and privately that the Vietnamese were not sincere because they had not allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross into the camps and had not provided a list of the prisoners. Some senior officials still doubt the Vietnamese will live up to their offer, but are willing to test their sincerity in an effort to free the prisoners. **********After the Communist takeover of South Vietnam in 1975, the Vietnamese authorities set up a network of so- called ''re-education'' prison camps, mostly in the north, to which thousands of pro-American and other anti-Communist Vietnamese from the south were sent. At one time as many as 50,000 people were said to be in the camps, but Vietnamese authorities now say the number is closer to 10,000, and refugee experts believe the figure is between 6,000 and 15,000.   Conditions Said to Be Grim **********By all accounts, conditions for the prisoners are grim. The State Department's human rights report for this year said that those in the camps ''are regularly provided food rations below subsistence levels, denied medical care and assigned to hard labor.'' **********''Prisoners are punished severely for minor infractions of camp rules, for example, by several months' solitary confinement and by beatings,'' the report said. ''These practices result in acute suffering, permanent physical impairment and sometimes death.'' Information cited in the report was provided by former inmates who have made their way to the West. **********The United States has accepted about 700,000 refugees from Indochina since 1975, about half of the worldwide total of 1.4 million who have been settled abroad. It has taken about 50,000 a year in recent years, most of them former ''boat people'' who had made their way to Thailand and other countries. **********In recent months, in the aftermath of Prime Minister Dong's statement, refugee groups, members of Congress and some high officials in the Administration have said that the highest priority should now be given to freeing those in the ''re-education'' camps.   U.S. 'Impotence' Criticized **********On July 23, Roger P. Winter, director of the United States Committee for Refugees, wrote to President Reagan urging him ''to break through the impotence that has characterized U.S actions on this matter.'' In an interview today, Mr. Winter said he had proposed that the Administration set 10,000 immigration slots for camp inmates and their families in the fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1. This would be above the 50,000 already planned for Indochinese refugees.   List of Prisoners Requested **********Mr. Wolfowitz of the State Department wrote to Mr. Winter on Aug. 22 that the United States had always been ready to receive the camp inmates and had asked the International Committee of the Red Cross to seek a list from the Vietnamese of the prisoners they held. This was to no avail, he said. **********He said that although there was reason to doubt the ''good faith'' of the Vietnamese, ''I share your view that we should continue to make every effort to explore the possibility that the offer is genuine, and ideas such as yours are being given careful consideration as we develop our Fiscal Year 85 refugee admission proposals.'' **********''If the Vietnamese authorities would demonstrate a willingness to meet our reasonable procedural needs, we are confident that the Congress will readily authorize as many admission numbers as we need,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said. **********He expressed hope that the Vietnamese would begin freeing those who would be eligible for resettlement here, and would allow the Red Cross to have access to the camp prisoners.   Questions to Be Answered **********A senior official said today that among the questions for which answers needed to be found by Sept. 11, when Mr. Shultz testifies, is whether the United States should establish a set goal - such as the 10,000 advocated by Mr. Winter and Mr. Solarz's group - or leave the numbers open. There is some uncertainty on how to approach the Vietnamese - directly, or through the United Nations High Commisioner for Refugees or the International Committee of the Red Cross."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/12/business/phone-units-stock-offer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Phone Units' Stock Offer", "print_headline": "Phone Units' Stock Offer", "body_text": " **********Ameritech, the Middle Western regional telephone company, and the Southwestern Bell Corporation yesterday announced plans to offer shareholders who own fewer than 50 shares an opportunity to sell their stock at full market value without having to pay brokerage commissions. **********Ameritech, the parent of telephone companies in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio, said that shareholders of record on Sept. 28, 1984, holding fewer than 50 shares, are eligible for the offer. **********The offer begins Oct. 16 and ends Nov. 30.

Misurasata used to support the Sandinista Government but later joined the insurgents. **********Last month Mr. Rivera visited Nicaragua, where he met with Sandinista leaders and traveled to Indian villages where anti-Sandinista sentiment is reported to persist. **********Mr. Rivera said he hoped to reach a settlement of the problems of the Indians, who live on the Atlantic coast. **********But other rebel leaders criticized him for visiting Nicaragua.

COMPUTER", "print_headline": "CHALLENGE TO A.T.& T. COMPUTER", "body_text": " **********When the American Telephone and Telegraph Company introduces its entry in the personal computer market Tuesday, its biggest task may be to satisfy a horde of skeptics that it has not waded into battle with I.B.M. with the wrong machine at the wrong time. **********For the last week, pictures and detailed specifications of A.T.& T.'s newest computer, made for the telephone giant by Olivetti, have circulated broadly throughout the industry. **********While dealers, analysts and some big potential customers - some of whom have seen the machine - say they would hardly dismiss anything bearing the A.T.& T. label, most say they are disappointed that A.T.& T. did not make a bold stroke, a major technological advance that would set its products apart from those offered by the International Business Machines Corporation. **********''Their big shot at making it, we thought, was coming out with a machine that was different, a major step forward,'' said David Cook, chief financial officer of the United Personal Computer Corporation, who said he may not carry A.T.& T.'s entry in his 10 Computerland franchises in Connecticut and Massachusetts. He and others note that A.T.& T.'s machine is another slick- looking I.B.M.-compatible computer, although signficantly faster and a little more flexible. **********''Lord knows there are enough me- too products out there,'' Mr. Cook said. **********Moreover, other dealers and analysts say, A.T.& T. is coming to market just as demand for top-of-the-line personal computers appears to have slackened, and dealers' shelves are overflowing. **********''We've entered a time of consolidation in this industry,'' said David A. Norman, president of the nationwide Businessland chain. While he would not comment on the A.T.& T. product, he did say, ''To break into this industry today, you really have to be bold and daring.'' **********''On Tuesday, I think you will see that we have something very impressive to offer,'' a spokesman for the company responded. But he, like other A.T.& T. executives, declined to elaborate or respond to specific criticisms, until the computer is introduced next week. **********High-Speed Network **********To distinguish its computer, A.T.& T. is expected to play to its biggest strength - telecommunications. The company will likely demonstrate a machine that can easily be hooked up to a local area network, which links computers, printers and other peripheral devices at high speed. **********That could prove a big selling point in the office market, where A.T.& T. hopes to make its stand with its personal computer as well as the line of six larger computers, ranging in price from $10,000 to $340,000, that it started selling in late March. **********I.B.M. still appears to be struggling with a high-speed network for its own computers, and the company said last month that it may still be two to three years away from marketing such a system. **********Also, the early judgments on the new A.T.& T. machine may be overly harsh. At the core of the computer, for example, is the Intel 8086 microprocessor, which runs much faster than its cousin, the Intel 8088, used in the I.B.M. machine. As a result, recalculating a financial spreadsheet, for example, could take half the time on the A.T.& T. model - a savings of just a few seconds, but important to users who do a lot of ''number crunching.'' **********Better Graphics Cited **********The computer also reportedly has improved graphics, and a special feature in the software that enables it to draw on data from a bigger A.T.& T. system with just a few keystrokes. **********Most analysts expect the basic A.T.& T. model, with two disk drives, will sell for slightly less than I.B.M.'s new prices, which were reduced by up to 23 percent last week. That means a basic A.T.&T. model would sell for about $2600. **********Despite the improvements, those familiar with the machine say its overriding characteristic is its sameness with the I.B.M. PC. Its keyboard is nearly identical. And like other I.B.M.-compatibles - ITT and the Sperry Corporation, for example, have both recently introduced similar machines, also made by third-party manufacturers - it runs on the operating system I.B.M. made popular, MS-DOS. **********That and other characteristics mean it is possible to run on A.T.& T.'s computer virtually all the thousands of programs - financial spreadsheets, word processing packages and others - that have already been written for I.B.M. computers **********Vulnerable Position ''It's a choice they had to make, playing to the market's strength,'' said H. Paris Burstyn, an analyst for Arthur D. Little Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. But it is also an approach that may leave A.T.& T. vulnerable, analysts say. **********Unlike Apple Computer Inc., which refused to follow the I.B.M. lead when it introduced its Macintosh computer earlier this year, when I.B.M. zigs by cutting prices, or zags by upgrading its standard equipment, A.T.& T. - along with the other compatible manufacturers - will be forced follow, analysts say. **********But A.T.& T. had a chance to be very different - and elected not to. The other members of the A.T.& T. computer line use another operating system, called Unix, that the company's own Bell Laboratories began developing 15 years ago. **********The system - a fundamental program that acts as the computer's traffic cop - has been widely licensed and has proved popular because it enables the computer to perform numerous functions, often for many different users, at one time. **********Decision Not to Use Unix **********Many believe Unix will become an industry standard, usable on computers of all sizes, in the next five years. And although the move would be risky because few programs for personal computers have been written to run under Unix, if A.T.& T. had embraced the operating system for its new machine it would have positioned its computer at the cutting edge of the industry. **********''In the long run, it would have been a much better strategy,'' Mr. Cook said. **********According to one A.T.& T. insider, who insisted that he not be named, many of the company's executives argued that using Unix would have been better. ''I am sure it was a royal battle,'' said Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, an industry newsletter. ''What they ended up with was a no- decision decision that will make it hard for them to establish their own identity.'' **********In the most recent issue of Personal Computing magazine - which an A.T.& T. spokesman charged violated a nondisclosure agreement by putting its issues on the newsstands before the announcement - Jack M. Scanlon, vice president of computer systems for A.T.& T. Technologies, defended the decision not to use Unix. **********''On the low end Unix still has some problems to get fixed,'' he said, particularly to make it easy to use for those not familiar with computers. And he noted that A.T.& T. has already developed a ''bridge'' that allows its personal computers to exchange data with Unix machines, and indicated that with imminent improvements in chip technology, a desktop Unix machine would follow. **********Marketing May be Problem **********Compounding A.T.&T.'s problems are the issues of marketing and timing, and here the reviews are mixed. **********''A.T.& T. has never before had to be a marketing company, but I have been very impressed with the moves they have made,'' said Martin Mazner, vice president of marketing for Ashton-Tate, a major software manufacturer working with the telephone giant. **********Others note that late next week, the A.T.& T. machine is expected to be in hundreds of stores across the country, including its own own Phone Center stores."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/03/world/around-the-world-canadian-stunt-man-braves-niagara-falls.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 137, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Canadian Stunt Man Braves Niagara Falls", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Canadian Stunt Man Braves Niagara Falls", "body_text": " **********A 37-year-old professional stunt man survived the 176-foot drop over the Horseshow Falls today. **********Karel Soucek, a native of Czechoslovakia who lives in nearby Hamilton, was treated for minor cuts on his forehead at Greater Niagara General Hospital after his 150-pound barrel, equipped with a ship-to-shore communications system, was pulled to the bank on the Canadian side of the lower Niagara River. **********Mr. Soucek, who said he had spent $15,000 on the project, was charged with violating parks commission rules and is scheduled to appear in court here on July 11.

It has not reported its second-quarter results, expected to show a big loss. **********Even without the news from Continental, the quarter was not a cheerful one for most of the other top 15 banking companies either. As a group, their average annual rate of return on each $100 of total assets - a key measure of a banking company's basic profitability - dropped to 47 cents, or 14.5 percent below the average in the second quarter of 1983. (Continental was not included in this quarter's roundup.) **********''You look at the numbers, and they're not good - in fact, they're rotten,'' said Lawrence W. Cohn, first vice president and chief bank-stock analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds. **********The Security Pacific Corporation, consistently a strong performer, was an exception and took the No. 1 spot in this year's second quarter. Its strength reflected its strong base of domestic business and its relatively small reliance on foreign loans. **********But Security Pacific's quarter was not great. Its annual rate of return on assets, as at most of the other banks, declined from the comparable period of 1983 - to 68 cents per $100 of total assets, from 70 cents. **********Only the First Chicago Corporation showed a year-to-year increase in its return on assets, to 47 cents, from 43 cents. That was partly due to the fact that First Chicago bucked the trend and reported a $5.5 million increase in its trading-account profits. And a recent tightening of accounting rules relating to loans to Argentina had no effect on First Chicago's net income, unlike other banks. **********As another sign of a tough quarter, the 14 companies reported an average decline of 9.9 percent in per-share net income from 1983's second quarter. **********Analysts look at per-share net income rather than aggregate net income to find a truer picture of how a bank's common stockholders have been faring. In the latest quarter, for example, the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation reported that its aggregate net income declined 8.5 percent, while its earnings per common share dropped 29.5 percent. **********The difference reflects the pressure being applied on banks by the authorities and the markets to increase the shareholders' investments in the banks. This is to provide more protection to the banks' creditors, including depositors, and reflects the widespread concern about the sharp increases in problem loans.  The banks have acceded to these demands largely by selling common or preferred stock. Issuing new common stock dilutes the value of the existing outstanding shares. As a result, existing shareholders get a smaller portion of the aggregate net income, reducing per-share earnings unless aggregate net income rises enough to make up the difference. **********Dividends paid on preferred stock do not reduce aggregate net income but reduce the amount of profit available to common stockholders. **********This dilution of common shareholders' equity is a price the big banks have paid as a result of their huge problem loans - largely to Latin America. That dilution affects the prices of bank stocks, which have plummeted in recent months. **********Partly because of dilution and preferred dividends, in the second quarter only six of the 14 banks showed higher per-share income. **********Three bank holding companies reported fairly sharp declines. Aside from Manufacturers Hanover, which was down 29.5 percent, the BankAmerica Corporation dropped 29 percent (down 23 percent on an aggregate net-income basis), and the Mellon National Corporation declined 26.3 percent (down 19.7 percent on an aggregate net income basis). **********Manufacturers Hanover's per- share earnings were hurt on two counts: its large exposure to borrowing by Argentina, which reduced its aggregate second-quarter earnings by $21.4 million, to $73.7 million, and a substantial dilution of its common stockholders' equity as a result of 5 million new common shares issued in February and the dividend requirements on $250 million in preferred stock issued in May. **********J. David Barnes, Mellon's president and chief executive officer, attributed his bank's decline primarily to ''a substantial increase'' in the provision for possible credit losses as a result of substantial domestic loan growth. The provision for loan losses in the latest quarter amounted to $30.4 million, up from $9.7 million in the second quarter of 1983. **********BankAmerica said that the decline in its second-quarter earnings this year partly reflected special factors in last year's quarter that bolstered earnings then by about $30 million. Loans to Argentina also reduced net income by $5 million, it said. **********The biggest decline, however, was at the Crocker National Corporation, which was down 60.6 percent, to 28 cents a common share. But that looked good to some analysts because the California-based bank reported losses of $120.8 million, or $5.94 a share, in the first quarter of this year and $57.2 million, or $2.84 a share, in the fourth quarter of 1983. **********Earnings at several New York banks were sharply reduced by their bond and foreign-exchange trading activities.

But many took advantage of a provision in the tax law that gives them an additional four months until the day of reckoning. **********The provision grants an automatic extension, until Aug. 15, for the filing of 1983 tax returns, no questions asked. To obtain the delay, you would have had to file Form 4868, available at most Internal Revenue Service offices, by April 16. **********And what about those who just plain missed last Monday's deadline, and did not get an extension? **********''It would be best to get the return in as soon as possible, to reduce interest that would be due on any tax owed, plus a penalty,'' said Sidney Kess, director of tax policy and planning with the international accounting firm of Main Hurdman. **********Even if you have secured an extension, that merely lengthens the time allowed for filing a tax return, not for paying whatever tax is due. In fact, people who fail to pay at least 90 percent of the tax that they ultimately calculate they owe by the filing deadline are subject to a nondeductible penalty of half of 1 percent a month on the unpaid portion - in addition to interest on that portion, currently 11 percent a year, compounded daily. **********Despite the fact that they may wind up paying extra to the I.R.S. for the privilege of leisurely filing, millions of taxpayers are seeking extensions these days and the number is expected to increase. I.R.S. Commissioner Roscoe Egger recently noted that more taxpayers are discovering the tax code's extension provisions. **********Extension requests have risen from 1.3 million in 1976 to 3.4 million, or more than 3.5 percent of all individual returns filed in 1983, he said. During the current filing season, he added, the revenue service anticipates that extension requests will increase by about 200,000. **********Tax experts say there are several reasons for the growing use of extensions. Perhaps the single most important one is the tardiness of tax shelter managers in sending investors their K1 forms, which show the individual partners' share of such items as income (or loss) and various deductions and credits arising from the shelter. **********''People who are involved in tax shelters don't seem to get their partnership information until almost the filing deadline, and that makes it practically impossible to file their tax returns on time,'' said Leon M. Nad, national tax partner with the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse. This year, he said, general partners are even slower than usual because of confusion over how to comply with the I.R.S.'s tough new rules on shelters. **********Another reason for the popularity of extensions is the extra time they allow for contributing to an Individual Retirement Account. Normally, the deadline for contributing to an I.R.A. is the due date for filing a tax return, or April 15 of the following calendar year. But if you get an automatic filing extension, the due date for contributing to an I.R.A. (or a Keogh plan in existence before Dec. 31, 1983) is extended by four months as well. **********This provision, coupled with a recent I.R.S. turnabout on use of tax refunds to fund I.R.A.'s, has liberalized the time limits for contributing to retirement accounts. Earlier this year, the revenue service reversed itself and ruled that people could use refunds expected from their current tax returns to fund I.R.A. contributions claimed on those same tax returns, provided the contribution were made by the filing date plus any extensions. In effect, the ruling allows people to claim I.R.A. deductions before the contributions are made. **********''It means that as long as you file your tax return after you request an automatic extension, you can use your tax refund to make your I.R.A. deposit,'' said Milton Pickman, a partner in the New York accounting firm of Anchin, Block & Anchin. However, to avoid a penalty, the contribution must be made by Aug. 15. **********He gave the example of someone in the 50 percent bracket who requests an extension and then puts $2,000 in his I.R.A. in August: ''He gets four extra months to accumulate $2,000, and $1,000 of it comes in the form of an increased refund or a reduction in tax to pay for the contribution.'' **********But Mr. Pickman noted that pending Senate legislation would require I.R.A. contributions to be made by the due date, regardless of any extensions, ''so this may be your last chance to do this.'' **********FINALLY, the I.R.S. itself removed a potential disadvantage to getting an extension **********when it did an about-face on the way that the estimated tax underpayment penalty is computed. The mechanics of the new rule are complicated, but the net effect is that people who get extensions ''are not going to lose interest on estimated tax payments'' made during earlier periods, said Mr. Nad of Price Waterhouse. **********If you need more than four months to complete your return, you may be able to get an additional two-month extension by filing Form 2688. But this extension is not automatic and taxpayers must demonstrate ''undue hardship'' to qualify. ''We don't spell out what that is,'' said Wilson Fadely, an I.R.S. spokesman, adding that the Government ''looks at each individual case.'' But acceptable reasons might include serious illness in the family, or a catastrophe such as fire or theft, he said. **********One perfectly legal way to get a short extension without filling out any forms at all is to take a trip outside the United States or Puerto Rico on April 15. You are entitled to an automatic two-month grace period, until June 15, for such temporary absences, as long as you attach a statement to your return saying you were away on the due date. **********Mr. Kess of Main Hurdman said this is often a favorite ploy for people with matrimonial problems who cannot work out their financial differences, including taxes. ''A short hop north of the border to Canada or south to Mexico satisfies the requirement,'' he noted. **********Only one spouse needs to be out of the country for the automatic extension to apply. But the tactic works only for couples who file a joint return; if they file separately, only the partner who was away on April 15 is entitled to the extension. **********But an extension also extends the time period during which the I.R.S. can audit you and claim you owe additional tax. The statute of limitations normally runs three years from the date a return is filed, except in cases of fraud or substantial understatement of income. **********If you filed your 1983 return by the due date, for example, the I.R.S. would have until April 15, 1987 to challenge it. But if you waited four more months to file, the revenue service would have until Aug. 15, 1987, to scrutinize your return. On the other hand, you get that much more time to file a claim for a refund if you discover a mistake on your return - say, forgetting a big deduction."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/07/world/sikh-hijackers-give-up-in-pakistan.html": {"writer_name": "William Stevens", "pub_date": "1984-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 868, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SIKH HIJACKERS GIVE UP IN PAKISTAN", "print_headline": "SIKH HIJACKERS GIVE UP IN PAKISTAN", "body_text": " **********Hijackers identified as Sikhs freed 255 passengers and crew members from a commandeered Indian Airlines jet in Pakistan today, then surrendered to Pakistani authorities. **********The plane was hijacked to Lahore on Thursday during a scheduled flight from Srinagar, the capital of the northern Indian state of Kashmir, to New Delhi. **********The hijackers' surrender came as a result of negotiations that ended a 17- hour ordeal for the plane's passengers and crew, who remained aboard the A-300 Airbus in suffocating heat, with little food and water. During that time, passengers said, the hijackers threatened to blow up the plane if their demands on behalf of the Sikh radical cause were not met. **********Indian officials said the release of the passengers was a ''high point of cooperation and good will'' between India and Pakistan, which have fought three wars and have a history of mutual suspicion and hostility. Indeed, in the weeks since the Indian Army raid in early June on the Golden Temple, the Sikh shrine in Amritsar, Indian officials have floated more than veiled hints that Pakistan was behind the terrorist campaign in Punjab that has resulted in the deaths of some 500 people in the last two years.   Passengers Identify 9 Hijackers **********Passengers on the plane identified nine hijackers, six wearing the familiar Sikh beards and turbans, but the other three clean-shaven and without turbans. **********India today asked for the return of all the hijackers. But six other hijackers, who were arrested in 1981, have yet to be returned, and the status of the nine involved in today's incident was uncertain. India and Pakistan have no extradition treaty. **********According to passengers' accounts, the hijackers roughed up some of the hostages but also served as flight attendants, passing out food and commondeering fresh cherries that passengers had brought from Kashmir. **********Passengers said that all of the hijackers were young, some appearing to be teen-agers, and that many seemed to be very nervous. All were described by officials as followers of the late Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the terrorist leader killed in the raid on the Golden Temple in Amritsar in the Indian state of Punjab a month ago. Lahore is just across the Indian-Pakistan border from Amritsar. **********Between 600 and 1,000 people were killed in the Punjab raid by the Indian Army in an attempt to root out the heart of the Sikh terrorist movement, which made the Golden Temple its bastion and headquarters.   Sought Damages for Temple Raid **********Among the hijackers' demands, which were said to have changed during the hijacking, were that the Indian Government pay $25 million in compensation for damage to the temple; that the Indian Army be withdrawn from Punjab and the temple, and that many Sikhs arrested as terrorists in the last month be freed.  No serious injuries were reported, however, and the hijackers' demands apparently went unmet. **********The hijackers were said to have surrendered after exchanges with Pakistani officials in which ''psychological pressure'' of an undisclosed nature was brought to bear, according to officials. Passengers who arrived here here from Lahore tonight said that the leader of the hijackers conferred outside the plane at about midday with an Indian official, believed to be the Ambassador to Pakistan, K. D. Sharma.   'We Will Let You Live' **********When the leader came back, according to John Haines, a Canadian who was returning aboard the plane from a vacation in Kashmir, he told the passengers that the Indian Government had not agreed to any demands, and that Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ''wanted the plane blown up.'' But the leader said, according to Mr. Haines, ''We will let you live'' on humanitarian grounds. **********The passengers cheered at this, and according to Mr. Haines, they shook hands with the hijackers as they left the plane. ''From the bad guys,'' he said, ''they became heroes at the end.'' **********A crush of well-wishers greeted the passengers when they returned to New Delhi tonight after having been taken on a tour of Lahore by Pakistani officials. So thick was the crowd at Palam Airport that glass panes in the terminal were broken. But there were no injuries, and the mood was festive as the passengers were garlanded with flowers in the traditional Indian greeting.   1981 Hijacking Thwarted **********Around New Delhi this evening, some people expressed admiration for the Pakistanis, who have now frustrated two hijacking attempts by Sikh radicals at Lahore airport in the last three years. In 1981, commandos dressed as cleaning men captured six supporters of Mr. Bhindranwale without causing any injuries. **********A lone Sikh hijacker was shot dead at the Amritsar airport by Indian commandos in August 1982. **********Some passengers aboard the hijacked plane said security appeared lax in Srinagar despite a month- old ''red alert'' issued by the Indian Government at all airports. **********''The searching at Srinagar, at least for me, was very thin, very light,'' said Andre Goldstein, a 20-year-old student from Cleveland, Ohio, and a passenger on the plane.

About 300 people were reported arrested. **********The situation in the city, in the northern state of Punjab, was described by a Government spokesman as being ''well under control.'' **********The disturbance took place during a thanksgiving service by temple priests. Militants seized control of the dais, made anti-Government speeches and raised the flag of Khalistan, an independent country that many Sikhs would like to establish. **********Only two days ago, the Government formally handed over control of the temple to the priests for the first time since June 5 and 6, when the army invaded the temple to root out extremists who had converted it into an armed base. At least 600 people, and perhaps 1,000, were killed in the resulting battle. The temple is the holiest shrine in Sikhdom.   Leaders Condemn Action **********Various leaders of the Sikhs, including the head priests, condemned the action today by radicals. The priests warned that violation of the sanctity of the temple and other Sikh shrines would not be tolerated. **********The major contingent of troops left the temple Wednesday, and the last token soldiers were withdrawn Saturday after prolonged negotiations between the Government and the priests. Today the priests called for a thanksgiving congregation in front of the Akal Takht, the temple headquarters, where the worst fighting took place in June. Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the leader of the most radical Sikh faction, was killed there. **********Today, as thousands of Sikhs gathered for the thanksgiving service, youths identified as Bhindranwale followers disrupted the proceedings. The priests, with folded hands, appealed vainly for order. **********Soon, according to the Press Trust of India, a group of youths captured the dais from the priests. According to the report, the youths made highly provocative speeches criticizing India's President, Zail Singh, who is a Sikh, and the head priests.   'A Revolt Is Brewing' **********The youths read a statement that said, in part, that ''a revolt is brewing in the Sikh masses against the Sikh priests as they had failed to lead the community at this critical juncture.'' The statement asserted that Sikhs were ''losing faith'' in the head priests because of their agreement with the Government. **********The youths announced further that the All-India Sikh Students Federation, which had been the action arm of the Bhindranwale group before the temple raid last June, was to be disbanded. In its place, the statement said, a ''Khalistan Sikh Student Federation'' would be formed. **********The youths also forced people at the gathering to raise their hands in support of the demand for the establishment of Khalistan in Punjab, according to the report. **********Shortly after the disturbance began, paramilitary forces entered the temple complex from all sides. The army also moved in, with troops posted in front of the main gate and just inside it, in the temple's outer compound. The troops left about an hour later. **********It was not clear how many activists were involved in the disturbance. **********A spokesman for the Akali Dal, a Sikh political party made up of a more moderate group of Sikhs, today condemned what he called the action of a ''handful of miscreants.'' **********The spokesman, Prakash Singh Majitha, told reporters in Amritsar that the action had violated the sanctity of the temple. Those who disrupted the thanksgiving service were not true Sikhs, he said, adding that the Akali Dal disowned all of them. **********Before the temple raid last June, the Akali Dal never took such a clear stand against the Bhindranwale group."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/06/business/cuts-urged-for-utility.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 183, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cuts Urged For Utility", "print_headline": "Cuts Urged For Utility", "body_text": " **********Michigan's chief utility overseer today recommended $200 million in spending cuts, including elimination of common-stock dividends, to help the Consumers Power Company recover from the failure of its Midland nuclear power project. **********Eric J.

Once, back in the 1950's and 1960's, businesses supplied one-quarter of all Federal Government revenues. By 1983, that share fell to 6.2 percent. **********The decline of the corporate tax is a direct result of the tremendous expansion in corporate loopholes - to an expected $87 billion in the current fiscal year, from $7 billion in 1970. President Reagan's 1981 tax act so expanded tax-avoidance opportunities that the corporate tax code is now more loophole than tax. In the fiscal years 1983 and 1984, the Government lost $1.47 through corporate tax breaks for every $1 paid in corporate income taxes. **********A recent Citizens for Tax Justice study, analyzing 250 of America's most profitable corporations, found that more than half either paid no taxes or got outright tax subsidies in at least one of the first three Reagan years. **********The biggest gainer was General Electric, which earned $6.5 billion in pretax domestic profits between 1981 and 1983, paid not one cent in Federal income taxes, and claimed $283 million in tax refunds. **********Six other companies - Boeing, Dow Chemical, Tenneco, Santa Fe Southern Pacific, Weyerhaeuser and Du Pont - also received net tax refunds or benefits in excess of $100 million each, despite combined profits of almost $10 billion. **********OVER all, if the 250 companies we examined had paid taxes at the 46 percent statutory corporate tax rate, they would have contributed an additional $91.4 billion in taxes, a considerable contribution toward reducing the Federal deficit. **********Not all companies pay very low tax rates. The top 10 corporate taxpayers in our study, for example, paid half the total taxes for the group, despite having only a quarter the total profits. **********This fact points out another serious problem with our current system: By making some business activities more profitable than others, the tax laws create terrible economic distortions. **********The problem exists not only among companies and industries, but also among different kinds of investments. The bias is so strongly in favor of the short term that an investment in industrial plant needs to be almost twice as profitable before taxes as an investment in short-lived equipment in order to compete on the after-tax bottom line. **********Supposedly, the idea behind Mr. Reagan's corporate tax concessions was that they would lead to added investment. But such has not been the case. Real business spending on plant and equipment actually fell for the first three years that the Reagan ''incentives'' were in effect. Even the current rebound in plant and equipment investment has left the total amount in constant dollars only 3.5 percent above the 1980 level, compared with a 28.6 percent real increase during the years of the Carter Administration. **********These dismal statistics have led many loophole apologists to shift gears. Trying to tax corporations is ''dumb,'' they contend, because the taxes simply will be passed on to consumers. **********Is there any merit to this contention? Not really. In a market economy, the profit maximizing price for a product generally will be independent of the income tax paid on that profit. This analysis is not only widely accepted by economists, but, unlike some theories, it also turns out to be true in practice. **********In the Citizens for Tax Justice corporate tax study, for example, we found 1983 effective tax rates on oil companies ranging from negative for several companies, to 5.9 percent for Mobil, and up to 33.8 percent for Exxon. **********Yet all these corporations were charging the same price for their oil. A 1982 Congressional study of effective tax rates paid by major banks found a similarly wide range of tax rates. But all the banks were charging about the same interest rates. And does anyone seriously believe that General Electric reduced the price of its toasters in response to its tax refunds? Of course not. **********Ultimately, those who argue against corporate taxes undercut themselves in their feeble attempt to pose as consumer advocates. What are they proposing as the alternative to closing corporate loopholes? A national sales tax, or ''value-added tax'' - in other words, a direct tax on consumers. **********At least they make the issues crystal clear: Do we want to raise taxes still further on the working poor and middle class, or shouldn't we ask those who are not chipping in to start paying their fair share? Must we continue throwing loopholes at our economic problems, or can't we instead follow the lead of the Japanese, with the highest corporate taxes and the highest productivity growth rate in the world? **********Why not learn from our past mistakes, and discover, as the British Government recently put it, that ''the assumption that tax incentives meant better investment has been proved alarmingly wrong.'' **********A tax code that asks corporations to pay taxes on their real profits - just as working people pay taxes on their paychecks - would cut the deficit and would also enhance economic growth in the United States. It would also be vastly fairer than the current approach. **********Robert S.

Some officials and commentators, however, argue that the new Parliament will not have to convene until six months after Jan. 20, and that Mrs. Gandhi could legally call the election for any time before then. **********Mrs. Gandhi herself has repeatedly said the elections will come ''when they are due.'' This is most often interpreted to mean the balloting would take place in November or December. But Mrs. Gandhi could easily call it earlier if she saw advantages for her party. **********It is considered highly unlikely, however, that the election announcement will come before the last week of August. The five-week ''monsoon session'' of Parliament, which is to begin July 23, does not end until then, and members would not be free to campaign.

Accusations Over Kashmir **********Meanwhile, the opposition has been assailing the Government's recent actions with gusto. Last Wednesday opposition leaders in New Delhi accused the faction of the Congress Party led by Mrs. Gandhi of having engineered the downfall of the Kashmir government of Dr. Farooq Abdullah and putting a ''puppet government'' in its place. **********The Gandhi Government had for some months been accusing Dr. Farooq of giving aid and support to Pakistani sympathizers in Kashmir, and with allowing training camps for Sikh terrorists from neighboring Punjab to operate in the state. **********There has also been a political animus between Dr. Farooq and the Gandhi camp ever since the two groups failed to cement a political alliance before the May 1982 state elections in Kashmir. Dr. Farooq and his National Conference Party went their own way and soundly beat the Congress Party in the Kashmir Valley. **********As a result, the Gandhi camp had apparently been seeking for sometime to oust Dr. Farooq. An opportunity arose when a faction within the National Conference Party broke away, held a convention, declared itself the true party and expelled Dr. Farooq. The Farooq party retaliated by expelling the leader of the rival faction, Ghulam Mohammed Shah, Dr. Farooq's brother- in-law.   Deprived of a Majority **********On July 2, 12 members of the National Conference Party who had supported Dr. Farooq defected to the Shah faction, depriving Dr. Farooq of a majority in the 78-member state assembly. A thirteenth defector later emerged. At that point Mr. Shah was named the new state leader by the governor of the state, Jagmohan, who was recently appointed to the job by the Gandhi Government. **********Mr. Jagmohan directed Mr. Shah to test his new government's authority within a month. It was considered likely that the Congress Party would join with the 13 defecting Farooq supporters to give Mr. Shah a majority. In effect, although the Congress Party would not formally rule Kashmir, it would control the Shah government and could exact political support in the general election.To add to the opposition's charges, the Congress Party in recent months has been accused of trying to topple the opposition Janata government in the southern state of Karnataka by buying the defections of legislators. And despite a lack of hard evidence, there is a widespread assumption that whether the 13 defecting Kashmiri legislators were paid or not, the Congress Party engineered their defections. Twelve of the 13 were given ministerial posts in the new Shah government. **********These developments have caused representatives of opposition parties, meeting here, to characterize the Shah regime as a puppet government installed through dubious methods in violation of democratic norms. **********The Statesman, an important national newspaper, called the action ''a coup'' and said that this, along with other recent Gandhi actions, suggested that ''after a long period of dithering, she has decided on firm action as the only means to refurbish her Government's image.'' **********The paper said Mrs. Gandhi had probably calculated that such a demonstration of ruthless control in Kashmir would impress voters."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/05/business/advertising-wang-laboratories-offers-new-campaign.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wang Laboratories Offers New Campaign", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Wang Laboratories Offers New Campaign", "body_text": " **********Wang Laboratories, one of the first computer companies to use network TV when it started on the medium in 1977, breaks a new campaign there and in the top 20 markets on Sunday. **********And the new theme from the company's longtime agency, Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, is, ''We put people in front of computers.''

''We must not vote today to send guns and bullets to a man who would desecrate the ideals of Lincoln and Jefferson.'' **********The $21 million level, Senator Kennedy argued, would finance the Salvadoran armed forces through the end of May and allow Congress to reassess the situation after the runoff. **********But another influential Democrat, Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, said this was politically unrealistic.

Tonight South Africa rejected the proposal and reiterated its insistence on a withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola itself. **********The rejection, contained in a statement by Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha, was the latest in a series of diplomatic exchanges between the two ideological foes that has proffered little hope for a settlement either in South- West Africa's 18-year-old bush war or in the conflict between Luanda and Pretoria. **********Late last week South Africa announced the withdrawal of a 2,000-man invasion force after a six-week incursion into Angola, the twelfth campaign of its kind known to have taken place since Angola's independence in 1975. **********Pretoria said between 300 and 500 of its foes were killed for the loss of 21 of its own men in an operation ostensibly designed to thwart a buildup of insurgents. Former German Colony **********South Africa rules South-West Africa, a former German colony widely known as Namibia, in defiance of rulings by the United Nations, which call the occupation illegal. An Angola- based insurgent movement, the South- West Africa People's Organization, has been fighting a largely low-key campaign against Pretoria's domination since 1966. **********Despite the rejection tonight of Angola's terms, however, Mr. Botha confirmed that a high-ranking aide, Dave Stewart, returned recently from a visit to the Cape Verde Islands. Angolan officials were also reported to be in Cape Verde when the South African official visited, but there has been no official indication that the two sides met. **********The Cape Verde Government has acted in the past as an intermediary between South Africa's white minority regime and Angola's Marxist leadership. Mr. Stewart is the most senior South African official dealing with South-West Africa, so there was speculation that one side or the other might be seeking a meeting. Angolan and South African officials held inconclusive talks in Cape Verde last year. **********The complex series of exchanges between South Africa and Angola began Dec. 15, when the South Africans offered a one-month disengagement of forces in southern Angola starting Jan. 31. At the time it was not public knowledge that the 2,000-man invasion force had entered the former Portuguese colony.   Pretoria's Offer Rejected **********Angola and its insurgent allies rejected the offer because of South African conditions that effectively required Angolan authorities to act on behalf of Pretoria in restraining the South-West African guerrillas. **********Last week Mr. Botha said South Africa would not oppose direct talks between the insurgents and Pretoria's Administrator General in South-West Africa. But Mr. Botha withdrew the offer when it seemed the insurgents favored it. **********On Tuesday the Angolan leadership revived the idea of a Jan. 31 disengagement of forces. But among the conditions set by Luanda was a call for South Africa to begin carrying out United Nations Resolution 435, which foresees elections that the insurgents would probably win, and South African troop reductions in the territory. An Angolan statement also said the plan should be carried out ''without considerations foreign to the resolution'' - an allusion to South Africa's demand for the 25,000 to 30,000 Cuban troops in Angola to be withdrawn before there is a settlement. **********In his statement tonight Mr. Botha said South Africa's disengagement offer had not been linked to a Cuban withdrawal. The offer, he said, had been ''a fair test if the Angolan Government is really interested in peace.'' **********He added: ''But the Angolan Government does not want to be tested because that Government now demands that South Africa renounce its viewpoint that the Cubans withdraw before a settlement plan can be implemented.''  'Free and Fair Elections' **********South Africa, Mr. Botha said, ''cannot depart from this viewpoint.'' **********''Free and fair elections'' as foreseen in the United Nations resolution ''cannot happen as long as the Cuban forces form a permanent source of menace and intimidation north of the border and as long as Swapo continues with its terror, backed by Cuban forces,'' the statement said. The South-West African guerrillas are commonly referred to as Swapo. **********The statement went on: ''If the Luanda Government is really interested in peace, it will accept South Africa's proposal and if they want to see the settlement plan implemented they ought to get rid of the Cubans as quickly as possible.'' **********South Africa's insistence on a Cuban withdrawal is supported by the Reagan Administration. Part of Pretoria's argument, as presented tonight, is that the United Nations settlement plan foresees a reduction of South African forces in South-West Africa to 1,500 while Cuban forces remain ''at full strength.'' **********''It is absurd to suggest that just and fair elections can be held under these circumstances,'' the statement said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/13/business/market-place-profit-outlook-for-marsh.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 693, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Profit Outlook For Marsh", "print_headline": "Market Place; Profit Outlook For Marsh", "body_text": " **********RECOMMENDING stocks and predicting corporate earnings can bump head on into surprise news developments. This was underscored Monday when the Marsh & McLennan Companies announced an extraordinary after-tax charge of about $60 million for the first quarter of 1984. **********The charge, according to the holding company that owns the world's largest insurance broker, would reflect projected losses in government bond positions accumulated by a trader on its staff who violated the firm's trading guidelines. **********This news, by coincidence, came directly on the heels of purchase recommendations for Marsh & McLennan's stock by Salomon Brothers, a leading investment firm, and by the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, whose trust department manages an estimated $12 billion for individual and institutional accounts. **********The shares closed last Friday at 48 on the New York Stock Exchange and, in December, had reached a record 50 3/4, moving against the downward trend of the overall market. After falling as low as 41 on Wednesday in response to the company's surprise disclosure, the stock finished that session at 42 1/4, down 2 points. Yesterday, it rose 1 3/8, to 43 5/8. **********''I upgraded the stock last Friday, when we believed that the shares of Marsh & McLennan should outperform the market over the next 12 to 18 months,'' Samuel G. Liss, the analyst following the company for Salomon Brothers, said yesterday. ''Then, on Monday, after the news broke, we downgraded the stock and now take a neutral position on it.'' **********Late last week, Harris Trust advised clients to ''continue to buy the stock under $50 per share.'' At that time, the bank's investment advisory newsletter made this appraisal about the shares: ''They have significantly outperformed the rather lackluster performance of the market in general and are now beginning to more accurately reflect the positive outlook for reinsurance brokerage in 1984.'' **********In response to questions yesterday, John Scholz, director of equity research for the bank, said: **********''We have not changed our buy recommendation. We think this is a Cadillac company and that the expected charge of $60 million reflects an unfortunate situation.'' **********Meanwhile, in light of this new development, both Salomon Brothers and the bank have sharply reduced their previous earnings estimate of $4 a share for Marsh & McLennan in 1984. If the insurance broker takes a $60 million charge against first-quarter profits, both the investment firm and the bank said this would reduce their earnings projections for 1984 to about $2.30 a share. **********''We had been estimating earnings for 1985 at $4.70 a share and there is no change in this projection,'' Mr. Liss said. ''After the 1984 first quarter, I look for positive earnings increases to follow on a quarterly basis.'' **********Harris Trust had tentatively estimated next year's profits at $4.75 a share. Mr. Scholz said that ''conceivably, since the after-tax charge is apparently a nonrecurring situation, the company could still earn $4.75 a share for 1985.'' **********Before Monday's announcement, the Salomon Brothers analyst expected ''a small dividend increase from an annual rate of $2.20 a share, to $2.30, in 1984'' by Marsh & McLennan. In the light of developments, he said yesterday, any dividend increase probably ''will depend upon the company's fundamentals'' over the rest of the year. **********At the Chicago-based bank, Mr. Scholz said Conrad Metz, the trust department analyst covering Marsh & McLennan, was out of town yesterday. Another representative of the bank said Mr. Metz had issued a memorandum on Marsh & McLennan, dated Wednesday of this week, for the bank's portfolio managers and its clients. He said the memorandum stated, in part, that ''because this extraordinary charge is not tied to the company's basic brokerage business, the buy recommendation on the shares is maintained.'' **********In addition, according to the representative, the memorandum says the ''downside in the stock is probably to the high 30's.'' The memorandum also says, ''After release of the first quarter's net loss, the shares should provide an above-average return to the investor over a 12-to-18-month time frame.'' **********In recent years, Marsh & McLennan has shown a steady string of earnings gains.

After a day and a half, running short of ammunition and in danger of being picked off by Syrian missiles and gunfire, the trapped battalion decided to try to break out.

For four long years, much of Europe had been under a terrible shadow. Free nations had fallen, Jews cried out in the camps, millions cried out for liberation. Europe was enslaved and the world prayed for its rescue. Here, in Normandy, the rescue began. Here the Allies stood, and fought against tyranny in a giant undertaking unparalleled in human history. **********We stand on a lonely, windswept point on the northern shore of France. The air is soft, but, 40 years ago at this moment, the air was dense with smoke and the cries of men; the air was filled with the crack of rifle fire and the roar of cannon. At dawn on the morning of the 6th of June, 1944, 225 American Rangers jumped off the British landing craft and ran to the bottom of these cliffs. Their mission was one of the most difficult and daring of the Invasion: to climb these sheer and desolate cliffs and take out the enemy guns. The Allies had been told that some of the mightiest of those guns were here, and they would be trained on the beaches to stop the Allied advance. **********Seize Back the Continent' The Rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers at the edge of the cliffs shooting down at them with machine guns and throwing grenades. And the American Rangers began to climb. They shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up. When one Ranger fell, another would take his place; when one rope was cut, a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb again. They climbed, shot back, and held their footing; soon, one by one, the Rangers pulled themselves over the top - and in seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs they began to seize back the continent of Europe. **********Two hundred twenty-five came here. After two days of fighting, only 90 could still bear arms. **********Behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that were thrust into the top of these cliffs. And before me are the men who put them there. **********These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent; these are the heroes who helped end a war. **********Everyone Was Brave That Day' **********I think I know what you may be thinking right now: ''We were just part of a bigger effort; everyone was brave that day.'' **********Everyone was. Do you remember the story of Bill Millin of the 51st Highlanders? Forty years ago today, British troops were pinned down near a bridge, waiting desperately for help. Suddenly, they heard the sound of bagpipes, and some thought it was a dream. It wasn't. They looked up and saw Bill Millin with his bagpipes, leading the reinforcements, and ignoring the smack of the bullets into the ground around him. Lord Lovat was with him - Lord Lovat of Scotland, who calmly announced when he got to the bridge: 'Sorry I'm a few minutes late,' as if he'd been delayed by a traffic jam - when in truth he'd just come from the bloody fighting on Sword Beach, which he and his men had just taken. **********There was the impossible valor of the Poles, who threw themselves between the enemy and the rest of Europe as the invasion took hold. And the unsurpassed courage of the Canadians, who had already seen the horrors of war on this coast. They knew what awaited them here, but they would not be deterred; once they hit Juno Beach, they never looked back.   You Risked Everything Here' **********Forty summers have passed since the battle you fought here. You were young the day you took these cliffs - some of you were hardly more than boys, with the deepest joys of life before you. Yet you risked everything here. Why? Why did you do it? What impelled you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your lives to take these cliffs? What inspired all the men of the armies that met here? **********We look at you, and somehow we know the answer. **********It was faith and belief; it was loyalty and love. **********The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right, faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a just God would grant them mercy on this beachhead - or on the next. It was the deep knowledge, and pray God we have not lost it, that there is a profound, moral difference between the use of force for liberation and the use of force for conquest. They were here to liberate, not to conquer, and so they did not doubt their cause. And they were right not to doubt.   Some Things 'Worth Dying For' **********They knew some things are worth dying for: one's country is worth dying for; and democracy is worth dying for, because it is the most deeply held honorable form of government ever devised by man. They loved liberty; they were willing to fight tyranny; they knew the people of their countries were behind them. **********Something else helped the men of D-day: their rock-hard belief that Providence would have a great hand in the events that would unfold here; that God was an ally in this great cause. **********In spite of our great efforts and successes, not all that followed the end of the war was happy, or planned. Some liberated countries were lost. The great sadness of this loss echoes down to our own time in the streets of Warsaw, Prague, and East Berlin. The Soviet troops that came to the center of this continent did not leave when peace came. They are still there, uninvited, unwanted, unyielding, almost 40 years after the war. **********Because of this, Allied forces still stand on this continent. Today, as 40 years ago, our armies are here for only one purpose - to protect and defend democracy. The only territories we hold are memorials like this one and the graveyards where our heroes rest.   Bitter Lessons' From Two Wars **********We in America have learned bitter lessons from two world wars: It is better to be here, ready to protect the peace, than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost. We have learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with expansionist intent. **********But we try always to be prepared for peace; prepared to deter aggression; prepared to negotiate the reduction of arms; and yes, prepared to reach out again in the spirit of reconciliation. **********In truth, there is no reconciliation we would welcome more than a reconciliation with the Soviet Union, so together, we can lessen the risks of war, now and forever. **********It is fitting to remember here the great losses also suffered by the Russian people during World War II: 20 million perished, a terrible price that testifies to all the world the necessity of avoiding war. **********I tell you from my heart that we in the United States do not want war. We want to wipe from the face of the Earth the terrible weapons man now has in his hands. I tell you we are ready to seize that beachhead - but there must be some sign from the Soviet Union that they are willing to move forward, that they share our desire and love for peace, that they will give up the ways of conquest. There must be a changing there that will allow us to turn our hope into action. **********We will pray forever that some day that changing will come. But for now, particularly today, it is good and fitting to renew our commitment to each other, to our freedom, and to the alliance that protects it. **********We are bound today by what bound us 40 years ago: the same loyalties, traditions, and beliefs. And we are bound by reality: the strength of America's allies is vital to the United States, and the American security guarantee is essential to the continued freedom of Europe's demoracies.  We were with you then; we are with you now. Your hopes are our hopes, and your destiny is our destiny."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/11/business/us-steel-files-trade-suits.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 227, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Steel Files Trade Suits", "print_headline": "U.S. Steel Files Trade Suits", "body_text": " **********The United States Steel Corporation filed unfair trade charges today against steelmakers in Spain, South Africa, Argentina, Finland and Australia, contending that they are selling steel in the United States at prices well below the cost of production. **********The filings were the latest in a series of actions brought by the hard- pressed steel industry. **********U.S. Steel asked the Government to impose duties on the imports to offset dumping margins and government subsidies.

Dutt, **********chairman, is in the midst of a personality change. **********The Chicago-based holding company is little known outside Wall Street, yet is the parent of some very well-known consumer goods and services - Tropicana, Cutty Sark, Samsonite and Culligan, just to name some. **********So in a $29 million, first-of-its-kind corporate advertising effort, the company is now attempting give itself a transfusion of some of the good will of its brands, so that in the future the name Beatrice will add value when attached to its lesser-known products, and any new products it might develop. Nabisco and Borden are two of the companies that already work that way, but Procter & Gamble doesn't - since its brands frequently compete with one another. **********Since Beatrice is made up of both national and regional products, the campaign has some interesting logistical challenges, with different TV commercials frequently being used in different geographic areas during the same time periods, for example. To facilitate similar practice in print, Marsteller, Chicago, the corporate agency, not only created magazine ads in one-page and two-page sizes, but also in quarter and third of a page variations. **********Beatrice Foods will soon change its name to simply, Beatrice, and that is the featured name in the advertising, which uses known brands, such as Stiffel lamps or Fisher Mixed Nuts. It is the same way on TV. In case you didn't catch it during the Winter Olympics on ABC-TV, the commercials are made up several vignettes. **********And the tagline, the same in both media, is ''Beatrice. You've known us all along.'' A stranger revealed as a friend. **********Of the total budget, $8.5 million was spent during the winter Olympics and about $11 million will go into the summer games, according to Douglas Stannard, Beatrice's director of corporate relations. **********Magazine advertising will be used in between the two events in order to maintain message frequency against the primary target audience, women 25 to 49, and the secondary target, men 25 to 34. And an interesting mix of publications there are, with three business publications being used up front, according to Greg Carrott, a Beatrice vice president, to prove to the investment community that Beatrice was ''keeping its promise to become an aggressive marketing company.'' **********The rest of the media schedule is made up of Time, Newsweek, People, TV Guide, Good Housekeeping, Better Homes and Gardens, House Beautiful, Parents, Working Woman, Ebony, Bon Appetit, Southern Living, Sports Illustrated, Travel and Leisure, Seventeen, and Money. **********Beatrice, started in 1894 as a dairy company, went on an acquisition kick in the 1960's and 1970's, buying up about 400 companies in all sorts of fields. Mr. Dutt, when he took over, sold off about 100 of them, including Southwestern Investment; Beneke, a toilet seat manufacturer, and Dannon yogurt - after cashing in on the yogurt boom. **********The corporate advertising adventure has its genesis in a decision last summer by Mr. Dutt to tell the world, in a big, memorable way, that the company was being reorganized and solidified. The Olympics was that big way. **********Before the campaign started, Beatrice turned to Yankelovich, Skelly & White, the research company, to see just how well it was known among consumers. The answer came back that under 4 percent of those interviewed could recall the name without help. **********Another project for the researchers was to find out the answer to the question, ''If a consumer goods company were to appear in human form at your door, what personality traits would you want it to have?'' The traits most desired turned out to be caring and standing behind products. If you look carefully, you will find that in the advertising. **********When it came to picking an agency for this multimillion-dollar project, Mr. Stannard said, the company went no further than Marsteller, which it inherited when it acquired Dannon, and which did some purely financial- type corporate advertising at an earlier point. **********And whatever the agency is doing, as far as the client goes, it is doing it right, since post-Olympic consumer research already shows greater recognition and a playback on just those endearing traits that Beatrice wanted for herself. **********Beatrice, the name, is from the Latin beatrix, ''one who brings happiness.''

The rate, currently at 8 1/2 percent, is likely to be lopped by one-half a percentage point, in the view of most money market participants. The discount rate is that charged by the Fed on loans to financial institutions. **********Analysts have based their opinion that the discount rate could be cut soon on movements in the Federal funds rate, the overnight rate on loans between banks. **********For the last week, Fed funds have traded at a level lower than the discount rate, and yesterday was no exception, with funds in a range of 7 3/4 percent to 8 1/4 percent. **********Prices in the secondary market for Government securities rose close to their daily highs after the money supply report was released. **********The price of the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond, the 11 3/4's of 2014, ended the day at 103 8/32, up 6/ 32, to yield 11.36 percent. **********In the short end, three-month bills were bid at 7.75 percent by the end of the day, up 6 basis points on the day. **********Light Trading **********Corporate and municipal bond traders said that activity in those markets was very light yesterday. **********In other developments, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that commercial and industrial loans on the books of major New York City banks fell $496 million in the week ended Dec. 12, compared with a decline of $526 million a week earlier. **********The New York Fed also said that commercial paper outstanding nationwide rose $1.5 billion in the week ended Dec. 12, to $238.44 billion.

Hanoi's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, has suggested there are 10,000. **********In addition, there are tens of thousands of former inmates of the camps - which may have held a total over the last decade of as many as 150,000 men and women - who might try to obtain exit visas from Vietnam because they had been imprisoned. Until now, refugee officials say, the Vietnamese Government has not granted exit permits to its citizens solely because they had been camp inmates. United States officials say they know of at least 18,000 former prison inmates among their own records of applicants for asylum.   Problem of Malnutrition **********The United States has pledged to take family members as well as camp inmates. In many instances families number more than a dozen people. **********Refugee officials who have examined former camp inmates at transit centers in Southeast Asia report that they are often suffering from health problems associated with malnutrition and an unbalanced diet: bad teeth, eye defects, scurvy, ulcers. For some, meals never consisted of more than rice and salt, with occasional pieces of fish. The exiled captain said he was often able to prepare some extra food for himself in the evenings. **********Vietnam opened its first re-education centers within days of the fall of Saigon, former prisoners say. Many relativly unimportant or low-ranking South Vietnamese with connections to the fallen government were confined for relatively short periods in April and May 1975. **********By June, officials say, higher-ranking officers were beginning to be jailed. At this point the word ''studies,'' which became ''re-education'' in common parlance, was dropped from the description of the camps and the Vietnamese word for ''reconstruction'' - the same term North Vietnam had earlier employed to describe its prisons - was substituted. As many as 100 of the camps, many of them in the Saigon region, were apparently in operation during this period.   Lower Officers Released **********By 1978, according to former prisoners' accounts, which officials caution are always fragmentary because they had no access to records, lower officers began to be released. Military men from the rank of colonel upward were moved farther north. **********In 1980 there appears to have been a new series of arrests. Some officials speculate that this may have been because a number of infuential Vietnamese refugees in the United States had begun to speak openly of resistance. But after six months, as applications for emigration and certificates of release examined by refugee officers indicate, many prisoners were again being released. The releases have more or less continued to the present time, and Hanoi may be looking for a way to close most of the centers. Refugee officials say they think there may be 8, possibly 10 camps left. **********Refugees reaching Thailand and other Asian countries from Vietnam have reported that those who are rleased from camps often buy their way out by bribing authorities with gold: 12 to 20 ounces seems to be the prevailing rate. After release, former prisoners are put on probation, usually for a year, and often assigned to work in one of Vietnam's New Economic Zones. **********Most former prisoners then attempt to use family connections to get themselves back on a civil registry or census so that they can obtain identity cards without which they cannot apply for exit permits. Vietnam has been granting these since 1979 under a United Nations Orderly Departure Program. Nearly 70,000 Vietnamese have left under this program. Hundreds of thousands have fled illegally.   Offer Made Three Years Ago **********Refugee officials say there is little concern that Vietnam will use the opportunity of the American offer - which diplomats point out was first made three years ago by Under Secretary of State Walter Stoessel after Hanoi first suggested that the United States take the inmates - as President Castro of Cuba seized the opportunity of the Mariel boatlift to empty Cuban prisons and mental institutions. **********Some officials in international organizations who have worked with the Vietnamese over the years of the Orderly Departure Program, under which the camp inmates would be processed, say that Hanoi has never been prone to whimsical decisions in refugee affairs. **********Others suggest that Hanoi, facing severe economic problems, has been looking for ways to improve its relations with both the United States and the neighboring countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ties that have been frozen over the issue of Hanoi's military presence in Cambodia and Laos."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/13/business/credit-markets-interest-levels-show-declines.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1984-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 652, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS ; Interest Levels Show Declines", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS ; Interest Levels Show Declines", "body_text": " **********Low Funds Rate Cited **********Interest rates declined yesterday, helped by a surfeit of funds in the banking system that produced a lower-than-expected rate for overnight bank loans. **********Many economists doubt that the overnight bank loan rate in the Federal funds market will remain at 10 percent or lower, as it has been much of the last four days. But the lower rate has endured for longer than expected and has spread to other securities. **********The rate for three-month Treasury bills, for example, has fallen to about 9.9 percent, down from 9.98 on Thursday and 10.11 percent on Tuesday. And the yield on two-year Treasury notes has fallen to about 11 3/4 percent, from 11.99 percent on Tuesday. **********Caused by Technical Factors **********Economists are not sure what rate for overnight bank loans will prevail in the future, but many recent rates of 10 percent and lower were caused by technical factors, such as a drop in the Treasury's deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks and an increase in float, bank checks in the process of clearing. **********''I expect the funds rate to average about 10 1/2 percent in a few weeks,'' said Kathleen Cooper, a money market economist at the Security Pacific National Bank. She added that weak money supply growth and low inflation were among the reasons the Federal Reserve had encouraged a drop in the overnight rate from the levels of 11 1/2 percent and higher that prevailed for much of August and September. **********''But the economy is not weak enough to justify'' a funds rate below 10 percent, the bank economist said, adding that the 1.6 percent rise in retail sales in September was a sign that the economy is not weakening further. **********Note and Bond Prices Firm **********Yields for longer-term notes and bonds have not fallen as much during the last week as issues due in less than two years, but market particpants are impressed that note and bond prices have been firm, despite the specter of about $43 billion of new Treasury notes and bonds to be auctioned by Nov. 8. **********In advance of next Tuesday's $5.5 billion auction of seven-year Treasury notes, securities dealers offered the notes on a when-issued basis with a yield of about 12.30 percent, while the $8.8 billion of two-year notes to be auctioned next Wednesday were offered with a yield of 11.73 percent. **********Specialists in the Treasury market said there was good investor buying of notes due in four to seven years early yesterday, but they added that even modest purchases are enough to cause sharp price gains at a time of light activity and small inventories. By late in the day, the 12 1/2 percent bond due in 2014 was offered at 103, up about 1/4 point, to yield 12.12 percent. **********Demand for Zero Coupons **********In the long-term market, demand from foreign and domestic investors continued strong for zero coupon securities - preferably those with the longest maturities and the lowest prices. **********If interest rates decline, prices of zero coupon securities would rise more than the prices of interest-bearing bonds, and the price of zero coupon issues with the longest maturtities would rise most, analysts said. **********The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation yesterday took advantage of strong demand for non-interest-bearing securities, and offered $7 billion face amount of subordinated capital debentures due in 2019 at a price of 3.179, or $31.79 per $1,000 face amount, to yield 10.10 percent. The underwriters were led by Salomon Brothers. **********Although investors could earn an 11 1/2 percent to 12 percent yield on Treasury-backed zero coupon securities due in 25 years, the lower-yielding issue from the home loan corporation was attractive because it carried a longer maturity than any outstanding Treasury issue and was offered at a lower price than Treasury-backed zero coupon issues. For example, Treasury-backed zero coupon issues due in August 2009 were valued at about 6.25, or $62.50 per $1,000, assuming a yield of 11.50 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/22/business/hazeltine-award.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 46, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hazeltine Award", "print_headline": "Hazeltine Award", "body_text": " **********The Hazeltine Corporation received a $61.6 million Air Force contract to continue full-scale development of an information distribution system, the Defense Department said.

E. Meyer Jr. at Trans World Airlines who is trying to convince skeptical and resistant unions of the need for contract concessions to revive his groggy airline. **********Frank Lorenzo at Continental chose bankruptcy and Frank Borman at Eastern used the threat of it to get the concessions they said they needed. **********But Mr. Meyer, in a rare interview the other day, described a strategy that he said was more like the one American Airlines successfully pursued. It is a steady, crushing, bear hug and a pledge to keep the carrier flying without unions if necessary. **********'Harder and Harder Choices' **********T.W.A., about to be spun off from the Trans World Corporation, is looking for $93 million in concessions from its flight attendants and machinists. And Mr. Meyer, the carrier's president and chief executive officer, says he will simply confront them ''with harder and harder choices.'' **********He added: ''Eventually, they will have to select whether or not we are going to be successful. We'll have to go more to a direct confrontational approach and take a very firm position.'' **********That is, he said, if there is no movement in the current talks, when the contract runs out with the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants on July 31 and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers on Oct. 31, he will prepare the airline to continue operating if a strike is called by the union leadership. **********So far, the unions have not blinked. ''Nothing new,'' said Arthur Teolis, the president of the flight attendants' union. ''They have threatened that every time they have negotiations.'' **********Profit in Third Quarter **********The carrier has had heavy losses - $275 million in the 12 months ended last June on its domestic division - but it is not in danger of bankruptcy. During the third quarter, for example, the airline had a profit of $75.5 million, which came mostly from the strong performance of its international operations. **********Still, there is wide agreement among analysts that the airline's major problem is its labor cost. **********Candace Browning, an airline analyst for Oppenheimer & Company, compared T.W.A.'s second-quarter results with those of its rival, Pan American World Airways, and found that both had roughly the same revenues - $738.8 million for Pan Am and $750.5 million for T.W.A. But Pan Am paid $257.4 million in wages, down 12.7 percent from the period a year earlier, while T.W.A.'s labor costs came to $338.8 million, up 7.6 percent. **********''The fact that we have avoided being on the brink contributes to making it more difficult for people to recognize that we need concessions,'' Mr. Meyer acknowledged. ''One of the reasons we have avoided that was that this management started to plan for deregulation in 1977.'' **********So Mr. Meyer is more sympathetic to what American Airlines did last March - negotiating an agreement by vowing to continue to operate the airline even if one of its unions did strike.''An American type of solution is a possibility,'' he said. **********Traffic Gains Cited **********But he acknowledged that several developments have made it more difficult to persuade the unions. Airline traffic has improved and analysts are beginning to see 1984 as a better year for the industry in general. **********In addition, the recent settlement at Eastern Airlines, in which the machinists' and flight attendants' unions made concessions in return for about one-fourth of the company's common stock and a significant voice in its management, could bring similar demands from T.W.A.'s unions. **********Also complicating the talks is the carrier's lingering connections with the Trans World Corporation. Even though the airline will be spun off as of Feb. 1, the parent company will continue to guarantee $200 million in bank credits for the carrier through 1987, contribute about $20 million in dividend payments on T.W.A. preferred stock through May 1985, and help the airline sell some of its receivables in a program to pick up additional cash through May of 1987. **********Union Offers 10% Pay Cut **********Mr. Teolis said his flight attendants' union was being flexible, having offered to take a 10 percent pay cut toward the $40 million that Mr. Meyer is seeking from that union. Mr. Teolis said a 10 percent cut was worth less than $40 million but he could not be more precise. T.W.A. estimates such a cut would be worth $17.5 million. **********The union chief said the only response from the company had been a threat to lay off 400 flight attendants by the end of January. ''They put out a layoff notice,'' he said, ''which I believe means no to the proposal.'' **********Mr. Meyer, however, has made progress on his overall plan to get $197 million in total labor concessions, which he says are necessary to turn the airline around in 1984. He has already gained $53 million from the airline's nonunion workers. **********Concessions From Pilots **********He has also won from the executive council of the T.W.A. Air Line Pilots Association an agreement to cut wages by 10 percent and put off an increase of 4 percent until June 1985. He estimated that the concessions from the pilots would save about $63 million next year. **********''We've been very successful with our pilots,'' he said. ''On the other hand, we've had very poor success with the machinists and the flight attendants.'' **********Last fall he also dismissed 3,500 workers, reducing the airline's labor force to 26,000. **********Despite the retrenchment, Mr. Meyer is determined to expand flying operations in 1984, particularly on international routes. The airline plans to add Amsterdam, Brussels and Munich, West Germany, to its schedule in 1984, which will mean more work for the remaining employees. **********But T.W.A. also has its own labor history to contend with in its talks. Last year, while Pan Am was able to extract major concessions from its unions, T.W.A. signed contracts with the machinists and the flight attendants that gave increases in wages and benefits totaling about 30 percent over three years. **********Warns on Cutbacks **********In a booklet entitled ''Where It's At,'' which has been distributed to employees, Mr. Meyer has warned that the airline would face major cutbacks if the unions did not grant the concessions. **********One would be to sharply reduce operations at St. Louis, where the airline has built a hub offering more than 160 daily flights. It has also built a $25 million terminal there. **********An even more severe alternative would be to follow Pan Am's example and reduce its domestic system to a few select feeder routes for its terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport, where T.W.A. has completed a $35 million renovation. **********On the surface, the alternative looks tempting because T.W.A.'s international operations have been highly profitable. During the first nine months of last year, for example, its international division showed a profit of $75.5 million while domestic operations registered a loss of $33.4 million. **********But Mr. Meyer said he hoped to avoid a sharp reduction in domestic operations because he did not want to ''inflict large levels of pain and throw people out on the streets.'' **********On the other hand, he said that the airline had taken all the major steps it could in cutting costs. ''We have run out of rabbits that we can pull out of a hat,'' he added."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/09/world/around-the-world-pope-offers-cheer-to-czech-catholics.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 173, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pope Offers Cheer To Czech Catholics", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Pope Offers Cheer To Czech Catholics", "body_text": " **********Pope John Paul II offered words of encouragement today to Roman Catholics in Czechoslovakia after talks last week on improving strained church-state relations in that Communist nation. **********''I entrust the bishops, priests, men and women of religious orders and all the faithful of that noble nation to the Blessed Virgin,'' the Pope said, adding that he hoped the Virgin Mary ''secures for them the strength to always bear a clear witness to the Christian faith.'' **********He spoke during his weekly Angelus blessing, which was delivered from his apartment window overlooking St. Peter's Square, where 8,000 tourists and pilgrims had gathered. **********The Pope also praised St. Cyril and St. Methodius, who in the ninth century brought Christianity to parts of what is now Czechoslovakia.

Eugenio Vides Casanova, the Defense Minister, according to a military official. **********The memorandum was prepared by a special commission of seven officers, which was set up more than a year ago to make recommendations on internal military matters. **********The memo, according to the official, said that the new president could make ''personnel'' changes, but structural changes within the military had to be made by the High Command. **********One military officer acknowledged that it would make sense to consolidate the security forces, which American officials believe are responsible for most of the military's human rights abuses. **********The officer said, however, that such a change would have to be made by the high command. If Mr. Duarte tried to make changes, he said, there would be ''repercussions.'' **********The new president will be able to name a new defense minister.

Peking decreed in April that such taxes and fees could be imposed only by the provinces, regions and municipalities directly under the central Government. **********These taxes and duties, under a miscellany of names, have proved unbearable to many traders, Hao Haifeng, a Peking official charged with supervising private enterprise, warned in an interview published Wednesday by the English-language China Daily. **********On Tuesday, another newspaper, Workers' Daily, listed some of the bizarre charges that were being imposed around China, from a drunkard tax on private restaurants to assessments for blood donations and military recruiting drives. **********Some entrepreneurs were forced to close down their businesses because of unreasonable taxes and fees, Workers' Daily reported in a front-page article.   Enterprise Suppressed Under Mao **********Private enterprise, which was once suppressed under Chairman Mao Zedong as the tail of capitalism, has been revived by the current Government of Deng Xiaoping both to provide more goods and services for consumers and to reduce urban unemployment, which has been estimated unofficially at close to 9 percent. **********In November 1981 the central Government and the Communist Party made public a joint directive that urged unemployed Chinese to create their own jobs. The directive made clear that young people would no longer be guaranteed job tenure in a state-run enterprise, a practice nicknamed the iron rice bowl. **********Mr. Hao, who heads the individual enterprises department of the state industrial and commercial administration, said at a news conference in March that the number of self-employed Chinese had risen from 140,000 in 1978, before Mr. Deng's economic policies were introduced, to more than 7.5 million in 1983. **********Over 2 million of these worked in towns and cities and the rest in the countryside, Mr. Hao said. This is still fewer than the nearly 8.4 million Chinese who owned business in 1953 before the crackdown on private enterprise. **********According to statistics, nearly four- fifths of the restaurants, retail stores and service shops set up since 1978 have been privately owned. Such businessmen are now permitted to hire up to seven apprentices and helpers, not including family members, and to buy produce and materials through state wholesale outlets. **********The central Government has worked to dispel a prevailing notion that private enterprise contradicts the principles on which China's Communist regime was founded 35 years ago. At a work conference for senior Government and party officials presided over by the Communist Party Secretary Hu Yaobang this summer, it was reiterated that private business, by supplementing China's economy, would help it develop and improve.   Some Harassment Reported **********But at the grass-roots level, resentful leftist officials have harassed some private entrepreneurs to prevent them from growing too prosperous. A common device has been taxes, the more outrageous of which were listed by Workers' Daily. **********In the Manchurian city of Harbin, where private enterprises ballooned from 610 to 16,227 in five years, small- business men have been subject to 42 kinds of fees and taxes, 7 of them imposed by the local police alone. They include a drunkards tax of $4 imposed on restaurants whose customers might drink too much. **********Small-business men in Harbin have also been charged for hanging out colored lanterns and have been taxed to pay for tree-planting, voters activities, upgrading public sanitation and maintaining the dikes on the Songhua River. **********In Guangdong Province in southeastern China, 22 kinds of fees and taxes have been slapped on private businessmen by 17 different departments. In Raoping County, 265 privately employed households were made to pay an old man's rent for the county's care of the elderly. In Zengcheng County, three private businesses were charged a loss fee of $120 for having taken customers away from a local production brigades' own sideline enterprise. **********In Yunnan Province, a photographer in Kunming was assessed a $120 gardening fee. And in Henan Province, a man who quarried and sold limestone had to pay $200 as a management fee to the local village committee. **********In Sichuan and Shandong Provinces, Workers' Daily said, private businessmen have been charged a guidance fee for scientific research and technology, a market management fee and a joint security guarding fee.   Central Government Steps In **********The latest press reports did not give examples of private businesses going bankrupt because of so many taxes. But People's Daily, in one such account in March, told how Feng Dianshe, a restaurant owner in Henan, saw his monthly county tax increased 30 percent without reason. When he protested, Mr. Feng was forced to pay $500 three times for purported tax evasion. His restaurant had to shut down. **********After he pushed for an investigation, the county tax director was discharged and Mr. Feng got part of his money back. **********There have been other stories of private entrepreneurs, such as peasants raising fish or poultry as a sideline, being forced to hand over fertilizer, feed and cash to less prosperous local officials or neighbors. **********Such harassment often comes from leftists in authority who dislike the new economic policies because they undermine the old Maoist doctrine of egalitarianism. If the abuses get publicized, it is because the central Government wants to stop them. **********Last December in the industrial city of Wuhan, where 14,000 private businesses now operate, the police confiscated the licenses of 200 individual vendors and relocated another 300, demolishing some stands, because they strayed out of the sites assigned to them by the city. After Peking heard of it, the licenses were returned and Wuhan's Mayor, Wu Guanzhen, apologized personally to the businessmen.  The Government wants to make private enterprise more attractive to unemployed youth. Most young Chinese are still reluctant to go into business for themselves, where they will not be eligible for housing, welfare benefits and pensions that the state-run enterprises generally provide."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/18/business/starts-of-housing-jumps-8.9.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 523, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STARTS OF HOUSING JUMPS 8.9%", "print_headline": "STARTS OF HOUSING JUMPS 8.9%", "body_text": " **********Construction of new homes, rebounding from two consecutive monthly declines, rose 8.9 percent in September, the Government reported today. **********The Commerce Department said new housing was started at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.68 million units last month, after declines of 12.3 percent in August and 6.6 percent in July. **********But applications for new building permits, a sign of future activity, dropped in September for the fourth consecutive month.

That meant that many Westerners had become targets. **********A Little More Jittery **********Until last night, at least, the earth was still. But the deadline has nonetheless left this always anxious city a little more jittery. The army, for instance, has taken to mounting more frequent patrols in West Beirut, the predominantly Moslem part of the city, so that, at midnight, the stroller will see American-supplied armored personnel carriers clattering down Hamra Street, once the emblem of Beirut's elegance. After nine years of near-constant war, only the rats in the garbage piles compete for Hamra's spoils. **********The heavily-armed soldiers in their jeeps have replaced the men in red Mustangs who once cruised the street, as much in demonstration of wealth and machismo as in quest for adventure. **********Beirut is no stranger to bombs - six went off the other night, and no one remarked much on the fact - but the name Islamic Holy War seems to evoke a particular terror. **********The reason, perhaps, is that, in terrorism as in other fields, nothing succeeds like success, or, at least, the appearance of it. Thus the words Holy War have been attached to some of the city's worst atrocities and they have achieved their own cachet in Beirut's catalogue of horrors. **********So many Lebanese stayed home, without even trying to test the 8 P.M. curfew. **********When a bomb explodes there is, initially, the flat whoosh of the detonation, a sound that gives pause to any other activity. Then a silence filled with a prayer that no relative or friend has died, imprecations tinged with a survivor's relief. Then the sirens begin to wail, for despite Beirut's divorce from anything relating to order, the ambulance service still functions so quickly, sometimes, that a rescue worker arrived at the scene of a bomb explosion with too much haste the other day: a sniper killed him before he had a chance to bring salvation to others. **********Since the outbreak of civil war in 1975, according to a Lebanese explosives expert, there have been 1,760 bomb, car-bomb and truck-bomb blasts in Beirut, a statistic that is woven into the city's tally of bloodshed and mayhem. But for all that the Lebanese have become inured to violence, sustained by fatalism and intuition, bombs strike a fear that will not go away. **********''It is something you cannot protect yourself against,'' a Lebanese businessman said, requesting anonymity. ''People are so frightened that even my concierge panics when he sees a car he does not recognize, in case it's a bomb.'' **********The other day, a vendor of vegetables in West Beirut said, a man pulled up in his car, parked, jumped out and drove off in a cab. The vendor called the police, who came in about 30 minutes. They found the name and address of the car's owner, they called him and he gave his explanation: he had not wanted to drive home in Beirut's congested traffic. His seeming flight from the car, however, left a whole neighborhood nervously awaiting the capricious, deafening crump of an explosion. **********It is the unpredictability, and the mechanical callousness of the bomb that terrifies, Beirut residents said. A sniper might be dodged, an artillery duel circumvented, but there is no way of knowing if the car parked on the curb might not be turned into an instrument of sudden death at the very moment you are walking by. **********''Everybody is talking about bombs,'' a Lebanese reporter said. ''They get home early, they avoid public places. When one goes off my first though is relief, then I wonder if my daughter was among the dead, then I check, then I feel sorry for the people who have been killed.'' **********There is another element, too. There was a time in Beirut's recent history when bombs might weigh a maximum of 110 pounds. Those days are the past. The most recent, major bombing - the minor ones barely elicit comment and are a source of relief at their pettiness rather than awe - took place last month near a French command post. The experts who calculate such things reckoned one and a half tons of explosives had been packed into the truck that bore it. **********''It is the magnitude of the bombs these days,'' the journalist said. ''You don't know when or where or how it is going to explode, but you do know it's going to be big.'' **********Lost Symbols of Normalcy **********Thus, at the French command post, houses across the way were flattened and most of those who died were Lebanese civilians, not French soldiers. The blast funneled through the streets for hundreds of yards, tearing steel shutters from shopfronts so that, at one place, a barber's shop stood, suddenly revealed to the world, stripped of the intimacy of the morning shave over a cup of Turkish coffee, its mirrors cracked, the chairs unoccupied, forlorn symbols of a routine and normalcy that Lebanon lost long ago. **********Across the road from the French command post, walls had collapsed, leaving private interiors exposed to public scrutiny. And close by, a detail that only Lebanon could provide: the blast had blown away the supporting wall of a cemetery whose tombstones were higher than street level. A coffin had slid out of the earth, and its lid had opened, as if offering up its occupant as a companion for the more recent dead. **********Those that plant the bombs have no scruples, it is said, so a mistake that kills civilians is not a deterrent to further attacks. **********The targets might be a supermarket that serves liquor - like Smith's just off Hamra Street, which went up the other night, just before curfew started - or some emblem of the countries that are providing the multinational force, particularly France and the United States. Last night, in the northern port of Tripoli, the French cultural center was blown up. **********The bombs do not choose those on whom they will inflict suffering. So people seek to minimize their risks, and many Lebanese these days want those units from the four-nation force - mainly the French - that hold positions in residential areas to move away. ''If you live close to the French,'' a woman who had lived near the most recent attack on the French in Beirut said, ''you are just a target.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/27/business/advertising-tropicana-account-to-benton-bowles.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-04-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tropicana Account To Benton & Bowles", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Tropicana Account To Benton & Bowles", "body_text": " **********Beatrice Foods, Chicago, completed its decision-making process yesterday and assigned its Tropicana Products account to Benton & Bowles, New York. **********The billings will be between $15 million and $20 million. **********The move completes Beatrice's agency reorganization and brings to eight the number of shops handling its diverse subsidiaries. **********In the running for the citrus fruit juice business, in addition to the winner, were MCA Advertising, the incumbent; D'Arcy MacManus Masius, and Ted Bates Advertising."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/06/business/anchor-hocking-to-close-plant.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Anchor Hocking To Close Plant", "print_headline": "Anchor Hocking To Close Plant", "body_text": " **********The Anchor Hocking Corporation said it plans to close a Lancaster glassware plant by mid-1985.

Bitov, a Soviet journalist who returned to Moscow three months ago after defecting to the West, reappeared in print today in his former newspaper with an admiring critique of an article by Norman Mailer about Russia. **********Mr. Bitov, who said after his return that he had been kidnapped while on assignment in Italy and was forced to write anti-Soviet articles in Britain, has published detailed accounts of his year in the West in the pages of Literaturnaya Gazeta. **********Today's article marked his return to normal publication in the newspaper. A spokesman for the paper said Mr. Bitov, who was foreign culture editor before his defection at the Venice Film Festival in September 1983, was now a columnist for the newspaper. **********Defectors are rarely accepted back to the Soviet Union and even more rarely treated gently if they return. Mr. Bitov's treatment, and that of Svetlana Alliluyeva, the daughter of Stalin, who returned two months ago after 17 years as a defector, indicate a new Soviet approach.   Change in Policy Hinted **********Both were put on display at news conferences after their return, and made statements denigrating the West and praising the humanity of their homeland. Western diplomats saw this treatment as indicating that the Soviet Union might want to tempt other defectors and emigres to return home. **********The official press agency, Tass, carried an item today on its foreign-language service pointing out the article by Mr. Bitov. **********Last week two Soviet soldiers who had defected in Afghanistan returned to the Soviet Union from Britain, apparently voluntarily, after visiting their embassy in London. Their return has not been publicized here, and there has been no word on their fate. **********Mr. Bitov, taking the sarcastic tone that is common in his newspaper and which he employed in his accounts of his year in the West, praised Mr. Mailer for having tried, in what he called a naive way, to overcome his acknowledged prejudices about Russia. **********Mr. Mailer's article, titled ''A Country, Not a Scenario'' and published in the Aug. 19 issue of Parade magazine, was an account of a 15-day visit to the Soviet Union in which Mr. Mailer compared his observations with his preconceptions.   Not Quite What Was Expected **********''You walk the streets of Moscow thinking: Is the Soviet Union as we have painted it, or have we painted ourselves into a corner?'' Mr. Mailer wrote. ''After 40 years of reading newspaper accounts about Russia, the trouble is that the country is not quite the way one expected it to be.'' **********He then described his Leningrad hotel room, ''not too unlike a high-rise Holiday Inn in such a place as Norman, Okla.,'' listed his breakfast menu, discoursed on relative prices and salaries and was struck by the architectural similarity of Soviet and Western high- rise apartment buildings. **********Mr. Bitov noted the author's surprise at such observations, and added, ''and he was altogether flabbergasted by the fact that he, an American, could walk wherever and whenever he wanted in Soviet cities and, no matter how hard he tried, could see no one following him.'' **********''I list the naive discoveries of the author not to laugh at him, nor in reproach,'' Mr. Bitov said. On the contrary, he said, he respected Mr. Mailer's attempt to see and understand what he could without prejudice. **********''It is not the fault, but the misfortune of Mailer,'' Mr. Bitov wrote, if his visit ''was too short to overcome the stereotypes embedded in his consciousness and memory.''  The Horrors of Central Park **********Mr. Bitov appeared to draw on his own sojourn in the West, including a visit to the United States, when he depicted in standard Soviet stereotype the horrors of a carriage ride through Central Park in New York. **********''On the coach-box, side by side with the armed driver, sits, in the required style, a plainclothes detective who is undoubtedly also not empty-handed: in the dark time of day, Central Park becomes the domain of hooligans and gangsters,'' he wrote. **********In this context, Mr. Bitov mocked one of Mr. Mailer's central images, of a peaceful Leningrad Park where a young couple sat on a bench at night with a baby carriage beside them. **********''That simple fact of life overwhelmed the venerable author,'' the Soviet journalist wrote.   Indictment of the West **********Mr. Bitov, who is 52 years old, has presented as strong an indictment of the West in his recent articles about his year abroad as he did of the Soviet Union in the articles he wrote during that time. **********He described himself as having been beaten and drugged in Venice, then bribed and intimidated into defecting and into writing and speaking against the Soviet Union. He said he was constantly under the eye of Western secret services and had to play for time before he could make his break for home. **********Differing versions of his story are offered in the West, and a degree of mystery still surrounds a number of aspects of his adventure. Most Western analysts tend to agree in their belief that his defection was genuine. They say the statements he is making now are the price of his return."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/03/business/finance-new-issues-british-telecom-shares-will-be-sold-in-autumn.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 196, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Telecom Shares Will Be Sold in Autumn", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; British Telecom Shares Will Be Sold in Autumn", "body_text": " **********Shares of British Telecom, the state-owned telecommuncations company, will be offered for sale to the public in late autumn, the Government announced today. **********The Government said that British Telecom would come to market with a debt to the Government of $:3.5 billion, or $4.86 billion at today's exchange rate. **********Trade and Industry Secretary Norman Tebbit, in speaking to the House of Commons, dismissed rumors that the share issue would be worth $:4 billion, or $5.56 billion.

He eats, on average, five meals a week at fast-food outlets, which gives him a chance to compare menu pricing, talk to store managers and, of course, sample the hamburgers, fried chicken, codfish cakes and other items on the bill of fare. ''It's fun,'' he said, ''although I could stand to lose a little weight.'' **********Interviewed last May, Mr. Culp took a cautious view of the stocks in his industry. ''Currently, I'm downright bearish and expect to stay that way a while longer,'' he said this week. ''My basic recommendation is to leave the group alone until next spring, when the economy should be improving. **********''The customer count of people coming into the restaurants tells the story. It averaged a 6 percent increase in the first half of 1984, then was up only 3 percent in the third quarter, and right now the gain is running less than 1 percent.'' **********This slowdown in sales at leading chains, he added, is combined with margin-cost pressures stemming from new product introductions, geographical expansion and the implementation of franchising programs. **********For investors determined to buy restaurant stocks, the Prudential-Bache analyst favors three companies that he describes as ''having strong internal dynamics that offset the slowdown in the industry.'' His choices here are the Carrols Corporation, JB's Restaurants and Sizzler Restaurants International. ''But even these three favorites,'' he said, ''could succumb to the industrywide pressures of softening sales and unexpected margin deterioration.'' **********As for the McDonald's Corporation, the dominant force in the fast-food sector, Mr. Culp regards the stock as an average market performer over the next six months and as an ''aggressive purchase'' in a longer time frame of six to 18 months. **********''Disinflation is having an adverse influence on restaurant industry sales because most chains cannot or will not raise menu prices,'' the analyst said. ''McDonald's, for example, last took a price increase almost 24 months ago and has shown no interest in taking one in the fourth quarter. As amazing as it sounds, the price of a Big Mac may be the same in early 1985 as it was in late 1982.'' **********Early last month, Merrill Lynch also recommended that investors reduce their emphasis on stocks of restaurant chains. **********''In our view, a period is under way where it is unlikely that restaurant stocks as a group will outperform the market,'' William T. Trainer, an analyst at the firm, said at that time. ''The basis for de-emphasizing the group on an intermediate-term basis is twofold. **********''Firstly, the price-earnings premium that the group commands is near the upper end of the band that has prevailed since the late 1970's. Secondly, fundamentals in the industry have deteriorated somewhat of late with volume gains slackening, a trend that will probably continue.'' **********Until November, McDonald's had been the only restaurant stock rated as an outright ''buy'' by Merrill Lynch for the intermediate term of up to one year. In early November, the firm lowered its opinion by one notch to ''O.K. to buy.'' Elsewhere, several issues were reduced to a ''neutral'' rating in this same time span from ''O.K. to buy.'' These are Luby's Cafeterias, Shoney's Inc. and Wendy's International. **********Both Mr. Trainer and Mr. Culp drew attention to one problem facing the fast-food industry, namely the proliferation of smaller, ''new concept'' chains. **********''Investment in these chains has generally not been a profitable exercise during the past 15 months,'' Mr. Trainer said in November. ''Most such issues are selling far below year-ago levels. A few bankruptcies have occurred and more may be forthcoming to judge by the widening losses being incurred by some companies. The slowing of the industry's sales momentum will probably accelerate the shakeout trend.'' **********Mr. Culp predicted that ''we will see a sharply increased failure rate among some of the newer start-up companies in the next two years.'' In the past, he added, there was a sense within the industry that plenty of room existed for new fast-food chains. But what has ensued is that chains have begun to ''cannibalize'' one another's business. **********The industry's problems were underscored only this week by an announcement from Diversifoods Inc., which is based in Itasca, Ill., that it expected a sharp decline in fourth-quarter earnings. Moreover, it said, a tentative agreement for a $525 million leveraged buyout of the company had been terminated. Diversifoods was formed about a year ago by the merger of Godfather's Pizza Inc. and Chart House Inc. The stock, which sold last year at a record price of 25 3/4, closed yesterday in the over- the-counter market at 8 5/8, unchanged. **********As for Mr. Culp of Prudential-Bache, he is still searching for a fast-food chain that serves linguine, his favorite dish."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/29/world/a-scandal-in-bonn-casts-a-soft-shadow-on-madrid.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Schumacher", "pub_date": "1984-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1065, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A SCANDAL IN BONN CASTS A SOFT SHADOW ON MADRID", "print_headline": "A SCANDAL IN BONN CASTS A SOFT SHADOW ON MADRID", "body_text": " **********Spaniards call it the Flick case, and it can be viewed as a corruption scandal, cynical politics, overzealousness by the press or just a big national joke. **********However it is viewed, the unsubstantiated allegations that Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez received a suitcase full of money from Flick, the West German industrial conglomerate, has angered, divided and entertained the country for more than a month. **********And that the furor has been over a lot of smoke but little fire says much about the best and the worst of Spain's seven- year-old democracy. **********''Democracy here is still pending,'' said Eduardo Martin Toval, a spokesman for the governing Socialist Party, ''and all that is feeding leaks and rumors is not helping to resolve the problem.'' **********A Charge From West Germany **********The genesis of the case lies in West Germany, where an investigation of Flick political contributions has led to several resignations. Then, last month, a Frankfurt newspaper quoted a member of the parliamentary investigating committee, Peter Struck, as telling a gathering of West German Social Democrats that a ''satchelful'' of Flick money was also given to Mr. Gonzalez to pay for one of his electoral campaigns. **********The report further quoted Mr. Struck as saying that the treasurer of West Germany's Social Democrat Party, Hans-J\"urgen Wischnewski, delivered the money. **********There are no Spanish laws controlling private contributions to political parties, but there are laws on bringing money into Spain. And if this money was brought in, it was not registered. **********Mr. Gonzalez has denied the report, which was amplified in the Spanish press to say that the money financed his 1982 election victory. He told the Spanish Parliament, ''I have received not one mark, not one duro, not one peseta, and you will not see me obliged to rectify this.'' **********In an unusual reflection of the brotherhood shared by the West German and Spanish Socialists, Mr. Struck and Mr. Wischnewski came to Madrid two weeks ago and testified before a hastily set up Spanish parliamentary investigating committee. Mr. Wischnewski denied any role in transferring money, and Mr. Struck said his comments were imprudent exaggerations in jest about the testimony in West Germany of a former Flick director.   Some Contradictions Arise **********The former director, G\"unter Max P\"afgen, also came and testified last week, producing some contradictions. He said Flick gave $333,000 to the Spanish Socialist Party in 1976, as Mr. Struck had said, but Mr. P\"afgen added that the company gave an additional $800,000 from 1976 to 1980, though it was unclear if that money entered the country illegally. **********The Flick money was all channeled through the West German Social Democrats' Friedrich Ebert Foundation and was designed to strenghen parties in newly emerging democracies, Mr. P\"afgen said. He said that after Francisco Franco died in 1975, there was concern that the Spanish Communists might take advantage of the confusion. **********The dates are crucial because the Socialist Party in Spain was not legalized until 1977, and its leaders freely admit that they sought clandestine contributions from abroad before then to survive. Spaniards can accept that reasoning, but foreign contributions after 1977 are more politically damaging because of a virtual Spanish paranoia about foreign meddling in Spanish affairs.   Willy Brandt's Contribution **********The president of the West German Social Democrats, Willy Brandt, the former Chancellor, threw his weight into the affair. He came to the defense of the accused and said he ''could stick my hand in fire'' to prove that the charges of illegal transfers to Mr. Gonzalez after 1976 were false. **********But Alianza Popular, a right-wing coalition, gleefully jumped on the allegations and suggested that Mr. Brandt might singe his fingers. The rightists maintain that Mr. Struck's initial remarks were the true ones and that the backtracking might be motivated by the close personal relationship Mr. Brandt and other West German Socialists enjoy with Mr. Gonzalez. **********No one has come up with evidence that Flick ever got anything in return other than Government considerations to buy tank-making technology from a Flick subsidiary, Kraus-Maffei. But that has not stopped the opposition from slinging innuendoes. ''Nobody gives money for nothing,'' said Jorge Verstrynge, Alianza's secretary general. **********For the Socialists, the Flick case adds to a host of garbage-collection payoff scandals in towns they control politically.   Not Something New **********But the payoffs pale next to the corruption under Franco, and in the Flick case at least some opposition political cynicism appears to be at play. El Pais, a leading Madrid daily, reported last week that West Germany's Ministry of Economic Cooperation alone had distributed nearly $18 million in Spanish political development grants through West German political foundations allied to different Spanish parties. The Communists receive aid from East Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, political analysts said. **********A day after Mr. Verstrynge said that Alianza Popular ''never, ever received even one duro from abroad,'' the party's president, Manuel Fraga Iribarne, admitted that in 1977 he received nearly $16,000 in unregistered money from the West German Christian Social Union. **********''The matter is all a little miserable,'' Mr. Gonzalez said of the finger pointing. **********Whatever the outcome of the case, it has served to underscore the weakness of Spain's nascent political financing system. Campaigning is subsidized by the Government, but the Socialists still report a $16 million debt. Only 1 percent of the Socialist's voters in 1982 are inscribed party members.   Public Is Confused **********The public, meanwhile, has been left confused by the furor, public-opinion polls report. The press has hardly helped. ''German Money Pays for Staying in NATO'' and ''Why Flick Wants to Buy Felipe'' were headlines in two of the country's leading newsweeklies, though neither offered more than groundless supposition. **********But Spaniards have a sardonic sense of humor, and the case has fed dinner party hosts and taxi drivers with a growing national reservoir of Flick jokes. These usually play on the similarity of the word Flick to Flit, a popular insect repellant. **********The matter does not seem likely to go away soon. **********Mr. Gonzalez himself has got into the swing. ''Flick or flock'' he now calls the case, and he adds: ''I will take this matter to the end. And I will take it, moreover, enjoying myself.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/23/world/us-envoy-looks-to-soviet-talks-on-a-new-exchange-agreement.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1984-03-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 975, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. ENVOY LOOKS TO SOVIET TALKS ON A NEW EXCHANGE AGREEMENT", "print_headline": "U.S. ENVOY LOOKS TO SOVIET TALKS ON A NEW EXCHANGE AGREEMENT", "body_text": " **********Arthur A.

''For one thing, I think that there are differences of opinion within Moscow. There is perhaps some competition for leadership.'' **********Another official said the Government was debating whether to ask the Senate to approve two nuclear treaties with the Soviet Union. One, limiting underground weapon tests to the equivalent of 150 kilotons of TNT, was signed in 1974; the other, on monitoring nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes, was signed in 1976. They have never been acted on. Kenneth L. Adelman, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said in an interview, ''There are people in the Administration who want to go ahead with these two treaties, and people who don't want to.'' **********Mr. Adelman would not say what his position was, but other officials have said that Senate approval is being sought by the State Department and is opposed by the Pentagon, with Mr. Adelman's position ambiguous. **********He said the National Security Council had met twice on the subject. **********Arguments for Senate Approval **********Mr. Adelman said those advocating approval argue that a treaty signed by a President should be brought to the Senate for approval. A second reason cited for Senate action is that the United States and the Soviet Union have already agreed not to violate the 150-kiloton limit. **********He said the advocates also argue that ratification would make it easier to verify compliance because each side would be required to turn over geological data about test sites and allow some on-site inspection. **********Mr. Adelman said those opposed were dissatisfied with the verification aspects and felt that a Senate debate would divert attention from more important arms control talks. **********In a report to Congress last January, the Administration said that, although information was questionable because of the difficulties involved, it was ''likely'' that there had been some Soviet underground explosions over the 150-kiloton limit. The Russians have also accused the United States of violating the limit. Both sides have denied doing so. **********Ratification by the United States was cited by Mr. Chernenko in a speech on March 2 as the kind of concrete measures by which the United States could ''prove its peaceableness by deeds.'' **********Mr. Hartman met with Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko 10 days ago, and Secretary of State George P. Shultz conferred with Anatoly F. Dobrynin, the Soviet Ambassador, at about the same time. **********''We have tried over the last little while to see whether or not it is possible to begin to get at discussions of some problems that separate us,'' Mr. Hartman said on the ''Today'' program.

The protesters against the rabbi included many Jews. **********When a police commander in the town announced, ''Kahane is not coming,'' there was a cheer. The stone- throwing seemed to ease, and the helmeted police appeared to relax.  'Shameful Capitulation' **********Rabbi Kahane, who won a seat in Parliament in the elections July 23, said the incident represented a ''shameful capitulation by the police'' as well as a violation of his parliamentary immunity. **********He said outside the Irron police station that ''Um el Fahm is a nest of vipers and Jew-haters.'' He had said it had ''no right to exist'' because ''there are no Arab towns, only Jewish towns occupied by Arabs.'' **********''Now we are going to prevent Arabs from entering Jewish towns, whether there is a law or not,'' he said. He told reporters that he would start Sunday with Bet Shemesh, near Jerusalem, and Wednesday with Bet Shean, in the Galilee region near the Jordan River. He did not say how he would do this or how it would fit into a two-week visit to the United States he is to start Thursday. **********Thousands had come to this hilly area, 20 miles southeast of Haifa, to join residents of Um el Fahm in protesting the rabbi's actions.

''It covers my sadness about the Kahane phenomenon,'' he said. **********The Hadera-Afula road at the turnoff to this Arab town was lined with anti- Kahane demonstrators, members of youth groups and hundreds of Arabs.

The police repeatedly pushed the crowd back. **********Shortly after 11 A.M., the time set for he arrival of the rabbi and more than 150 supporters, violence flared.

Pro-Kahane Slogans **********Policemen pounced on him and another man, apparently an Arab he had been arguing with, and took both away. Later, when the radio announced that the rabbi had been detained, a man began shouting pro-Kahane slogans such as ''Israel is ours.'' He was removed from a menacing crowd. **********Israel radio, which had threatened to bar coverage of Rabbi Kahane, broadcast reports from the roadblock, the main entrance and the village itself.

Kennedy asked the Harvard Business School to help establish an institute to train business executives in Central America, he envisioned a program whose graduates would spread the theory and practice of capitalism throughout the isthmus. **********Today, nearly two decades after the Central American Institute for Business Administration came into being, thousands of its graduates are among the region's most important and successful business leaders. But since Nicaragua's Sandinista-led revolution five years ago, the student body has changed discernibly and some have questioned whether the institute has a future here. **********The student body now includes many Sandinistas seeking to learn how to run Government agencies or how to administer the farms, factories and other businesses that have come into Government hands. **********Some Oppose Support **********Last year, some anti-Sandinista Nicaraguans began to grumble that the school was a training ground for the leftist Government and should no longer be eligible for support from the Agency for International Development, the Inter-American Foundation or other United States agencies that have been contributing to its budget. **********But before a crisis could arise, senior Nicaraguan business leaders reaffirmed their support for the school's policy of accepting students from the public as well as private sector. **********At the same time, some Sandinistas are said to be questioning the need for a traditional business school in the kind of revolutionary society they are trying to build. And with some Sandinistas and some business people both criticizing the school, it has been forced to defend its mission. **********''Karl Marx and Adam Smith are pretty irrelevant to what we're doing here,'' said John C. Ickis, a Harvard Business School graduate and former Peace Corps worker who is now one of the school's administrators. ''Regardless of who is in power, there is a need for people who are able to behave rationally. Nicaragua will be a better place in the long run if more people know how to think.'' **********Suburban Campus **********The institute, known by its Spanish acronym Incae (for Instituto Centroamericano de Administracion de Empresas), sits on a breezy suburban campus whose manicured orderliness is in contrast to the disorganization that characterizes much of Managua. **********The main lecture hall is equipped with microphones for each student and booths for simultaneous translation when necessary. The school's 25,000-volume library is perhaps the most extensive business reference archive in Central America, and its faculty, half of whose members hold doctorates, includes a number of Harvard Business School graduates. **********Most of the 53 faculty members are Central Americans who have studied both in the region and in the United States. But there are also six resident American professors, and other Americans regularly visit for a semester or academic year of research and teaching. **********The suggestion that such an institution would stimulate regional economic development came out of a meeting that President Kennedy held with Central American leaders in Costa Rica in 1963. **********The region was then in the midst of an economic boom fueled by high farm export prices and a surge of investments in commerce and industry. But executives complained that a chronic shortage of trained managers was impeding growth. **********Teaching Began in 1964 **********After the meeting, President Kennedy asked the dean of the Harvard Business School, George P. Baker, to send a mission to the region to investigate the feasibility of the idea. The mission, led by Prof. George Cabot Lodge, came back with a positive report, and the first teaching began in 1964 in the Guatemalan colonial capital of Antigua. **********After spirited competition among Central American countries, Nicaragua was chosen to be Incae's permanent home. The Somoza family, which then dominated the country, arranged favorable terms for purchase of land for the campus, and used its influence in Washington to win the contest. First classes at the Managua campus were held in 1967. **********Over the years, as Incae graduates have risen to positions of authority throughout Central America, the school's reputation has grown. It is now considered the outstanding institution of its kind in Central America. **********''By any standard, you have to consider Incae a success,'' said Pedro Jose Alvarez, a business executive who is an active Incae supporter. ''Anyone who wants a job in Latin America and is carrying a degree from Incae is going to be looked at favorably.'' **********Hundreds Fled **********But the countries of Central America, especially Nicaragua, have undergone political convulsions in recent years. Following the Sandinista takeover here in 1979, hundreds of Incae graduates, left uneasy by the new Government's Marxist rhetoric, fled the country, taking their skills and what they could carry of their wealth with them. **********Companies began to close or move away, and Nicaragua suddenly seemed like a very unpromising place for a business school with historic ties to both Harvard University and the United States Government. **********The problems have not all been political. Nicaragua has an acute shortage of dollars, and this year the country's central bank informed Incae that it would no longer be able to convert its Nicaraguan money into hard currency. This has made it difficult for the school to pay its debts, which are in dollars, and to pay faculty salaries. **********For a period, it looked as though Incae might have to end its operations in Managua. A new campus has been built in Costa Rica, and this year, for the first time, the two-year graduate course is being offered there instead of in Managua. (The school's one-year program continues to be offered here.) **********Ideal Students **********In the last few years, however, the Sandinistas have come to view Incae as a potentially valuable resource. Their Government is run principally by untrained officials who spent their formative years fighting in the hills rather than learning about accounting or budget management. They were the ideal clientele for a business school looking for students. **********Today, half the students at Incae's Managua campus are Sandinistas, often sharing classrooms with ideological opponents. Their presence became something of an issue a year ago, when a group of them held a ceremony on the campus to commemorate the death of Carlos Fonseca Amador, the Sandinista hero. **********But ruffled feathers in the private sector were smoothed, and today young men and women on leave from Sandinista agencies and state-run businesses are listening to professors teach the same business practices that are instilled alongside the Charles River in Massachusetts. **********In addition to the two-year course given in Costa Rica and the one-year program that survives here, Incae sponsors a continuing series of seminars, ranging from a day to several weeks, in every Central American country and in Ecuador. **********Incae administrators and private sector leaders say they are confident the school can remain active in Nicaragua for now, but are not certain about the future. **********''Incae has done what it set out to do, which was to train high-level managers for Central American businesses,'' said Jaime Bengoechea, president of Nicaragua's Chamber of Industry. ''But now our countries have different needs. Incae has to decide exactly what it wants to do in this new situation and then convince some skeptical people on both sides that it still has a role to play.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/09/business/business-people-lockheed-appoints-president-of-group.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1984-02-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 266, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE ; Lockheed Appoints President of Group", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE ; Lockheed Appoints President of Group", "body_text": " **********Robert B.

Unless the transmitter was found, the trial would have to be canceled, he said.   Incident Called Provocation **********The Polish press representative said the defendants began to laugh. The lawyers, on the other hand, said Mr. Kuron and Adam Michnik, another defendant, argued loudly with the officer, declaring that it was well known who had the power to plant transmitters and that the entire issue seemed to be a provocation to justify searches of the lawyers and relatives. **********Lawyers and the Polish journalist said that the officer asked whoever had the transmitter to surrender it. There was no response but the officer said the transmission then ceased. After a short recess the trial was allowed to proceed. **********On trial with Mr. Kuron and Mr. Michnik are Henryk Wujec, 43, a physicist who was a strike leader during the emergence of Solidarity in 1980, and Zbigniew Romaszewski, 41, also a physicist, who set up Solidarity's clandestine radio station.

The remaining $4.2 billion was used by the previous military Government to subsidize extremely low gasoline prices, to buy arms and to finance Argentine tourists traveling abroad. **********Company officials say that if they were forced to pay, the company would go bankrupt, despite annual sales last year of $3.8 billion, a total that made it not only Argentina's largest company but one of the five largest in Latin America as well. **********It is a tale that partly explains the crisis the new civilian Government of President Raul Alfonsin faces in trying to repay the world's third-largest foreign debt. **********''We were not indebted so that we could progress,'' Hector Fiorioli, president of Y.P.F. since last December, said in an interview. ''It was almost all financial debt in dollars we never controlled.'' **********Other Companies Affected **********The Y.P.F. debt is part of $11.7 billion in foreign debt owed by Argentina's 12 state-owned civilian companies, almost all of it contracted in similar ways and almost all of it past due, Government officials said. Among the companies are the state railroad, airline, telephone, coal and electric companies. **********Their debt makes up nearly half the country's 1983 and 1984 debt, which is currently the subject of tough refinancing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and world banks. **********During the negotiations, the Alfonsin Government has objected strenuously to austerity conditions demanded by the I.M.F., partly, it is said, because of the difficulty it would have in justifying austerity for a debt that produced so little. **********''Brazil and Mexico got industrial infrastructure,'' Bernardo Grinspun, Argentina's Economics Minister, said of the two largest Latin debtors. ''We got financial speculation.'' **********Inquiry Under Way **********The central bank is in the midst of an investigation to uncover just what the money was spent for. But officials said that preliminary estimates for the military Government's years from 1976 to 1983 show that $5 billion to $10 billion went for arms purchases alone. An additional $8 billion to $10 billion was spent by tourists going abroad during a brief economic boom. And some $10 billion left the country in capital flight. **********Moreover, officials said, the roads, hydroelectric projects and the like undertaken by the previous Government were often laced with corruption. **********At Y.P.F. itself, a former president, Carlos Suarez Mason, a retired major general, is being sought in an investigation into misplaced funds and adulterated gasoline. He has gone into hiding abroad. Before taking the Y.P.F. job as a patronage plum, General Suarez Mason was a powerful corps commander. Recently, he was indicted on charges of heading a bloody antisubversion campaign. **********The corruption, however, appears to be a sideshow to the bulk of the debt, which grew as a matter of policy. Y.P.F. may be the most salient case. **********Gasoline Price Held Down **********After the military took power in 1976, it held down the price of gasoline to combat soaring inflation. By 1982, the real price of gasoline had dropped to 38 percent of its 1977 price; a gallon cost a mere 40 cents. **********The Government was forcing the company to sell each cubic meter of crude to refineries, including its own, for $30, despite company estimates that each meter cost $70 to produce. Y.P.F. was losing prodigious sums. **********To cover the losses, the Government directed the company to borrow overseas. World interest rates were low, while rates at home had skyrocketed. Seeking to establish a free market economy, the military had lifted many controls on interest and banking. The immediate result, however, was an intense rush to bid up interest rates on deposits as a growing number of banks sought to collect money for their own investments. **********The overseas borrowing was viewed by the Government not only as a way to drive down the high Argentine rates, but also to bring in valuable foreign exchange. Following a near war with Chile in late 1978, the military went on an arms buying spree, and often paid with cash. **********A Surge in Debt **********In five years, Y.P.F.'s debt rose from about $2 billion, which was almost equal in foreign and domestic loans, to more than $5 billion, with 80 percent of it owed abroad. **********The leading lender was the Bank of Tokyo, which today has almost $250 million of Y.P.F.'s debt, company accountants said. They added that the sums owed the Chase Manhattan Bank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Morgan Guaranty Trust were almost as large. **********Syndicated loans were made in the name of projects such as a drilling program in Patagonia, but bankers here said they knew the funds went to finance the deficit and feed dollars into the central bank. The projects could easily have been financed by simply allowing gasoline prices to rise. **********''The symbiotic relation between the treasury and Y.P.F.,'' one American banker said, ''only underlined how a state company cannot go bankrupt, which made it easy for us not to be too demanding.'' **********Oil Production Fell **********During the great flow of loans, said Mr. Fiorioli, who rose through the ranks at Y.P.F., national oil production actually declined for lack of investment. **********The debt burden became a debt crisis because of another inflation- fighting policy. The Government had overvalued the peso in 1979 to permit cheaper imports. The effect on Y.P.F. was to require greater dollar borrowings to get the pesos it needed.  Then in 1981, when the peso became so overvalued that it collapsed, devaluing more than 400 percent in just 12 months, Y.P.F. suddenly found it needed five times more pesos to pay the dollar debt back. **********Last year, the Treasury took formal responsibility for the company's financial debt, leaving it with only a $300 million ''operative'' debt it received in dollars, including $62 million past due to Amoco, Occidental and other foreign oil companies for purchases. **********But Mr. Fiorioli said that Y.P.F. would come up to date before the end of the year.

Unemployment and higher prices often result, along with reduced imports. **********If export revenues improve, a country can pay off some of its outstanding debt or invest in ways that make the country more productive and more nearly self-sustaining. **********The Dominican Republic is a case in point. The I.M.F. agreed on Jan. 21, 1983, to lend nearly $390 million to the Dominican Republic, one of about 40 similar packages now in effect. **********Early this year, the austerity measures imposed in the agreement for the Dominican loan - including the doubling of some food prices that resulted when the Government in effect withdrew subsidies - began to bite. **********Demonstrations in Santo Domingo turned violent in the last two weeks, leaving an estimated 55 people dead and more than 200 injured. **********Those who say the fund drives excessively hard bargains before granting aid cite the unrest in Santo Domingo and disturbances elsewhere in past years, such as food riots in Egypt in January 1977. **********''What is happening in the Dominican Republic is clearly suggesting that the I.M.F. policies do not take into account the social needs of debtor nations,'' said Ruben Rabanal, chairman of the budget committee in Argentina's lower house of Congress. **********But Mr. de Larosi ere, while not responding directly, says the severity of terms depends on the gravity of a country's overspending. **********Another point made by defenders of the fund is that the I.M.F. is a convenient scapegoat for deflecting political criticism from a government that is taking corrective measures. **********Already-Strained Economies **********The enforced austerity also must be overlaid on developing economies that are already strained by high interest rates, surging energy costs and low prices for the commodities they sell. The global recession has curbed exports of tin, copper, sugar and other materials that the third world produces. Rising trade barriers in industrial countries also hurt. **********Another problem is a sense of urgency: The I.M.F. is lending other people's money, which is sometimes hard to obtain, and wants it paid back as promptly as possible. **********For its resources, the fund is dependent on what its member countries are willing to lend it. A fierce debate in Congress last year over additional American contributions to a new subscription of capital highlighted the pressures on this side. The I.M.F. simply cannot afford to be overly generous with its clients, even if it would like to be. **********''There is a real question whether the fund can put up enough money to enable adjustment to be spaced out over a long enough period to avoid social unrest,'' said John Williamson, a former British Treasury official and adviser to the I.M.F. who is now with the Institute for International Economics. **********''Most countries have gone about as far as they can go in cooling their economies,'' adds Nicholas Hope, chief of the World Bank's external debt department, echoing the sentiment of many economists. **********Rigorous Enforcement **********But if a nation that is getting aid from the fund has trouble meeting the conditions, the I.M.F. can be rigorous in insisting that the terms be met. **********Although each case is different, there is a pattern in which the I.M.F. staff asks for more austerity than it knows it can get, and the borrower, especially if it is a newly democratic government such as Argentina, plays for generosity. The managing director stays out of the early negotiations so that he can ultimately weigh the political and social needs for generosity against the economic needs for austerity.Once a letter of intent is signed indicating general agreement between the fund and the borrower, the agency advances money in installments, making periodic assessments of the borrower's compliance with the criteria set forth in the letter. **********In May 1983, for example, when Brazil fell out of compliance because its inflation exceeded the goals set in the letter of intent, the I.M.F. turned off the money faucet. **********It was not until November, following repeated trips to Brazil by I.M.F. economists and visits by Brazilian ministers to the Washington offices of Mr. de Larosi ere, that Brazil signed a series of pledges that brought it back into compliance. **********'Policy Weaknesses' a Target **********Mr. de Larosi ere denies that I.M.F. programs are too restrictive. What the I.M.F. does, he said in a recent speech in Brussels, is to identify and try to correct such ''policy weaknesses'' as overvalued exchange rates, excessive money supply growth and budget deficits that are swollen by food, transportation and other subsidies and large public payrolls. **********The signs of such weaknesses in a country may be legion - black markets, smuggling, reduced government revenues, an overloaded administration, a decline in economic growth and a worsening in the balance of payments. **********''The policies the fund supports produce beneficial results for the countries undertaking them,'' Mr. de Larosi ere insisted, citing programs in Mexico, India, Pakistan, Somalia, Mauritius, Turkey and Hungary. **********Countries are in serious trouble when they have to borrow from the I.M.F. They have either run out of money or are about to because, in simplest terms, they have been spending more than they make in their foreign transactions. In most needy nations, the economic prospects are so dim that commercial banks have stopped making loans. **********A Better Credit Risk **********Once a government signs with the I.M.F. the banks generally come back: The country, with its letter of intent outlining the measures it will take to pay its bills once again, has become a better credit risk. **********On the one side of the negotiating table are the I.M.F. economists from Washington, who, even though they may use abstract economic models, are not without political experience. Eduardo Wiesner, the top Latin American negotiatior, is a former Minister of Finance of Colombia. Mr. de Larosi ere himself was for years second in command of the French Treasury. **********On the other side are the most powerful politicians and civil servants of the borrowing government. So much is at stake that the leadership has to take an active interest. Local newspapers cover every facet of the negotiations. Raul Alfonsin, newly elected President of Argentina, is, for example, deeply involved in Argentine negotiations with the I.M.F., which are front-page news every day in Buenos Aires."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/26/world/china-plans-put-troops-hong-kong-peking-may-25-ap-china-intends-station-troops.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 566, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHINA PLANS TO PUT TROOPS IN HONG KONG PEKING, May 25 (AP) - China intends to station troops in Hong Kong when it regains sovereignty over the British colony in 1997, Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader, said today.", "print_headline": "CHINA PLANS TO PUT TROOPS IN HONG KONG PEKING, May 25 (AP) - China intends to station troops in Hong Kong when it regains sovereignty over the British colony in 1997, Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader, said today.", "body_text": " **********The remarks, which were contrary to an earlier pledge by a Chinese official, had an immediate effect on the Hong Kong stock market.

The group, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, contended in a letter delivered to Comptroller C. Todd Conover that the rule was ''unlawfully adopted'' and ''substantively invalid.'' **********The officials, and other critics of the new rule, contend that it was put into effect by the Comptroller without prior publication and a period for public comment, a violation of Federal law.

The megabit RAM is an awesomely powerful memory chip capable of storing more than one million bits of information - enough to fill roughly four of these newspaper pages with type this size - on a sliver of silicon the size of a dime. **********The announcements will take place in San Francisco at the International Solid State Circuits Conference, an annual showcase for semiconductor developments. There do not appear to be any papers from American companies on such chips. **********The new chips are only laboratory specimens. Mass production is not expected to begin until 1986 or 1987, and much can go wrong between laboratory and production line. **********''Before it's in volume production, a lot of things can change,'' said Arthur L. Lancaster, memory design manager at the RCA Corporation's solid state division and chairman of a session on memory chips at the upcoming conference. **********But the early lead of Japan could mean further success in the RAM market, where it now has about a 60 percent share. **********''I think it's significant,'' said Larry W. Sumney, executive director of the Semiconductor Research Corporation, an organization of 28 American electronics companies that directs cooperative research in chip-making technology. ''I think it represents that they are probably a little further along. How much it's difficult to say. The one that gets there first is going to have the ability to penetrate that market.'' **********The RAM, which stands for random access memory, is the basic chip used in computers to store instructions being executed, or calculations in progress. One of the major measurements of a computer's capability is how much random access memory it has. **********While the RAM represents only one type of product in a vast panoply of microelectronic chips, it is the largest single product because it is a commodity. While different computers might use different microprocessors or different chips to control their video screens, they all use the same memory chips. In addition, RAM's are often used to push manufacturing technology to its limits. Once a new technology is perfected on RAM's, it is used to make other chips with smaller volumes. **********For those reasons, the Japanese electronics companies have made a special effort to penetrate the RAM market, and semiconductor officials pay special attention to that market. A new generation of chips with four times the storage capacity of the previous generation seems to emerge about every three to four years. Each new generation allows computers to have more memory for less cost in a smaller space. **********The most popular memory chip now in use is the 64K RAM, which stores more than 64,000 bits of information. A bit is a 0 or 1, and a combination of eight of them, known as a byte, is used to represent a typed character in computer code. Thus a 64K RAM, which actually stores 65,536 bits, can hold 8,192 letters. **********Some 365 million 64K RAM's, worth $1.4 billion, were sold in 1983, making the chip the first semiconductor industry product to top $1 billion in revenues in a year, according to Lane Mason of Dataquest, a San Jose, Calif., market research firm. **********The next generation, the 256K RAM, which stores more than 256,000 bits, is just starting to come to market. Dataquest estimates that 18 million will be shipped this year. The market for 256K RAM's is expected to peak late in the 1980's and to surpass the size of the 64K RAM market. The Japanese already have the lead in this market. Several Japanese companies are already shipping products, while most American companies are only starting to provide samples to prospective customers, according to Mr. Mason. **********But even as the 256K RAM comes to market, attention is shifting to the megabit RAM, which will store 1,048,576 bits, equivalent to 131,000 letters, or about 22,000 words. **********To cram more than one million electronic storage bins onto a tiny chip will require making the individual bins incredibly small - about 1 micron wide. A micron is a millionth of a meter, or about four hundred-thousandths of an inch. Making circuits that small will stretch existing technology. The five volts of power at which electronic circuits are now operated might overwhelm such tiny circuits. With so many bits on a chip, new techniques will have to be found to allow any single bit to be retrieved fast enough - ideally in less than 100 billionths of a second - to avoid slowing down the computer. The chips will have to incorporate spare memory bins and circuit elements, so that a single failure does not immobilize the entire chip."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/06/business/a-slump-in-farm-implements.html": {"writer_name": "Winston Williams", "pub_date": "1984-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1195, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A SLUMP IN FARM IMPLEMENTS", "print_headline": "A SLUMP IN FARM IMPLEMENTS", "body_text": " **********This summer, as in summers past, farmers' hopes for a prosperous year grow with their crops. But for the makers of farm tractors and combines, the hopes for a turnaround in sales have been dashed, and they are cutting back again. **********Last month, for example, Deere & Company, with excessive inventories on hand, said it would lay off 600 workers at its plant in Waterloo, Iowa. International Harvester will keep the gates of its tractor plant in Rock Island, Ill., locked until mid-August, extending the normal vacation shutdown for three weeks. And it will suspend combine production for the month of September. Other manufacturers are making similar adjustments. **********Bad weather - Middle Western floods and Southeastern heat waves - are damping farmers' prospects and reducing machinery sales. A glut of used equipment from foreclosures and voluntary liquidations overhangs the market. And with farmers already in debt, rising interest rates are depressing demand for machinery even more. Some economists say the farm sector is in a long-term decline and that demand for American farm equipment will probably never equal the industry's glorious days of the late 1970's. **********No Rebound in Sales **********''I don't think any of us expected '84 to be as soft as it turned out to be,'' said Lavon Fife, an economist for International Harvester who, like other industry experts, expected a strong sales rebound in the spring. ''May did not come through. June probably did not come through. And that's a bad omen for the rest of the year.'' **********The Farm and Industrial Equipment Institute, a trade association, said retail sales of tractors had improved just 6.8 percent through May. But sales of combines dropped a surprising 27.5 percent. **********Chase Econometrics expects tractor sales to rise 9 percent this year, to 78,000 units, in contrast to the 142,000 sold in 1979, the record sales year. Combine sales are projected to jump 14 percent, to 14,000, less than half the annual sales rate of 31,000 in the late 1970's. Many of the sales will come out of the huge inventories held by dealers and manufacturers - a one- year supply at current sales rates. **********Consequently, the farm equipment industry's operating rate, which stood at less than 40 percent before the vacation shutdowns, will not improve much. Neither will the financial health of the industry's weary companies - Harvester, Allis- Chalmers, Massey-Ferguson and Tenneco's J. I. Case - because heavy discounting is also eating away at profit margins. **********Middle West Hit Hard **********In the Middle Western grain belt, where recent floods left many fields inundated, sales have been particularly poor. Farmers in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, South Dakota and Ohio have been hit especially hard. **********Some had hopes of replanting their crops when the soil dried out, but it's now too late for planting most crops and moisture remains a problem. Iowa officials estimate that the crop damage will bleed $1 billion from the economies of the state's rural communities. **********''We're going to be a lot worse off this year than we were last year,'' said Karol King, whose 2,000 acres of corn and soybean fields in western Iowa are still dotted with large muddy puddles. **********He added that his tractors are ''all getting a lot of age on them,'' and said: ''But we'll keep them a few more years. You can put a lot of repairs into a machine for what it costs to buy.'' **********Mr. King's falling income is no isolated occurrence. Although farmers' cash receipts are expected to climb $5 billion this year, to $145 billion, analysts estimate that expenditures will increase by $9 billion, so that net income will probably be lower. **********With the termination of most of the payment-in-kind price support program, farmers have increased their planting by 25 million acres this year. And that means spending more for seed, fertilizer and fuel than in 1983. Last year under the payment-in-kind program farmers received surplus Government grain for allowing some land to remain fallow. The reduced planting thus trimmed their expenses. **********The strong dollar, heavy farm debts and creeping interest rates also share the blame for the lackluster performance. **********''This spring there was nervousness about interest rates and the strong dollar across the entire grain and bean belt,'' said Boyd Bartlett, executive vice president of operations for Deere. **********Strong Dollar **********Farmers had hoped for a weakening dollar that would have aided exports. In the 1970's exports expanded rapidly and accounted for a significant share of American farm sales. In recent years there have been bumper grain crops in Canada, South America and Europe, which compete against United States crops priced in expensive dollars. As a result, despite the grudging return of China and the Soviet Union to the grain markets, export growth has been anemic. **********To many experts the chief villain in the farm equipment industry's depression is the mountain of debt that expansion-minded farmers accumulated in the late 1970's when business was good and land values soared. In fact, some economists insist there is a strong correlation between farm land values and equipment purchases. **********For the last three years land values have been declining because of reduced earnings prospects. Last year the decline was about 1 percent, to about $743 an acre. Land is the major asset in a farm's portfolio, and when land values shrink, farmers have less borrowing power. Even so, debt on America's farms climbed last year to 22 percent of assets, up from 16 percent a few years ago, according to Chase Econometrics. **********''Farmers have plenty money but it all has to go back to the financial institutions to reduce debt,'' said Edwin Cox, a partner in Fry & Cox Inc., a Massey-Ferguson dealer in Muleshoe, Tex. The Southwest has been a slight exception to the industry's slow sales because cotton exports are doing well and prices are firm. **********No Foreign Buyers **********But Mr. Cox says his business is still in the doldrums, in part because buyers from Mexico, suffering their own hardships and wary of the prices pushed up by a strong dollar, do not come across the border any more. **********He has been unable to entice them into his store despite the changing array of rebates, discounts and deferred payment plans that all the manufacturers are offering. Their plan is to reduce inventories from a year's supply to a more normal five to six months' supply. **********Some optimists think things will turn around for farmers and equipment makers this fall if interest rates stabilize and the harvest turns out well. But they seem to be outnumbered by the pessimists who think poor profits will drive more farmers out of the fields and force implement makers to trim still more production capacity. **********''I can't see an end to this any time soon,'' Mr. Cox, the Massey dealer, said. ''The Government is committed to a cheap food policy. The farmer has lost his clout in Congress. Even with a good crop it will take two to three years to get back to a volume where I can justify my existence.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/05/world/inmates-on-west-bank-give-up-hunger-strike.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 198, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Inmates on West Bank Give Up Hunger Strike", "print_headline": "Inmates on West Bank Give Up Hunger Strike", "body_text": " **********A 10-day hunger strike by 800 Palestinian inmates of a West Bank prison ended tonight after prisoners reached an agreement with jail officials over improvement of their conditions, a spokesman for the Israeli-run Jail Authority said. **********The spokesman, Shimon Malka, said Minister of Police Haim Bar-Lev met representatives of the prisoners Monday and heard their complaints, which concerned the quality and quantity of food, overcrowding of cells and the amount of time spent in the fresh air. **********After his visit to the prison, Mr. Bar- Lev circulated a letter in Arabic Tuesday among the prisoners, outlining his view on the issues raised by them.

Chernenko as General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party. **********Cyrus R. Vance    Former Secretary of State **********Both countries should use this occasion to improve the dismal state of U.S.-Soviet relations. From our standpoint, I hope that the Reagan Administration will alter its bellicose rhetoric and that both nations will re-examine their policies with respect to each other. A change in leadership in the Soviet Union is always a political turning point, and our policies and actions toward them can affect the direction in which the Soviets move. **********Dmitri K. Simes    Senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace **********I think there was no real power struggle. They functioned for a number of months as a collective leadership without Andropov. One can speculate that they wanted a caretaker, there was no heir-apparent among younger men and the old guard wanted continuity and stability. **********We should not dismiss Chernenko too easily and prematurely. We always have this temptation, especially if we compare him to a colorful man like Andropov. But his selection was much more typical than that of Andropov. The way a person acts as a subordinate is not always a key to how he will act in a supreme position. **********Adam Ulam    Director of Harvard University's Russian research center **********The whole development since Brezhnev's death demonstrates the conspiratorial character of the Soviet regime. To a man who was 68 and already seriously ill at the time of succession, there now succeeds a man who will be 73 this year and who had been bypassed at the time of the last selection. It demonstrates how little even the Soviet elite has to do with the selection of leaders. **********The most logical explanation of what happened is that there was a split between proponents of the two other logical candidates, Grigory Romanov and Mikhail Gorbachev. In the deadlock the only other eligible man, being a member of both the Politburo and the Secretariat, was Chernenko. I think that, on the one hand, the older people did not like the idea of someone as young as Gorbachev, who is a generation younger, 52 going on 53, becoming the boss, and, on the other hand, there was evidently a feeling that Romanov was too tough, even by Soviet standards. **********Seweryn Bialer    Director of Columbia University's Research Center on International Change **********The election of Chernenko signifies that the core group of the Politburo, which is formed of men of his own generation, asserted its dominance. Andropov was eager and partly able to put younger men in the Politburo. Had he lived one more year, the selection would have been different. **********From the point of view of policy, in the short range it does not signify anything. The leadership is collective. The policy toward President Reagan - total mistrust and an unlikelihood of deals helping him in the election - is apt to continue. **********But in the longer term, it does make a difference who runs this top office. From that point of view, the choice of Chernenko is not a positive development for the United States. We are engaged in serious arms negotiations, and there is need for a strong leader in the Kremlin who could push through arrangements in arms control despite the opposition of various groups. I doubt that Mr. Chernenko will have time to accumulate enough power to become a strong leader."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/04/business/south-korean-debt.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 53, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "South Korean Debt", "print_headline": "South Korean Debt", "body_text": " **********South Korea will need about $6 billion in fresh foreign loans and investment in 1985 to help repay foreign debts and finance exports, Finance Ministry officials said today.

''We all quit working in this 'Urban Cowboy' thing. We got fat and lazy.'' **********Jeans sales have dropped since the explosive growth of the late 1970's and early 1980's, and analysts say demand is likely to remain flat. **********A Risky Business **********As a result, the jeans business has gone from stable and secure to risky and highly competitive. Using aggressive marketing, new product lines and leaner operations, jeans makers are trying to create growth by cutting themselves a larger piece of a pie - estimated to have been worth $5 billion last year - that is no longer getting bigger. **********Most analysts attribute the flat growth to the maturing of the baby boom generation. From peak sales of 588.8 million pairs in 1981 - an 8.1 percent increase from 1980 - sales of jeans were down 4.8 percent, to 560.6 million pairs last year, about the same level as 1982, according to industry estimates. **********''Through the 1970's, the domestic production grew at a real rate of 7 percent, compounded annually, and international markets grew at even a faster rate,'' said Jay Meltzer, textile analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''It's a whole new ball game today.'' **********Signs of hard times and fierce competition brought about by flat sales are especially apparent among the three largest jeans makers: Levi Strauss, Lee and Blue Bell. The three represent about 42.5 percent of unit sales in the United States, according to industry estimates, with 8 percent coming from abroad and the remainder divided among many smaller domestic manufacturers. **********On Tuesday, Levi Strauss & Company, the nation's leading jeans producer, said it was laying off 400 employees at its San Francisco headquarters, just one month after announcing it would close 11 plants and lay off 3,200 workers. Levi's earnings grew at a 37 percent annual clip in the late 1970's but plunged 78 percent in the first half of its 1984 fiscal year, to $17.2 million. **********Blue Bell, best known for its Wrangler line, has closed six domestic jeans plants since 1982. Last week, the Greensboro, N.C., manufacturer dissolved its money-losing Sedgefield division, which for 11 years had produced a variety of jean and apparel products aimed at pricier outlets that normally did not carry Wrangler products. The company's earnings have risen, but sales have fallen and Blue Bell has been replaced as the No. 2 jeans maker by the Lee Apparel Company. **********On the other hand, Lee, which is based in Merriam, Kan., and is a subsidiary of the VF Corporation, has doubled its sales since the ''Urban Cowboy'' boom to about $800 million annually with innovative products and smart marketing. VF earned $57.5 million in the first half, up 12.8 percent from a year ago. Lee accounts for about 80 percent of sales. **********Demographics Cited **********One of the main currents creating the volatility, analysts say, is demographics. Not only is the baby-boom generation aging, but there is also a decline in young adult population, the group most likely to buy jeans. By 1995, the number of 18- to 24-year-olds is expected to plunge 23 percent, to 23 million. **********The older crowd is no longer buying as many pairs of jeans, and when they do, they are usually wearing them longer, according to industry analysts. **********High-Fashion Segment **********The introduction of high fashion into the jeans business has made the situation all the more unstable, though analysts say so-called fashion jeans represent the industry's best chance for growth. Younger customers, especially women, now shun standard blue denim jeans for fashion jeans, which are made with stripes or patterns in distinctive fabrics and cuts. **********Indeed, consumer tastes in jeans have fluctuated so wildly over the last 10 years that the definition of ''jeans'' is itself in question. In the mid-1970's came the shift from basic blue jeans to blue jeans with designer labels, which are made of denim but carry a designer's name on the pocket. Prompted largely by ''Urban Cowboy,'' tastes shifted back to basic jeans, but gave way beginning last year to fashion jeans. **********Popular fashion styles include ''stonewashed'' denim jeans, which are washed, as the name suggests, in pebbles to give them a worn look. Baggy cuts are in as well, as are jeans made with striped and nondenim fabrics. **********''We can't take anything for granted any more,'' said Thomas M. Kasten, president of the jeanswear division of Levi Strauss. ''Today, there is the basic business, but the element of fashion has entered into it. In a fashion business, there is more risk.'' **********For Levi and Blue Bell, the two big jeans makers that have been hit hardest by the new marketplace environment, strategies for gaining back lost ground focus on building stronger ties to retailers and consumers, broadening product lines outside of jeans and selling jeans with marketing techniques such as gift-giveaways that were pioneered by packaged goods makers. **********In-Store Observations **********To learn what consumers want, Levi executives have been working in stores as clerks and sales people in recent months, selling both Levi and competitors' products. Levi's president, Robert Haas, who was named chief executive in April, spent a day in a department store near the company's San Francisco headquarters last Christmas. **********''I came back with three pages of notes,'' said Mr. Kasten of his similar outing. ''You can learn a lot from talking to the consumer.'' Levi is spending about $150 million this year to promote the Levi name, up from $119 million last year. In response to the fashion trend, the company is offering its basic button-fly jeans in stonewashed, striped, black and other styles. It declined to disclose actual sales figures. **********Levi has also recruited the designer Perry Ellis to create a fashion line, including its first designer jean. The move, which the company resisted for years, is also intended to mend fences with many department stores, which were upset when Levi began distributing its jeans through J. C. Penney and Sears, Roebuck & Company stores in 1982. The Perry Ellis line will be offered beginning next year only department stores that now carry Perry Ellis. **********In February, Blue Bell became the first of the big three jeans makers to establish a private label jeans division. Private label jeans, in which the product is sold under a store name or brand, such as Sears Toughskins, account for about 40 percent of all jeans sales. Because private labels offer retailers bigger profit margins, it is one of the faster-growing segments of the jeans business. **********Private Label Market **********The company, which sells jeans mainly through discount stores and mass merchandisers, sees private label as one way to break into the upscale department store market. Macy's sells jeans under its Great Plains label, for example. **********''People like that have to have their goods made somewhere,'' said William Hervey, president of Blue Bell's Wrangler Menswear division. **********According to Mr. Hervey, the company sees room to grow in the discount stores as well with new products such as fashion-type jeans and jean complements such as tops and jackets. In the past year the company has doubled production of fashion jeans, to between 20 percent and 30 percent of its jeans output. It is spending $30 million to $50 million this year on promotions and advertising. **********Lee Apparel, which is considered the industry's leading innovator, plans no major changes in its formula, executives say. It produces jeans in 17 different ''fits'' - styles for different body shapes - in 25 plants, up from 17 plants three years ago. To increase sales, Lee will begin selling jeans through Sears and Penney's this year. It declined to disclose its marketing budget. **********In addition, the company has moved quickly into fashion jeans, where profit margins average 10 to 15 percent higher than basic jeans. ''Two years ago, 90 percent of our business was basic jeans and 10 percent was fashion,'' said Kathy Ferguson, Lee's vice president for marketing development. ''Now we're 25 percent to 30 percent fashion.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/14/world/hotel-blast-stirs-fear-of-an-ira-fall-offensive.html": {"writer_name": "Jo Thomas", "pub_date": "1984-10-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 641, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HOTEL BLAST STIRS FEAR OF AN I.R.A.

Today there were signs that the bombing on Friday of the hotel in Brighton where Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was staying was only the beginning of an autumn offensive. **********Today, in Newry, near the southeast border of Northern Ireland, a 20-pound bomb was defused after it was found in a shopping cart at the back of a shop. The I.R.A. admitted responsibility, said the bomb was meant for the ''crown forces,'' and warned it intended to intensify operations in the area. **********After the bombing of the Harrods department store in London last December - an attack the I.R.A. said was not authorized - bombings stopped on the mainland, and violence in Northern Ireland dropped to about half of last year's levels. British authorities who were interviewed recently attributed the lull to the I.R.A.'s attempts to win votes for candidates of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the organization. **********''If you are trying to to win votes,'' one Northern Ireland official said last week, ''you won't blow people up.''  Poor Showing in Vote **********But last June Sinn Fein's candidate in the elections for a European Parliament, Danny Morrison, did poorly against the leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party of Northern Ireland, John Hume, who received 147,000 votes to 91,000 for Mr. Morrison. **********''Their assessment is they might have peaked,'' the Northern Ireland official said. **********In recent months I.R.A. attacks have been largely confined to rural border areas, which are difficult to secure, and to attacks on members of the security forces, particularly in Londonderry. In Belfast the calm has spawned a profusion of new restaurants and shops and talk by the authorities of ''reintroducing normality.'' **********Even before the I.R.A.'s veiled threat to Mrs. Thatcher after the Brighton bombing - ''We only have to be lucky once. You will have to be lucky always.'' - officials were pointing to recent patterns to predict more I.R.A. violence. **********For example, Douglas Hurd has just been installed as Northern Ireland Secretary. Two months after his predecessor, James Prior, took the post, the Rev. Robert Bradford became the first Northern Ireland Member of Parliament to be assassinated. In Mr. Hurd's first formal speech, on Oct. 3, he said the ''increasing effectiveness of the measures taken against terrorism'' was due in no small measure to increasing support for the police from ''the public at large.'' The phrase incensed nationalists. **********Last month's seizure of arms, including two Browning armor-piercing heavy machine guns, also worried authorities in Northern Ireland, who pointed out that the I.R.A. had always responded with violence after a major setback. Sinn Fein's annual conference will be held in Dublin in three weeks, and there has been speculation that the I.R.A. needed a morale-booster. **********The timing of the Brighton blast was seen by Irish and British politicians as an effort to enrage the Conservative Party on the eve of talks on Northern Ireland between Mrs. Thatcher and Garret FitzGerald, the Irish Prime Minister. There is a considerable gap in the thinking of the Governments, but there has been optimism in Dublin that the talks could bring progress. **********The conference is expected to take place near the end of November, and had been scheduled for Dublin. Today Irish authorities were reassessing security there and raised the possibility that there might be less risk in Britain. **********Mr. Prior said Friday that he thought the Brighton bomb had been planted by an I.R.A. cell that had been lying low in Britain for some time.

The main one, Hydrocryl, a material used to make dentures, is designed for used by dentists and dental laboratories. Dento-Med says it is also planning to introduce a denture adhesive to be sold directly to consumers. **********So far, Mr. Tauman said, only ''tiny'' quantities of Hydrocryl have been sold. **********The key ingredient for Hydrocryl is Hydron, a clear polymer that is designed to absorb saliva and form a seal and a cushion of moisture that holds dentures firmly in place, making them more comfortable, Mr. Tauman said. **********The patent for Hydron is held by the National Patent Development Corporation, a contact lens manufacturer, which last July sold the exclusive rights for the oral use of Hydron to Dento-Med for 600,000 shares, Mr. Tauman said. **********The current leader in the denture material market is Lucitone, an acrylic material produced by the L. D. Caulk Company of York, Pa. **********Mixed Reviews **********Hydrocryl is receiving mixed reviews from those in the field. **********''It's an interesting, innovative material, but I don't know if it's any better than what's on the market,'' said Richard J. Mitchell, a researcher at the University of Kentucky's College of Dentistry who conducted laboratory studies on Hydrocryl. ''I think there's probably more excitement in the stock market than in dentistry.'' **********The American Dental Association, which certified the product in May, said Hydrocryl meets its standards for denture material. Certification allows the company to carry the association's seal on the product and advertise it in trade journals. **********''But it's not all that unusual that a product would meet the specifications,'' said Wayne Wozniak, assistant secretary for the association's Council on Dental Materials. ''There are between 40 and 50 products meeting them.'' **********Norbert Richter, head of a dental laboratory based in New York, said the product was not proving to be very popular. ''I know of very few labs or dentists that use it because the company's claims of water absorption and all that have not been proved,'' he said. **********Dento-Med was started in 1948 in New York as Oral Craft Inc. by Irving Tauman, Mr. Tauman's father, who died last year. It was primarily a dental laboratory manufacturing dentures, crowns and bridges for dentists. **********Mr. Tauman joined the company at the age of 12 and watched it grow in the 1960's to one of the largest dental lab's in the country, employing 256 technicians, Mr. Tauman said. **********But as the company's research operations grew, he said, it became apparent that the future lay in the production of denture material. **********Laboratory Sold **********When Dento-Med obtained the license for the use of Hydron, the company's laboratory, which had retail sales of $2 million, was therefore sold to concentrate on selling Hydrocryl, Mr. Tauman said. **********''We had to eliminate our other work because we'd be directly competing with the laboratories we would be trying to sell to,'' Mr. Tauman said. **********Dento-Med's employees include Mr. Tauman's son and wife and a lab researcher. Mr. Tauman said the company has no short- or long-term borrowing obligations. **********Mr. Tauman added that the company has some $3 million in cash, $2 million from the private placement of stock several months ago, for a big promotional campaign and to expand its research and development department to produce other dental and oral hygiene products. **********Before the public offering in 1970, Mr. Tauman made the first private placement of 100,000 shares, at $2 each, to a small group of investors that included a New York dentist, Oddvin Lokken, now one of the principal shareholders and the inventor of the company's new dental adhesive. **********While Hydrocryl has been sold directly to some 4,000 dental supply houses and dentists, test marketing has been small compared with the company's plans. **********Ben Roher, head of Healthco laboratories in Boston, which distributes Hydrocryl, said that with the marketing effort, the product could sell. **********''The problem has been not the product but the company's promotion,'' he said. ''You can have an excellent product but if you don't push it, you can't sell it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/16/business/finance-new-issues-gte-preferred-offering-grows.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-10-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GTE Preferred Offering Grows", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; GTE Preferred Offering Grows", "body_text": " **********The GTE Corporation's offering of convertible adjustable preferred stock at a price of $50 a share was increased to 1.3 million shares, from a million shares.

The addition of transmitters, particularly closer to the Soviet Union, is aimed at overcoming the jamming carried on by the Soviet Union and its allies, the officials said. **********New or Improved Sites **********In the last year, Administration officials said, the Voice of America has negotiated agreements either for new sites or to improve existing ones in Morocco, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Costa Rica and Belize. **********According to the officials, the project in Israel is deemed so important that President Reagan sent a personal message to Prime Minister Shimon Peres recently endorsing the request. **********The Voice of America would probably share a transmitter in Israel with Radio Liberty, a station paid for by the United States that broadcasts only to the Soviet Union. **********Local Languages **********In recent years, the United States has given priority to sending strong broadcasts in the local languages to the Soviet Central Asian republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan and to the Caucasian republics of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan, all areas in which there are often reports of hostility toward the central Government in Moscow. Broadcasts to these areas would also be picked up by Soviet troops in nearby Afghanistan, officials said. **********As part of the $1.5 billion plan, the Voice of America is to increase the number of languages it broadcasts in from 42 to 60, the officials said. **********The Soviet Union tries to jam Voice broadcasts in all languages except English, the officials said, as do all the East European allies of the Russians except Hungary. **********The modernization plan, which is expected to take five to six years, was authorized by Congress in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 1983, Administration officials said. Because it is often a sensitive issue for foreign governments to acknowledge that they allow the Voice of America to have equipment on their territory, the negotiations are often secret and the agreements classified, with only appropriate committees of Congress being notified. **********Israeli officials in recent days have been quoted by the Israeli press and radio as saying that Israel had agreed in principle to the American request, but American officials said they were awaiting a formal response. ''And once they agree in principle there still would have to be extensive negotiations,'' one official said. **********Currently the Voice of America has transmitters in Delano and Dixon, Calif; Marathon, Fla; Bethany, Ohio, and Greenville, S.C. A large transmitter is planned for Puerto Rico. Additionally, the Marathon location will be used by Radio Marti, the new AM station that is to broadcast to Cuba. **********The broadcasts from the United States are then sent by satellite to relay stations abroad, which broadcast them on shortwave or AM bands. **********The Voice of America has transmitters in Greece, on the island of Rhodes and on the mainland at Kavalla. The Rhodes transmitter is primarily responsible for broadcasts to the Soviet Union and the Middle East. Administration officials said a new transmitter in Israel would be desirable because broadcasts from there could penetrate the Soviet Union better. **********Negotiations have been under way since last summer to renew the rights to use transmitters in Greece. **********The Voice of America also shares a shortwave installation with the British Broadcasting Corporation in Britain, and has one in West Germany, near Munich. It has transmitters in the Philippines, Morocco, Liberia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Botswana.   The New Accords **********In the last year, the officials said, agreement was reached with Morocco and Sri Lanka on building new, larger transmitters. **********Thai officials agreed to the construction of a new shortwave installation to augment an AM transmitter, the officials said, while Costa Rica and Belize each agreed to construction of AM transmitters. **********In addition, negotiations are under way to build four more AM transmitters in Central America and four or five in the Caribbean. The goal is to blanket the area with programming originated by the Voice of America that can be picked up by people with ordinary AM radios. **********Officials would not disclose the names of the countries with which the United States is discussing the Central America-Caribbean program. **********Administration officials said discussions were also being conducted with several Middle Eastern, African and Far Eastern countries on establishing transmitters there. **********Israeli officials said they felt some pressure from the Reagan Administration to put up the transmitter. They said the United States had asked such permission before and been refused. **********Even though the Israelis have no diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and have long been critical of Moscow's support for Arabs, the Israelis said they have tried to avoid openly aggravating relations with the Soviet Union so as not to give Moscow an additional reason to stop emigration of Jews to Israel. **********The Voice of America would not use transmitters in Israel to broadcast to the Arab Middle East, the officials said, so as not to cause problems with Arab countries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/07/world/court-supports-thatcher-s-ban-on-unions-at-intelligence-center.html": {"writer_name": "R.

Last year the battleground for this institutional rivalry was Lebanon; this year it seems likely to be El Salvador and the neighboring countries of Honduras and Nicaragua.  In recent days the Reagan Administration has renewed its accusations that Congress was using the War Powers Act to undermine the executive's ability to make foreign policy. But lawmakers from both parties argue that events in Central America last week graphically demonstrated the need for a Congressional check upon foreign policy initiatives by the executive branch. **********The latest round in this struggle was touched off last Wednesday, when Secretary of State George P. Shultz challenged the constitutionality of the War Powers Act and told a Senate subcommittee that the Administration's ability to control its foreign policy had been ''constantly undercut'' by Congressional meddling. **********Flights by U.S. Pilots Reported **********The next day legislators awoke to news reports that United States pilots had been flying reconnaissance missions in direct tactical support of Salvadoran combat units. Moreover, Senator Jim Sasser, a Tennessee Democrat, told the Senate he had been informed by the Defense Department that United States advisers in the region had been fired upon three times in recent months, a statement that the Pentagon sought to modify the next day. **********Many on Capitol Hill reacted with concern and alarm, and Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. asked the House Foreign Affairs Committee to determine whether the War Powers Act had been violated. Senator Sasser summed up a common view in this way, ''Congress should reassert its effort to be a watchdog in Central America and be even more demanding of the Administration in ascertaining what its intentions are there.'' **********Republican strategists have long worried that Mr. Reagan could be vulnerable to the charge that he charts a ''trigger happy'' and unstable course in foreign matters. And some legislators maintain that the Administration's persistent criticism of Congress and of the War Powers Act has a political purpose and is aimed at shifting the blame for any foreign policy failures to Capitol Hill.   'Trying to Cover Themselves' **********''There's no question,'' said Representative Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut, a Democratic member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, ''that the Administration's desire to focus attention on the process is a direct result of the failure of their policy. They're trying to cover themselves before the election.'' **********Other legislators express concern that the President and his aides may be trying to intimidate Congress and carry out a pre-emptive strike against the War Powers Act before expanding the military involvement in Central America.  Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, noted that the Administration was seeking a court test of the War Powers Act, and rhetorically asked the Senate why that was so. His answer: ''Because Ronald Reagan does not want to be bound even by the War Powers Act if he decides to go to war in El Salvador.'' **********The debate between the executive and legislative branches over foreign policy goes back to the Constitution. Congress is granted the right to declare war, but the President is the Commander in Chief, and, as Representative Dante B. Fascell, Democrat of Florida and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, put it, the key question about the two institutions is, ''Where do you draw the line?''  Prompted by Vietnam War **********In the aftermath of the Vietnam War, Congress adopted the War Powers Act to help draw that line. Under the act the President is required to notify Congress whenever United States troops enter a combat zone or face imminent hostilities. The troops must then be withdrawn within 60 days unless Congress grants authority for them to remain. **********Congress has generally been reluctant to invoke the act, or, alternatively, to set severe limits on Presidential actions through the appropriations process. In the case of Lebanon, for instance, the lawmakers adopted a resolution under the War Powers Act approving the Marine mission for 18 months, and defeated attempts to shorten the time period or cut off funds for the mission. **********Last week, as the Senate debated a bill providing $62 million in aid for El Salvador, the legislators defeated two amendments by Senator Kennedy that would have required the President to get Congressional approval before sending combat troops to the region. **********The main reason that Congress is reluctant to take such drastic legislative steps is a widespread belief that the President must have considerable flexibility in foreign policy. Moreover, the President's counterattack against Congress has clearly made an impact.   Congress Said to Fear Blame **********''There is a reluctance around here to be too assertive on Central America,'' Senator Sasser said. ''People fear Congress will be blamed by the Administration for losing Central America if things go awry there.'' **********But Congress is becoming more outspoken as the news from Central America suggests a deepening United States military involvement.  While the legislators are reluctant to tie the President's hands too tightly, they also influence policy in more subtle ways, through the sort of statements and signals that emanated from Capitol Hill all last week. **********Just by calling for an investigation of possible violation of the War Powers Act, Speaker O'Neill puts pressure on the Administration to move more carefully. Moreover, the War Powers Act, at least as seen by the legislators, provides Congress with a continuing mechanism for consulting with the Administration on an evolving policy.   Undue Constraint Seen **********To Congress, that monitoring role is essential. But to Mr. Shultz and the President, the whole process unduly constrains the executive branch in carrying out foreign policy. **********In addition, statements like Mr. O'Neill's focus public attention on the Central American situation. So do amendments like Senator Kennedy's, even if they are defeated. As a result, policy makers are forced to consider Congressional and public opinion before expanding their commitments. **********It was not an accident, for example, that immediately after Senator Sasser's statement and the disclosure of the use of reconnaissance planes in direct support of Salvadoran Government forces that the implications of all this on the War Powers Act were immediately reviewed by White House officials. To that extent, without ever being invoked by Congress, the law was serving as a constraint upon the executive branch."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/12/business/business-people-chief-named-at-fluor-other-officers-promoted.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1984-09-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 283, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE ; ;  Chief Named at Fluor; Other Officers Promoted", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE ; ;  Chief Named at Fluor; Other Officers Promoted", "body_text": " **********David S.

Eager for any favorable omen, Western analysts and bankers have seized on a number of financial and trade developments during the past year as happy evidence of improvement in the Mexican economy. **********This positive assessment has been echoed through cheery editorials in the nation's largest newspapers, with headlines such as ''Progress in Mexico,'' ''Mexico's Strength'' and ''Mexico: Cause for Optimism.'' It has also resulted in close to $4 billion in additional loans to Mexico for 1984 at relatively low interest rates from American bankers. Justifying their unaccustomed generosity, the bankers cited positive factors stemming from Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado's stringent austerity program. **********Yet, a realistic sifting of the most significant Mexican statistics ought to prompt gloom rather than articulations of joy. For example, the highly publicized swing from a trade deficit of $4.5 billion in 1981 to a $6.6 billion surplus in 1982 and an even greater surplus in 1983 turns out not to be a favorable event once we get past the glare of the numbers. **********Although positive trade balances are the dream of third-world technocrats, the Mexican surplus was neither the result of a Herculean gain in exports nor of a dramatic boot-strap increase in domestic productivity. It came about instead through a crippling contraction of imports. **********Exports last year went nowhere at all - hovering around the $21 billion level of 1982 - whereas imports were slashed from nearly $24 billion in 1981 to $14.4 billion for the following year and then to an estimated $8 billion for 1983. Although attractive window dressing, this sharp decline is dangerous because it was achieved at a devastating cost to domestic production. It was the unavailability of foreign-sourced raw materials, machinery and replacement parts that contributed to the decline in the country's output last year. **********Moreover, as we continue staring at the Mexican statistics it becomes apparent that the components of export earnings have been as static as the dollar volumes themselves. In 1983, oil and related products generated 75 percent of export earnings, as was the case in 1981 and 1982. There can be no joy here until we see a decline in that figure and a significant jump in export earnings from manufactured and agricultural goods. **********However, here is where Mexico is chasing its tail. There can be no real improvement in its manufacturing exports without an increase in the imports of raw materials and equipment essential for production, which in turn would have an immediate adverse impact on the balance of trade - thereby fogging that image of functioning austerity. **********IN addition to misreading the trade numbers, analysts attached too much significance to the prompt repayment by Mexico of the 1982 bridging loans extended by the United States Government and the Bank for International Settlements. These emergency loans were made following the virtual collapse of the Mexican economy in the late summer of 1982 and ought not be confused with the loans made to Mexico as part of the renegotiation of its existing debt. Their on-time repayment should have been interpreted as an indication that things were not getting worse, rather than that they were getting better. **********Moreover, the primary worry remains one of how the Mexicans will be able to maintain interest payments of more than $10 billion a year on their $80 billion to $90 billion in foreign debt, much less try to deal with the repayments of the debt itself, which supposedly must be resumed in a couple of years. More likely than not, there will be another one of those convoluted international arrangements that will result in a postponement or stretching out of interest payments into the far-distant and less- menacing future. **********The level of inflation also received hyperbolic treatment, with statements that the 75 percent rate for 1983 was significantly lower than the 100 percent-plus rate of the previous year. However, one must keep in mind that there probably are as many ways to estimate inflation as there are to stuff an enchilada. So while the Consumer Price Index shows an 82 percent increase from December 1982 to December 1983, other estimates of inflation in 1983 exceed 100 percent. And conveniently forgotten by all concerned was the Mexican target of a 55 percent inflation ceiling for 1983. **********But of all the depressing numbers, the unrelenting 2-percent-plus growth in the population each year is the most debilitating and frustrating, and it exerts an inexorable drag on the most ambitious and well-intentioned of recovery programs. By the end of this century there will be an additional 20 million to 25 million Mexicans who will have to be fed and sheltered and whose minimal aspirations will have to be met.  The Mexican Government is already in the onerous position of having to import foodstuffs to feed its current population. And this agricultural condition probably will continue for the remainder of the decade. **********Is there cause for any optimism? Undoubtedly there are some who are patiently waiting for another surge in oil prices, and those of us with even a modest grasp of recent history cannot discount such a possibility. But for anyone who tries to function in reality, the wisest assumption must be that there will be no profound improvement in the Mexican economy during the rest of this century. Nor can we assume that the current austerity program can stay in effect forever. At some point, political and social pressures will require its modification. **********Fortunately for Mexico, it borders the United States, and this juxtaposition will prove of greatest value - not because illegal Mexican immigrants are welcomed in California's sweatshops, but because Washington cannot tolerate an unstable country on its border. To preclude such a development, the current as well as future administrations in Washington will continue to encourage trade with Mexico and American investment there, and to support loans and agricultural credits for the Latin country. **********Most Mexican officials and businessmen reluctantly realize this, their acceptance of the fact complicated by hostility toward the United States over an historically one-sided relationship. This ambiguity shows up in the attitude of the current Mexican Administration, which openly encourages greater American investment, while refusing to amend the law that restricts foreign investors to a minority position in joint ventures. It probably also accounts for the recent newspaper headlines in Mexico blaming foreign corporations for its agricultural woes. **********However, most seasoned American executives are too wise to move precipitously on new investments in Mexico or elsewhere simply on the basis of some half-hearted official encouragement or because of the transparent optimism of the banking community.

What the white authorities call a ''new dispensation'' offers places in Parliament to Indians and people of mixed race for the first time, but excludes the country's black majority of 20 million people. **********In elections a week ago for the parliamentary chamber representing people of mixed race, only 18 percent of those eligible to vote turned out, about 30 percent of those who had registered. The participation rate among the 800,000- strong Indian majority, to judge from early, urban returns, seemed to be hovering around 17 percent of those registered. Three-quarters of the Indians eligible to cast ballots had registered to do so.  In the Indian town of Lenasia, outside Johannesburg, about 500 demonstrators gathered to protest the exclusion of black people from the ''new dispensation.'' **********More Than 100 Hurt **********The police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the demonstrators, and officials at an emergency medical center said more than 100 people were injured in a day of baton-charges. Protesters hurled petrol bombs at the police and four shots were fired from a speeding car during the unrest, a police spokesman said. **********About 20 journalists covering the event were ''whipped and beaten'' in the police charges, witnesses said. A police spokesman said it was ''just bad luck'' that they had been caught up in the fighting. **********Four police officers were injured, one seriously when demonstrators overturned his car. In what seemed unrestrained police attacks, witnesses reported, a 9-year-old Indian girl, identified as Sayedah Nosarka, was beaten on the thigh when she was caught up in the battle on her way home from Arabic classes. Witnesses said an unidentified police officer paused in his charge to strike the child with what is called a sjambok, a baton about three feet long. **********Unrest also spread to three black townships in the province of Transvaal, where pupils boycotting classes stoned buses and their own schools. A house in Johannesburg's satellite of Soweto was also set on fire. Police in Lenasia were also reported to have surrounded a minibus, smashing its windows and beating students inside.   40-Member Chamber for Indians **********The bulk of South Africa's Indians live in the province of Natal, where most are concentrated around this port city. Most polling stations in Durban seemed quiet. The turnout indicated by the initial returns was lower than the 20 percent predicted by those political groups taking part in the elections, which offer Indians seats in a 40-member house of Parliament, segregated from the 80-member chamber for people of mixed race and the 160-seat chamber for whites. **********Whites endorsed the new Constitution providing for the three-chamber Parliament in a referendum last November. It did not come before nonwhites, however, and the voting to elect members of the nonwhite parliamentary chambers was viewed not so much a political race between various groups as an indication of the popularity of the changes among Indian and mixed-race people. **********The black majority has been given no formal platform to express its views. **********The low turnout among Indian voters - mostly descendants of indentured laborers who came to South Africa in waves of immigration from 1860 onward to work on Natal's sugarcane plantations - represented a success for the United Democratic Front, a broad alliance formed a year ago to oppose the constitutional changes.   Intimidation Is Charged **********The front's most prominent affiliate in this region is the Natal Indian Congress, founded 90 years ago by Mahatma Gandhi and the oldest of Africa's protest movements. The authorities accused the Congress of intimidating Indians to stop them from voting. **********South Africa's Indian minority is 80 percent Hindu, with Moslems and Gujaratis making up the total. Isolated from black and white alike, the community is the subject of many pressures.  Durban, for instance, is largely encircled by South Africa's biggest black group, the Zulus, numbering six million. In 1949 hundreds were killed when Zulus attacked Indians, and the memory still lingers with many. Thus, foreign specialists said, one factor contributing to the Indian boycott was a fear of alienating the Zulus, who, like other blacks, are not included in the new Parliament, which will be dominated by whites and led by a white executive president with potentially authoritarian powers. The Zulu leader, Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, has threatened an economic boycott against those Indians taking part in the ''new dispensation.''  Many Ballots Were Mailed **********The changes offer little prospect of reform in those aspects of the system of racial compartmentalization, called apartheid, that affect Indians the most. Unlike black people, Indians are not required to carry passes permitting them to be in designated areas. But they may only reside in areas set aside for them under the Group Areas Act, a pillar of apartheid. That legislation, the Government has said, will not be repealed by the new Parliament. **********Many of the votes cast in today's elections were postal ballots, underscoring the unwillingness of Indians to be seen endorsing the legislative changes, which seek to widen the Government's base while securing power in white hands. **********In tandem with last week's mixed- race vote, South African commentators said, today's ballot seemed to present the white authorities with a major challenge in establishing - in foreign and nonwhite South African eyes - the credibility of its new approach to racial differentiation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/20/world/us-to-sell-military-transport-planes-to-taiwan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 434, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. TO SELL MILITARY TRANSPORT PLANES TO TAIWAN", "print_headline": "U.S. TO SELL MILITARY TRANSPORT PLANES TO TAIWAN", "body_text": " **********The Pentagon announced the sale of 12 C-130 military transports to Taiwan today.

But the almost simultaneous shellfire from the battleship New Jersey against targets ashore has left unclear what happens next for United States policy. **********A key question is whether the pullback of the Marines to Sixth Fleet ships and the resumption of fire by the New Jersey's 16-inch guns is a tactical ''redeployment,'' as President Reagan has insisted, and thus a prelude to even more intense use of American naval and air power to shore up President Amin Gemayel against his Lebanese opponents. **********The ground rules for the departure of the Marines as announced by Mr. Reagan on Feb. 7 certainly have left that as a possibility. And it is the chance of a stepped-up military operation in Lebanon, with Marine combat units gone, that has renewed criticism in Congress of the Administration's policy. **********Disengagement Also Possible **********Another possibility is that the Marines' withdrawal marks the start of a process that will actually lead to the disengagement of the United States from the Lebanese political and military struggles. **********If that is the case, the naval shelling of Lebanon Saturday night and again today could be seen as necessary to remind the Syrians and others not to try to humiliate the American diplomats and other personnel in Lebanon, and to prevent Mr. Reagan's critics from saying that he had done what he said he would not do - ''cut and run'' from Lebanon. **********Such an interpretation is possible, given the private and public statements of disillusionment with Lebanon made by top officials over the last 10 days, and their desire to get away from the crisis there as an impediment to Mr. Reagan's re-election. **********Ambiguity is often deliberately chosen by policy-makers as the course to follow when they do not want an adversary to be certain about American policy. But in this case, the uncertainty about what will happen next seems to flow not so much from a Presidential desire to appear equivocal as from the inability here to predict what the future holds for Mr. Gemayel and the other players in the Lebanese political scene. **********''We're waiting to see what emerges,'' a senior State Department official said today. It is evident, from discussions with officials in recent days, that the situation in Beirut has demoralized many senior officials who feel cut off from having much impact on what will take place in Lebanon.   Official Cites 'New Policy' **********When a reporter called up a senior State Department official last week to ask about the latest developments in Lebanon, the official, who only a few weeks ago had said American ''credibility'' depended on not pulling the Marines out, replied in a deadpan tone of voice: ''Lebanon? Where's Lebanon?'' **********He then went on to say: **********''You don't understand. We now have a new policy in Lebanon. It goes like this: Lebanon is a country that has been at war for a thousand years. We did what we could to bring some order to the place, but it is obvious that nobody there wants order, and so we're turning our attention now to wider issues of reviving the Middle East peace process and letting the Lebanese fight their own battles.'' **********There is little confidence in Washington that with the Marines gone, Mr. Gemayel will remain as the independent political leader of Lebanon. On the other hand, some officials noted that many in Washington predicted two weeks ago that he would have resigned by now. Instead, he is still President and still bargaining with the various factions and the Syrians on a formula for survival.   Military Shipments Continuing **********Military aid shipments to Lebanon have not been suspended, officials said, but they are being monitored on a case- by-case basis to insure that no heavy equipment like armored personnel carriers falls into the hands of the Syrian- backed forces. **********This is because of the disintegration of the Lebanese Army, which found its Shiite members refusing to fight against the anti-Government Shiite Amal militia. **********In his statement Feb. 7 announcing the intention of removing the Marines from the airport, Mr. Reagan said that to ''enhance the safety of American and other multinational force personnel in Lebanon'' he had authorized naval gunfire and air support against two types of targets. **********The first, he said, was ''any units firing into greater Beirut from part of Lebanon controlled by Syria,'' and the second, ''any units directly attacking American or multinational force personnel and facilities.'' **********''We will stand firm to deter those who seek to influence Lebanon's future by intimidation,'' the President said.   90 Rounds Fired by Destroyer **********According to Defense and State Department officials today, the destroyer Caron fired 90 rounds into the hills around Beirut Saturday because American military personnel serving as advisers to Lebanese Army units had come under fire. On Saturday night, a Defense Department spokesman said that the fire had been directed at marines, but did not specify where they were. **********''They were not on a boat or landing craft going out to the ships,'' he said. ''They were on the ground somewhere there with the remainder of the United States forces.'' **********The New Jersey opened fire today because, officials said, antiaircraft missiles had been launched against an American plane on a reconnaissance mission. Mr. Reagan said last week that American planes had been fired on in recent days but that the United States was trying to show restraint. A White House official said that at the time Mr. Reagan spoke, there had been only ineffective ''pop shots'' from the ground and not sophisticated Soviet- built missiles. **********The White House official said there was no intention by Washington to widen the American military involvement in Beirut, and he said that the use of the New Jersey today had no special symbolic importance on the day the Marines left.  ''I don't think anybody wants to try and kill people for a symbolic gesture,'' he said.   Strong Commitment Implied **********What is most unclear is whether Mr. Reagan stands by his statement of Feb. 7 that the United States would try ''to deter those who seek to influence Leanon's future by intimidation.'' That statement implied a heavy commitment in support of the Lebanese Government, but since then Mr. Gemayel has not endeared himself to Washington by his willingness to cancel the May 17 agreement with Israel, which was worked out by Secretary of State George P. Shultz. **********A key question now is whether Washington should seek to step up its military force to prevent the ''intimidation'' of Mr. Gemayel by the Syrians, or should follow up the Marines' removal to ships by a phaseout of the remaining several hundred Americans, who are attached to the embassy or are training the Lebanese Army. **********The contradictory signals only underscore the lack of reliable information about Lebanon and the lack of American leverage on events there. A major problem is likely to arise soon at Suk al Gharb, the mountain town that overlooks both the presidential palace and the American Ambassador's residence in East Beirut. The residence has been the American command center recently because the embassy facilities in West Beirut are under siege.   Embassy Could Be Endangered **********According to Pentagon officials, the last remaining Lebanese Army unit of some strength still loyal to Mr. Gemayel is the Eighth Brigade, currently holding Suk al Gharb. If it comes under an all-out attack, should the United States reply with heavy naval and air strikes to defend it, as it did in September when the town was under Druse attack? A White House official said that if Suk al Gharb fell, the American Embassy would be in jeopardy. But there are many in Congress who probably would prefer that the embassy be evacuated rather than that the American military role be widened. **********Some State Department officials say that the situation in Beirut, albeit unsatisfctory, may still be salvaged, if the United States does not disavow Mr. Gemayel. **********''This is not Saigon, when the North Vietnamese marched into power and we and the Thieu Government fled for our lives,'' one official said. ''The Lebanese have dealt with each other for years, and they are likely to negotiate something that might produce a kind of compromise if they feel that Gemayel still has some American chips to play. **********''After all,'' he said, ''I don't think they want to be Syrian stooges. And in the end, they know only the United States can influence the Israelis and provide the kind of aid Lebanon needs.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/07/business/executives.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-11-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 237, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "body_text": " ***********  Alco Standard, a diversified corporation based in Valley Forge, Pa., has named William F.

The stock closed yesterday at 32 5/8, down 1/2, on the New York Stock Exchange, after trading as low as 32 1/4. That marked the stock's lowest price since Aug. 11, 1982, two days before the start of the great bull market, when it traded at 30 7/8. **********The stock later rebounded to a high of 47 1/4 in December 1982, but began to lose ground soon thereafter. **********''The most recent price decline in Chesebrough reflects not only the prospect of disappointing earnings for the first three months of this year, but also a pattern of volatility in quarterly profits,'' said Joseph H. Kozloff, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ''Actually, this is a highly diversified consumer-packaging company that derives 40 percent of its revenues from the personal care, or cosmetics, business.'' **********The company's product line includes such familiar household names as Vaseline, Pond's, Cutex, Q-Tips and the Ragu line of spaghetti sauces. It also makes Health-Tex children's clothes, Bass casual footwear, Prince tennis racquets and various hospital products. **********After years of steady growth, Chesebrough's profits have been flat since 1981, when it earned $3.52 a share. Profits were $3.56 a share in 1982 and $3.58 last year. **********The company is expected to announce first-quarter earnings later this month, and Mr. Kozloff expects them to fall to 55 cents a share from 81 cents a share a year earlier. The analyst has also trimmed his profit projection for all of 1984 to $3.85 a share, from $4, and reduced his 1985 estimate to $4.40 a share from $4.50. **********These lower estimates, he said, reflect a combination of heavy advertising spending by Chesebrough and higher interest expense, mainly in the form of short-term bank loans. **********''I've been recommending the stock for the past six months and, obviously, I've been wrong,'' he said. ''But at its present price, you can buy a lot of value in Chesebrough, which I regard as a quality company.'' **********Jack Salzman, who follows Chesebrough for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, is less enthusiastic about the company's prospects. ''We rate the stock as a 'hold,' '' he said, ''but we're concerned about the quarterly earnings volatility.'' **********Merrill Lynch continues to rate Chesebrough ''O.K. to buy'' over the next 12 months and an outright ''buy'' on a long-term basis. Yesterday, however, the company cut its 1984 earnings estimate to $3.75 a share from a range of $3.85 to $3.90 formerly. It also cut the estimate for next year to $4.10 a share. The previous estimate was a range of $4.30 to $4.40 a share. **********As for the cosmetics industry in general, Mr. Salzman of Smith Barney said, ''The basic nuts-and-bolts problem is that this is a mature industry where unit consumption has slowed appreciably.'' For some companies in the beauty business, he added, this has meant a stagnation in earnings. **********Analysts agree that the recent strength of the dollar has also acted to depress the earnings of companies like Chesebrough, which has significant overseas operations. **********Mr. Salzman's favorite stock in skin care and cosmetics is the Noxell Corporation, which he described as the industry's best stock market performer in recent years. ''I have a long-term 'buy' on Noxell,'' he said. One reason given for Noxell's success is that it emphasizes basic cosmetics - lipstick, nail enamel, face and eye makeup - rather than fragrances. **********At Dean Witter, Mr. Kozloff carries a 'hold' rating on Noxell, which he describes as ''a great stock but fully priced at these levels.'' **********Underscoring the changing fashions of the industry over a protracted period, both analysts now regard Avon Products as a ''sell.'' A dozen years ago, Avon was a ''glamour'' stock with a lofty price-earning ratio. **********But its profits have been hurt recently by sluggishness in the direct selling business and, according to Mr. Kozloff, ''a dividend cut by Avon at some point is a possibility.'' **********Perhaps the market's biggest disappointment has been Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc. Its share price has plunged by about 70 percent since last year's record high. According to a study by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, Kay's earnings have been adversely affected by a falloff in the recruitment of new direct-sales personnel, intensified competition and higher costs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/04/business/finance-new-issues-s-p-rating-money-market-funds.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 257, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "S. & P.

Two and a half of their stores disappeared virtually overnight. The shops were razed by the Syrian Government as part of an ambitious restoration project now under way in the Syrian capital. **********The Government's renovation plans in Damascus, which many call the world's oldest continuously inhabited settlement, has touched off a furor, at least by Syrian standards. **********Controls on political expression are tight under the military-dominated Government, but the destruction of hundreds of shops near the historic Citadel, which dates from Roman times, and the walls of the eighth century Umayyad Mosque, one of Islam's holiest shrines, has prompted a vigorous and unusually public debate. **********Letters of praise and protest about the restoration work have been published here in the state-controlled press; public gatherings have been held, and Siham Terjman, author of a book about old Damascus and the leader of the campaign has written an open letter to President Hafez al- Assad, begging him to stop the destruction. She said: ''It was he who authorized this renovation and he who can stop it. History will accuse him if he does not.''  Renovation Is Defended **********Afif Bahnassi, director of Syria's Department of Antiquities and the renovation's prime mover, defended the project in a recent interview. ''Our goal is to preserve the character of the old part of the city, not to destroy it,'' he said. ''No effort has been spared to insure that historically valuable structures are not torn down.'' **********''Of course there is criticism,'' he added. ''Restoration requires courage.'' **********Last summer President Assad approved a plan sponsored by Dr. Bahnassi and the Mayor of Damascus that allocated $2.7 million to restoring the old sectors of the city. **********Since then the Government has leveled about 300 shops, according to official estimates, most of them immediately adjacent to the Citadel and the walls of the Umayyad Mosque. **********The purpose of the destruction is to expose the mosque's 400-foot-long walls, large sections of which were obscured by the shops, some of them built directly off the wall's facade. On the mosque's southern wall, for example, a grand triple entrance gate was almost completely hidden by shops. It and all the walls of the mosque are now entirely visibile, separated from remaining shops by a sand pathway the width of a double-lane highway. **********Dr. Bahnassi said the renovation was already shedding light on the history of the mosque and yielding archeological treasures. **********The Umayyad dynasty, which ruled as caliphs in Damascus from A.D. 661 until 750, built the great mosque on the site of a pagan temple to Jupiter on which Christians had erected the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist. Using the church as a focal point, the Umayyads expanded it into a grander structure that was fronted by a magnificent courtyard. **********''We've had lots of theories about the size of the original courtyard,'' Dr. Bahnassi said. ''But now for the first time we are learning with relative certainty the dimensions of the old courtyard.'' **********He said the restoration had also led to the discovery south of the mosque of a stone gate that predates the Islamic and Roman periods. **********The restoration of the Citadel is disputed just as much. Before the demolitions, only the tops of the Citadel's 12 giant towers were visible. The structure itself has been used as a prison. **********''One of Damascus's most magnificent edifices has been closed to the public except to criminals,'' said Kassem Toueir, director of the Antiquities Department's Center of Research and one of Syria's most respected archeologists. **********The restoration plan calls for moving the prison to a new site outside Damascus. This has widespread support. But the destruction of the city's celebrated leather and crafts souk, or market, near the Citadel has aroused opposition. **********''The life of the city is its artisans and merchants,'' Mrs. Terjman, the leader of the preservationist movement, said. ''Besides, mosques have always been surrounded by shops and intricately connected to an Arab city's commercial life. Its walls have never been 'displayed' in Western museum-style.'' **********The Government says new shops in nearby areas are planned for those displaced by the renovation. In addition, officials maintain, each merchant has been offered compensation for his shop.  But the merchants are not satisfied. The compensation offered does not begin to compensate for the loss of their property, merchants say. Moreover, many do not believe the Government's promise of new shops. Although the destruction began almost a year ago, no shop owner has been shown where his new shop will be, they say. **********Many critics dispute the Government's assertion that the renovation was motivated by esthetic considerations. Security, they contend, was the primary concern. **********''President Assad and senior Syrian officials go to the mosque on special occasions to pray,'' one critic said. ''Official guests are escorted there by Syrian leaders. The shops were torn down so that the cavalcades of limousines could drive to the mosque with greater security.'' **********Syrian officials deny this, although Dr. Toueir acknowledged that the Government was concerned about easing vehicular access to the mosque. ''This city, like most, is struggling to accommodate modern transportation with its cultural and architectural heritage,'' Dr. Toueir said. **********Dr. Toueir added that he was encouraged by the outcry of merchants and critics. ''Initially, many were concerned only about their property,'' he said. ''Now they have become genuinely interested in the fate of old Damascus.'' **********''It's always heartening to see the development of cultural consciousness,'' he said. ''And it's long overdue here.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/29/business/sargent-acquired.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-06-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 97, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sargent Acquired", "print_headline": "Sargent Acquired", "body_text": " **********Sargent Industries said it had reached a definitive agreement to be acquired by the Dover Corporation for $8.90 a share, or about $68 million. **********The boards of both companies have approved the merger.

Another leading candidate had been Heinrich Windelen, the Minister for Intra-German Relations. **********Mr. Jenninger, an affable and popular politician from the southern state of Baden-W\"urttemberg, served as a close aide in the late 1960's to Franz Josef Strauss, the Bavarian politician, when he was Finance Minister.

The comfortable majority held by the Kohl coalition in Parliament guarantees the election. **********In the aftermath of Mr. Barzel's abrupt resignation Thursday, the parliamentary subcommittee investigating the Flick affair continued its deliberations today by questioning Willy Brandt, the chairman of the opposition Social Democratic Party. **********Like many leading Bonn politicians, Mr. Brandt is included on the meticulously detailed payoff lists kept by Flick - in his case for a total of 190,000 marks, or $63,000 at the current exchange rate. Mr. Brandt told the committee he had not received, directly or indirectly, any money from the concern, and he expressed surprise he should be on its lists.   Tax Waivers Are Investigated **********The focus of the subcommittee's inquiry is the granting of $175 million in tax waivers to the Flick holding company in the 1970's at a time when West Germany was governed by a coalition of the Social Democrats and the Free Democrats. Mr. Brandt insisted he had nothing to do with the decision and said it was ''barking up the wrong tree'' to focus on him. **********Mr. Brandt said he did not know the meaning of a subpoenaed July 1979 letter to him from Eberhard von Brauchitsch, the Flick deputy manager, thanking the Social Democratic chairman ''for keeping an eye on the restructuring of our group.'' **********The unauthorized release of documents from the Bonn prosecutor's office and the Flick subcommittee has tarnished the reputations of many politicians, because they are included on the so-called Diehl lists, named after Rudolf Diehl, a company bookkeeper. They include Mr. Kohl, Mr. Strauss and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. **********The acceptance of donations from the Flick concern is not in itself proof of illegal activity. According to West German press accounts, Chancellor Kohl, for example, is on the Diehl list as having received 665,000 marks from Flick, or $221,000 at the current exchange rate, between 1973 and 1980. **********Like other politicians, Mr. Kohl was questioned by the Bonn prosecutor's office in connection with its investigation of the tax waivers, which last July led to the indictment of Otto Lambsdorff, who resigned as Economics Minister. Mr. Kohl's testimony was taken in July 1982.   Some Kohl Testimony Published **********In January 1983, Der Spiegel, the Hamburg weekly, published excerpts of what it said was Mr. Kohl's testimony to the prosecutor's office. In it, Mr. Kohl acknowledged receiving cash contributions from Mr. von Brauchitsch for his election campaigns but put the total lower - ''two or three donations of about 20 or 30-35,000 marks.'' **********The same Spiegel excerpt cites a 1975 von Brauchitsch memorandum recording that Mr. Kohl, who was at the time opposition leader, had guaranteed that the question of granting tax waivers to Flick ''would not be emotionalized in a negative way'' by the left wing of the Christian Democrats. **********The memo said Mr. Kohl had suggested a gathering of ''interested and dangerous'' Christian Democratic deputies so Flick could explain its case for being granted the waivers. Asked by the prosecutor if he could recall such a conversation with Mr. von Brauchitsch, Mr. Kohl answered, ''No,'' according to the Spiegel document. **********Mr. Kohl is scheduled to appear before the parliamentary subcommittee on Nov. 7."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/04/business/business-digest-saturday-august-4-1984.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 654, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "List", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST SATURDAY, AUGUST 4, 1984", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST SATURDAY, AUGUST 4, 1984", "body_text": " **********Markets **********The stock market explosion continued, as institutional investors, heartened by the soundness of the economic recovery, charged into the market.

Mondale's choice of a woman as his running mate as a bold attempt to reshape his political image and to fire up what some feared would become a humdrum, almost hopeless challenge against President Reagan.  By proposing Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro of Queens as the first woman to be nominated by a major party, they said, Mr. Mondale had acquired a political partner whose background and policies seemed tailor-made for offsetting Mr. Reagan's strengths. **********But for a likely Presidential nominee whose career has been characterized by cautious weighing of odds, Mr. Mondale's decision also represented a gamble that the choice would win more votes among younger women than it would lose among middle-aged men. Votes from these two groups are most likely to be swayed, polls indicate. **********In the euphoria of the moment, however, Democratic leaders here seemed eager to ignore the political dangers courted by the former Vice President in making his bold move. Mrs. Ferraro, in her third term in the House, is almost a novice political figure in comparison to what the Republicans will be offering in the Reagan-Bush ticket. **********Also, while the Democrats stressed Mrs. Ferraro's potential for solidifying the party's base in the East, her candidacy seemed of uncertain value in the South and Southwest where Mr. Mondale must take some electoral votes away from Mr. Reagan to win in November. **********But in general, Democratic leaders cheered Mr. Mondale for recognizing that he needed to take some risks if he was to overtake Mr. Reagan. ''When it comes down to the big call, he makes the gutty move,'' Representative Tony Coelho of California, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said today. **********Admiring Reviews From Party **********In her televised appearance with Mr. Mondale today in St. Paul, Mrs. Ferraro's relaxed use of Mr. Reagan's themes of family values, patriotism and a strong defense won admiring reviews from Democratic officials and delegates gathering in San Francisco for the party's national convention. **********Democratic strategists said that at a time when their party has to reverse Mr. Reagan's inroads among blue-collar and ethnic voters in the cities, the fact that Mrs. Ferraro is an Italian Roman Catholic from Queens may be as big an asset as her gender. **********''What better contrast could you have than the Congresswoman from Archie Bunker's district with the striped-belt, oil-baron crowd of George Bush?'' said Peter D. Hart, the polltaker for the Mondale campaign. **********Tipoff on Strategy **********Both Democratic and Republican Party strategists also said they regarded the forming of the Mondale- Ferraro ticket as a tipoff of the Mondale campaign's geographic strategy for the general election campaign. **********''It's clearly a decision to go for the Rust Belt and the Middle West and take their chances in the South,'' said a Democratic Party professional. **********Other Democrats also predicted that the ''energizing effect'' of the choice might give Mr. Mondale a better chance of carrying such important states as Texas and California by increasing turnout among women and minorities. **********Even Bert Lance, the Georgia party chairman who had strenuously urged Mr. Mondale to put a Southerner on the ticket, predicted that the choice might give the Democrats a chance in Reagan strongholds in the Sun Belt. **********However, Mr. Lance observed that by putting a Northeastern woman on the ticket, Mr. Mondale had, in effect, committed himself to spending more of his own campaign time in the South and Southwest.  Mr. Lance's remark represented one of the Democrats' few admissions that there might be drawbacks to Mr. Mondale's choice. Otherwise, party leaders brushed aside suggestions that Mr. Mondale ''wrote off'' the nation's more conservative regions and basked in rhetoric about the party's ''electric mood.'' **********The selection of Mrs. Ferraro confirmed predictions by the director of the Reagan re-election committee, Edward J. Rollins, that the Democrats would adopt an Eastern-Middle Western strategy with New York as its ''anchor.'' **********The decision was also regarded as raising new tactical problems for the Republicans because Mrs. Ferraro is linked to population groups that they have targeted. **********Neither Mr. Reagan nor his main spokesmen had much to say about Mr. Mondale's choice. The President, traveling in Kentucky, would only say that he was ''looking forward to running against the Democratic ticket.'' Some Republicans singled out Mrs. Ferraro's lack of foreign policy experience, but otherwise they kept their peace, allowing the Democrats a rare day of favorable news coverage and unanswered boasting.   'She Adds Excitement' **********Some Democrats said they felt that Mrs. Ferraro, based on her appearance today, might have corrected an imbalance in publicity appeal that has worked in the Republicans' favor. **********''She adds excitement to the ticket,'' said Mr. Coelho. ''She has that star quality, that twinkle in her eye that Reagan has and that Bush and Mondale don't have.'' **********In general, however, the commentary centered less on the appeal of the ticket than on Mr. Mondale's apparent success in burnishing his image and providing a fresh chance for his campaign to overtake Mr. Reagan. **********''What it answers once and for all are the questions that are sometimes raised about Mondale's being a little too stolid, a little too Norwegian,'' said Ann F. Lewis, the political director of the Democratic National Committee. ''What he's done is bold, precedent- shattering and history making.'' **********This was a day of triumph for Mrs. Lewis, a leader in the movement for a female candidate. She also crafted the main line of argument against predictions that a woman on the ticket would drive away as many votes as it attracted.   Wide Appeal Predicted **********Mrs. Lewis said Mrs. Ferraro's candidacy would create such excitement among women, minority voters of both sexes and political progressives as to transcend the usual boundaries of geography and ideology. **********''Go around today,'' she said. ''Ask the women behind the counters. Talk to the woman driving the cab. Ask the black doorman at the hotel who told me either Dianne Feinstein or Geraldine Ferraro would be terrific.'' **********Such optimism seemed at times to mask a reluctance to face the harder and largely undecided question of how voters will respond to the reality, rather than the theoretical possibility, of voting for a woman for the nation's second highest office. **********Even those who fretted privately that the move could fail acknowledged that it at least gave Mr. Mondale a fighting chance to overtake Mr. Reagan, who cruised along with a lead of 15 percentage points lead in the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll. **********Up until now, said one Mondale campaign chairman from a key state, Mr. Mondale's situation had been that of a team behind 7 to 1 in the sixth inning. With the Ferraro choice, he said, Mr. Mondale had ''rearranged the political chemistry so that everyone says it's a new ball game.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/08/business/market-place-dow-s-drop-how-steep.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1984-03-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 741, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Dow's Drop: How Steep?", "print_headline": "Market Place; Dow's Drop: How Steep?", "body_text": " **********THE Dow Jones industrial average has been **********dropping with disconcerting regularity since **********early January.

Yesterday, the market's most closely watched indicator finished at 1,143.63, down another 8.90. **********There's no such thing as a consensus target level, but Charles S. Comer of Oppenheimer & Company said that ''you're hearing more and more about a possible decline to around 1,050.'' **********The Dow's closing high this year was 1,286.64 on Jan. 6. Its low so far stands at 1,134.21 on Feb. 22, marking a decline of 11.8 percent. **********In late February, Fred Fraenkel, chief market strategist for Prudential-Bache Securities, said: ''We think the Dow industrials will drop to between 1,000 and 1,050, probably within the next several months.'' **********Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company also said in late February that its technical analyst, Alan Shaw, ''sees the Dow industrials heading south, possibly to 1,100, 1,050 or even lower.'' **********Meanwhile, Stan Weinstein, publisher of the Professional Tape Reader, an influential market letter based in Hollywood, Fla., said that as a ''working scenario,'' the industrial average could test its major support at around 1,050 - perhaps by May or June. **********At the Philadelphia-based brokerage firm of Butcher & Singer Inc., Richard J. Yashewski and Joseph H. Barthel recently said that, ''with the market in its current state of disarray, we could see a climax selling wave which would carry the Dow industrials back to the 1,100, or possibly the 1,050, level.'' **********And now this week the Value Line Investment Survey, the nation's largest investment advisory service, told subscribers: ''Hold off buying stocks until further notice.'' **********The stock market's potential for advance, according to Value Line, will be limited for a time. It added: ''A further selloff based on disappointment or frustration could easily result, potentially with a high-volume climax that could take prices into the 1,000-1,050 range before stabilizing.'' **********Value Line's particular concern is the possibility - though not a probability - of ''a dollar crisis.'' A sharp decline in the dollar, it warned, could touch off ''a deluge of liquidation'' by foreign investors in their huge holdings of United States securities. ''We advise deferring new purchases until we can get a better sense of what is going to happen with the dollar,'' the service said. **********It is no mere coincidence that the 1,000-to-1,050 band in the Dow is being cited with increasing frequency. Between 1965 and late 1982 the industrial average repeatedly worked up to this range only to fall back. **********Finally, when it succeeded in breaking through impressively in the final months of 1982, a key rule of technical analysis came into play. ''When you have such a well-defined resistance level that's finally surmounted,'' Mr. Comer of Oppenheimer declared, ''it becomes a valid support zone.'' **********Incidentally, he does not believe the Dow will drop as far as 1,050. ''I think the average will slip below its closing low of February,'' he said, ''but I see the ultimate downside level as perhaps 1,070 or 1,080.'' **********There is, of course, no guarantee that this average, which consists of 30 big-name stocks, will continue to fall. But if it does, many lesser-quality stocks and over-the-counter issues could register even larger percentage declines. **********Merrill Lynch recently expressed the view that ''the secular bull market will reassert itself from a bottom in the first half of 1984 and we expect to see new highs sometime in 1985.'' Sometime ago it had suggested that the market would set a new high in early 1984. **********Whatever lies ahead, the swift, and largely unexpected, setback in stock prices so far this year has already reached the approximate proportion of two famous ''October massacres'' in Wall Street. In 1978, between Oct. 11 and Nov. 14, the industrial average dropped 12.9 percent. In 1979, the downward spiral between Oct. 5 and Nov. 7 was 11.2 percent. **********In both years, rising interest rates and the prospect of tightening credit conditions - not unlike present worries confronting the market - proved to be critical factors. **********Meanwhile, analysts keep seeking new clues that might point the way to the future path of the stock market. ''No leading national news weekly has run a cover story with a bear on it yet,'' Robert Farrell, chief market analyst of Merrill Lynch, said recently. ''So we are not inclined to believe the 1983-84 decline phase is all over.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/26/business/technology-s-dean-elizabeth-e-bailey-computer-whiz-helm-carnegie-mellon.html": {"writer_name": "Kirk Johnson", "pub_date": "1984-08-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1809, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A COMPUTER WHIZ AT THE HELM OF CARNEGIE-MELLON", "print_headline": "TECHNOLOGY'S DEAN: ELIZABETH E. BAILEY; A COMPUTER WHIZ AT THE HELM OF CARNEGIE-MELLON", "body_text": " **********Elizabeth E. Bailey is a **********woman who gets things done. She couldn't find a special school for a physically handicapped son - so she founded one herself. **********She hates cigarette smoke - so, during a term on the Civil Aeronautics Board, she pushed through rules guaranteeing non-smokers a smoke- free seat on airplanes. **********She has little patience with academics or businessmen who do not integrate computers into their daily routines. And now, 15 months after becoming dean of Carnegie-Mellon University's Graduate School of Industrial Management, Mrs. Bailey, a short, stocky, 45-year-old woman with a firm chin and a determined expression, is pushing the Pittsburgh- based school into the middle of the computer age. ''My thrust is on integrating computers into the curriculum a lot better than has been done in the past,'' she said. **********The National Academy of Sciences says that Carnegie-Mellon's computer science department is one of the nation's leaders, but Mrs. Bailey says she is not satisfied with the graduate school's degree of computerization. Since replacing Robert Kaplan as dean in May 1983, she has insisted that each student use a personal computer, and has set up a computer ''network'' that enables students and faculty members to communicate electronically. She has hired 10 new faculty members, 4 of them specialists in information systems. And she has revised the school's research agenda to emphasize studies of how businesses deal with information. **********That seems a lot to accomplish in one year, even for an energetic woman who schedules her first appointments before 8:30 A.M. and goes to lunch-hour exercise classes three days a week. And indeed, many of the activities traditionally handled by deans have taken a back seat. For example, Mrs. Bailey has limited fund raising to just four or five days a month. ''Next year she plans to go out more,'' said an associate. ''She wanted her first year to be her 'inside year,' to concentrate on the school.'' **********Mrs. Bailey even delegates some internal duties. She appointed a deputy dean to serve as liaison with the faculty on routine matters. But, associates say, she does plumb faculty members' views on technology and business. ''Dean Kaplan wanted to deal with everything himself,'' recalled Eleanor Riess, an administrative assistant in the Dean's office. ''Dean Bailey tends to bring in more opinion. She has more of a committee arrangement.'' **********Mrs. Bailey, meanwhile, describes her main priority in one sentence. ''I want our students to feel as though they are on the threshhold of a revolution,'' she said, her eyes, although masked by large glasses, lighting up at the thought. **********Mrs. Bailey herself has been a trailblazer in a revolution of sorts - the push of women into management positions. She was the first woman to receive a doctorate in economics from Princeton University. She was the first woman to head a department at Bell Laboratories (in her case, the economic research section). In 1977 President Jimmy Carter, at the recommendation of his domestic policy staff, made her the first woman C.A.B. commisioner, and in 1981, President Reagan named her the agency's first woman vice chairman. **********Although there are seven women deans among the country's 617 accredited business schools, Mrs. Bailey is the first to head a Top 10 graduate business school. Of her first 10 faculty appointments, only one was a woman, giving the school a total of five women teachers in a faculty of 70 - a still small 7 percent. But her associates say that more women teachers are likely to be appointed soon. **********The hurtful comments, intentional or unintentional, that Mrs. Bailey says she has run into during her career - she still feels anger when she recalls a male colleague asking if she was at Bell Lab management meetings to take notes - have given her such a strong antipathy to sexism that, by her own admission, she will sometimes spot sexist slights when none exist. When Carnegie-Mellon officials first tried to interest her in the deanship, she refused to return their calls for three months. ''I thought they wanted to interview some woman to show they had done their affirmative action process,'' she said. **********It was not until Allan H. Meltzer, head of the university's selection committee, flew to Washington to personally reassure her that the school meant business that she started taking her candidacy seriously. ''We were looking for someone who valued research and would direct the effort toward forthcoming problems,'' said Professor Meltzer, who insists that the fact that Mrs. Bailey was a woman was a monumental non-issue.  ''We realize we have to keep moving to stay relevant to problems as they emerge,'' **********Mrs. Bailey has built her career around ''relevent'' research. While compiling her doctoral dissertation, entitled ''Economic Theory of Regulatory Constraint,'' she became a staunch supporter of government deregulation of the airline industry, a theme that pervaded her five years on the C.A.B. ''Betsy was the most ardent deregulator on the board,'' said Alfred E. Kahn, who was C.A.B. chairman when Mrs. Bailey joined the agency and is now an economics professor at Cornell. **********MRS. Bailey's career at first centered on immediate applications of technology, rather than policy issues. From 1960 through 1972, she worked in the technical programming department at Bell Labs. She developed a hands-on knowledge of computers, but had little chance to work through her ideas about their relationship to management. **********But then, armed with a newly earned Ph.D., Mrs. Bailey transferred in 1972 to the economics department, and spent the next five years focusing on the changes that technology and impending deregulation might bring to the economy in general and to her company specifically. Her economic analysis group at Bell Laboratories is credited with making one of the first hard examinations of where technology was taking the Bell System. The report concluded - somewhat controversially, although prophetically for the mid- 1970's - that A.T.& T.'s insistence that it was a ''natural monopoly'' would not be an economically convincing defense against a breakup. **********''We said, 'look, if the government is going to bust you up, there are some ways that are going to be a lot less costly and a lot more efficient than others,' '' Mrs. Bailey said. Many of her team's conclusions - for example, that local telephone company operations would not be opened to competition - were realized in the A.T.& T breakup. **********Now Mrs. Bailey says she is trying to infuse Carnegie-Mellon's graduate business school, which produces about 125 M.B.A.'s a year, with the same sort of spirit that she brought to the Bell Labs economic research team. While the university has long been considered a major center for industrial technology studies, Mrs. Bailey says that her graduate school still lags in integrating those subjects into the curriculum. Last year, at Mrs. Bailey's urging, Carnegie-Mellon began offering a combined engineering/M.B.A. degree. And it is giving several new courses on the impact of technology. One of them, called Robotics and Social Change, drew 90 students for 45 openings. **********For Mrs. Bailey, that sort of course is a necessary part of a business school student's education if that student is to prosper later as a corporate executive. ''We're going to see shrinking of huge layers of management because the information is flowing in a different way,'' she said. **********Because executives now have easy access to computer terminals, Mrs. Bailey explained, they can call up wide-ranging international information and plant-specific operating information at a moment's notice. She expects that top executives will use most of the information to devise corporate strategies. But, since computer terminals will be available to lower-level supervisors, too, Mrs. Bailey predicts that much of the day- to-day decision-making will shift to the shop floor. That, she adds, means that M.B.A.'s must also have shop- floor experience and computer expertise. **********Mrs. Bailey has directed her school's research toward finding out how the new information technology is being used. One faculty member, for example, is spending the summer on the shop floor of the Burroughs Corporation and the General Motors Corporation to study how the two companies manage information. **********So far, Mrs. Bailey has had fairly smooth sailing in getting her ideas listened to and acted on at Carnegie- Mellon. People who have known her in former jobs predict that, should she run into obstacles in the future, her academic colleagues will see a side of her they may not have seen as yet: that of a scrapper who will not budge an inch when she believes she is right. **********''I would describe her as ebullient, both personally and professionally,'' said Professor Kahn at Cornell. According to Webster's New World Dictionary, the first definition for ''ebullient'' is ''bubbling, boiling.'' The second is ''exuberant.'' Mrs. Bailey has displayed all of these qualities, her friends say. **********ONCE, while she was a member of the C.A.B., a flight attendant for Eastern Airlines told Mrs. Bailey that she had shown up too late to reserve a seat in the non-smoking section of her flight. Mrs. Bailey, who knew full well that the rules at that time guaranteed a smoke-free seat to anyone who desired one, held her ground. In the loud argument that followed she was called, among other things, a ''witch.'' **********Mrs. Bailey got her seat, but she also filed a C.A.B. complaint against Eastern the next day. Frank Borman, Eastern's chairman, showed up at Mrs. Bailey's Washington office a few weeks later to offer his personal apology, and to assure the commissioner that the offending flight attendant would be reprimanded. **********According to Professor Kahn, Mrs. Bailey could be equally stubborn when arguing C.A.B. issues that did not affect her personally. ''We had a big flap once about whether Braniff or Pan Am should get the Dallas-London route,'' Professor Kahn recalled. ''I disagreed with her on that one. She went with Braniff.'' Although then- Chairman Kahn won the argument on the board, President Carter reversed the C.A.B.'s decision and granted the route to Braniff. **********While Mrs. Bailey is quite open when it comes to her views about business issues, she is far more reticent about her personal life. Born in New York City, the daughter of a professor of medieval history, she has four sisters, most of them still living in the New York area. **********Today Mrs. Bailey, who has been divorced for seven years, lives in what she described as a ''Washington D.C.-style townhouse'' in the Squirrel Hill section of Pittsburgh with her two sons, James Jr., 20, and William, 18. She divides her time between the university and her hobby of woodcarving. **********She resists being characterized by any of her activities. When asked how she would describe herself - an economist? a feminist? a mother? a dean? - she shrugged her shoulders, drew an imaginary line along the edge of her desk with her finger, and thought long and hard before answering. The final response? ''All those things, I guess.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/02/world/us-aides-fear-salvador-setback-even-a-coup-in-election-s-wake.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Taubman", "pub_date": "1984-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 777, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. AIDES FEAR SALVADOR SETBACK, EVEN A COUP, IN ELECTION'S WAKE", "print_headline": "U.S. AIDES FEAR SALVADOR SETBACK, EVEN A COUP, IN ELECTION'S WAKE", "body_text": " **********United States officials say the Reagan Administration is seriously concerned that the outcome of next month's presidential election in El Salvador could jeopardize rather than strengthen democratic rule there. **********While the Administration publicly describes the election, scheduled for March 25, as an important step toward democracy, it is said to be privately concerned that the balloting might lead to a confrontation between political leaders on the left and right that could set the stage for a military coup. **********Those points were made by the officials as Secretary of State George P. Shultz arrived here today after spending eight hours in El Salvador on Tuesday. **********Rightist's Candidacy of Concern **********The officials said the focus of the Administration's concern was the presidential candidacy of Roberto d'Aubuisson, the leader of the far-right National Republican Alliance. The Administration was said to feel that a victory by him could polarize El Salvador's civilian leadership and produce an upswing in human rights abuses by security forces and right-wing death squads. **********And that, the officials said, could increase already widespread opposition in Congress to expanding United States military aid to El Salvador to fight the leftist guerrillas. **********The officials said the Administration was also concerned over the candidacy of Jose Napoleon Duarte, who represents the Christian Democratic Party and is expected to be Mr. d'Aubuisson's strongest opponent. **********Military Reportedly Suspicious **********The informants said the Salvadoran military viewed him with suspicion and might move to overthrow a Duarte Government on the ground that it would make too many concessions to guerrillas to end the civil war. **********In elections in 1982 for a Constituent Assembly, Mr. Duarte's party, which at the time was favored by United States officials, won 40 percent of the popular vote and Mr. d'Aubuisson's party 29 percent. **********Administration officials said today that a runoff election between the two men this year could split the country and lead to increased violence. **********The dark horse candidate, and the one who is said to be receiving at least indirect support from the United States Embassy in El Salvador, is Francisco Jose Guerrero from the National Conciliation Party. Mr. Guerrero is viewed by United States officials as a conservative who could appeal to both the business class and the military.   Administration 'in a Bind' **********Describing the Reagan Administration as ''in a bind'' over the elections, one official said that if it pushed hard for an end to human rights abuses and death squads, ''d'Aubuisson and others may try to turn that pressure into a voter backlash'' against the United States. He said Mr.  d'Aubuission had already adopted an anti-American tone in his campaigning. **********But if the Administration lessens the pressure, the official said, ''Congress will never give us the money we need.'' **********Senior officials traveling with Mr. Shultz have said the Administration plans to ask Congress for $170 million in additional military assistance in the current fiscal year. Congress has already approved $64.8 million. **********At a news conference on Tuesday in San Salvador at the beginning of an eight-day trip to Latin America, Secretary Shultz tried to navigate between the conflicting interests. He condemned far-right terror and death squad activities but said the Salvadoran authorities had made progress toward reducing such violence. **********He emphasized that the United States was neutral on the coming elections. When asked if Washington would be concerned about a d'Aubuisson victory, he said, ''We believe in the democratic process and we believe in fair and open elections, and we believe that under those circumstances you accept the verdict, whatever it may be, of the people who do the voting.''  Direct Accusations Avoided **********Mr. Shultz and his aides have not wavered from that position in public. But officials said in private interviews that a d'Aubuisson victory could create major problems. **********They said Mr. d'Aubuisson and the issues of death squad activity were linked in a way that constrains American policy. They noted that Administration officials had spoken bluntly to Salvadoran leaders about the death squad problem, and demanded that the Salvadoran Government take action against squad leaders and organizers, including at least one security official closely linked to Mr. d'Aubuisson. But the informants said the United States officials had avoided direct accusations about Mr. d'Aubuisson himself. **********Officials said they were aware of reports connecting Mr. d'Aubuisson to the death squads, including a cablegram sent to the State Department in 1981 by the United States Embassy in El Salvador. The State Department refused Mr. d'Aubuisson a visa to visit the United States last November, citing American national interests."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/27/business/investing-hunting-for-bargains-in-a-dull-market.html": {"writer_name": "Anise Wallace", "pub_date": "1984-05-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1189, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HUNTING FOR BARGAINS IN A DULL MARKET", "print_headline": "INVESTING; HUNTING FOR BARGAINS IN A DULL MARKET", "body_text": " **********IN a stock market correction such as the one **********over the past 11 months, money managers who **********focus only on picking stocks often find future winners at bargain prices. Arthur Nicholas, managing director of San Diego's Pacific Century Group, a unit of the Security Pacific Corporation, has been one of the hottest stock pickers around. He is avidly searching for such steals. **********In both 1982 and 1983, one of the funds under his control turned in the best record of the almost 300 bank-managed stock funds measured by Computer Directions Advisors of Silver Spring, Md. That fund soared 84.7 percent in 1982, and in 1983 it advanced in value 47.4 percent. **********This year, of course, has been a far different story. The $12 million fund is down a dismal 20 percent since January. But it should be noted that this fund is forced by its charter to remain fully invested in stocks throughout any kind of market. Another $80 million, which he manages for Fortune 500 companies in separate accounts, has declined much less because he was able to park some of those assets in Treasury bills when he could not find stocks that he considered suitable to buy. A composite of the entire $90 million or so under his control - virtually all of it in stocks - is down 9.8 percent since the beginning of the year, compared with the 8 percent decline of the Dow Jones industrial average for the same period. **********Mr. Nicholas, who is 37, says he wants to hit home runs, not singles or doubles. ''I'm not interested in a very fine company that may be growing at 25 percent a year,'' he said. ''That's probably fully recognized in the marketplace. I'm looking for a company with something unique that will make it grow at a geometric rate.'' He specializes in small, aggressive growth companies. Often many of the stocks he follows sell at price/earnings ratios of 25 to 30 times earnings, more than double the market's ratio. But high P/ E's do not faze the investment manager. ''You do have to take into account relative P/E's, but quite often you'll get what you pay for,'' he said. ''Good companies are expensive and will always be expensive.'' **********Because only one analyst and one trader help him manage the funds, most of Mr. Nicholas's investment ideas often come from brokers. He seldom visits companies; his group verifies information provided from his brokerage sources. **********While Mr. Nicholas does not describe himself as a contrarian, he likes to buy stocks before other institutional investors. He said he buys the rapidly growing companies before they have ''credibility'' among the institutions. Many of his stocks are not heavily owned by other large investors. ''If we've done our work right, the larger pools of money will follow at the higher prices,'' he said. **********Mr. Nicholas said that no industry groups are assuming leadership in today's market. So he is picking individual stocks, rather than a collection of stocks in one or more industries. ''We look for ideas that can make money,'' he said. **********Two of his favorites are entertainment companies. The Cannon Group Inc., which he bought at $4 last year and recently traded in the $20's, is one of the leading independent film makers. He likes it because the company's average film cost is $5 million, compared with the industry average of $11.5 million. One of its newest releases is ''Brea kin,'' about break dancing. ''They have more movies coming out than any other film producer over the next 12 months,'' Mr. Nicholas said. **********The other entertainment company in his portfolio is Lorimar, a producer of such TV shows as ''Dallas,'' ''The Waltons,'' and ''Eight Is Enough.'' One of the factors that makes this television show producer attractive, said Mr. Nicholas, is the number of its hit shows soon to be syndicated to local television stations. **********''Relative to its growth rate, we think it is a very good value,'' Mr. Nicholas said. He estimates that the company will earn $2.22 a share this year and $3.50 to $4 in 1985. **********Another of Mr. Nicholas's favorite companies is Compucard International Inc. This 10-year-old company, which he has dubbed the ''retail company of the future,'' should enjoy its first year in the black this year, he estimates. The company has built a data base of 60,000 different products that it makes available to home computer owners. Rather than using a catalogue, a consumer can use his computer and Compucard's database to find and order, for example, the lowest-priced television set. Mr. Nicholas is looking for the company's earnings to grow 50 to 60 percent a year for the next five years. He estimates Compucard will earn $1.40 a share in 1985. **********ANOTHER company with data bases that **********should benefit from the technological revolution is Value Line Inc., he said. Pointing to the recently announced merger of A. C. Nielsen with Dun & Bradstreet, Mr. Nicholas said that the company's database of stock information could make Value Line an attractive merger or acquisition candidate. ''Whether or not somebody else acquires them, what they have is enormously valuable,'' he said. ''There are so many ways to leverage the business they have.'' **********One of his holdings that he characterizes as particularly lacking credibility with other institutions is Flakey Jake's, the chain of gourmet hamburger restaurants. The company, which was spun out of a seafood restaurant, Sea Galley Stores, has commitments for 140 franchises and is growing at the rate of 100 percent a year,'' he said. ''It's on the front part of its growth curve,'' he added. Mr. Nicholas likes the company so much that he also owns shares in Sea Galley, which owns 55 percent of Flakey Jake's. ''Both those companies are timely investments,'' he said. **********Despite his emphasis on individual issues, there is one ''mini-sector,'' the health maintenance organizations, that Mr. Nicholas thinks will provide the kind of ''dramatic'' increase in earnings that he demands. These companies, better known as H.M.O.'s, provide individuals with a prepaid, all-inclusive health plan that some industry analysts estimate saves consumers up to 40 percent of the cost of traditional health plans. In the past several years, many of the H.M.O.'s, which originally were established as nonprofit, have converted to for-profit status. And last year several went public. The group makes up almost one-third of Mr. Nicholas's portfolio. **********In the last three months, Mr. Nicholas has been buying a package of these stocks, representing companies from all over the country. Among his holdings are Independence Health Plan, Maxicare Health Plans, Peak Health Care and U.S. Health Care Systems. Mr. Nicholas also includes Greatwest Hospitals in this group because he figures that 90 percent of the company's 1985 earnings will be generated by H.M.O. revenues. **********Mr. Nicholas believes that money managers must be consistent. ''There are all kinds of ways to make money in the market,'' he said. ''The real key is to find a way that you're good at and stick to it. People that have trouble over time are those people that flip-flop.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/11/world/un-leader-expresses-condolences-to-soviet.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 222, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

In Washington, the Reagan Administration has accused Nicaragua of supporting, training and arming the Salvadoran left. **********The United States Embassy said that shipments of ammunition and other supplies, which almost stopped for a six-month period last year, were stepped up in recent months. European diplomats in Managua tended to agree with that assessment in interviews last week. **********Colonel Monterrosa, who was interviewed in San Miguel Province over the weekend, said he knew of a shipment of ammunition that had come in a few days ago to Jucuaran, a small town in San Miguel that is seven miles from the coast. **********The commander declined to say how he knew that ammunition shipments had been received in Jucuaran. However, he said that in the past the army had come upon empty ammunition cases not intended for Salvadoran Army forces. **********Colonel Monterrosa was not able to explain how or why ammunition would enter El Salvador through Guatemala. Officials in Honduras have suggested in the past that as Honduran routes from Nicaragua to El Salvador came under greater scrutiny rebels had begun moving equipment by sea to Guatemala, to be moved over the border from there into El Salvador. **********The American Embassy has also declined to give any material proof of supply shipments from the Nicaraguan Government to Salvadoran insurgents. Embassy officials have said the shipments are delivered by small boats and planes. **********The Reagan Administration has used the Nicaraguan Government's support of the Salvadoran rebels to justify to Congress its covert aid to Nicaraguan exiles based in Honduras.

However, he said the army did not have enough troops to guard the 160-mile-long coastline and the borders with Honduras and Guatemala. **********Moreover, even when the Salvadoran Army knows that a shipment is being delivered, its troops do not have the capacity to reach the scene quickly and discreetly enough to intercept the supplies, he said. **********''I am trying, but I am not Superman,'' Colonel Monterrosa said. **********The commander said that the rebels, who have established bases in northern El Salvador along the Honduran border, were able to cross over into Honduras to purchase some supplies such as boots and food. **********''Most of the boots we find are made in Honduras,'' he said. **********The rebels also receive dollars from groups of supporters outside the country that can be used to purchase food, medical supplies and some unsophisticated communications equipment inside El Salvador, according to Salvadoran and American officials.   Some Supplies Captured **********Insurgent leaders assert that they obtain most of their military supplies by capturing them or purchasing them from the Salvadoran military or by buying them in the international arms market with money they have solicited from friendly foreign governments and nongovernment allies. **********An official of the Democratic Revolutionary Front said in an interview last year that most leaders of that opposition political organization had been assigned areas of geographic responsibility, where they were expected to develop political and economic support. He said it was the opposition's version of a foreign service. **********The guerrilla and civilian opposition to El Salvador's Government also set up an agency in Mexico late last year to solicit foreign aid for the parts of El Salvador that are under rebel control. The agency, known as Dad-Paz and financed by foreign donations, asserts that it provides only humanitarian aid to the guerrilla-held areas. **********Some governments have resisted giving money to the organizaton, however, because they are unable to verify how the funds are spent, according to diplomats in Managua.

Final results in the balloting for the 28-seat lower house of the National Assembly showed the opposition United Democratic Party with 21 seats and Mr. Price's People's United Party with 7. **********'We Needed a Change' **********''I wasn't surprised,'' said one voter, Luke Davis, who spoke in the lilting Creole that is predominant here. ''People got tired of Mr. Price. We needed a change.'' **********The elections were the first national referendum in this Commonwealth nation since Mr. Price led it to independence in 1981. **********The issue of economic freedom played a major role in the campaign, with the United Democratic Party calling for more foreign investment and less government control of the economy, which it argued had stifled individual initiative. **********So extensive was the repudiation of the Government that shortly after the vote-counting began Friday night, the Prime Minister saw his own Belize City Assembly seat fall to a 25-year-old City Councilman, the youngest candidate on the ballot. The vote was 876 to 570. Until Friday, Mr. Price had not lost an election in his 30-year political career.   'New Ideas' Demanded **********The victory of the Councilman, Derek Aikman, seemed an apt symbol for the opposition, which had campaigned on the theme of tackling Belize's economic ills with young leadership and ''new ideas.'' **********Under Belize's parliamentary system, patterned after Britain's, the Governor General will ask Mr. Esquivel to form a new government. He said today that he would be ready to assemble his Cabinet by Monday. Mr. Price, he added, had telephoned him this morning with congratulations and good wishes. **********The election results inspired noisy celebrations in Belize City, a delapidated Caribbean port where the opposition swept municipal elections last December. Ragtag groups of young men, many in bright red opposition T-shirts, strode gaily through the narrow dirt streets Friday night, shouting and throwing firecrackers.   A Tireless Campaigner **********The seeds of Mr. Price's downfall appeared to be not in Belize City, a longtime opposition stronghold, but in the outlying districts of this New Jersey- sized nation of 150,000. **********The Prime Minister, a tireless campaigner, is said to have learned the names of virtually every family in the country during routine crisscrossings in his Land-Rover of such regions as Toledo, a southern rain forest region populated by Maya Indians, and the northern mestizo region of Corozal and Orange Walk, near the Mexican and Guatemalan borders. But for reasons that seemed more to do with weariness of his Government than specific grievances, his longtime supporters forsook him in droves. **********''I'm not unhappy with the Government,'' said Eddie Fisher, a 58-year- old father of nine who said he had always voted for the party of ''Mr. George.'' ''I just wanted to try something else.'' **********Mr. Fisher, who said he lived in the Mesopotamia division of Belize City, paused. ''I just hope I'm doing the right thing,'' he said.   U.S. Ties Loom Large **********The issue of future relations with the United States loomed large during the campaign. Of special interest has been the possibility that Washington will play a role in settling a festering territorial dispute between Belize and Guatemala. The Guatemalans have claimed Belize as their own territory since the mid-19th century. **********The situation has compelled the British to keep a force of 1,800 in Belize to guard the borders against a possible invasion by the Guatemalan Army. **********The British have made no secret of their interest in leaving, but the opposition has long been adamant that the British stay on indefinitely, and has suggested that Mr. Price has not been doing enough to insure this. **********The opposition's eagerness to have the British stay on has been enhanced by the fact that the British military presence contributes nearly 15 percent of this sugar-producing country's gross national product of around $100 million a year.   Government Called Ambivalent **********On Washington's role, Mr. Esquivel said, ''We need to make sure that the United States attitude toward Belize is at least sympathetic as far as the Guatemalan question is concerned.'' **********Mr. Esquivel, who spoke in an interview Friday as he waited on a long voting line in Belize City, said, ''I think the United States could very well be of the opinion, 'We are only talking about 150,000 people, what differnce does it make?' '' **********''We have to make every effort to convince them we are important.'' Mr. Esquivel said, adding that he thought Mr. Price had failed in this ''because of the ambivalence of the Government,'' apparently a reference to two leftists in Mr. Price's Cabinet. Both men lost their Assembly seats in the voting Friday. **********''We have ministers,'' Mr. Esquivel said, ''who use all the strident rhetoric about U.S. intervention in Nicaragua and Cuba, et cetera - imperialists and things like that - which can hardly convince the United States that we're serious about good relations.'' **********The campaign's focus on economic issues found the governing party defending its record and promising future growth.  The opposition charged that the Prime Minister and his party had failed to pull Belize out of its economic doldrums. **********The Esquivel forces pledged to put mechanisms into effect to attract more foreign investment, particularly in tourism and alternative crops to sugar."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/25/world/study-sees-israel-staying-in-arab-areas.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1984-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 713, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STUDY SEES ISRAEL STAYING IN ARAB AREAS", "print_headline": "STUDY SEES ISRAEL STAYING IN ARAB AREAS", "body_text": " **********A study on the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, issued today, has concluded that the annexation of the area, with its 1.2 million Palestinian Arabs, ''now seems only a matter of time.'' **********The study, by a former Israeli official, says that proposed diplomatic solutions, such as United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, the Camp David agreements, and the Reagan plan were no longer realistic ways of resolving the Palestinian problem, given the ''quasi-permanence'' of Israeli Jewish settlement in the area. **********The study, ''The West Bank Data Project: A Survey of Israel's Policies,'' was directed by Meron Benvenisti, an Israeli who was a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem.

There must be ''realistic answers'' to the question of ''Is Israel to be a Jewish state or a democratic one?'' it says. **********''Anyone who looks forward to, or fears, an imposed settlement is waiting in vain,'' the report concluded. ''For all practical purposes, the annexation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip now seems only a matter of time.'' **********Mr. Benvenisti appeared today at the headquarters here of the American Enterprise Institute, which published the study, for a discussion with leading Middle East experts. **********In his remarks, Mr. Benvenisti said he was ''very pessimistic'' about the outlook, and declined to offer a detailed formula for resolving the situation. The study said that the process started by the Israeli occupation in 1967 and accelerated since the Likud bloc took power in 1977, ''have created social, economic, and political interactions between Israel and the territories that have assumed quasi-permanence.'' **********The forces ''working toward the total annexation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip outweigh those that work against it,'' the report said. **********''I think the study is a powerful contribution to the discussion about what to do in the Middle East,'' a State Department official who was present said later, asking not to be named. ''Much of what Benvenisti says is known and accepted by some of our top people, but nobody is going to say so up front.'' **********Mr. Benvenisti said that conclusions of the study would probably be welcomed by the hard-line supporters of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin who favor annexation of the West Bank, and the Palestinian radicals who have been saying for years that Israel would never give up the area. He said that in his view, even if the Labor Party is returned to power in this July's elections, there would not be any dramatic change in the situation. **********''The chances that an internal political force will halt the process of annexation in the post-Begin era seem as slim as they were before his resignation,'' the study said. ''The Likud Government is committed to his legacy; in the event that a Labor-led coalition is formed or a Labor-Center coalition wins national elections, we may expect a change in style - an avoidance of extreme religious and historical claims - but not in substance.'' **********The report also castigated Arab states and the Palestine Liberation Organization for doing little to try to resolve the Palestinian issue peacefully saying: ''The somnambulant policies of the leaders of the P.L.O. are expressed in practically everything that happens in the occupied territories.''

Zieber, an analyst at Datquest Inc., a market research firm. **********''Throughout the industry, overtime has been discontinued, and extra shifts are no longer being used,'' said Michael W. Kubiak, manager of statistical programs at the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group. **********In a brief announcement issued after the close of the stock market, Texas Instruments, the world's largest maker of semiconductors, said that some of the layoffs would be permanent and some temporary. The company said that most of the affected people currently work in chip- making plants in Texas. Texas Instruments' stock closed at 118 5/8, off 7/8, on the Big Board yesterday. **********'Reduced Work Schedules' **********In the same announcement, Texas Instruments, which is based in Dallas, also said it had instituted ''reduced work schedules'' at some of its factories. This also reflected the problems in the semiconductor market, the company said. **********The announcement cited Texas Instruments' third-quarter report to shareholders, in which the company said order rates for semiconductors had begun to plunge. At that time, the company attributed the drop in orders to a slowdown in United States economic growth and to inventory adjustments by customers. **********Yesterday, analysts said those same factors were behind the layoffs. In particular, they said, Texas Instruments, as well as other leading chip makers, greatly enlarged chip-making capacity last spring in anticipation of continued vigorous demand for electronic products that use the chips, such as personal computers. Texas Instruments chips are used in a wide range of personal computers. **********It Happened With ROM's **********Since then, however, demand for personal computers has leveled off, leaving makers of those machines with more than enough inventory of chips. The slowdown in the economy has aggravated the situation. **********''It's the same kind of thing that happened to the ROM market for video games,'' Mr. Kubiak said. ''The demand that personal computer makers forecast was just not there.'' **********Mr. Kubiak was referring to a huge buildup in so-called read-only-memory circuits that occurred about two years ago following a collapse of the video game market. **********The most recent slowdown in demand for chips is showing up clearly in industry statistics. The industry's book-to-bill ratio, which compares orders with shipments, has declined steadily in recent months. **********In March, for example, it stood at 1.35, meaning that orders outstripped shipments by about 35 percent. Since then, however, the index has dropped to 0.67 in October, and most experts predict that the results for November will be even lower. **********Concern Elsewhere **********Other semiconductor makers also expressed concern yesterday. The Intel Corporation, a large maker based in Santa Clara, Calif, said a falloff in orders had been most pronounced among makers of personal computers. As a result, according to James Jarrett, a spokesman, Intel had reduced production in plants in Oregon and Texas, and had slowed construction on two new office buildings. Mr. Jarrett added, however, that Intel had not laid off workers because of the slump. **********Motorola Inc., the No. 2 maker of chips in the world, said it, too, had been able to avoid work force reductions. But Kenneth C. Phillips, a spokesman, said orders for chips had ''moderated.'' **********And at Anthem Electronic Inc., a big semiconductor distributor based in San Jose, Calif., Robert S. Throop, the company's president, said that order cancellations reached a peak in September but remained substantial. He called the situation a buyer's market. **********That would be in sharp contrast to the situation six months ago, when, because of the rosy forecasts for personal computers, chips were in short supply. The most recent excess capacity, therefore, seemed to provide yet further evidence, analysts said, that the industry remains volatile."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/10/business/strong-dollar-erodes-raychem-s-earnings.html": {"writer_name": "Jesus Rangel", "pub_date": "1984-02-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 657, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STRONG DOLLAR ERODES RAYCHEM'S EARNINGS", "print_headline": "STRONG DOLLAR ERODES RAYCHEM'S EARNINGS", "body_text": " **********The Raychem Corporation, whose insulation materials and radiation- treated plastics have applications ranging from oilfields and utilities to aircraft, computers, electronic devices, missiles and telecommunications equipment, is running into troubles at home and abroad. **********On Jan. 31, the Menlo Park, Calif., company predicted that earnings for the second half of the fiscal year 1984, ending June 30, would be about the same as the results for the first half, ended in December. Those results: $15 million, or $1.56 a share, on sales of $305 million. **********The earnings prediction, coming as it did in a nervous stock market, sent Raychem's shares tumbling 13 points, to 59. Yesterday they closed at 54 3/4, down 1/4, on the New York Stock Exchange. Last June Raychem sold at a record price of 93. **********An Electron Beam **********The company's specialty is bombarding plastics with radiation from an electron beam generator. This changes the molecular structure of the plastics, and makes them more resistant to heat, moisture and corrosion. Such plastics are particularly used in wiring systems of aircraft and computers. The materials are also used to join, protect or insulate transmission and distribution systems in electric and gas utilities. **********The idea for the company grew out of the work its founder, Paul M.

Mr. Cook, who started the company in 1957 and remains its president, became intrigued by radiation chemistry while seeking ways to use atomic waste. **********Raychem's Chemelex division makes heating elements for tanks and pipes. **********Impact of Stronger Dollar **********For the last two years, the impact of the strengthening dollar has eroded profits from still-strong foreign sales of Raychem's insulation materials, 60 percent of which are manufactured abroad. And demand for the expensive, high-performance pipe connectors that Raychem makes has decreased because of a slowdown in construction of petrochemical and oil refineries in the Middle East. **********More recently, demand for its pipe protection and insulation products slowed in November and early December because of unusually mild fall weather in many parts of the United States. Recent frigid weather across the United States has mitigated this problem somewhat. **********In the fiscal year 1983, Raychem earned $30.5 million, or $3.23 a share, on sales of $583 million. That was down from 1982, when it had net income of $37.2 million, or $4.07 a share, on sales of $535 million. The 1982 figure includes a tax benefit of $6.8 million in Britain. **********An Optimistic Prediction **********Robert M. Halperin, Raychem's executive vice president, said prospects for the company were brighter than its recent stock activity might indicate. Both he and analysts are predicting higher earnings for the fiscal year 1985, based on expectations that the dollar will ease and that the company's development of new products will succeed. **********Martin Roher of Montgomery Securities of San Francisco said: ''They've made it loud and clear that while earnings are important, they are going to increase funding of research and development.

Hundreds of thousands of Colombians are expected to participate in a day of peace Sunday by painting and displaying white doves, but guerrilla attacks in the days before the cease-fire have also fed irritation with the left. **********Warning that the cease-fires are only the beginning of the road to peace, Mr. Betancur is now committed to convoking a ''national dialogue'' to discuss the political, economic and social changes long demanded by the guerrillas. But before any changes are made, the President will have to overcome resistence from the country's traditionally conservative political elite. **********The paradox is that Mr. Betancur is himself a member of the Conservative Party. But, unlike most other leaders of both Conservative and Liberal Parties here, he comes from a peasant background that is said to account for his populist touch and his ability to communicate with the masses.   A New Foreign Policy **********As a complement to his domestic liberalization, Mr. Betancur has ended Colombia's isolationist foreign policy. Defending his participation with Mexico, Venezuela and Panama in the Contadora group's Central American peace efforts, he said recently, ''What happens over there will have influence here because we're trying to put out a fire in the house next door.'' **********The Contadora effort seemed to give greater urgency to the domestic peace effort. ''It was very difficult for Betancur to pontificate about El Salvador when guerrilla warfare has been raging here for decades,'' one Western diplomat remarked. **********But to achieve even a cease-fire at home, the President had first to change the tense political atmosphere inherited from his predecessor, Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala, who had allowed the army to assume a continuing role in public affairs in the name of fighting Communist subversion. **********Upon taking office, Mr. Betancur promptly lifted the state of siege, a seemingly permanent feature of Colombian politics, and promoted a general amnesty that led some 2,000 guerrillas to abandon the armed struggle and rejoin society. He also moved firmly to curb human rights violations, which had grown alarmingly during the previous administration.   Control of Military Reasserted **********Perhaps most significant, the President reasserted civilian control over the armed forces. Key army officers, including Gen. Fernando Landazabal Reyes, then the Defense Minister, made no secret of their disapproval of his policies toward the left. But last December, after General Landazabal spoke his mind too publicly, he was dismissed by Mr. Betancur with the words, ''The President is the commander of the armed forces, which obey his decisions.'' **********But having made his point during the difficult truce negotiations, Mr. Betancur tried to reassure the armed forces that security concerns would not be neglected. **********Even though close aides concede that he has been more successful in persuading the guerrillas that a ''democratic peace'' is possible, many army officers suspect that the rebels will merely use the armistice to seek new recruits and rebuild their strength for a fresh round of warfare. **********Halfway through his four-year term and unable to seek immediate re-election, Mr. Betancur is therefore said by aides to view his next priority as that of consolidating the progress on peace so that the gains cannot be undone. **********''What happens now will determine whether the political opening will survive after he leaves office,'' said Bernardo Ramirez, the President's closest confidant. ''We can make peace with some groups, but if the causes of the problem are not resolved, within X years, others will take up arms again. For the moment, though, we can be reasonably and prudently optimistic.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/02/business/dynatech-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 76, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DYNATECH CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "DYNATECH CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/04/world/iran-says-it-has-driven-6-miles-on-key-iraqi-port.html": {"writer_name": "Drew Middleton", "pub_date": "1984-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 447, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IRAN SAYS IT HAS DRIVEN 6 MILES ON KEY IRAQI PORT", "print_headline": "IRAN SAYS IT HAS DRIVEN 6 MILES ON KEY IRAQI PORT", "body_text": " **********Iran asserted yesterday that its forces had driven six miles closer to the key Iraqi port of Basra in fighting over the last three days.

Essentially, the new rules are aimed at giving options traders the same maximum tax on profits, 32 percent, to which futures traders have been subject since 1981. **********But whatever bill evolves, tax experts say it will create as much confusion in the futures and options markets as the lack of tax guidelines has in recent years. **********One tax expert who thinks so and who has worked on the problem with Congress and the options industry for several years is Donald Schapiro, partner in the law firm of Barrett Smith Schapiro Simon & Armstrong in New York. **********''While both bills represent a step forward, they add up to a mess,'' he warned last week. ''The tax courts will be flooded. If options traders have been confused over what taxes apply to their profits, they soon will be even more confused. But to understand the strange situation, we have to recall how the 32 percent ceiling on futures profits came about in 1981.'' **********The Treasury wanted to ban the then widespread use of tax spreads to roll over tax liabilities indefinitely from one year to another. Not only did many futures traders thus avoid taxes, but so did increasing numbers of people who only used the futures market for that purpose, Mr. Schapiro noted.  Because futures trading is a highly fluid affair, the Treasury set Dec. 31 of each year as the day when all futures traders would have their accounts ''marked to the market'' as a means of establishing tax liabilities. **********Because the options market hardly existed then, these instruments were not covered by the 1981 rules. Since then, options traders have used whatever suited them when calculating taxes owed on their profits. **********As a trade-off, the Government granted futures traders the right to charge 60 percent of the profits as long-term gains and 40 percent as short term, for an effective maximum tax bite of 32 percent. This is commonly referred to as the 60/40 rule. **********While the new tax bill is also aimed at outlawing the use of stock and commodity options for rolling over tax liabilities, the two bills differ. **********The House bill proposes to treat the options and futures profits alike under the 60/40 rule. So does the Senate bill - but only for ''professional exchange market makers,'' not the ''public'' trader. Generally, the public trader would pay higher taxes on most stock and stock index options traded on commodity or equities exchanges. **********''As if this isn't confusing, what about the common practice of mixed spreads involving futures and various kinds of options,'' Mr. Schapiro said. ''The area of mixed spreads alone will fill the tax courts for years.'' **********Another tax expert, Robert A. Rudnick, partner in the law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, agreed, noting that many options traders could be subject to back taxes. This area is not clear in either version of the proposed bills. Also unclear, Mr. Rudnick said, was the status of the Senate bill. **********''The Senate version is actually contained in an amendment to, of all things, the Boat Safety Act of 1971,'' Mr. Rudnick said. ''We think the House version will prevail. The 60/40 rule will eventually apply to all options.'' **********Mr. Rudnick attributed some of the confusion to the fact that the Senate Finance Committee was reflecting the concerns of stock exchanges and some large brokerage houses. **********''The exchanges, including those that trade or plan to trade stock and stock index options, fear that if the public gets a tax break on these instruments, it would adversely affect the trading volume in their much bigger equities markets,'' he said. ''So do some big brokerage houses, although these parties would never admit these fears.'' **********But since index futures are already subject to the 60/40 tax rule, Mr. Rudnick said, ''it is only fair that index options are treated the same way and by extention all other options.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/03/world/indonesia-under-suharto-allows-few-dissenting-voices-to-be-heard.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Trumbull", "pub_date": "1984-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 838, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INDONESIA, UNDER SUHARTO, ALLOWS FEW DISSENTING VOICES TO BE HEARD", "print_headline": "INDONESIA, UNDER SUHARTO, ALLOWS FEW DISSENTING VOICES TO BE HEARD", "body_text": " **********A sales clerk chatting with a customer complained about Indonesia's press censorship and other authoritarian measures of the Government of President Suharto, who has ruled for 17 years. **********Later she followed the departing customer to the sidewalk and asked that she not be quoted by name.

He said that the Government controlled the bureaucracy and labor unions and that the once-feisty students had been tamed by the threat of expulsion for participation in anti-Government activity.   Outspokenness Can Be Costly **********The price of speaking out can be high. Several years ago 50 retired senior military officers sent President Suharto a joint letter suggesting that the time had come to liberalize Indonesia's tightly controlled political system. The letter was ignored, one signer said, but members of the group, now disbanded, who had gone into business found that banks would no longer extend credit to their companies. **********A United States State Department report on human rights in Indonesia, submitted to Congress last February under a law requiring such information on countries receiving American aid, quoted accounts of official harassment of critics of the Government ranging from cutting off telephone and electricity service to pressure put on companies through refusal to accept their bids on Government contracts. **********Politically aware Indonesians chafe at the shadowy role allowed the electorate in choosing the 360-member Parliament, which is dominated overwhelmingly by Mr. Suharto's Golkar Party. One hundred members are appointed by the President. Critics charge that the candidates of the two small opposition parties are also picked by the Government. **********Like President Marcos of the Philippines, Mr. Suharto, a former general, uses the armed forces for law enforcement and places military officers in key administrative posts of the Government.   Leeway Given to a Few **********A few distinguished Indonesians like Adam Malik, the longtime diplomat and former Vice President, are allowed to air critical views without fear of official reprisal. Harsh measures taken against them would attract international attention and could be expected to diminish the Government's reputation in the dozen or so Western countries, including the United States, that contribute to an annual economic aid pool that now stands at $2.2 billion.  The sometimes biting comments by Dr. Malik and others in interviews and articles published abroad are never permitted to reach the eyes of ordinary Indonesians. The censors, who carefully scan all incoming foreign publications before they reach newsstands or subscribers, blot out offending material with a thick layer of gummy black ink, affixing a flap of paper over the damp blotch to prevent it from blemishing the inoffensive print on the facing page. **********Outgoing dispatches by foreign correspondents are not censored, but correspondents whose reporting displeases the Government may find that their visas will not be renewed.   Editors Get Guidance **********One outspoken Indonesian who is allowed latitude for his comments was told by a friendly editor of a telephone call from the Information Ministry directing that nothing the critic said should be published. An editor said he had a list of people whose statements were banned. **********Editors are also told when the Government does not want a news development reported. Such an event occurred in April when troops forcibly evacuated 54 retired military officers, some of them veterans of the war of independence against the Dutch, and their families from a housing project marked for commercial development. **********The old soldiers protested that the compensation offered by the Government, a fraction of what their property was worth, was insufficient for the purchase of new homes elsewhere. Troops then drove them out, but some veterans defiantly set up a tent camp. This took place across a busy street from one of Jakarta's main hotels and was witnessed by thousands of tourists and residents, but not a word about it appeared in the newspapers.   Press Gives False Impression **********A tourist might get the impression that Indonesia has a lively, unfettered press, judging by the accounts of official corruption that regularly appear on the front pages. Well-informed journalists say these stories concern petty graft the Government wants routed out, while the big offenders are never mentioned. **********Editors say they know from experience how far they can go without incurring official anger.

If they succeed, it would cheer inflation watchers and bring gloom to the Administration just before the November elections. **********As usual, the grain and oilseed markets did not learn the farmers' planting intentions from the farmers themselves or the Government, despite the pains that the Agriculture Department takes at this time of year to survey and report on what and how much the grain and cotton farmers plan to grow. Rather, grain merchants and traders monitor fertilizer and other farm chemical sales, the best measure of what farmers intend to plant. **********So does E. S. Finley, president and chief executive officer of the International Commodities Export Corporation. He is one a leading fertilizer exporter, but he studies domestic sales for clues to overseas market trends. **********''Our latest figures show that farmers will be trying to maximize output this season in order to offset the expected decline in market prices,'' Mr. Finley said. ''While current grain and bean prices are somewhat higher than a year ago, farmers apparently are not counting on this situation to obtain at harvest time.'' **********Specifically, he expects fertilizer sales this season to total 47 million tons, up 7 million from last year. This would make 1984 the best sales year for the industry since 1980, when farmers used 55 million tons of fertilizer. **********Last year's low fertilizer use resulted not from the severe drought that started in July but from the ''payment in kind'' crop reduction program Washington created to reduce burdensome surpluses and thus aid hard-pressed grain and cotton farmers. **********''Based on the fertilizer sales figures and, of course, weather permitting, we expect this year's corn crop to come in at 8 billion bushels, compared with 4.2 billion in 1983 and the near-record 8.3 billion the year before, when the weather was good,'' Mr. Finley said. **********He also forecast a total wheat crop of 2.25 billion bushels, based on increased sowing of winter wheat last fall. Last season's total wheat output was 2.4 billion bushels, with the spring crop reduced by drought. In 1982 a record 2.8 billion bushels of wheat were produced. Mr. Finley, who has an enviable record as a crop forecaster, projected a soybean crop of 2 billion bushels for this year, compared with 1.5 billion in 1983 and a record 2.2 billion the year before. **********Overseas he expects China to continue to be the biggest importer of fertilizer as Peking strives to increase its rising level of food production. ''India is also using more imported fertilizers for the same purpose, but Latin America continues to be a disappointing market because of foreign- exchange shortages,'' Mr. Finley said. **********Sherman L. Levin, agricultural research chief at Paine, Webber, Jackson & Curtis in Chicago, said: ''Farmers will certainly try their best to raise production this season, no matter what they declare as their planting intentions. The soybean and cotton growers have already confounded everyone by giving figures indicating that, somehow, 5 million acres have vanished in the South.'' **********The Government also appears concerned that farmers will try to set output records at a time when export demand is at best dismal. Thus, Washington extended the deadline for farmers to sign up for this year's 10 percent acreage set-aside program to March 16, from Feb. 24. **********For example, corn growers who sign up will be assured an average support price of $3.03 a bushel if they leave 10 percent of their acres idle. Last Friday the average cash corn price was $3.30 a bushel, and that price could plunge if a huge crop is harvested. **********Many corn growers who do sign up will try to ''grow'' the lost grain in the futures market, Mr. Levin said. He explained: ''The average corn grower works 500 acres. If he agrees to idle 10 percent, he will lose 5,000 bushels because the average yield is 100 bushels per acre.

And it carried the tacit endorsement of the Interim Council Government of Nicholas Braithwaite, which American troops helped to install when they marched into the country in October. **********But so far, despite outpourings of money and manpower, the Reagan Administration has little to show for its efforts to move Grenada away from a state-run economy to one that embraces **********laissez-faire **********capitalism. Unemployment on the island, which is about the size of Martha's Vineyard, is at record levels. American efforts to woo foreign investors have snagged only one company, a toy maker. And only one local business - a soft-drink factory employing 25 people - has started up in five years. **********Moreover, there is growing resistance to the concept of a free-enterprise economy on Grenada, and political analysts say that the Interim Council probably will use stalling tactics on economic changes until elections, which might take place later this year, make clear the identity of Grenada's next ruling party. Marius St. Rose, chief economist of the Caribbean Development Bank, recently called an unregulated business environment ''alien and impractical'' for Grenada - and several of the candidates vying for assembly seats have been echoing that sentiment. **********Indeed, the Reagan Administration's antipathy to anything smacking of socialism in Grenada has, at least for the short term, exacerbated the island's economic woes. During the late Maurice Bishop's five-year reign, the state imposed a 55 percent flat corporate tax, import duties as high as 75 percent, and a 20 percent reserve requirement for the island's four commercial banks. Although Charles A. McIntyre, president of the local Chamber of Commerce, complains that local merchants have been ''pushed under'' by these taxes and regulations, many Grenadians actually benefited from them. **********The state used the money to support a huge civil service, a 1,000-man army, and numerous state-owned fisheries, hotels, farms and factories - all major employers of Grenada's 110,00 people, 67 percent of whom are under the age of 25. By the time of the invasion last October, unemployment was about 14 percent - a far cry from the 49 percent rate that prevailed in 1978, the year preceding Mr. Bishop's coup. **********This year, at the urging of the United States, the Interim Council decimated Grenada's civil service and disbanded its army. The moves pushed the published unemployment rate to 33 percent - and officials privately admit that real unemployment may be as high as 60 percent. **********Moreover, many of the state-owned enterprises are hemorrhaging. Officials of the Ministry of Finance say that the Grenada Sugar Factory and Grenada Agro-Industries Ltd. together are draining the treasury of over $1 million a year. **********The Reagan Administration reportedly opposes loans from the Inter- American Development Bank and the Caribbean Develpment Bank that might save them. ''There is a lot of pressure not to lend to the Grenadian Government for the rehabilitation of state-owned enterprises,'' said the Caribbean bank's Mr. St. Rose. **********MEANWHILE, tourism is sluggish, and if it were not for the presence of American advisers and workers, the hotel occupancy rate would probably hover around a meager 25 percent. World markets for cocoa, nutmeg and bananas, which provide an estimated 35 percent of Grenada's gross domestic product and 90 percent of its export earnings, are weak. And the American presence effectively has cut off sales of those products to Soviet countries, the principal buyers before the invasion. **********Mr. Braithwaite's Interim Council, despite its reluctance to tamper too much with Grenada's economic structure, is trying to make the island more palatable to an investor's taste. Although it has so far refused to slash the corporate tax rate, the council is offering tax concessions to foreign investors. It has returned several state- operated farms to their original owners, and is seeking the previous owners of other blocks of state land. And the council is reducing reserve requirements for banks to a more manageable 6 percent.  Thus far, United States advisers have identified for sale attractive Government-owned properties such as the Grenada Beach Hotel and the Grenada Bank of Commerce, and have led missions of American businessmen to Grenada. The Agency for International Development has hired Coopers & Lybrand to identify both American and Far Eastern investors. **********The Reagan Administration, which plans $57 million in aid to Grenada over the next two years, is touting the advantages of Grenada's recent inclusion in the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which allows exports from the islands to enter the United States duty free. It is highlighting the availability of a young, English-speaking workforce at a wage of $4.50 a day - still high compared with Haiti's $3 daily wage, but a bargain compared with pay scales in Central America, the Far East and other traditional centers of inexpensive labor. And the United States is offering potential investors subsidized financing for new factories. **********The American advisers are banking that management skills as well as money needed to industrialize Grenada will come in from abroad. Few business analysts suggest that local merchants, most of whom simply market imported foreign products on the island, would do much better than the state in running factories. **********''There is no entrepreneurial class on Grenada, just merchant cartels that mark everything up 200 percent,'' said an American adviser who requested anonymity. **********''The businessmen here are engaged in what we call invoice capitalism,'' added George Louison, Agriculture Minister under Mr. Bishop, and now head of a new political party called the Maurice Bishop Patriotic Movement. ''Anyone who places their future in the hands of Grenada's merchants will be in for a rude shock.'' **********GRENADA'S immediate future actually may be in the hands of vacationers. ''In the short run, the tourism sector is the only area of the economy that can have a substantial impact on employment and foreign exchange problems,'' stated an Agency for International Development report drawn up last March. **********But Grenada's creaky infrastructure remains a major impediment to tourism. Its utility services are poor, and its only airstrip cannot accommodate widebodied aircraft or night landings. Island hoteliers say that after the $71 million airport under construction at Point Salines is completed they will proceed with plans to triple the number of rooms on the island, to 1,500 from the current 500. Royston Hopkins, a past president of the Grenada Hotel Owners Association, said that the strategy is ''to concentrate on attracting a luxury clientele.'' **********The Agency for International Development is contributing $19 million toward the estimated $21 million needed to finish the airport. One American official said it would be completed ''come hell or high water'' by the first anniversary of the invasion, and it is widely rumored here - and the United States Embassy does not deny it - that President Reagan will open the airport on Oct. 25. **********No one is willing to guess whether Grenada's long-awaited general elections will have occurred by that time. And most political analysts say that the development agency's fervent search for foreign investors cannot succeed until Grenada's political future has been resolved. **********Indeed, the Ingle Toy Company of New Jersey, which has spent an estimated $500,000 to set up a wooden toy manufacturing facility on Grenada, is the only new foreign investor since the October invasion. But other American companies, including MacGregor Sporting Goods, Agro-Tech International and the Totalbank Corporation, have expressed interest. **********Frederick Brooks, MacGregor's chairman, said that MacGregor, which has a large factory in Haiti, is interested in making canvas mailbags in Grenada, in part because the Agency for International Development is offering 4 1/2 percent financing for its factory and because Washington has indicated that MacGregor could look forward to a United States Government contract for its Grenadian output. **********The Totalbank Corporation, which is the parent company of Florida retail bank Totalbank, has offered to head a consortium of foreign and local investors to purchase the state- owned Grenada Bank of Commerce for $2.5 million. But so far, said Francisco Blanco, Totalbank Corporation's vice president for corporate finance, the Interim Council is dragging its feet on his proposal. ''They still haven't said no, but they have not followed up, either,'' he said. **********The delay is frustrating to local merchants, who claim that Grenadian bankers have been unwilling to use the estimated $31 million on deposit in the island's banks to make long-term loans. ''I would not want to see a foreign bank buying a Grenadian bank out completely,'' said Mr. McIntyre, who is one of Totalbank's potential partners, ''but we do need outside help.'' **********MOST political analysts predict that the Interim Council will leave decisions on major divestitures to the next Government. And they say that if Sir Eric Gairy, whose 18-year regime was overthrown by Mr. Bishop, makes a comeback, or if Mr. Louison's Maurice Bishop Patriotic Movement, which wants to reinstate the policies of the Bishop Government, attain a majority in the Assembly, the entire American effort to attract private- sector investors could go by the boards. ''Gairy would be an absolute disaster,'' said one senior American official. ''The only thing that would be worse is if the M.B.P.M. took all the seats.'' **********George Brizan's National Democratic Party also is arguing for a large state role in the economy. Of the major contenders, only Herbert Blaize's Grenada National Party is running on a conservative platform. The United States is urging a coalition of these two parties in hopes of routing Mr. Gairy's well-financed, anti-Communist Grenada United Labor Party, but the elderly Mr. Blaize, who was Prime Minister here between 1962 and 1967, is somewhat wary of the 41-year-old Mr. Brizan. ''The N.D.P. will find a home,'' said Mr. Blaize, ''as long as they don't twist it around the way it was under Bishop.'' **********Neither Mr. Brizan nor Mr. Blaize supports current attempts to bring in light assembly operations - particularly those which, like MacGregor's, would use imported raw materials. ''The kind of industries we must attract should be labor-intensive,'' said Mr. Brizan, ''but we don't want screwdriver industries that won't generate any foreign exchange.'' **********Both of the politicians are campaigning on a platform of strengthening Grenada's agricultural industries, an area that is unlikely to attract the foreign companies now being wooed by the development agency. ''Private investment has a definite role to play but it cannot take up the slack by itself,'' said Mr. Blaize. ''There is a role for the state in the economy, a leading role.'' **********Jonathan Friedland is a Washington-based correspondent for Inter Press Service, Third World News Agency."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/19/world/around-the-world-railroad-station-is-hit-in-3d-french-bombing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Railroad Station Is Hit In 3d French Bombing", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Railroad Station Is Hit In 3d French Bombing", "body_text": " **********A bomb exploded Friday at the Grenoble train station, and a group that claimed responsibility for two previous bombings demanded nearly $3.75 million to stop its attacks. **********Police sources said a man, his face covered with blood, ran from the area after the explosion and boarded a bus. **********Hospitals were searched, and the police set up roadblocks in the region. **********The bomb caused minor damage, the police said.

This is double the number of border crossings over the previous two years, refugee workers say. **********The influx, attributed to poor economic conditions, collectivization and other problems, is a source of concern to Thai and other relief agencies. **********The Laotians, who are mainly Hmong hill people, known by outsiders as Meo, have found adjustment more difficult than other Indochinese refugees. Thailand has refused to allow any more Hmong to settle among Thai hill tribes of similar ethnic background. **********Since May 1983, Thailand has been treating all Laotians as illegal immigrants, not refugees. There are now 80,000 Laotians in Thailand, compared with 40,000 Cambodians and 9,000 Vietnamese.   Access to Camp Now Restricted **********Part of the reason for Thailand's decision can be seen here at Ban Vinai, a camp for Hmong that has become a settlement of 43,000 people. Some of them have lived here for six or seven years; many of them, hearing stories of problems the Hmong are facing in the United States, are reluctant to move. The Thais are putting pressure on them to return home. **********Thailand no longer admits Laotians to Ban Vinai, which is near the Mekong River, about 30 miles north of the provincial capital of Loei. The refugees are now held in detention camps and police stations along the Mekong River border. Most Laotians swim or float on bamboo rafts across the river. Some have been entering overland farther north. **********Many Hmong have a special reason for being here. During the 1960's and 70's, a Hmong military unit fighting the Communist insurgents and the North Vietnamese in Laos was supported by the United States. Hmong were also recruited to infiltrate Communist-held areas in Vietnam itself.   Old Scores Are Being Settled **********In the nine years since the Communists took over Laos, and particularly since 1979, when Vietnam installed the Heng Samrin Government in Cambodia, Vietnam's military presence in the region has increased, and some Vietnamese are settling old scores. **********''My father was a soldier in Vietnam,'' 18-year-old Xiong Kao told a visitor to Ban Vinai. ''Two years ago, the Vietnamese came to catch him. But he is very old, and I am still young, so everyone told me, they won't take him, they will catch you instead. I was afraid, and I ran.'' **********Xiong Kao, then 16 and alone, said he fled through the wooded Laotian hills for 14 days before arriving at the banks of the Mekong. He swam for four hours, he said, to reach Thailand. He has been at Ban Vinai ever since, one of a burgeoning new generation of young Hmong who seem to be trapped here more by fear, confusion and conflicting pressures than by the camp's gate. **********The young Hmong are also under pressure from their own warrior leadership, especially Gen. Vang Pao, who now spends much of his time in the United States, to remain in Thailand and prepare for a new guerrilla war to overthrow the Communists in Laos.   French Offer Is Declined **********Further, there are clan and family pressures to stay together, and second thoughts about emigration to the United States or other distant places. When a French team visited the camp recently to recruit 80 more settlers for French Guiana, an aid organizer said, only about 30 people took up the offer. **********Until two or three years ago, many Hmong counted on their erstwhile American allies, and Washington granted them asylum as a persecuted minority. That door is still open. **********''These are a nomadic people who traditionally send out a few scouts to look at a territory before they move in numbers,'' said the Rev. Edward Brady, an American priest working for a Thai Roman Catholic bishops' group that oversees education at Ban Vinai. **********Early Hmong refugees in the United States sent back tales of hardship and dislocation. While there were success stories, there were also disasters. **********There is now an understanding among the refugees here that life abroad can cause social and psychological damage. Coming from a remote culture, worshipping spirits by whom they are still often guided, the Hmong have far greater problems dealing with Western life than do the urbanized Vietnamese, Chinese or other immigrants, refugee officials say. **********Men Are Having Worst Problem **********Middle-aged and elderly men, who are reduced from positions of authority within the clan to the unemployed, illiterate, uncomprehending margin of life, have the worst problems. **********Yang Chou, a man in his 20's with a fourth-grade education in Laos who has learned English here well enough to teach it to other Hmong, said people of his generation might find work. **********''But what about the old man who is just a farmer,'' he asked, ''Who in America would give a job to him?'' **********Hmong living in the United States, many of them in California, have been generous in supporting fellow Hmong at Ban Vinai, refugee workers say. **********''Their physical needs are being met,'' an American refugee worker said, ''What we have here is a crisis of broken spirits.

In doing so he continues several misconceptions about Conrail and the railroad industry. **********Mr. Edgar states that Conrail has adopted the ''new technologies'' of piggy-backing and of truck trailers with both rubber and rail wheels (known as RoadRailer). These concepts are hardly new. Piggy-backing has existed since the 1950's and was heavily promoted by Conrail's predecessor, Penn Central, and before that, by the New York Central. Conrail does not promote the RoadRailer concept - it merely provides the locomotive and crew for a single Buffalo- New York run; a mere 400 miles on a 15,000 mile system. **********Mr. Edgar does indirectly hit upon what has turned Conrail around - the reduction of labor. Conrail had nearly 100,000 employees in 1976 and has only about 39,000 now. Many of the ''unprofitable branches'' are now run as independent shortlines which can make money where Conrail did not because of lower labor costs. **********Finally, Mr. Edgar does not mention that the deregulation of the railroad industry in 1980 allowed railroads to do more modern marketing than its competition has been able to do for decades.

Their marketing plan is aimed at re-electing a President and Vice President - Ronald Reagan and George Bush. **********In 7,000 square feet at 1270 Avenue of the Americas next door to Radio City and in space previously used by Exxon Office Systems, James D. Travis, president of Della Femina, Travisano & Partners, is supervising a group of top-notch professional advertising people. By the day before Election Day, this Tuesday Team will have produced about 80 TV commercials and an untold number of print ads, and spent about $20 million to run them starting the day after Labor Day.  Additionally, if William Greener, communications director of the Republican National Committee, has his way, the agency will also be doing joint advertising for his organization and the National Republican Congressional Committee on the issues. And indeed the Tuesday Team, working at unusual speed for an ad agency, has already made them a number of TV spots. **********The creative team, which Mr. Travis wishes he could have for a regular agency, consists of Jim Weller of the Los Angles office of Della Femina, whose only previous political effort was in behalf of Edward V. Regan, the New York State Comptroller; Hal Riney of Ogilvy & Mather, San Francisco; Marvin Honig, recently of Doyle Dane Bernbach; two writers and two art directors whose names are not being given out because of possible repercussions from clients, and, part time, Ron Travisano, Della Femina's vice chairman. **********And when they are called volunteers, it's not because they work for nothing, because they are getting paid. Except for Mr. Honig, they will all be able to go back to their old jobs when their mission is over. **********The Tuesday Team includes ''all the best in the business, terrific and fast,'' said Mr. Travis, who noted that most of them are now working at home and missing out on the possible inspiration they could get from the unpainted and unspackled walls at the Avenue of the Americas headquarters. **********Mr. Travis is being assisted in running the show by Walter A.

Walter Thompson volunteers are working as account executives: Mark Zimmerman in New York and Susan Bricker in Washington. **********A key job in an agency that has to work as fast and furiously as the Tuesday Team will is the advertising production head. That job is filled by a old hand from the 1980 Presidential campaign, Geoff Kelly, who is usually a consultant in the field. **********Mr. Travis's previous political experience was when he was at DKG Advertising, which was working to put Jacob Javits back in the Senate in 1968. The executive, however, believes that, especially on the creative side, a lack of previous experience can be an asset and can lessen the chance of producing typical political advertising. **********He then turned on his TV to show the seven commercials that his people produced in a hurry for showing during one week in May between the President's trip to China and the one to Ireland, Normandy and London, to make sure that the name Reagan remained in the public mind in a positive fashion despite the negative comments being voiced by two Democratic candidates, Walter F. Mondale and Senator Gary Hart. **********Part of the Travis proposal when he was pitching to the Reagan-Bush '84 people was that the Tuesday Team could enlist some of the top people in advertising to serve as consultants. Mr. Travis said he only tried for a few volunteers and could have gotten as many as he wanted. **********Those who will be reviewing the finished advertising, Mr. Travis said, are Edward N. Ney, chairman of Young & Rubicam, America's largest agency; Kenneth Roman, president of Ogilvy & Mather; Charles D. Peebler Jr., president of Bozell & Jacobs, and Philip B. Dusenberry, vice chairman of Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborne, which, as the agency for Dwight D. Eisenhower, moved national politics into the television age. **********Working in the frantic environment of a national political campaign does have certain rewards.

Crocker, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, before the two men opened private talks in Lusaka, the Zambian capital. **********Mr. Kaunda said that as long as the United States insisted on demanding a withdrawal of the estimated 25,000 Cuban soldiers, ''then the withdrawal process of South African troops from southern Angola and from Namibia itself will be jammed.'' **********Namibia is the name by which South- West Africa, a former German colony ruled by South Africa in defiance of the United Nations, is also known.

The United States played a central role in the latest initiative by helping to mediate an accord in February under which South Africa agreed to withdraw forces from southern Angola in return for Angolan curbs on the South- West African rebels based there. **********Since then, however, South Africa and Zambia have taken the lead in the initiative, despite wide ideological differences.

Now artificial intelligence, or A.I., is making its way into the research and development laboratories of Fortune 500 companies across the nation. **********The change has opened doors for people like Gregg Vesonder, 32 years old, who is not your average computer programmer. Five years ago, after finishing his Ph.D. in cognitive psychology at the University of Pittsburgh, Mr. Vesonder turned down an academic position for a job at Bell Laboratories' research center in Whippany, N.J. The system he created, Automated Cable Expertise, or ''ACE,'' enables a computer to monitor telephone cable repair and recommend maintenance. It is already in use in Fort Worth, Tex. **********Mr. Vesonder is one of a relatively tiny force of young Ph.D.'s and university professors who also work at the commercial vanguard of a technology that most believe will have enormous ramifications for the computer industry. International Data Resources, a consulting firm in Norwalk, Conn., estimates that the market for artificial-intelligence products, now less than $100 million, could be worth $8 billion by 1990. And many experts predict that within the decade there will be little computing that is not somehow affected by the new discipline. **********Artificial intelligence is a broad term used to describe any program that allows computers to handle functions considered to require intelligence when humans do them. Programs like Mr. Vesonder's ACE are called knowledge-based, or expert systems, because they imitate the work done by experts. Another expert system, designed by Schlumberger Ltd., an oil- production products company, will interpret data from oil-well readings; TRW has created a system called ''Adept,'' which can help military field commanders make tactical decisions in battle. **********A second major A.I. sector deals with so-called natural language computer programs, which enable computers to recognize and understand English and other written languages and thus obviate some computer-language programs, eliminating the need for many data-processing personnel. Experts estimate that sales of such programs alone could reach $2 billion by the end of the decade. **********The growing market for this discipline bodes well for the very few qualified to work in it. University officials report that doctoral candidates are increasingly sought by major oil, aerospace and computing companies, as well as by small robotics concerns and a growing number of start-up consulting firms. Employers who seek such programmers agree that it is already a job-hunter's market, and that the industry's expected growth in the next 5 to 10 years could well outstrip the availability of human resources it will require. **********''It's a hot area, and there are a lot of companies that are trying to apply it,'' said Rick Reis, assistant director of the Center for Integrated Systems in Palo Alto. ''The numbers of people who are going into the field aren't large, and the demand exceeds the supply considerably.'' Shin-Yee Lu, a research specialist and recruiter for the Exxon Corporation, echoed the phenomenon: ''I will be lucky to find two people by the end of the year.'' **********The people who enter commercial artificial-intelligence operations still are most notable for their scarcity. Only Stanford, Carnegie-Mellon and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have sizable A.I. research facilities, and each produces only a dozen Ph.D.'s yearly in A.I.-related fields - typically, computer science or electrical engineering. **********THIS relative scarcity obtains even though interest in such programs has risen sharply: Carnegie-Mellon, for one, reports that applications for admission to its A.I.-related Ph.D. programs are more than six times what they were in 1976. **********Some graduates find positions through their universities' job placement offices; according to Robert Wetherall, director of the M.I.T. office of career services, representatives of more big high-technology companies than ever, including Honeywell, United Technologies and Schlumberger, filed through his office last year in search of A.I. programmers. Starting salaries at M.I.T. and other schools average between $40,000 and $50,000, slightly higher than those in other special computing disciplines. **********But more often, employers and employees acknowledge, jobs result from academic contacts. ''I know most of the people who will be graduating this year with A.I. degrees,'' said Mitchell Marcus, who left M.I.T.'s artificial-intelligence research staff two years ago to develop natural-language programs for Bell Labs. ''The number of people who are doing research and are very good is very small.'' **********Not all artificial-intelligence programmers have computing or engineering Ph.D.'s, and increasing numbers have little or no A.I. research experience. The A.I. researchers in TRW's Defense Systems Group include Ph.D.'s in philosophy, linguistics and biological engineering; all received in-house training in A.I. ''The common link is that they love knowledge,'' said Edward Taylor, director of requirements analysis for the TRW division. ''They like to twist things around.'' **********Many experts believe that a company's ability to train programmers from within will soon become a key to success in A.I. research. Indeed, some downplay the importance of specifically trained Ph.D.'s at all, arguing instead that industry demand will soon require that certain A.I. courses be taught at lower educational levels. **********Some artificial intelligence will actually reduce the need for computing jobs - indeed, the point is a source of controversy in the industry. Henry Levin, a Stanford economist, among others, argues that new products in natural languages will eliminate many jobs held by traditional software programmers. **********For Ph.D.'s specifically trained in artificial intelligence, the long-term employment outlook appears secure but not dynamic. Most believe that Ph.D.'s will remain in demand but will never account for a significant portion of the field's total employment. ''It's not a field that's going to employ thousands of people right now because it's not production-oriented,'' said Mr. Reis of the Center for Integrated Systems. ''And once it is production-oriented, you'll have engineers, not Ph.D.'s, putting A.I. systems together.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/15/world/around-the-world-suriname-bauxite-strike-spreads-to-3-banks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Suriname Bauxite Strike Spreads to 3 Banks", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Suriname Bauxite Strike Spreads to 3 Banks", "body_text": " **********Employees of three commerical banks have joined a month-old bauxite workers' strike in a widening protest over the military government's tax policies. **********Lieut.

But in his commitment to compromise and his faith in reason he has been quintessentially Canadian, dedicated to domestic and international policies that stress reasoned discourse and conciliation. **********He was first swept into office committed to healing the growing rift between French- and English-speakers and keeping his native Quebec within the regionally disparate Canadian federation. He applied the same approach to international issues, arguing for talks between rich and poor countries and offering his view of an economically interdependent world. **********And in his most recent crusade, the Prime Minister traveled to Washington, Moscow, Stockholm, Budapest, London, Tokyo and New Delhi urging new talks on disarmament, more conciliation, compromise.   16 Years in Office **********The personal flamboyance often concealed a highly disciplined intelligence. Back from the nightclubs, where he had been photographed with young women and stars such as Barbra Streisand, he would stand in Parliament, his ever-present rose in his lapel, and demolish opposition arguments with graceful ease. **********By the time he actually steps down, once a new Liberal Party leader is selected, the 64-year-old Mr. Trudeau, after 16 years in office, will have served longer than any other Canadian Prime Minister except William Lyon Mackenzie King, who was in office for a total of 22 years in three terms between 1921 and 1948. **********In his span, Mr. Trudeau, a Jesuit- educated constitutional lawyer, has offered his own agenda and made it that of the nation. In the words of Richard Gwyn, a writer and a Trudeau biographer, Mr. Trudeau has been ''central to the Canadian imagination as no other Prime Minister has been before him.''  'Reason Before Passion' **********Under his leadership Canada became officially bilingual and multicultural. It also broke most of its juridical links to Britain and established a Charter of Rights as part of a new written Constitution. **********Essentially, Mr. Trudeau's years in office were dominated by three major domestic concerns: the maintenance of national integrity with regard to Quebec, the formal decolonization from Britain and an attempt to loosen economic dependency on the United States. **********On Quebec, the Montreal native jousted with Rene Levesque, his equally charismatic adversary and a veteran of the same Montreal salons. While Mr. Levesque, the Premier of Quebec province, rallied French Canadians to independence emphasizing emotional and passionate appeals to nationalist sentiments, Mr. Trudeau used cold and hard economic arguments in urging them to seize their destiny within the Canadian union. In this as in so many other fights he was guided by his personal motto, ''Reason before passion.'' **********When separatist nationalists began a program of terror bombings and kidnappings in Montreal in 1970, Mr. Trudeau, two years into his first term, moved quickly to call out the army and round up students and teachers among hundreds of suspected nationalists. With an adamancy that his critics have repeatedly regarded as arrogance, the Prime Minister brushed aside charges that he was violating human rights. **********''It is more important to maintain law and order than to worry about those whose knees tremble at the sight of the army,'' he declared. **********The key dramatic moment in the struggle over Quebec came two months after Mr. Trudeau and his party were returned to office after a nine- month interruption of his leadership, a period when Joe Clark, the former Conservative leader, headed a minority Government. **********At that point, in the spring of 1980, Federalist forces led by Mr. Trudeau entered into ideological combat against the separatist coalition headed by Mr. Levesque to defeat a referendum whose passage would have paved the way for the predominantly French- speaking province to withdraw from the Canadian federation. **********The British North America Act **********The next major crusade for the Prime Minister was his struggle to repatriate the British North America Act of 1867, Canada's Founding Document, giving Canada the right to amend it. To achieve this he needed the support of a majority of provincial premiers who, reflecting the states rights issues that long dominated United States politics, were guarding their prerogatves. **********Eventually, on Nov. 5, 1981, nine of the premiers approved a new Constitution. The lone holdout, Mr. Levesque, insisted in vain that Quebec be given specific veto powers in the amending procedures in order to protect the French minority in Canada. **********Perhaps Mr. Trudeau's least successful policy initiative was the one seeking greater national control over Canada's economy. Basically, his Government sought to curb United States dominance of the economy by limiting foreign investment in energy fields and by reviewing all foreign investments to determine whether they were in Canada's best interests. **********He succeeded in gaining approval of a policy that limited foreign holdings in oil and gas. But, after strong objections were raised by the United States and after a deteriorating Canadian economy pointed out the need for capital investments from whatever quarter, the Government in the last two years retreated on the entire issue of economic nationalism. **********In the international field, he concentrated on efforts to forge cooperation between the industrialzed democracies and the resource-exporting nations of the third world. As a one-time student of Harold Laski at the London School of Economics, Mr. Trudeau sought to reflect a compassionate idealism that linked him to such leaders as Julius K. Nyerere of Tanzania, Olof Palme of Sweden, Willy Brandt of West Germany. He also became close to Helmut Schmidt of West Germany, who disuaded him from further scuttling Canada's NATO commitments.   Beyond Politics **********Throughout his tenure, Mr. Trudeau dominated Canadian life far beyond politics. In his first campaign, he set off a frenzy that the press called Trudeaumania. The candidate, a rich and well-connected bachelor who could flash his intelligence and wit in either French or English, was said to evoke a Canadian version of John F. Kennedy. **********His marriage in 1970, at the age of 51, to 22-year-old Margaret Sinclair commanded attention in Canada and around the world. And when after three sons were born that marriage unraveled, the Prime Minister faced a barrage of publicity by maintaining his silence and working. **********In recent years, as the Trudeaumania wore off, he was attacked repeatedly for shunning and disdaining the press, and yet he monopolized press attention. He could and did gesture impolitely to striking lumbermen or refer in Parliament to an opponent as ''the honorable stinker.'' He also became the object of parodies, plays and critical board games."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/25/jobs/and-now-televised-recruiting.html": {"writer_name": "Katya Goncharoff", "pub_date": "1984-03-25", "snippet": "''WANT to be on the cutting edge of the new technology?

The purpose of this meeting will be to recruit college students for positions at high-technology concerns. As one company representative put it, ''It will be a new high-tech way for high-tech companies to hire high-tech people.'' **********The broadcast will be beamed to a communications satellite, then bounced back to earth where such schools as Duke University, the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Minnesota will receive it. Students watching large- screen television will be able to see, hear and question the company representatives; the participants in Washington will not be able to see the students, but they will be able to hear and respond to their questions.  In addition to the college recruiters, project managers and maybe even a company president or two will be present to say positive things about his or her concern. They may also take viewers on a video tour of the company plant and display the company's products. **********This entire electronic event will be produced by Business People Inc., a company based in Minneapolis. ''This is not a replacement for traditional college recruiting,'' according to David Aberman, Business People's executive vice president. **********''It is an additional way for companies and students to view each other,'' Mr. Aberman said. ''The companies are interested in hiring people who best suit their needs. The students are interested in talking and working for companies that are involved in the technologies that interest them. The teleconference format saves both companies and students a lot of time.'' **********''It is a new approach to getting your company message across,'' said Noreen Nelson, staffing manager for the defense systems division at Sperry Corporation. ''I describe it as a sort of mutual exchange by satellite. We do have an extensive college-recruitment schedule, but we can't visit all the colleges we would like to, and so by using the teleconference format we can reach more of the students who might like to learn about us.'' **********According to Miss Nelson, it is not always easy to find the qualified candidates to fill openings for computer-aided design specialists, for example, or logic and circuit designers, but in her estimation the teleconference format will significantly increase the company's chances of finding the right person for a specific job. ''The students we are dealing with have grown up with television,'' she said, ''and so to them this will be a much more natural way to do things. It is also high-tech and innovative and we are that kind of company. From that standpoint, it appeals to us a lot.'' **********Other personnel representatives are less enthusiastic about a recruitment teleconference. They feel that a format of this sort is too artificial, and that face-to-face, in-person meetings are the most effective way to attract applicants for jobs, supplemented by full-color brochures and company literature. The latter, they feel, can be just as effective a means of attracting interested students, if not much more so. **********It will cost each company $2,400 to participate in the teleconference for one day. Thus far the participating institutions, besides Duke, Minnesota and Berkeley, include the Michigan Technological University, Southern University in Louisiana, Illinois Institute of Technology, Georgia Institute of Technology, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, California Polytechnic Institute and Pennsylvania State University.

But much of the decline was accounted for by a drop in the volatile military hardware category, which is not expected to remain depressed. (Page D7.) **********Called Positive Development **********Government officials and private analysts saw the slowing as a positive development, saying that it should allow the expansion to continue at a sustainable pace rather than exploding into a new burst of high inflation. **********In a typical comment, Thomas Thomson, chief economist for the Crocker National Bank in San Francisco, said the new figures ''should be welcomed by almost everyone.'' **********''It's better to have a sustained recovery than a boom-bust situation,'' he said. ''I'm not concerned at all that the slowdown will become a stall.'' **********The chief White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, said the April figures ''show the economy to be moving ahead at a brisk but sustainable pace.'' Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the relatively modest increase in the leading indicators meant that ''less robust economic growth lies ahead.'' **********Rise in Rates Cited **********Private economists said the increase in interest rates over the last several months undoubtedly had a lot to do with the slowdown. **********Michael K. Evans, head of Evans Economics in Washington, said weaker economic growth, coupled with lower-than-expected inflation and other factors, could even bring rates down.

April credit figures were missing from the new report, and Mr. Evans said those likely would be weaker, making a downward revision in the April index possible. **********The report gave these additional details: **********- The biggest factor pushing the overall index upward was an increase in the average workweek to 41.2 hours from 40.6 hours in March. **********- Also rising were formation of new businesses, building permits for new home construction, the nation's money supply, stock prices and the prices of sensitive raw materials. **********- Negative signals included a decline in contracts and orders for new plants and equipment, an increase in first-time claims for unemployment benefits, a drop in orders to manufacturers for consumer goods and a decline in companies reporting slower business deliveries. **********In all, the report said, the leading indicators index rose to 167.8 percent of the 1967 base level of 100."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/09/world/indian-moslems-fear-mobs-might-pick-them-next.html": {"writer_name": "Pranay Gupte", "pub_date": "1984-11-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 665, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INDIAN MOSLEMS FEAR MOBS MIGHT PICK THEM NEXT", "print_headline": "INDIAN MOSLEMS FEAR MOBS MIGHT PICK THEM NEXT", "body_text": " **********Many Moslems in this southern Indian city say they fear that widespread attacks against Sikhs in the aftermath of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's assassination are an indication of a larger problem. They say this is the inability of the Hindu-dominated Government to rein in effectively the right-wing Hindu groups that are openly challenging Moslems and other minorities in many parts of India. **********''Our hearts go out to our Sikh brothers,'' said Abdul Aziz, who heads an organization here called Jammat- e-Islami. ''But if one minority group is subjected to this kind of terror, then can other minorities in this vast land truly be safe?'' **********Hundreds of Sikhs have been killed by Hindu mobs in places like New Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. Now many Moslems here fear that the south, which in the last week has been relatively free of strife, might be overtaken by the violence. **********These Moslems are mindful of the fact that just a few weeks ago Hyderabad was the scene of fierce rioting between Hindus and Moslems. Dozens of Moslems died, and property damage was estimated by the authorities in the millions of dollars. So far this year there have been four separate incidents of sustained rioting here, and this city of three million people has been under curfew for a total of 50 days. **********Sulaiman Sikander, a vice president of the All-India Majlis Tameer- e-Millat, a leading Islamic civic organization, said: ''These right-wing groups, such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, foster a continuing suspicion of us Moslems - they openly say that we are a fifth column in India, that we are in league with the Pakistanis. There is absolutely no basis to such charges. But we Moslem minorities are made very vulnerable by such poisonous talk.'' **********This city's Islamic leaders wield much influence among India's 80 million Moslems because Hyderabad has tradionally been a center for Islamic learning and culture. **********In conversations with some of the leaders today, what emerged was their unhappiness that although the Government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had acted swiftly to compensate financially the Sikhs affected by the recent violence, Moslems who suffered recently in similar incidents of violence here and in other Indian cities have not received such assistance. **********The vulnerability that Mr. Sikander spoke about was an allusion to widespread speculation that Pakistan had something to do with the assassination of Mrs. Gandhi. **********Many Indians believe Pakistan has trained and supported Sikh militants agitating for a separate Sikh state in the Punjab. Many Indians also believe that the two Sikh security guards who the police say killed Mrs. Gandhi last week were acting on behalf of these militants. **********What worries Hyderabad's Islamic leaders is the association by implication of Moslems with Sikh agitators. They worry that the Hindu rightists, by suggesting that Indian Moslems are somehow allied with Pakistan, are in effect linking India's Moslem minority with the Sikh militancy. They therefore fear that the violence directed at the Sikhs by Hindus could now be unleashed on Moslems. **********''What also worries us is the fact that those who have engaged in ethnic violence, whether against Moslems in the past, or against Sikhs now, usually go unpunished,'' said Mr. Aziz. **********He added: ''If some people are punished, then it will act as a deterrent to those who engage in ethnic hooliganism. When Mrs. Gandhi was here in Hyderabad recently after the last rioting, we told her this. But she nodded and only gave us a casual reply that she would look into our suggestion. What worries us is that the Government never seems to take any action.

The move appears to be an attempt to establish a backup defense in case Bankers Trust loses a longstanding legal battle over its commercial paper role. **********And it follows by only one day the news that Citicorp is seeking a similar go-ahead from the Fed on the placing of securities activities in a nonbank subsidiary. **********''This will give us additional options for the future,'' Thomas Parisi, the Bankers Trust spokesman, said. The application, which the bank expects to file early next year, will ask the Fed to permit the bank to transfer its commercial paper activity to the BT Commercial Corporation, a unit now engaged in asset-based lending. **********Mr. Parisi declined to comment further on his bank's strategy. The Fed has said that by early April it will rule whether Bankers Trust's commercial paper activity should be deemed underwriting, which would be a violation of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act. That act bars banks from underwriting corporate securities. **********Last June, the Supreme Court ruled that commercial paper is a corporate security and is therefore subject to the Glass-Steagall restriction. The court's ruling, however, left open the question of whether the way Banker Trust conducts its commercial paper activity is, in fact, underwriting. **********Relies on Loophole **********By concentrating its commercial paper activities in a subsidiary, Bankers Trust is apparently relying on a loophole in the 1933 Act, which allows bank holding companies to underwrite securities as long as it is done in a non-bank subsidiary whose principal activity is not underwriting. **********Citicorp said Thursday that it was relying on this same loophole, contained in Section 20 of the act, in an application it currently has pending with the Fed to permit it to engage in broad underwriting activities, including commercial paper. **********Mr. Parisi said that his bank's action was not prompted by Citicorp's. ''Our plans to file have been in the works for several weeks,'' he said. **********If the Section 20 loophole is allowed to stand, Bankers Trust could conceivably continue its commercial paper activities, even if they are deemed to be underwriting. It also might set itself up as a traditional underwriter, one that purchases securities with its own funds from a corporation and then resells them to investors on a marked-up basis. **********Bankers Trust contends that its present activity is not underwriting, because it functions as an agent bringing buyers and sellers together, and collects a fee for its service. **********The Securities Industry Association, which in the past has sued to block Bankers Trust's commercial paper activity, said that after studying the bank's latest application it was likely to take further legal action. **********'Frantic Ways' **********''We will either petition the Fed or fight it at the district court level,'' the S.I.A.'s president, Edward I. O'Brien, said yesterday. He said he viewed both Citicorp's move and the Bankers Trust announced intention as ''frantic ways to circumvent Glass-Steagall.'' **********In the past, the Fed chairman, Paul A. Volcker, has said banks should not be permitted to underwrite corporate securities. **********Commercial paper is a short-term i.o.u. that a corporation sells in $100,000 increments to institutional investors. Because commercial paper interest rates usually are less costly than bank loans, the commercial paper market has grown enormously. **********Most of the $225 billion of commercial paper now outstanding was placed by investment banks. Commercial banks, such as Bankers Trust, are eager to gain a major share as well. Only a handful of major banks, including Chemical Bank, Bank of America and Morgan Guaranty Trust, have ventured into the field thus far. Others are waiting until the legal questions are resolved. **********Bankers Trust, the nation's seventh-largest bank, serves about 40 companies in the placement of commercial paper. With $3 billion of paper outstanding, it ranks sixth in volume behind such giants as Goldman, Sachs & Company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/05/business/advertising-reader-s-digest-closing-subsidiary-in-spain.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1984-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reader's Digest Closing Subsidiary in Spain", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Reader's Digest Closing Subsidiary in Spain", "body_text": " **********The Reader's Digest Association said it would close its subsidiary in Spain with the June 1985 issue. **********The subsidiary, begun in Madrid in 1952, ''has been unprofitable for a number of years with no prospect of economic improvement in the foreseeable future,'' the company said. **********The edition in Spain, which employs 119 people, has a monthly circulation of more than 400,000 copies.

''What Bowater has done is give recognition to trends that were already there,'' observed Tony Pennie, an analyst with James Capel & Company, a London brokerage house. **********Bowater emphasizes that it is naturally two companies: one, based in Britain, has moved away from paper manufacture toward production of packaging, housing fixtures and other products; and the other, based in Old Greenwich, Conn., is among the largest North American producers of newsprint. **********Ties Are 'Inconsequential' **********''The connections between Bowater's North American operations and those elsewhere in the world are quite inconsequential,'' said Ingram Lenton, the company's 56-year-old managing director, who next August will succeed Lord Erroll of Hale as chairman of the British Bowater. ''Let them both flourish separately - that's the essence of it.'' **********Bowater plans to offer 7.4 million common shares, or 25 percent, of the new North American company, to be called Bowater Inc. The issue, due next month, is expected to raise about $140 million. Then in the summer, the company will give the remaining shares to existing Bowater Corporation shareholders, who are expected to approve the plan at a meeting next Thursday. Shares of the new company will trade on the New York Stock Exchange. **********The North American operations have consistently produced the greater part of the company's profits. Mills in Tennessee, South Carolina and Canada - two of which are operated in ventures with The Washington Post and the Newhouse Newspaper Group - contributed nearly 70 percent of corporate operating income from 1980 to 1982, before slipping to 54 percent last year. In 1983, the Bowater Corporation reported earnings of $58 million, before taking one-time losses, on revenues of $2.35 billion. **********Some followers of the company have questioned why Bowater is dropping the most profitable of its businesses just as a strong recovery in the North American paper industry could be expected to lift earnings.  Capital Needs Are Heavy **********In response, the company points to the heavy capital spending needed for North American operations - about $450 million over the next three years, including $250 million to modernize the huge plant at Calhoun, Tenn. ''It's not that we couldn't have provided it, but it would have been a strain,'' Mr. Lenton said. **********Bowater is guessing that Wall Street - which it sees as more sympathetic than London capital markets to the needs of heavy industry - will provide the American company with a greater opportunity to get the financing it needs. ''It's a fact where the more sympathetic home is, and it's on Wall Street,'' Mr. Lenton said. **********The Bowater issue has drawn substantial interest on Wall Street already. ''Technically, this is a very strong company, of some substance and stature in terms of its position in the market,'' said Larry Ross, a paper industry analyst with Paine Webber in New York. **********Mr. Ross and others point out that most of Bowater's paper operations are in the South, where lower costs and faster growing trees have taken business from the once-dominant Canadian mills. Indeed, Bowater has taken a loss of about $44 million to cover the sale of its money-losing mill in Newfoundland. But the new company will depend on a highly cyclical business, and analysts believe there is little hope for long-term growth for the overall market. **********Bowater Industries, as the new version of the British company will be called, may have more growth potential, especially given its freedom from the obligation to support North America's capital requirements.

Unemployment, the organization projected, would continue to climb beyond the current 8 percent, nearly double what it was in 1981. **********The diplomat, who asked not to be identified, explained: ''By increasing wages, the Government drove up unit production costs, while its exchange rate policy left the drachma overvalued too long. That cheapened imports for Greek consumers, but it also made Greek products less competitive. Meanwhile, loss of business confidence had the private investment rate dropping constantly. In 1983 it went down 9 percent, while public investment was up more than 13 percent.'' **********16 Takeovers Tallied **********The situation has been complicated by the dispute over the Government takeovers. By one tally, 16 companies have come under Government control in the past two years, including the big Scalastiri group, which makes products for the cement and metals industries; Piraiki-Patraki, Greece's biggest textile company, and Heracles General Cement, the largest cement company. **********Greece's problems arose, many here say, because Greek governments, after the fall of the military dictatorship in 1976, were saddled with the cost of installing modern social welfare programs at a time when the economy was struggling to adjust to the energy price shocks of the 1970's. **********Fulfilling a 1981 election campaign pledge, Mr. Papandreou approved a 50 percent pay increase and reduced working hours a year after he took office. To avoid unemployment and satisfy his party's militant left wing, critics say, he initiated the takeover policy. **********But when Europe's economies went into recession, it was evident that Greek companies, with their high labor costs and expensive fringe benefits, could no longer compete.

Some Punjabi Sikhs said they would wear black turbans and armbands as part of the protest. **********Under the army clampdown on Punjab that began two weeks ago, demonstrations are banned, as are assemblies of four or more people and the carrying of arms in public. The authorities in Punjab have been instructed to enforce the bans strictly, officials said.   Civil Servants Suspected **********In another development, official sources said the Government was considering changing civil service rules to allow state civil servants to be transferred from one state to another.  The reason for the proposed change was said to be evidence that a number of civil servants in Punjab had conspired with criminals and terrorists and helped undermine the state administration and erode public confidence in the government. No details of the precise nature of the alleged collusion were supplied. **********In addition, the Government was said to be concerned about widespread demoralization among other Punjabi civil servants because of the climate of fear in the state. **********According to the official army count, 492 terrorists and 84 soldiers died in the battle for the temple, and 1,517 suspected terrorists were captured there. **********Since then the army has been trying to hunt down remaining terrorists who were elsewhere in Punjab when the temple was raided. Some army reports estimate that 3,000 to 5,000 may remain."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/02/business/article-105150-no-title.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 584, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Article 105150 -- No Title", "print_headline": "Article 105150 -- No Title", "body_text": " **********Three Ohio utilities, which last January halted construction of the Zimmer nuclear power plant and announced plans to convert it to coal use, said today that they would complete the conversion at a total cost of $3.4 billion. **********The top executives of the three owners of the Zimmer plant told a news conference that the converted plant should be operating in 1991 with a 1,300-megawatt coal-fired generating unit. That is a 62 1/2 percent increase in generating capacity from the 800- megawatt capacity the Zimmer nuclear reactor would have had, the utility executives said. **********The Zimmer plant is situated on the Ohio River at Moscow, Ohio, about 25 miles southeast of Cincinnati. **********About 45 percent of the $1.7 billion spent on the incomplete Zimmer nuclear plant went for equipment that can be used in the converted coal- fired plant, said William H. Dickhoner, president of the Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company, Zimmer's builder and majority owner. **********Nuclear Part Now Unusable **********The conversion will cost the utilities another $1.7 billion, the executives said. **********Zimmer's nuclear portion - including the single reactor, its steam supply system and the building that houses the reactor - cannot be used in the converted facility, they said. **********After the news conference, executives of the three utilities - C.G.&E., the Dayton Power and Light Company and the Columbus and Southern Ohio Electric Company - flew to New York City to give financial analysts details of their plan. **********Bruce Stoecklin, a spokesman for Cincinnati Gas and Electric, said the utilities had not decided exactly how to raise the money for the conversion. W. S. White Jr., chairman of Columbus and Southern Ohio and its corporate parent, the American Electric Power Company, said it would take two and a half years to obtain all the required environmental permits for the coal plant. Most of the conversion spending will not begin until mid- 1987, he said. **********Paying for Converted Unit **********Asked whether he expects the utilities' customers to pay for the new unit, Mr. Dickhoner said, ''We see no reason why this should not go into the rate base.'' He said he would expect rate payers to foot the bill if a completely new coal-fired plant were built. **********The utilities said the converted plant would have a design similar to those of four 1,300-megawatt coal- fired units operated in Ohio and West Virginia by American Electric Power. **********Mr. White said it would take nine years and would cost $3.1 billion if the utilities were to construct a comparable coal-fired plant from scratch. **********A consultant's study done for the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, in an effort to determine whether the utilities mismanaged the Zimmer nuclear project, has concluded that $1.3 billion of the nuclear project's cost went for equipment and construction unsuitable for the conversion to coal.  After today's announcement, Brewster Rhoads of the Ohio Public Interest Campaign, a citizens' lobbying group, attacked the utilities' decision. **********Doubts on Cost Expressed **********''This may be the most expensive coal plant in the world,'' Mr. Rhoads said. ''We have some severe doubts about the wisdom of completing Zimmer as a Cadillac coal plant rather than building from scratch.'' **********The three utilities jointly announced on Jan. 21 that they were immediately halting construction of the Zimmer nuclear plant. They cited its escalating cost and long, expensive delays in obtaining Federal approval for a license to operate a nuclear plant."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/07/business/executive-changes-166150.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-09-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 190, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " ***********  Acceleration Corp., Dublin, Ohio, whose principal business is insurance, has elected Louis E.

Until the last six or eight months, their use of their weapons against Arabs, especially after stone-throwing incidents, was rarely punished. **********Some militant settlers have also acted as vigilantes, seizing Arab youths, taking them to settlements, imprisoning and interrogating them, and sometimes beating them before turning them over to the police or the army. **********Although these actions were never legal, the authorities did not prosecute in such cases, tending to regard the settlers as adjuncts to the security system. The Cabinet's statement seemed to reverse the tacit tolerance of such activity. **********''The obligation to obey the law and to maintain public order,'' it stated, ''falls on all the residents, without exception, and anyone disobeying the law can expect to be punished as provided by law.'' **********The declaration reaffirmed that the task of law enforcement fell to the army, with the assistance of the police, and stated, ''Anyone not a member of the bodies authorized to enforce the law and preserve public order is not permitted to take upon himself the task of a policeman or soldier; any action taken by him in punishment or retaliation for a violation of law and order is an offense, and he can expect the punishment provided by law.'' **********However, the statement went on to authorize ''legal acts taken in self-defense'' and said that instructions on bearing arms and opening fire would be issued by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Defense Minister Moshe Arens and Justice Minister Moshe Nissim.   Severe Prison Sentences **********The Cabinet also said that ''security forces will view with utmost gravity the throwing of stones or Molotov cocktails,'' and that ''the prosecution in courts-martial will demand severe prison sentences for those who disturb the peace.'' **********Settlers have complained that Arab youths who throw stones at cars and buses of Jews have been given lenient treatment. The Cabinet's statement, while an apparent effort, for political reasons, to respond to the settlers' concerns, also seemed to herald a stricter approach to such actions. **********A Cabinet official explained that the statement was issued to provide a balanced context in which a report expected to be made public soon by the Justice Ministry could be seen. The report, by Assistant Attorney General Judith Karp, is said to give details of the failure to investigate and prosecute Jewish settlers who committed crimes against West Bank Arabs. **********The report has been kept secret by the Justice Ministry for more than a year, and is scheduled to be delivered to a parliamentary committee this week. After waiting more than a year for some results from her study, Mrs. Karp resigned last spring as head of a committee that had been set up to review police inaction. She was said to have been frustrated that no steps had been taken to curb the settlers' vigilantism.   Recent Wave of Attacks **********A new sense of urgency surrounds the issue in the wake of repeated terrorist attacks and violence directed at Arabs. Last July, after a Jewish settler was stabbed to death in the West Bank city of Hebron, three or four masked men ran into the Islamic College, threw a hand grenade and fired their guns, killing 3 Arabs and wounding 33. Nobody has been arrested. **********Since early December, a total of 13 hand grenades have been planted at mosques, churches and Arabs' homes, and ten days ago an attempt to plant explosives at the holiest Moslem shrines in Jerusalem - the Dome of the Rock and Al Aksa Mosque - was foiled by Arab guards. **********Defense Minister Arens has advocated a $15 million increase in funds to pay for the deployment of policemen on the West Bank, and the Cabinet statement said that ''the defense establishment and the Israel police will act to reinforce their deployment and strengthen their forces in these areas.'' But with the Government's budget being cut severely, there is no certainty that this provision can be implemented."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/31/business/regulator-issues-warning-on-thrift-unit-growth.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Bennett", "pub_date": "1984-10-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 524, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Regulator Issues Warning on Thrift Unit Growth", "print_headline": "Regulator Issues Warning on Thrift Unit Growth", "body_text": " **********Edwin J. Gray, the chief Federal regulator of savings and loan associations, told the industry today that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board would act to stop the rapid growth of many thrift institutions. **********Such growth, Mr. Gray has said, often threatens the soundness of the institutions because it is accomplished by bidding aggressively for deposits and by making high-risk loans. He said that the bank board, among other things, was considering adopting a net worth standard for all federally insured thrift institutions. **********Mr. Gray reminded industry leaders that when associations take risks, there is also a threat to the resources of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, the bank board's insurance arm. **********Underwriting the Growth **********''Is it not fair to ask how we can expect the F.S.L.I.C. to underwrite for risk the incredible growth spiral we are seeing in the industry as a whole?'' he said. **********Mr. Gray, who is himself a former thrift institution executive at the Great American Federal Savings and Loan Association in San Diego, spoke to the annual convention of the United States League of Savings Institutions. **********He criticized states that have given state-chartered savings and loan associations investment and loan powers far broader than those accorded federally chartered associations. Most of these state institutions are federally insured. **********The bank board chairman challenged those states - mainly in the Sun Belt - to insure their own institutions, but he predicted that they would not do it. **********''I can understand why they would feel far more comfortable relegating that expensive chore to the F.S.L.I.C.,'' he said. **********Net-Worth Standard **********In his speech, Mr. Gray said the board was considering linking asset growth to increases in a thrift institution's net worth. But in an interview later, Mr. Gray acknowledged that the board had not decided on what the net-worth requirements should be. **********Net worth is the difference between assets and liabilities. It thus provides a cushion between any losses on loans and depositors' funds. **********Because the F.S.L.I.C. insures deposits in the thrifts, it would bear the burden of any losses beyond an association's net worth. The greater the net worth, the less likely it is that an association with bad loans will fail and turn to the F.S.L.I.C. **********However, increasing an institution's net worth is worrisome to many savings and loan executives because it can be costly. One way to increase net worth is to retain profits, which usually means lowering dividends for shareholders - if the organization is stock-owned and not mutual. **********Many Report Losses **********Many institutions, however, are not earning a profit. About a quarter of the nation's 3,500 savings and loans, in fact, have been losing money. **********At their annual convention in New York last week, commercial bankers complained that they have been under pressure from banking regulators to increase their net worths, or capital accounts, while there are no such constraints on thrift institutions. **********After his speech, Mr. Gray was asked whether his call for greater net worth among thrift institutions was being done in coordination with bank regulators.

But they stressed that there is a real prospect that pilot projects could be started by January with the $28 million already raised.   Warsaw Sees End of Sanctions **********The disclosure of the emerging agreement came as Warsaw officials expressed hope in private that the amnesty for political prisoners, announced last weekend, would earn Poland political benefits at home and abroad. Government spokesmen predict only a token initial response by the United States, involving relaxation of some economic sanctions. But they look forward to slowly improving relations. **********The first steps by the United States are expected to include lifting of the ban on Polish airline flights to the United States.

They work hard - usually with horses rather than tractors - but are well paid for their crops and animals. But they lack adequate money for modern machinery and other equipment to make farming more efficient.

McGuire. As commissioner, he oversaw thousands of employees, tried to manage a succession of life-and- death crises, and did what he could to satisfy often antagonistic community groups. **********Today, as chairman and chief executive officer of Pinkerton's Inc., the largest and oldest security company in the world, he still oversees thousands of employees, but there the similarity ends. His empire extends to dozens of offices around the world now, and he spends most of his time planning corporate acquisitions and marketing strategy. **********Also, he has relaxed a bit. **********''Now I have a chief operating officer who looks after day-to-day operations,'' the 47-year-old Mr. McGuire said the other day during an interview at Pinkerton's headquarters in lower Manhattan, high above the Hudson River. ''And I have a different kind of pressure - bottom-line responsibility.'' **********How has the owlish-looking, soft- spoken executive fared since he took on his corporate role last January? **********A Natural Fit **********Analysts say he is a natural fit: an expert in his field, a well-known figure with many industry contacts. **********''It's good to have him around,'' said Stanley H. Fishman, an analyst with Fahnestock & Company. ''What do civilians know about crime?'' **********According to his new colleagues, the components of Mr. McGuire's managerial style remain unchanged: flexibility, moderation of tone, an easy articulateness far removed from the tough-cop stereotype. **********Mr. McGuire seems to be putting some distance between his old life and his new one. He no longer socializes with his former colleagues at police functions, to avoid any impression that he is looking over the shoulder of the new commissioner. **********And Mr. McGuire has been turning down most of the job applications that Pinkerton's, like other security concerns, receives in great numbers from police officers about to retire. **********''I'm not looking for just a law enforcement background,'' he said. ''They've got to be good businessmen as well.'' **********But he did hire away two officials who served under him when he was commissioner - Robert F. Littlejohn, a former inspector who heads Pinkerton's investigations division, and Edmond Baccaglini, a former deputy inspector, who is now Mr. Littlejohn's assistant. **********As for Mr. McGuire's ''bottom- line'' performance, it is no doubt too early to judge. But while Pinkerton's has not disclosed the details of its finances since it was acquired in January 1983 by American Brands Inc., the big tobacco concern, the company's outlook does appear to have brightened, analysts say, since Mr. McGuire took charge. **********Flat Revenues Last Year **********According to Diana K. Temple, a vice president at Salomon Brothers, Pinkerton's revenues were flat and its profit declined last year, as has been the pattern over the last few years. But she and other analysts predicted that the company will see an improvement in 1984. **********''Recessionary cutbacks and added costs from increased computerization hurt Pinkerton's earnings in the first year after its acquisition, which was disappointing,'' Miss Temple said. ''But things are looking better. I expect an increase in earnings in 1984 of about 13 percent.'' **********Through the first nine months of 1982, the last time Pinkerton's results were publicized, the company reported earnings of $8.49 million, or $6.06 a share, on revenues of $220 million. In 1981, it posted earnings of $13 million, or $6.06 a share, on revenues of $293 million. According to American Brands, the unit saw sales in 1983 of $462.4 million and operating income of $43.8 million. **********Mr. McGuire declined to make projections, but he believes Pinkerton's must diversify to fulfill its potential. And, he said, the company's financial upturn can be attributed to recent steps in that direction. **********''The competition is intense,'' Mr. McGuire said. ''People have adapted to terribly high levels of crime, and this, combined with reduced municipal budgets which see cutbacks in law enforcement, has made private security a popular business. To best compete, we've got to position ourselves as a full-service company.'' **********'A Mature Industry' **********Harry Delf, a senior analyst with Herzfeld & Stern, said that public demand is indeed up - the number of hours being charged to corporations by security concerns is heading higher, with billings probably hitting $20 billion this year - but ''profitability is drying up'' as companies keep cutting their rates to get a piece of the action. ''It's becoming a mature industry,'' he said. **********Some industry experts said Pinkerton's is No. 1 in the field, while others said it may have recently been edged out by Burns International Security Services Inc., based in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and Wells Fargo Guard Services, Parsippany, N.J., which are both owned by the Borg-Warner Corporation of Chicago. It is difficult to gauge their precise rankings, since all three are owned by conglomerates that do not break out their earnings. **********At any rate, the leading companies are running neck and neck. And there are all kinds of smaller competitors crowding the field - everything from regional concerns to former police officers working out of their homes. **********In New York State alone, some 200 companies are licensed to provide guards. According to a recent Justice Department study of the industry, more than one million private guards are employed in the United States, compared with 580,000 local and Federal law enforcement officers. **********What's more, electronic surveillance and alarm systems are also eating into the business. **********Investigative Unit Stressed **********One of Mr. McGuire's first prescriptions has been to beef up Pinkerton's investigative division. Although the company made its reputation on its detective services - its first agents tracked down outlaws in the Wild West and set up the first Federal intelligence organization for President Lincoln - it shifted its emphasis about 10 years ago to concentrate on the security guard business, a bigger money maker at that time. **********About 90 percent of the company's revenues currently come from providing security guards, but since the competition has heated up, Mr. McGuire has decided it is time to change again. That is why he has brought in Mr. Littlejohn and Mr. Baccaglini. **********Mr. Littlejohn, who has long experience in narcotics, terrorist and organized crime investigations, developed the training curriculum for the New York City Detective Bureau.

There is one enduring dispute in Europe, though, that rarely appears on the American scene: the battle over the proper balance between public and private ownership of industry. **********Thanks to Europe's economic problems in the last decade, that debate has heated up again in most European nations. The recession and the industrial restructuring generated by it have led to state takeovers of numerous companies to prevent the job losses that would come with bankruptcy. At the same time, the economic troubles have persuaded millions of European voters that there are limits to how many social services they can afford to support. The result has been that politicians promising to limit Government spending have steadily gained power. **********Usually, they are conservatives for whom selling state-owned businesses to the private sector has both financial and ideological attractions. But, as seen in the recent sale of Sweden's state-owned television manufacturer, Luxor, to Nokia of Finland, even Socialists can find the financial allure of such deals irresistible. **********Outside of Britain, the actual sale of state assets is still a rare event. The West German Government's sale this week of almost 14 percent of the equity of the energy company Veba for $284 million, reducing its stake to 30 percent, was its first transfer since 1961. But economists from one end of Europe to the other are seriously proposing the sale to private interests of numerous industrial concerns, airlines, and even railroads. And politicians seem to be listening. **********The discussion is particularly active in Britain, the intellectual and practical leader of the trend. Under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Government, Britain has already sold all, or a substantial portion of, its stake in 12 ventures, ranging from hotels to oilfields - and many more sales are planned. **********''No state monopoly is sacrosanct,'' John Moore, the Treasury Secretary, told a City of London conference in November. **********It is a minor sign of the times, perhaps, that ''denationalization'' has been replaced by the more positive ''privatization'' as the preferred word to describe the trend. Neither term is very precise. **********Privatization does not mean that the Government gives up all influence in a company. For instance, when Britain collected most of its North Sea exploration and production interests in a new company called Britoil P.L.C. and sold 51 percent of it to private investors for (at current exchange rates) $767 million, it retained special voting rights to block a takeover by foreign investors. **********Nor does privatizing a company always relieve the Government of financial demands from it. Britain reduced its holding in British Aerospace P.L.C. from 100 percent to 48.4 percent three years ago. Nevertheless, a company request for about $612 million in Government aid may be crucial to its future as a participant in the 150-seat A320 to be built by Airbus Industrie, the German, French, and British consortium - and perhaps to the future of the plane itself. British Aerospace says it could not afford the debt burden that would result from borrowing development money in the private sector. **********The continuing Government role is clearer still in the case of British Telecom, which is expected to bring in almost $6 billion when a 51 percent stake is sold next fall. Telecom will be regulated by a newly created Office of Telecommunications, and the Government will allow only one competitor in the field of basic telephone services. **********The Government's favorite argument for privatization is that it encourages competition, which in turn reduces costs and improves services to consumers. The 10 percent of British industry that is nationalized is typically depicted as bloated and complacent. **********Critics respond that nationalized companies such as British Steel and British Shipyards would be in trouble whether or not they were publicly owned, as are many of their private counterparts in the industrial world. Moreover, they argue, the Telecom plan demonstrates that the Government is quite willing to convert a public monopoly into a private one, if that is what it takes to guarantee a high sale price. These critics thus conclude that privatization is merely a way to raise money to cover the shortcomings of the Government's policies. **********Whatever the rationale, the mechanics of privatization have forced Britain to devote a great deal of attention to the actual structure of its basic industries. Telecom's management and accounting systems were laughable by commercial standards, until planning to sell it began. The debate has also focused attention on the depth and nature of capital markets here, since the Government cannot sell companies faster than investors can come up with enough money to pay reasonable prices for them. **********Capital market problems are cited as a factor discouraging privatization in other European countries, where equity investments are less popular. In Germany, for instance, analysts fear that privatization of companies, such as the airline, Lufthansa, would require selling much of the equity to foreign investors."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/13/world/bush-in-india-assails-soviet-over-the-war-in-afghanistan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 162, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bush, in India, Assails Soviet Over the War in Afghanistan", "print_headline": "Bush, in India, Assails Soviet Over the War in Afghanistan", "body_text": " **********Vice President Bush arrived here today for a three-day visit and said the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan had upset the military balance in the region and created the world's biggest refugee problem. **********''In our view, the most destabilizing factor to emerge in the region in recent years has been the brutal Soviet invasion and continuing war against Afghanistan,'' Mr. Bush said at a banquet in his honor at the presidential palace. **********The presence of more than 100,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan, he said, ''has fundamentally altered the strategic balance in the region and created the world's largest refugee population'' - 3.5 million people, many of them in Pakistan. **********Mr. Bush said he looked forward to discussing the Afghanistan issue and other foreign policy differences with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who attended the banquet. **********India has refrained from publicly condemning the Soviet policy in Afghanistan and has recognized the Soviet-backed Government in Kabul."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/18/world/man-in-the-news-at-37-captain-of-france-laurent-fabius.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1984-07-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 788, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AT 37, CAPTAIN OF FRANCE: LAURENT FABIUS", "print_headline": "MAN IN THE NEWS; AT 37, CAPTAIN OF FRANCE: LAURENT FABIUS", "body_text": " **********Laurent Fabius, appointed Prime Minister tonight, personifies the new, hard-headed, pragmatic brand of Socialism on which President Francois Mitterrand is now trying to rebuild his party's battered political fortunes.  At age 37, Mr. Fabius is the youngest Prime Minister in modern French history. But despite his youth he is a close confidant of the President as well as a proven, battle- scared political ally. **********Moreover, as Minister of the Budget and more recently as Industry Minister, Mr. Fabius helped mastermind the ideological about-face that France's Socialists are now engaged in under President Mitterrand's leadership as they jettison their leftist policies and opt for more cautious, conservative policies instead. **********Mr. Mitterrand once said of him: ''This man has talent. Other men have talents.''  Son of Antique Dealer **********Like Mr. Mitterrand himself, Laurent Fabius - the name is pronounced lo-RANH fahb-UCE - represents the middle-class, intellectual tradition that has always played a powerful role in the French Socialist movement. The son of a prominent antique dealer, he was born into a comfortable upper-middle- class family in Paris on Aug. 20, 1946. **********A brilliant student, he graduated from some of France's most prestigious schools, including the Lycee Janson-de-Sailly in Paris, the Ecole Normale Superieure and the Ecole Nationale d'Administration. **********After entering an elite branch of the French civil service, Mr. Fabius was drawn into Socialist politics by Georges Dayan, a close personal friend of Mr. Mitterrand. In 1974, Mr. Fabius joined the Socialist Party, quickly becoming Mr. Mitterrand's economic adviser and then his chief of staff. In 1978 he was elected to the French Parliament. **********A year later Mr. Fabius was appointed Socialist Party spokesman and in 1981 he assured his political future by managing Mr. Mitterrand's successful election campaign for the presidency of France. **********He married Francoise Casho the same year. They have one son, Thomas. **********As Minister of State for the Budget in Mr. Mitterrand's first Government, Mr. Fabius was theoretically in the No. 2 spot in the Finance Ministry, serving under Jacques Delors, a nonpolitical civil servant appointed Finance Minister. But he quickly established his independence, and his left-wing credentials, as the architect of France's new tax on wealth.   A War Against Smuggling **********Mr. Fabius fought for the highest tax rate against Mr. Delors's pleas for moderation. He also demanded that the tax be paid on works of art until Mr. Mitterrand overruled him, fearful that this would result in privately owned works being sold abroad to foreigners. **********Mr. Fabius then began an all-out war against currency smuggling. He helped bring about the prosecution of Pierre Moussa, a prominent banker, on charges of spiriting money out of the country, although Mr. Moussa was subsequently acquitted. And under Mr. Fabius's direction, French customs agents scored a notable coup when they obtained the details of some 5,000 secret Swiss bank accounts belonging to French citizens. **********But Mr. Fabius's attitude began to change as the Socialists expansionary economic policy, designed to blast France out of recession, led to soaring inflation and a plummeting franc. Instead of being ''the scourge of the rich,'' as the press frequently called him, Mr. Fabius joined forces with Mr. Delors to push through an austerity program that sent unemployment soaring. **********Later in 1983, when the Socialists' new economic policy led Jean-Pierre Chev enement, a leading left winger, to resign as Industry Minister, Mr. Fabius was chosen to succeed him.   Support for Private Sector **********Immediately, this ministry too took on a new coloration. Instead of pushing plans for more state intervention and new nationalizations, Mr. Fabius began to preach the virtues of private enterprise, free competition, low taxes, profits and hard work. **********''The private sector,'' he said, ''is predominant in France and it is going to stay that way.'' **********Under his direction, the Socialists started cutting back on subsidies to loss-making industries, announcing plans to end tens of thousands of jobs in steel, shipbuilding and the coal mines. The unions, the Socialist Party's left wing and the Communists howled their protest. The Government's popularity fell drastically in the polls. But Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Fabius stood firm. **********By appointing Mr. Fabius Prime Minister now, President Mitterrand has made it clear that he intends to continue his painful drive to restore the French economy to health and give the country a flourishing, competitive private industrial sector. **********All the same, despite the conservative flavor of his policies, Mr. Fabius has not forgotten his Socialist beliefs entirely. In his official biography, he does not mention his favorite hobby, which is the distinctly un-Socialist one of show-jumping."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/03/business/technology-the-advances-in-auto-plants.html": {"writer_name": "Marshall Shuon", "pub_date": "1984-05-03", "snippet": "TECHNOLOGICALLY speaking, the automobile has ridden both the crown of the road and\n\n the shoulder.

It has been high-tech and low- tech, but what it has been, mostly, is middle-tech, wallowing along as a conventional product - until the need for greater fuel economy prompted new materials and new ideas. **********Given that impetus, today's automobile is in some ways what it was in its infancy, a device on the forward edge of innovation. It is a sophisticated collection of parts, of electronics, of onboard computers and intricate engine controls, and it is among the more complex items available to the consumer. **********Mass-producing it, of course, is the real trick, and enormous amounts of money have been spent to infuse the product with the best quality, while keeping the cost competitive. To that end, Detroit has followed the Japanese lead in automation and inventory control, and in soliciting ideas and mutually beneficial assistance from the labor force. **********Cars now are built here in much the same way as they are in Japan, but one facet of manufacture shows that you still have to be up very early to beat the Japanese: They already have computerized plants that can run at night without any work force on the factory floor at all. **********The first such factory to go into operation was the internal combustion facility of the Niigata Engineering Company, according to an Ohio executive who recently spoke on the subject at a London conference on world trends and prospects in manufacturing technology. **********The executive, M. Eugene Merchant, who is director of advanced manufacturing research at Metcut Research Associates, a metals-testing company in Cincinnati, told delegates that the Japanese company's system has been running for 21 hours a day, machining cylinder heads for diesel engines. The number of workers has been reduced to 4, from 31, he said, and the number of machines required to make the parts was cut to 6, from 31. **********Another Japanese company, Fanuc Ltd., has also begun almost wholly unmanned night operations in its production of robots and other tools. According to Mr. Merchant, the unattended system includes 22 machining centers served by robots that load and unload the parts from pallets. **********''During the day, there are 19 workers on the machining floor,'' Mr. Merchant said. ''At night, there is no one on the floor and only one person in the control room.'' In any 24-hour period, he added, the availability of the machines is nearly 100 percent, and utilization rates average 65 to 70 percent. Productivity has increased dramatically, and the factory now turns out 100 more robots, 75 more machining centers and 75 more wire-cut machines per month than it did before the new technology. **********In Michigan, meanwhile, the General Motors Corporation is moving ahead with plans for its own ''factory of the future,'' a completely automated and computer-based plant. **********Dan Stainforth, manager of the $52 million project for G.M.'s Saginaw Steering Gear division, said the factory would assemble front-wheel-drive axles, beginning with a pilot facility in the autumn of 1985. The plant, adjacent to the division's headquarters in Saginaw, Mich., will reach full computerization and production two years later. **********''We think we have a competitive problem in the world market,'' Mr. Stainforth said, ''so the driving force here is a need to be competitive. And the thing that really makes this the factory of the future is the tying together of various elements of the factory through computer integration.'' **********As with the Japanese plants, he said, the factory will have the capability of running almost unmanned - although no one will lose a job as a result. ''There will be no labor to load and unload machinery or move material,'' Mr. Stainforth said, ''but there will be people necessary to monitor the activity and to program it and to maintain it.'' **********The plant is a joint venture of Saginaw and G.M.'s Advanced Product and Manufacturing Services staff, and it has been under way since late 1982. ''We are now at the point of having much of the equipment out for bid,'' Mr. Stainforth said, ''and in the next two or three months we will be making some of the significant purchases, while laying plans for training of the people who will be involved.'' **********As conceived, Mr. Stainforth said, the project will adapt an existing product line as a learning laboratory. ''The output will be in addition to our current output,'' he said, ''so we see it as being part of our plan to preserve our place in the market and to preserve our employment.'' **********Early on, he said, G.M. invited the union local to participate in the project, and hourly workers have assisted with the planning. The company sees the approach as a path to significant improvement in quality and in the use of capital investment, plus a quicker response to changes in the market. **********''I think there is a broad application for this,'' Mr. Stainforth said, ''and not only across the corporation and in the automotive industry. There are wide applications for computer-coordinating, for the use of technology to handle repetitive jobs and to take over those jobs that are in less than ideal environmental areas.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/27/business/washington-watch-fed-search-nearly-over.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-02-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1302, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Washington Watch; Fed Search Nearly Over", "print_headline": "Washington Watch; Fed Search Nearly Over", "body_text": " **********WASHINGTON   T HE White House, which is running late in its **********search for a woman to succeed Nancy Teeters as one of the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board, is only a week or two away from sending a nomination to the Senate, according to insiders. The term of Mrs. Teeters expired Jan. 31, but she is continuing to serve until a successor is confirmed. **********The front runner, according to some accounts, is Susan Schmitt Bies, 36 years old, an economist who is the treasurer of the Tennessee National Corporation in Memphis, which owns the First Tennessee Bank. **********Senate Republicans, however, report that some White House officials are backing Annelise Anderson, 45, a strongly ideological conservative who served in the Office of Management and Budget in 1981-83. Her husband, Martin Anderson, served in the Reagan White House and has been actively promoting his wife's candidacy at the White House - which he visited only last Thursday - and among Senate Republicans, whose votes would be needed to confirm the nomination. **********Mrs. Anderson, according to White House officials, has the support of the Treasury and the budget office. But there is a technical problem. She cannot be said to come from any of the six Federal Reserve districts not already represented on the board - and no two governors may be selected from the same district. Jake Garn, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, is unwilling to let this requirement be bent, as was done in the nomination of Lyle Gramley by President Carter, and so Mrs. Anderson may be ineligible. **********That, anyway, is why White House aides say Mrs. Anderson may not be nominated. A more important reason may be she is unacceptable to Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve. By law, the Fed chairman has no voice in the selection of other governors, but it is customary for Presidents to respect the chairman's feelings when he is strongly opposed to a candidate. **********Mrs. Bies, on the other hand, has been to see Mr. Volcker and he has no objection to her. Earlier, the White House sent to Mr. Volcker the resumes of other women being considered. **********From her home in Portola Valley, Calif., Mrs. Anderson said yesterday by telephone that she would like to serve on the Fed and had no reason to believe Mr. Volcker opposed her. She said she grew up in Illinois and so she could be selected from the Chicago Federal Reserve district, as was Mrs. Teeters ''even though she spent most of her working life in Washington.'' But Senator Garn, Mrs. Anderson said, now insists that a nominee be selected from the district in which the nominee is currently living. **********Martin Anderson, confirming that he has been lobbying for his wife at the White House and the Senate, said the idea of putting her on the Fed originated with Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan. ''Don Regan called Annelise,'' he said. ''That was the first I ever heard of it.'' **********Mrs. Bies is described by an Administration economist as ''a semi-monetarist.'' That may explain why she is acceptable to the White House staff, which has monetarist leanings, and to Mr. Volcker, who has blended monetarism - putting primary emphasis on growth of the money supply - with a more conventional, pragmatic attention to interest rates and the near-term outlook. **********Not a great deal is known here about Mrs. Bies, a native of Buffalo who holds a doctorate in economics from Northwestern University. While still writing her dissertation in 1970-72, she worked at the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, a bastion of monetarism. But her specialty was banking structure and mergers, not monetary policy. **********Another woman interviewed at the White House was Sydney Hicks, a Dallas banking executive, and she may still be in the running. But one usually informed official says, ''I haven't heard her name in six weeks.'' **********Japan Fears Import Surcharge **********Japanese lobbyists are increasingly worried about an obscure provision of the Trade Act of 1974 that gives the President authority to impose an import surcharge of up to 15 percent to deal with ''large and persistent'' American balance-of-payments deficits. **********The law gives the President power to raise tariffs across the board or to design the tariff increases so as to hit such countries as Japan, which is running a $20 billion-a-year trade surplus with the United States. **********The President may decline to act, however, if he finds that a surcharge would not be in the national interest. **********All of the options will be examined when the Senate Finance Committee holds hearings on the issue in March. **********The law empowers the President to act unilaterally, but it is considered unlikely, should he seek to use the authority, that he would move without consulting Congress. **********Administration trade officials said there are as yet no plans to invoke the surcharge provision, but trade analysts noted that in the volatile election- year climate a lot of unpredictable things could happen. **********Tailored to Japan, a 15 percent surcharge would amount to a forced upward revaluation of the yen and would also yield substantial customs revenues for the Treasury. **********Natural Gas Legislation **********Last winter, when the weather was warm, members of Congress heard lots of complaints about rising natural gas bills. This year, oddly enough, there have been relatively few complaints even though heating bills continue to rise. Consumers perhaps figure they should expect to pay more because of colder weather - 2 percent colder than normal and 11 percent colder than last winter, according to the Commerce Department. **********This relative calm, say some of the 12 Senators who met without staff and behind closed doors Friday to discuss prospects for natural gas legislation, provides an opportunity finally to get something passed before ''new'' gas discovered after April 1977 is decontrolled under current law next January. The consensus of the group was that the effort should be made and that this week be devoted to constructing a bill. **********It would undoubtedly be less ambitious than either the Administration's proposal for total decontrol or a price rollback bill supported by consumer groups. Both of those measures were voted down in the final days of the last session. **********But the new bill could still be significant. The present thinking, according to a Senate Energy Committee aide, is that it would include relief for pipelines with so-called take-or-pay contracts, a ''prudency'' test for pipeline purchases of gas, a cap on contract price escalators that otherwise would take effect Jan. 1 and a provision requiring pipelines to use spare capacity to carry other people's gas. According to the aide, the bill would also repeal present laws that restrict gas usage, that give the President the right to extend controls and that require industrial users to pay higher prices than householders. **********An aide to a Democrat on the committee, however, said ''the smart money still has to be on no bill'' this year, assigning odds of perhaps 3-1. **********Mondale Team Forming **********It is still early, but Democrats in Washington's economics establishment have begun choosing sides. Many of the biggest guns appear to be tipping toward Walter Mondale. **********About once a month, the former Vice President meets with 8 or 10 economic advisers. Insiders say the regulars include a covey of Carter-era officials - Stuart E. Eizenstat, President Carter's domestic policy adviser and now a Washington lawyer; C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, who was at the Treasury; George L. Perry of the Brookings Institution; W. Bowman Cutter of Mr. Carter's Office of Management and Budget and now with the Washington office of Coopers & Lybrand; Van Doorn Ooms, chief economist of the House Budget Committee, and Alan W. Wolff, a lawyer who was deputy special trade representative. **********Two other prominent Carter-era figures, however, Charles L. Schultze and Barry P. Bosworth, have so far remained on the sidelines."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/27/world/dublin-protest-over-reagan-visit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-05-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 276, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DUBLIN PROTEST OVER REAGAN VISIT", "print_headline": "DUBLIN PROTEST OVER REAGAN VISIT", "body_text": " **********About 1,000 demonstrators led by a group of nuns chanted anti-American slogans and marched in Dublin today to protest President Reagan's visit to Ireland next weekend, the police said. **********The police reported no arrests. **********The downtown march was led by nuns from the Dublin-based Sisters for Justice Convent.

Shultz for sweeping diplomatic changes in Latin America take effect. **********At least a dozen ambassadors, mostly political appointees, are scheduled to be replaced by Foreign Service officers, Administration officials said today. The move, coupled with the planned departure of key State Department personnel who are also political appointees, has stirred an angry response from conservatives in the White House and elsewhere in the Administration as well as Congress. **********''George Shultz has decided to step out to see how much control he has,'' a ranking Administration official said. ''It's really brutal. The President has no idea of the extent or depth of the changes.'' **********'A Big Turning Point' **********The official added that Mr. Shultz's personnel moves were ''a big turning point'' and ''a purge.'' **********Another ranking official, sympathetic to Mr. Shultz, said, ''Shultz has made a decision that he is going to run his department.'' **********''He's been saddled with a lot of the Haig people and a lot of people Haig was saddled with,'' the official added, referring to former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. ''I suppose there is a lot of resistance from people in the White House but I don't believe its going to be successful.'' **********Mr. Reagan is scheduled to meet Mr. Shultz on Friday in part to discuss the shifts and their impact on policy. **********Although the planned moves by Mr. Shultz involve personnel - at least a dozen ambassadors and three Assistant Secretaries - conservatives in the Administration and Congress view them as marking a turn in foreign policy, especially in Central America, because many of the departing officials are regarded as hard-liners who are being replaced by career diplomats. The scheduled departure of J. William Middendorf 2d, the delegate to the Organization of American States, has especially upset some conservatives. **********'A Policy Purge,' Kemp Says **********A senior Administration official said: ''The President has talked to many people on this. George Shultz has spent all day today on damage control.'' **********The official said that such Republican members of Congress as Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Representative Jack F. Kemp of New York were especially upset at the possible softening of policy as a result of the planned moves. **********''I've heard it called a personnel purge and I call it a policy purge,'' said Mr. Kemp, the ranking Republican on the foreign operations panel of the House Appropriations Committee. ''I view what's going on with serious concern and alarm and if these changes take place I think it'll jeopardize the Administration's aid program.'' **********Mr. Kemp said that his concern and that of other conservatives ''has been conveyed to the President.'' One key Administration official, upset about the personnel moves, said William J. Casey, the director of Central Intelligence, had voiced displeasure over them and had expressed concern about their impact on Central American policy. But aides said Mr. Casey had not voiced his concern directly to Mr. Reagan.   An Ideological Dispute **********Other Administration officials said that Edwin Meese 3d, counselor to the President, and Secretary of the Interior William P. Clark, a personal friend of Mr. Reagan and former national security adviser, had conveyed their worries to the President. **********On one level, the dispute involves the manner in which many of the political appointees are being removed from their current jobs. ''People were hearing in the corridors that they were being fired,'' an Administration official said. ''They requested meetings with the Secretary and they were steered away.'' **********On another level, however, the dispute is an ideological and political one, centering on the impact of the changes on policy in Central America. **********What especially concerns Administration conservatives is the move to replace the Ambassador to Honduras, John D. Negroponte, considered a hard-liner, with L. Craig Johnstone, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Central America. Mr. Johnstone, a career officer like Mr. Negroponte, is viewed, at least by some conservatives, as expressing views ''not very tough'' toward the Nicaraguan Government. **********Mr. Negroponte is moving to the relatively low-profile job of Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs.   Sharply Divided on Policy **********Over the last year the Administration has been sharply divided over Central American policy, with such figures as Mr. Casey seeking a change in policy that would withdraw diplomatic recognition from the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua and extend political recognition to Nicaraguan rebels supported by the Reagan Administration. Mr. Shultz has argued for pursuing diplomatic negotiations with the Sandinistas, particularly since Congress refuses to grant more aid to the rebels. **********''The entire pattern of the way this was done has stirred up concern,'' one Administration official said. ''A lot of the changes happen to be concentrated in the Latin American and Central American region and happen to affect many of those ambassadors that have taken a position in support of the President's policy. Hence the concern.'' **********Although another Administration official said the planned changes raised conservative concerns about an accommodation with the Sandinista Government - such as an agreement to halt supporting the rebels if the Nicaraguan Government agreed to ''stop exporting revolution'' - State Department and some Administration officials brush aside the notion of a shift in policy. **********''I think this has gotten out of hand,'' said a senior State Department official. ''I don't see any policy implications in this at all. With some people it's time for them to rotate to other jobs. Others are retiring or want to leave and with others it's a question of competence.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/19/business/finance-new-issues-a-dual-offering-by-mccrory-corp.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1984-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 181, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": ";  A Dual Offering By McCrory Corp.", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; ;  A Dual Offering By McCrory Corp.", "body_text": " **********The McCrory Corporation yesterday priced a two-part, $200 million offering of fixed-and floating-rate notes.

Over the last two days, Treasury issues have fallen about 1 1/2 points, and are more than 2 1/2 points below the peak prices set early last week. **********Amid falling bond prices, traders and investors are spending less time discussing the chances that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy and foster lower interest rates. Increasingly, they are concerned about the size of Treasury borrowings needed to finance Federal budget deficits. Those borrowings were readily absorbed during the summer and autumn, because the Federal Reserve was easing monetary policy, and promoting lower short-term interest rates. But without further Fed easing, they warned that long-term bond yields are unlikely to continue falling in the near future. **********''An hour and a half after the election, you read about the deficit rising to $205 million instead of falling,'' said the head trader at one major government securities dealer, referring to projections by the Office of Management and Budget that the recent slowdown in the economy will tend to increase Federal budget deficits. ''People have the idea that we are back to politics as usual.'' **********''The market's problem over the past week is the lack of resolution in Washington on dealing with the deficit,'' said Herbert Neil, an economist at Harris Trust and Savings Bank, Chicago. **********Despite the recent weakness, many analysts doubt that the recent move to lower prices will turn into a rout. **********Mr. Neil, for example, is one of many analysts who say that weakness in the economy and slow money supply growth will continue long enough to prompt another small step toward an easier monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. ''As more numbers pile up showing weakness in the economy, including a downward revision to the third-quarter G.N.P. data, I expect the Federal funds rate to fall to 9 percent by the end of this month,'' Mr. Neil said. **********Signal to Fed Policy **********A decline in the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market, if sustained, would be a signal of an easing in Fed policy. Yesterday, the overnight rate averaged about 9 1/2 percent, the same rate as has prevailed since Nov. 9. **********With weak investor demand for new issues, and unconfirmed reports of large sales of Treasury bonds by a major Japanese investor, the Treasury market did not respond favorably to the one-tenth of 1 percent decline in retail sales during October. Neither did the market benefit much when the Federal Reserve bought Treasury issues for its own account - a widely anticipated move that analysts said was technical and not a signal that the Fed is trying to make bank reserves more available. **********In advance of today's payment for the $17.5 billion of Treasury notes and bonds sold last week, Treasury dealers were reminded that the Government expects to raise another $25 billion of cash before year-end. Treasury officials announced late in the day plans to sell a record $9 billion of new two-year notes on Nov. 21. **********Among recently auctioned Treasury issues, the 11 percent notes due in 1987 were offered at 99 22/32, down about 1/8 point on the day, to yield 11.13 percent; the 11 5/8 percent notes due in 1994 were at 98 19/32, down about 5/8 point, to yield 11.86 percent, and the 11 3/4 percent bonds due in 2014 were about 99 14/32, down more than 3/4 point, to yield 11.82 percent. At last week's auctions, average yields for the three new issues due in 1987, 1994 and 2014 were 11.01 percent, 11.70 percent and 11.83 percent, respectively. **********Tax-Exempt Market **********In the tax-exempt market, a flood of new issues contributed to price declines of about 3/4 point for outstanding bonds and led underwriters to raise yields for various new issues offered this week. **********Suffolk County's offering of $136.8 million was revised by a Smith Barney group so that more of the bonds were insured by the Ambac Indemnity Corporation, and yields were raised as much as 1/8 percentage point for the insured bonds. The maximum yield for the issue is now 10 1/8 percent for long-term bonds. **********Underwriters led by Kidder, Peabody reduced the size of an industrial development bond offering on behalf of the Alabama Power Company to $100 million from $150 million, and offered the 30-year, A-3/BBBx rated bonds at par with a 10 7/8 percent coupon. Yields on a $99.9 million issue of Rhode Island Housing and Mortgage Finance were raised slightly with bonds due in 2000 now offered at 10 3/4 percent, up from 10 5/8 percent. **********Among other housing bonds, which have been in ample supply recently, yields were raised as much as a quarter percentage point for some bonds of the California Housing Finance Agency. A Merrill Lynch group raised yields for bonds due in 1990 to 1995, but left the bonds due in 2005 unchanged at 10 3/4 percent. **********The New Jersey Highway Authority's financing for the Garden State Parkway was also revised to raise yields slightly for some maturities.
