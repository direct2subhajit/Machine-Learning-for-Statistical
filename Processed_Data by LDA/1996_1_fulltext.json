''Get paid for owning a boat,'' the ads read, quite a temptation for anyone contemplating the purchase of a yacht. But like any offer that sounds too good to be true, these programs require careful scrutiny. **********Placing a yacht in charter has long been a way of offsetting the cost of ownership, especially with the rising prices of sailboats. By yacht, most charter programs mean a 30-  to 50-foot sailboat, typically with an inboard diesel motor. From major manufacturers like Beneteau S.A., Catalina Yachts or the Hunter Marine Corporation, such boats sell new for $75,000 to $375,000, up about 75 percent from 10 years ago. **********Charter programs maintain a fleet of sailboats owned by private individuals and chartered to qualified sailors by the day or week. It is a bit like owning a vacation home and renting it out to help pay the mortgage, but the charter programs do most of the work and keep part of the revenue. In some cases, the programs also pay for insurance, maintenance and dock fees, which can amount to a few thousand dollars a year, although the programs then take a larger slice of the charter income. **********Clearly, such plans can generate revenue for boat owners, but can they bring in enough money to match or exceed the cost of ownership? Can the programs turn a sailboat from an indulgence to an investment? The answers are maybe, and probably not. In many cases, the buyer's motivations and expectations are as important as the provisions of any program. **********''If one tries to analyze this for return on investment, you wouldn't analyze for very long,'' said Jean Larroux, vice president of yacht sales for the Moorings, one of the oldest and largest charter operators with more than 650 boats in service. ''There has to be some emotional involvement,'' he said. ''The revenue stream we provide is certainly real, but it's not that compelling.'' **********Some programs are multinational, with fleets across the Caribbean, the South Pacific and other exotic locales, while others are regional, in California, Florida and Texas. Although there are charter clubs in the Northeast and Midwest, short sailing seasons mean smaller revenues. **********Based in Clearwater, Fla., the Moorings has fleets in the Bahamas, the Caribbean, Mexico, Tahiti, Tonga, Fiji, Vanuatu, New Zealand, France, Turkey and Greece. All boats are sold new by the Moorings and are custom-configured by the manufacturer, Beneteau, for charter use. The Moorings pays owners 25 percent of charter revenues and picks up all other costs. **********Some programs promise a certain income, typically enough to cover mortgage payments. Others offer projections. The buyer of a new Moorings 382, the custom version of a Beneteau 380, a 38 1/2-foot boat, would pay $164,500. With 25 percent, or $41,125 down, and an interest rate of 8.75 percent, monthly payments come to $1,233. The Moorings estimates that the boat would generate $1,708 a month in charter revenue the first year, rising to $1,978 a month the fourth year, as charter rates increase. At the end of the four-year program, the owner would still owe $70,038 if all of the income were applied to the mortgage. **********In addition to the potential income, boat owners at the Moorings receive four to six weeks of owner's time, in which they can sail their own or other comparable boats, and pay a service charge of $350 a week. This allows them to sail in different parts of the world for far less than the usual $2,200 to $3,800 weekly charter cost of a boat like the 382, depending on the season. **********Although the Moorings does not account for depreciation, many charter programs do. Owners often reduce their income taxes by claiming depreciation on their boats. Tax advisers say such deductions are legitimate, but that the subject is one of great complexity and considerable litigation, so  owners should get professional advice. **********Boat owners say charter programs can be a good deal, but only for the right person: someone who could afford the boat without the charter income, which may fall well short of expectations; who can get four to six weeks of vacation a year, and who can afford to fly often. **********''You're not going to pay for the boat by chartering it out,'' said John Hakemian, a chief financial officer for a company in Manhattan, who has a boat in the Moorings fleet in the British Virgin Islands. ''The very best you can hope for is to pay off a significant fraction, one-third to one-half.'' **********''This is not an investment,'' he said. ''This is either a way to acquire a vessel at reduced cost, or more importantly, participate in a sailing program at reduced cost.'' **********JOHN WHITE, a Silicon Valley computer engineer, has had mixed results. He and his wife, Patti, have one boat in the British Virgin Islands with the Moorings and another on San Francisco Bay with Club Nautique in Alameda, Calif. Their Moorings 352, a $116,000 boat with about $850 a month in mortgage payments, has generated several thousand dollars a year in income. But their Calibre 40, which cost more than $200,000, has not earned enough revenue to pay the $1,550 monthly mortgage payment. **********''I couldn't have afforded a boat like this at all, to just put it in a marina and let it sit,'' Mr. White said. He expects the Calibre to break even next year and begin to generate income in 1998. ''I'm really going for positive cash flow with this thing,'' he said. **********Boats that are purchased from charter programs often cost more than a comparable boat bought from a dealer. Last week a dealer quoted the Beneteau 380 at $139,500, $25,000 less than the Moorings 382, the customized version of the 380. Charter companies are less willing to haggle than dealers, and typically load boats with special fittings and fixtures, which tend to have high profit margins and add little to resale value. **********So why not just buy the boat from a dealer? Because many charter programs only accept boats purchased from them. The Moorings and Club Nautique are two such programs. **********''We want the boats we want, and we want them the way we want them,'' said Don Durant, president of Club Nautique, which sells and charters boats made by Hunter. ''Our 30-footers go out 150 days a year. The reason we can do that is we standardize; we are a warranty station; we have spare parts. The typical off-the-shelf boat needs some modification for charter use.'' **********Used boats may make a better investment. Some clubs accept late-model used boats, and this is a way to increase the return on investment and reduce the cost of ownership. Because boats depreciate so rapidly, a typical 34-footer that sells new for $100,000 can be bought three years old for $50,000, yet both boats would command $300 a day in charter fees. **********''We recommend first, buy a good used boat,'' said Anthony Sandberg, president of OCSC, a charter club in Berkeley, Calif. ''Now there's some chance of making money.'' **********Hugh Devlin, a computer consultant in Chicago who bought a new 40-footer in the Moorings fleet almost four years ago, is still waiting to make money. **********''We haven't experienced any income in the Bahamas,'' Mr. Devlin said. ''Every year we've had to make up a difference between what the Moorings paid us and the mortgage. The only way I can view it as anything other than an insane act is to remember the great sailing time I've had.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/20/business/toro-to-acquire-irrigation-products-supplier.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-09-20", "snippet": "Toro Co will acquire James Hardie Irrigation Group, unit of James Hardie Industries Ltd of Australia, for $130 million (S)", "word_count": 102, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TORO TO ACQUIRE IRRIGATION PRODUCTS SUPPLIER", "print_headline": "TORO TO ACQUIRE IRRIGATION PRODUCTS SUPPLIER", "body_text": " **********The Toro Company, the lawn-care products concern, said yesterday that it would acquire James Hardie Irrigation Group, a unit of James Hardie Industries Ltd. of Australia, for $130 million.

Vasiliev was a student of Marxist economics, he was taught that the stock market was a casino for the super-rich. **********\"They stressed it served a narrow circle and was not in the interests of the  broad masses of people,\" Mr. Vasiliev recalled with a smile. **********Today, with an eye on those broad masses, he has a new passion: creating Russia's first mutual funds. **********As the 32-year-old head of Russia's version of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the former Marxist is now an unabashed advocate of free markets. And he sees mutual funds as the key to building capitalism, energizing the anemic stock market and helping Russia raise the money that is badly needed for investment. **********With many Russians deeply distrustful of investment schemes and the stock market experiencing growing pains, Mr. Vasiliev has his work cut out. But the potential payoff, he insists, is great. **********According to Government estimates, Russians are sitting on at least $20 billion in household savings. And Mr. Vasiliev figures that if 10 percent or so  could be drawn into the stock market, this could help the economy exceed foreign investment in Russia last year. **********\"There is a huge supply of money, including hard currency, for which there is no use,\" Mr. Vasiliev said. \"It is money kept under the pillow or bed, as we say.\" **********With his banker's business suit and studious manner, Mr. Vasiliev looks out of place in Russia's cut-throat political scene. By his own admission, it has been a long, strange trip. **********As a student in St. Petersburg, Mr. Vasiliev was a confirmed Marxist. But as  the cold war wound down, he began to study Western economics on his own. **********Mr. Vasiliev served as a key aide to Anatoly B. Chubais, the free-market advocate, who rose to the rank of first deputy prime minister before being ousted in January by President Boris N. Yeltsin. **********When Russia established its Federal Commission on Securities and the Capital  Market in 1994, Mr. Vasiliev became the deputy chairman and executive director under Mr. Chubais, who served as chairman. **********Now, with the Communists riding high in the polls, this is not the most auspicious time to be an economic reformer. Mr. Yeltsin's attempt to distance himself from controversial economic changes, and Mr. Chubais's departure, have led some to wonder if Mr. Vasiliev will be among the next casualties in Russia's political wars. **********Still, he soldiers on. \"I can say that my work was and is supported by the Prime Minister,\" Mr. Vasiliev said. **********Even without the political considerations, his task would not be easy. With a capitalization of about $20 billion, the Russian stock market is tiny compared with that of major markets in the United States. **********Mr. Vasiliev's commission completed a plan in December to protect investors'  rights, which is still awaiting Mr. Yeltsin's signature. Some key elements, such as the strengthening of the law on securities fraud, require legislative approval. **********Another big problem is attracting money from small Russian investors. Not only do they face prohibitively expensive brokerage fees and red tape, but also  pyramid schemes -- like the one at the investment company MMM, have made investing synonymous with scandal for many Russians. **********\"The capital market today is imbalanced,\" said Bernard Sucher, managing director of Troika Dialog, an investment bank and brokerage dealer. \"If you are  a small Russian investor, there is no way of accessing the securities market here.\" **********The scarcity of Russians willing to take the risks has made the market overly dependent on wary foreign investors. **********\"The market in Russia today moves on foreign money deciding to come or leave,\" said Christopher Smart, director of research for Pioneer First Voucher,  which is planning to start a mutual fund. \"Economically, the real long-term hope for this market lies in mobilizing domestic capital.\" **********And this is where mutual funds come in. Last summer, Mr. Yeltsin signed a decree authorizing the creation of the funds, leaving Mr. Vasiliev to create the regulatory structure. Mr. Vasiliev hopes to issue licenses for the first mutual  funds before the country's presidential election in June. **********The funds are to be of two types: open, meaning that they are required to redeem shares within 15 days of a request, and interval, which will be obliged to redeem shares at least once a year. Foreigners will be able to invest in the funds. **********Among the companies planning to set up mutual funds are Pioneer First Voucher, in which the Boston-based Pioneer Group has a controlling interest. **********Other applicants include Russian investment groups like Asko-Kapital as well  as Dubna, whose management includes former nuclear scientists. Major Russian banks and brokerage companies, like Troika Dialog, also plan to set up funds. **********Mr. Vasiliev hopes to rehabilitate failed investment schemes and turn them into respectable mutual funds. But his commission has received only five applications from such unlicensed companies, and only one, Russki Dom Selengo, has been given temporary permission to proceed. **********Some skeptics say the Government has been moving too slowly. **********\"There has been a lot of noise around this idea of mutual funds, but no result so far,\" said Sergei Skatershchikov, president of Skate Press, a financial data and research company. \"In the short period, I do not really expect this industry to develop.\" **********But other specialists argue that Russian stocks are undervalued and that Russians do not have a lot of investment alternatives. Even so, much may depend  on politics. **********\"If the Communists win, I think Western investors will treat Russia quite cautiously, and there will be less domestic investment,\" Mr. Vasiliev said. \"Our Communists are not Polish Communists. They are worse.\" **********But, characteristically bullish, he quickly moved away from that thought. \"If the elections have success, and I believe in Yeltsin's victory, we can expect a  significant development of the market in the fall of 1996,\" Mr. Vasiliev said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/09/business/the-sec-is-set-to-undo-a-rule-that-was-an-invitation-to-abuse.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1996-10-09", "snippet": "Securities and Exchange Commission is set to consider staff proposal that would force disclosure of ways companies are using and abusing Regulation S, 1990 rule aimed at making it easier for American firms to sell securities abroad; rule exempts f...", "word_count": 747, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The S.E.C. is set to undo a rule that was an invitation to abuse.", "print_headline": "The S.E.C. is set to undo a rule that was an invitation to abuse.", "body_text": " **********IT may be the worst regulation ever passed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, in terms of the invitation to abuse that it presented, but back in 1990 no one foresaw the problems. Now the S.E.C. is finally ready to force disclosure of the ways companies are using -- and misusing -- a rule meant to make it easier for American companies to sell securities overseas. **********The commission today will consider a staff proposal to require companies that make use of Regulation S to disclose the terms of any overseas offerings of stock sold under the regulation, which exempts foreign offerings from disclosure. **********Under Regulation S, American companies may sell securities overseas without any American disclosure. The rule says the overseas buyers may not sell the securities in the American market for 40 days, but otherwise sets no restrictions. **********When the rule was adopted, deregulation was a buzzword in Washington, and the view was that the commission was doing something to help companies raise foreign capital. **********The kind of companies that were expected to take advantage of the rule were major ones selling bonds in Europe. Why, the argument went, should the S.E.C. try to regulate the sale of securities when there were no American investors involved? And if the securities were to be resold in the United States, they would have to be registered anyway, so investors would be protected. **********What was not anticipated was the use of the rule by some small companies to sell stock, not bonds. The shares have often been sold at deep discounts to market value, with the buyers sometimes putting up no cash but instead providing only promissory notes. When the shares are resold in the United States, the proceeds are used to pay off the note and, assuming the stock has not collapsed, provide a tidy return for the buyers of the stock. **********In some cases, the S.E.C. has said in civil complaints, the buyers were not really foreigners at all, merely fronts that took advantage of the rule. In a criminal indictment announced in Brooklyn last week, Federal prosecutors said that six men had inflated the value of two stocks and used Rule S to secretly issue stock to allies who then sold it without disclosure. **********Just how much Regulation S has been used, or abused, is unclear because the rule does not require companies to disclose that they have used the rule to issue stock. The only way shareholders could deduce that stock was sold was when the next quarterly report came out, showing an increase in the number of shares outstanding. But even then, there was no way of knowing on what terms the shares were issued. **********The plan to be voted on by the S.E.C. calls for companies to disclose all Regulation S sales within five to 15 days of the sale of stock, including all relevant facts, such as the price and the nature of the compensation received by the company. **********It is expected that the rule will also cover private placements of stock in this country, although there have been fewer abuses in that area. In cases of those sales, the details would not need to be released until the company's next quarterly report was filed with the S.E.C. **********''If this rule is adopted, it should cure much of the problem, because of the sunlight brought through disclosure,'' said Brian J. Lane, the director of the S.E.C.'s division of corporation finance. **********But it will not cure all problems. Another favorite way for securities law violators to issue stock, according to both S.E.C. enforcement personnel and Federal prosecutors, is to use Form S-8, which requires minimal disclosure and is used to register stock distributed to employees and consultants, such as through employee stock purchase plans. The S.E.C. is thinking about making modifications to that, but has not yet taken any action. **********And more action is likely on Regulation S, although a precise proposal is at least a few months away. The S.E.C. staff is considering such questions as whether the period during which resale in the United States is barred should be lengthened from the current 40 days. Another issue is whether to ban the purchase of Regulation S securities with nonrecourse notes -- effectively freeing the buyer from paying if the stock price collapses before the shares are resold. **********Such moves may be necessary. But letting investors know that a company is selling stock at a big discount to market value will itself be a warning that something odd is going on.

According to its tally, there has been a 50 percent increase in injuries and deaths from stray bullets over the last two years. In 1995, the newspaper said, 41 people were shot. This year, the figure had already reached 51 by early this month. **********While crime has long been an inescapable feature of life in Rio, where apartments cost more than houses largely because they are considered safer, the more recent violence has spilled over into some of the city's most expensive neighborhoods. From most streets in Ipanema and many in Copacabana, explosions and prolonged gunfire in the middle of the night are becoming a weekly occurrence. **********''When the shooting starts, I take my pillow and sleep in the living room,'' said Hilda Martins, 65, who lives on a street between Copacabana and Ipanema called Sa Ferreira. Mrs. Martins' bedroom window faces the hillside slum of Pavao-Pavaozinho, where four straight nights of gunfire a few months ago forced slum dwellers to abandon their homes and sleep at the foot of the hill out of fear they might be caught in the crossfire. **********In the penthouse apartment in Mrs. Martins' building, a bullet had come through the window and hit the wall. ''I live just under that apartment,'' she said. One doorman on the block, who refused to identify himself for fear of retaliation by the drug traffickers, said 35 apartments on Sa Ferreira were for sale. **********While the gunfire has been disturbing the sleep and security of Rio's wealthy, the most direct casualties of the heightened violence have remained those who share the city's poorest neighborhoods with the drug dealers. **********In a clinic bed in Botafogo, a 6-year-old, Clecio de Souza Farias, fell in and out of tears, 24 hours after a bullet pierced his thigh. The same bullet went on to hit the ribs of his 5-year-old friend, Rafael de Siqueira Silva, who lay in a hospital across town. The two children were playing in front of Clecio's grandmother's house in the Rio Comprido neighborhood when the gunfire started. All the children ran for cover, but Clecio and his friend fell to the ground wounded. **********''They used to avoid shooting kids, but now they don't even care,'' said Clecio's father, Cleber de Souza Farias. The traffickers are younger and younger these days, and they fight without rules or reservations, he said.

But no cease-fire is likely, according to Sinn Fein officials, until the outlawed organization's political group, has representatives sitting at the negotiation table in Belfast. **********The I.R.A. car-bombing attack in Lisburn, south of Belfast, wounded 21 soldiers and 10 civilians and was the first attack in Northern Ireland acknowledged by the I.R.A. since it declared a cease-fire on Sept. 1, 1994. **********The overwhelmingly Roman Catholic group had already broken its general cease-fire with bombings in England beginning in February. The car-bombing at the British base on Monday caused widespread pessimism and fear that regular incidents of violence might soon resume in Northern Ireland and here in the Irish Republic. **********The anxiety is aggravated by the fact that the political talks that began June 10 in Belfast, the Northern Ireland capital, have in recent weeks slipped deeper into deadlock beween Catholic and Protestant politicians and officials of the Irish and British Governments. **********Protestant paramilitary groups, whose own cease-fire began on Oct. 13, 1994, are widely feared to be considering retaliation for the renewal of violence in Northern Ireland. Protestant paramilitary leaders have said that if they resume attacks, they will include Dublin and other Irish cities. **********The reasons for the near-collapse of the peace talks and the prospect of new fighting are complicated by the tangled history of violence and mistrust on both sides. They involve, according to officials and others close to the negotiations, a nettle of political strategies and face-saving measures, the same combination of factors that have kept the predominantly Protestant British province in turmoil for most of the last 27 years. **********The prospect of a peaceful settlement is also clouded by a split between hard-liners and moderates within the I.R.A. as well as by the general elections coming in Britain and Ireland next year. **********The political situation increases the determination of Protestant leaders in Northern Ireland to put off any accommodation with the I.R.A. and Sinn Fein. **********''The present peace process has taken us virtually nowhere,'' said Paul Arthur, a politics professor at Ulster University in Belfast.

They amount to the most far-reaching changes in 50 years for the state-run health care system here, and reflect the same struggle to rein in health costs seen in other countries like Britain, Germany and the United States. **********They involve, in a sense, an effort to impose on a national scale some of the controls on spending and practices that are applied by private insurers in the United States under the label of managed care. **********French Government officials denied the charge made by some doctors that these measures would constitute rationing of what has until now been considered the universal right of French citizens to unlimited health care, with practically no questions asked of doctors or patients. But they are intended to curb spending not only by limiting payments to doctors but also by controlling visits to specialists. **********The measures introduced today would require patients to consult general practitioners before going to specialists or receiving diagnostic tests. Richard Bouton, the head of the MG-France Association, the largest doctors' group, observed, \"General practitioners have much more to gain in this reform than to lose.\" **********But specialists -- surgeons, psychiatrists and others -- may find their incomes sharply reduced, and some doctors, especially from specialist-dominated  smaller unions, closed their offices today in protest.

This year, he hoped to keep the health system from running more than $3.3 billion in the red,  but Government predictions now project its deficit at up to $9.2 billion because of rising costs and slow growth of payroll taxes. **********The French system allows people to pick their own doctors and reimburses them for most of the cost of treatment, hospitalization, and medicine.

Jacobs, their chief executive. **********First he focuses on the army of salespeople who work out of their homes taking orders for Watkins's food, health and home-care products. Shouldn't the thousands who sign on each year be invited to company headquarters soon after they enlist, he asks, for training that will encourage them to stick with it? He also wants to know if prospective partners in Korea have been sent a fax of the  detergent ingredient lists they had asked for. Later he moves on to packaging costs, wondering why Watkins isn't pushing suppliers harder for new contracts now that paper prices have fallen. **********I want to be the nicest guy in town, but I don't want to be the nicest because I'm the stupidest,\" he says. **********Wait a minute. Is this the Irwin L. Jacobs, the fabled corporate raider who became conspicuously wealthy during the 1980's by buying huge chunks of troubled companies like Kaiser Steel, Walt Disney and Castle & Cooke (the parent of Dole  Foods), threatening them with takeovers or management changes, and then selling  out to higher bidders? Is this the man dubbed \"Irv the Liquidator\" for the way he dismantled companies that he did manage to buy, like the industrial and leisure-goods giant AMF Inc.? Wasn't Irwin Jacobs known for pestering powerful chief executives like Rand Araskog of ITT, whose conglomerate he wanted to break up, not underlings at obscure companies like Watkins, about what they are doing to build the business? **********Well, yes, it is he. To understand why he is so busy these days with the details of running Watkins, a privately held company that had revenues last year of about $100 million-- about what Wal-Mart Stores rang up in half a day -- one  has to look at how both Mr. Jacobs, 54, and the times have changed. **********\"It's some of each,\" said Mr. Jacobs, a gregarious and disarmingly casual bear of a man. \"I wouldn't buy more than 5 percent of a company today unless I was taking it over, and even then I wouldn't do it in a hostile situation.\" **********Corporate raiders are not quite extinct. There's Bennett S. LeBow, for instance, still pursuing his plans to break off the food business of RJR Nabisco Holdings from the tobacco operations and then combine the latter with Liggett, his own tobacco company. Then there is Carl C. Icahn, the New York financier best known for acquiring control in 1985 of Trans World Airlines, at the time the nation's fourth-largest airline. Until recently, he was an ally with Mr. LeBow in the assault on RJR. And there's Kirk Kerkorian, who failed in his attempt to gain control of Chrysler's board but may still make hundreds of millions of dollars from his investment. **********But, Mr. Jacobs said, the number of flabby or overdiversified companies that  are undervalued has fallen sharply because top managers and directors are now much quicker to whip their companies into shape at the first sign of trouble. \"Look at how AT&T and all these other companies are breaking up without being forced to,\" he said. **********Moreover, when the companies themselves have been slow to act, many pension funds and other institutional shareholders that once reflexively backed management are now routinely challenging corporate strategies without the prodding of freelance flame throwers like Mr. Jacobs. Their restiveness had a lot to do with Mr. Araskog's announcement last year that ITT would split up, just as Mr. Jacobs had urged in 1985. **********\"If we could have patented our suggestions, we could be suing Araskog right now for infringement,\" said Daniel Lindsay, a lawyer for Mr. Jacobs's holding company and a longtime partner in his deals. **********Raiding investors are also rarer because of the loss of their easiest source  of funds, the high-interest-rate loans provided by the giant leveraged-buyout machines run by the likes of Michael R. Milken of Drexel Burnham Lambert. The junk-bond financiers who survive have become much more cautious because of the bankruptcies and other struggles faced by many of the highly indebted companies  their deals created. **********Finally, as Mr. Jacobs and other raiders who gained control of companies have learned, running them can be a drain on the investors' time, their reputations and even their financial power. For every success like Ronald O. Perelman, who built a business empire around his acquisition of Revlon, many others have stumbled. Some, like T. Boone Pickens, who eventually settled down to run Mesa Inc., find themselves vilified by other investors as the same kind of self-interested corporate insiders they were once famous for attacking. Mr. Pickens stepped down this month as Mesa's chairman and chief executive at the request of a financier he had brought in to defend the company from hostile shareholders. **********Mr. Icahn flew TWA into bankruptcy in 1992. Under Asher B. Edelman, Datapoint, a once-leading-edge producer of computer networking equipment, collapsed. **********Mr. Jacobs has certainly accumulated his share of bitter lawsuits and critics. \"I lost all my respect for him,\" said Marc Kozberg, a longtime Minneapolis investment-fund manager. Mr. Kozberg profited from many deals involving Mr. Jacobs, but was dismayed by the latter's failure to shield fellow  investors caught in the collapse of an investment holding company called MEI Diversified. Mr. Jacobs says that there was nothing he could do to save MEI and  that he was among the biggest losers. **********Mr. Jacobs is the first to acknowledge that his portfolio's diversity strained his expertise and drained his energy, in part because he made a more serious stab than many raiders did at running parts of his empire. \"No one could spread themselves as thin as I did in the 80's,\" Mr. Jacobs said. \"It was profitable, but it could have been a whole lot better.\" **********Not the contemplative sort, Mr. Jacobs does not spend much time fretting about how much better it could have been. While continuing to buy and sell large chunks of stock, he stays below the 5 percent level that would require him to notify the Securities and Exchange Commission of his presence and intentions. Mostly, he tries to stay focused on improving the performance of what he already owns to the point where he will be comfortable stepping away. **********\"My wife asked if we could ever take a month off,\" he said. \"I may never do it, but I've reached the point where I want to know I could.\" **********But he still jumps at what he perceives as bargains, though. In 1994, he snapped up Canterbury Downs, a shuttered racetrack in a Minneapolis suburb, Shakopee, for $7 million, about a tenth of the cost of building it. But the payoff he was hoping for never materialized. After he ignited a controversy by suggesting that the track could enjoy a renaissance if other forms of gambling were authorized there, he unloaded the property at a modest profit. **********\"Deals are in our blood,\" mused Carl C. Pohlad, the 80-year-old Minneapolis banker who has been Mr. Jacobs's backer and partner in numerous ventures over the last 22 years. \"We could say, 'Never again,' but it's only until the right thing comes along.\" **********BY the mid-1980's Mr. Jacobs had assembled the bulk of the business portfolio -- and the headaches -- that keep him busy these days. There is no common thread to explain why he has kept some businesses and discarded scores of others, but the centerpiece of what is left is clearly Genmar Holdings, a privately held collection of boat companies acquired since 1977. With sales last year of $552.7 million, they make up the nation's third-largest leisure-boat manufacturer, after Brunswick and Outboard Marine. **********Mr. Jacobs, who keeps three powerboats at his lakeside mansion outside Minneapolis, has long played an active role in managing his boat businesses. But that involvement was overshadowed in the 1980's when his other investment forays were grabbing headlines and generating the profits that allowed him to load up on the trappings of success, including a vacation home in Palm Beach, Fla., and  a succession of Rolls-Royces. **********\"He knows and loves the marine business,\" said James Chapman, the former chairman and chief operating officer of Outboard Marine, a supplier of engines to Genmar as well as a competitor in boat sales. \"When we negotiated our long-term engine contract several years ago, it was Irwin across the table from  me.\" **********But Mr. Jacobs's management skills appeared to be nothing special when Genmar sales collapsed in 1989, along with the rest of the boating industry's. Burdened by the heavy debts accumulated to allow Mr. Jacobs and others to take cash out of the company, Genmar escaped bankruptcy only because Mr. Jacobs injected new capital, recruited new investors and negotiated new terms with lenders. Genmar's sales began rebounding three years ago, with total revenue up 25 percent in 1994 and 11 percent last year. Operating cash flows remain uncomfortably weak because of rising expenses -- both Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service downgraded their ratings on $100 million of outstanding junk bonds in December -- but Mr. Jacobs is confident of a third consecutive year of operating profits  and is even talking cautiously about the possibility of returning to the black for the first time since 1989. **********\"We are managing this for the long haul,\" he said, adding that his main role  at this point was developing new marketing strategies. **********For example, he recently negotiated an arrangement to allow Genmar dealers to display some of their more inexpensive boats in Wal-Mart parking lots, an exposure that he hopes will attract a broad new range of potential customers to  showrooms. **********Mr. Jacobs is delving much more deeply into Watkins, a 128-year-old company that was once a giant in direct sales. Watkins helped pioneer the technique of multilevel marketing, in which sales representatives are paid commissions not just on their own sales but on the business generated by people they recruit. Such pyramid-like marketing strategies have been a frequent source of business fraud, but when run legitimately they have allowed tens of thousands of Americans to create independent home-based businesses with little investment up  front.    THE founding Watkins family had mismanaged the company into bankruptcy when Mr. Jacobs acquired it for $4.6 million in 1978. A succession of professional managers he installed turned the business around, but after an early period of fast growth, annual revenues stalled a few years ago at around $100 million. **********The slowdown frustrated Mr. Jacobs, who believed the company's marketing structure made it an ideal refuge for workers threatened by corporate downsizing who were hungry for opportunities to build independent sources of income. **********His dismay deepened, he said, when Russ Hall, then the president, raised the  cost of the starter kit for new sales representatives from $81 to $99, with disastrous results. Instead of bolstering revenue by attracting more committed people, as Mr. Hall had anticipated, the move dampened sales, made new recruiting tougher and infuriated star sales representatives who earned six-figure incomes, Mr. Jacobs said. **********Mr. Hall was dismissed, Mr. Jacobs says, and after a meeting in Minneapolis in January with the top 100 salespeople that Mr. Jacobs calls \"the best learning experience of my career,\" a new starter kit costing $29.95 was introduced. Mr. Hall could not be reached for comment. **********Mr. Jacobs is now spending at least a day a week in Winona with a new management team, plunging into activities like negotiating the recent partnership with Jinro, a huge Korean conglomerate, to expand Watkins's reach into South Korea. **********The silver lining in Watkins's troubles for Mr. Jacobs is that they attracted the interest of Mark, his 32-year-old son. **********The only son in a close-knit family that includes four daughters, Mark had been pursuing an acting career that had resulted in bit roles in several movies. He can be seen getting beaten up in \"Goodfellas.\" Mark moved back to Minnesota this spring and recently became vice president in charge of marketing at Watkins. He and his father talk several times a day. One of Mark's sisters, Tricia, is developing a line of cosmetic products for Watkins, but the three others are not currently involved in Mr. Jacobs's businesses. **********MR. JACOBS said he hoped Genmar and Watkins would both be prosperous enough to take public within a year. But investors might be wary based on the track record of Insty-Print, a franchise chain of 325 printing shops in which Mr. Jacobs and an investment group retain a 70 percent stake after a 1994 public offering. The thinly traded shares of I.P.I. Inc., the publicly traded holding company, are at $4, just where they started trading in May 1994, having been left behind during one of the greatest market rallies in history. **********The problem, according to some investment managers, is Mr. Jacobs. They say I.P.I. told investors it planned to grow through acquisitions, but Mr. Jacobs's  reluctance to buy at anything other than bargain prices has resulted in no action and slow growth. That quest for a discount is unlikely to change, say those who know Mr. Jacobs best. **********\"He firmly believes that you make your money when you make your buy,\" said Dennis Mathiesen, a Jacobs lieutenant and investing partner in the 1980's, who has since built a mini-empire of his own around the Mountain Parks Financial Corporation, a publicly traded bank holding company. **********One business where Mr. Jacobs's passion for bargains is unlikely to hold him  back is his Jacobs Trading Company and the closely related WGD Inc., which specialize in buying cut-rate goods and reselling them to wholesalers, retailers and consumers. These descendants of Mr. Jacobs's original business, the close-out merchandising deals he began putting together as a teen-ager, aim to capitalize on retailers' growing problems with handling the billions of dollars  of goods that come back to them under liberal return policies that consumers have come to take for granted. **********Jacobs Trading sells a variety of returned goods picked up from mass merchandisers like Wal-Mart, manufacturers and other sources, marketing them to  other retailers or directly to consumers through its small but growing chain of  retail outlets in the upper Midwest. WGD, which stands for \"World's Greatest Deal,\" is attempting to expand the same concept into electronic marketing (and its home on the Internet is www.wgdeal.com). **********Critics, though, say Mr. Jacobs's search for the cheapest deal has led him down a questionable road. To expand the range of returned goods they handle, the trading companies last year began marketing electronic goods and other items that have been rebuilt by convicts at a state prison in Appleton, Wis. **********Unions decry the practice as a grab for cheap labor that they say was approved by Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin as a quid pro quo for campaign contributions. The Governor has denied the allegations, and Mr. Jacobs describes the plan as a public service that allows the state to recoup some of its costs of running the prisons and trains prisoners to do jobs that will help them stay  out of prison once they are released. **********Mr. Jacobs said it was never an exclusive deal, adding that he did not see it as essential to the success of Jacobs Trading. Indeed, the experiment is still so small-scale that his interest in it might surprise anyone whose impressions of Mr. Jacobs are based on his more widely publicized ventures of the 1980's. **********But Mr. Jacobs says he does not mourn the loss of the national spotlight, and those who know him believe him. Bill Nicholson, the former chief operating officer of Amway, whom Mr. Jacobs lured out of retirement to run WGD, said, \"He  loves the art of business at any level.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/14/world/un-and-iraq-report-progress-in-talks-to-allow-limited-oil-sales.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1996-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 550, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N. and Iraq Report Progress in Talks to Allow Limited Oil Sales", "print_headline": "U.N. and Iraq Report Progress in Talks to Allow Limited Oil Sales", "body_text": " **********Talks between Iraq and the United Nations that could lead to limited Iraqi oil sales for the first time since the Persian Gulf war neared the end of an initial round today, with diplomats saying that the two sides are as close as they have ever been to an agreement. **********United States officials said they thought the talks would recess late today,  but the United Nations spokeswoman, Sylvana Foa, said the two sides planned another meeting on details for Wednesday. **********As the talks proceeded, the Security Council today discussed a new and separate resolution on Iraq that would tighten monitoring of Iraqi imports in general and stiffen requirements on exports to Iraq from all countries. **********As new disclosures of secret Iraqi weapons programs have emerged in recent months, Council members have decided to act now to \"close loopholes,\" an official said. **********The resolution, which could be passed this week, would not only tighten monitoring now as limited oil sales become a possibility but would also put in place a web of restrictions before broader sanctions against Iraq are lifted at  some future date. **********[Reuters reported from Vienna on Tuesday that the International Atomic Energy Agency said its investigation into Iraq's weapons programs found that about a dozen Western companies had sold to Baghdad equipment it used in its nuclear program before the gulf war.

On this sunny, not-too-chilly morning, the older children are busy attacking the plastic playground equipment, while inside the 3-year-olds are puzzling over cut-paper shapes and the babies are snoozing in their green and white cribs. In the kitchen, the cook is preparing pizza-like ''Italian dippers'' with broccoli for lunch from a four-week rotation that runs from meat loaf to toasted cheese. **********If Kindercare Learning Centers' new owner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, has its way, tens of thousands more preschoolers will soon be sampling the menu. While Kohlberg Kravis, the leveraged buyout specialist, declined to discuss its plans for Kindercare until the formalities are completed next month, Clifton Roberts, a general partner, has made no secret of the firm's wish to capitalize on Kindercare's good will. **********''K.K.R. intends to support the expansion of Kindercare through internal growth and acquisitions while continuing to promote industry-leading education and quality standards,'' Mr. Roberts explained in the Oct. 3 announcement of the buyout. And despite a tangled financial past, Kindercare is probably better positioned to expand than its rivals. It has long experience in operating a nationwide network and a strong reputation in the upper-middle end of the day care market. **********But the obstacles to success in the child care business are substantial, a quandary that reflects both the problematic economics of day care and a cultural failure to adjust to the consequences of expecting mothers with young children to work. **********There are several reasons. Care of the sort provided by Kindercare's Clark center -- $150 to $205 a week -- is out of financial reach of many families. And many others do not want it: though experts say preschoolers benefit from the social context and stimulation of quality day care, many working parents prefer to re-create, with a mother-surrogate, a more traditional setting, even if it offers little more than baby-sitting. **********''Parents and developmental psychologists disagree about what is best for children,'' said David Blau, an economist at the University of North Carolina, who has studied child care providers. ''And many parents just don't want to pay for what the psychologists want.'' **********Quality Care Comes at a Price **********Two-thirds of American women with preschool children now work, including half the women with infants under a year old. Yet a survey of 400 day care centers in four states, conducted in 1995 by a team led by Susan Helburn, an economist at the University of Colorado, rated the quality ''poor'' to ''mediocre'' in six out of seven centers. While most centers ''meet children's basic health and safety needs,'' she concluded that few help to develop language, math and social skills, leaving even the children of America's middle class inadequately prepared for less sheltered environments. **********Less is known about ''family'' child care -- care in other people's homes. For while friends, grandparents and neighbors are the ones who most often must provide a safe, stimulating environment for preschoolers, the average quality varies widely from the most nurturing to the most neglectful. **********For many parents, its great advantage is cost: full-time child care in this largely unregulated part of the market runs $40 to $100 a week, just half the cost of unsubsidized care in a group center. **********But it is group day care centers to which more and more American families are necessarily turning. **********Today, just 3 percent of preschoolers with working mothers are left at home with nannies, according to Barbara Willer, a consultant to the National Association for the Education of Young Children. That is down from 15 percent in 1965. And of the 20 million children now under kindergarten age, some 6 million spend at least part of the day in one of America's 100,000 group day care centers. **********Indeed, Roger Neugeberger, publisher of the Child Care Information Exchange, an industry newsletter, reports that virtually all growth in the market has been in the centers. **********For years, the accepted wisdom has been that any solution to the day care problem would require a big injection of Government cash. Roger Brown, the president of Bright Horizons, a company that manages 125 up-market day care centers for corporate and government clients, offers the most common view. ''It's much like a famine in the midst of a well-fed world,'' he said. ''Good day care is out there, but the average person simply can't afford it.'' **********Margins Are Thin; Mergers Are Sparse **********But while more money to subsidize day care is clearly necessary to meet the needs of lower-income families and welfare mothers who are going to be required to work under the new welfare law, no level of government is likely to aim much money in the direction of Kindercare and others that cater to the middle class. **********Moreover, investors, like Kohlberg Kravis, that are looking to make a profit in child care must contend with the willingness of small-scale entrepreneurs to enter the business with operations that run on razor-thin margins. Of the roughly 35,000 centers run as businesses designed to make a profit, 29,000 are little more than a single operation -- often a converted house or a storefront. And in contrast to many other service industries, there is no clear trend to consolidation. **********Mr. Brown of Bright Horizons thinks he knows why: economies of scale in the business are modest. While chains can save a bit on supplies, training, insurance, real estate and marketing, most of the cost is in labor. The chains have some hiring advantages in being able to offer group fringe benefits and opportunities for promotion. ''We can get quality employees for $2 less in hourly wages,'' said Miriam Liggett, a regional vice president of Kindercare, who started as an assistant teacher. **********But the chains face disadvantages, too, in competing directly with the ''mom-and-pop'' centers whose owners impute little cost to their own long hours on the job. **********And there seems to be limited value to brand recognition. While parents may be relieved to find the same Big Mac in Pittsburgh or Prague, they have mixed emotions about the assembly line image in child care. ''There is some brand-name premium'' for chains that contract to manage centers for others, Mr. Brown concluded. But the contract business represents a small part of the commercial market. **********Kindercare clearly wants to break out of the slow-growth mold. The company, which was founded in 1969, stumbled badly in the late 1980's after it was saddled with a huge debt in a buyout engineered by Drexel Burnham Lambert. It spent part of 1992 and 1993 in Chapter 11. But Kohlberg Kravis, which agreed to pay stockholders $467 million, has pledged to provide $175 million in new equity capital, plus a $300 million line of bank credit. **********Market and Mandate Determine Costs **********But can that injection overcome the inherent difficulties of running day care centers at a return high enough to provide money for further expansions? **********A look at the finances shows just how hard it will be. Sandra Scarr, the president of Kindercare, who previously led a research program in developmental psychology at the University of Virginia, would not reveal the actual budget for the Clark center. But she provided enough detail to piece one together. Most of Clark's costs, it seems, are dictated by a combination of competition in the labor market and the State of New Jersey, which regulates health and safety at day care centers and sets minimum staffing ratios for each age group served. **********Every classroom at the Clark center has a full-time lead teacher earning $9 to $12 an hour, including benefits, along with enough full-time $8-  to $10-an-hour assistants and part-time $6-  to $8-an-hour assistants to satisfy the state. New Jersey requires one staff member for every 4 infants, one for every 7 toddlers and one for every 10 children between 2 1/2 and 4. With a mix that requires roughly one worker for 7 children at an average cost of $9 an hour, classroom labor runs a bit less than $1.30 an hour for each child. **********Clark is open from 6:30 A.M. to 6:30 P.M., or 60 hours a week -- a necessity, said Kristy Sugg, director of the Clark center, because ''most of our parents drop them off early on the way to work and pick them up late.'' Presumably, a full complement of workers is not needed across the entire day. Figure full staffing for just 50 hours a week, and the direct labor cost alone comes to $65 a child. **********Each Kindercare center has a director and an assistant director. In a relatively high wage area like Clark, the two earn a total of $60,000 to $80,000, including health benefits and virtually free child care. Figure supervisory costs (including regional and national management) at a minimum of $10 weekly a child when the center is running at 80 percent of its full capacity of 200. **********Then there is real estate. Kindercare designs and builds its own centers for about $1.9 million in high-cost areas like suburban New Jersey. It probably takes at least 15 percent a year for capital and maintenance, or $285,000. Assuming the center runs at 80 percent of capacity, the weekly cost for each child is about $35. Food (breakfast, lunch, two snacks), insurance, cleaning, classroom supplies and marketing costs are harder to pin down, but $50 a week is conservative. **********All told, then, Kindercare needs revenues of about $160 a week from each child for a spanking new, high-cost center like Clark to break even at 80 percent capacity. Currently, the fees run $205 for infants, $180 for toddlers, $165 for 2 1/2 to 3 years and $150 for 4 and above. This leaves only modest room for profit, ''but it is all the market can bear,'' said Susan Liddy, the New York regional coordinator for Kindercare. **********In lower-wage regions and states that permit lower staffing levels, Kindercare can break even for as little as $130 a week from each child, Dr. Scarr said. She added that the company is considering centers with fewer amenities, but doesn't expect that costs could be cut by more than 10 to 20 percent without compromising features that Kindercare considers important. ''Shiny playground equipment and hot lunches just aren't much of the bill,'' she explained. **********Looking at Life Through '57 Glasses **********At a minimum, high-quality day care -- with the higher staffing levels and wages that Mr. Brown of Bright Horizons said were needed -- would cost $9,000 a year. But even Kindercare's bare-bones $130 a week comes to $6,500 for a 50-week year, or a bit more than 10 percent of the median income of a family with two adults employed full-time. Perhaps it's no surprise, then, that the average center charges less than $5,000, with consequently lower care. Indeed, fully 40 percent of the centers in the Helburn study were rated ''inadequate'' for infants and toddlers. **********What seems clearest in the decidedly murky world of day care is that progress will be piecemeal. In part, this follows from the cost: the tens of billions of dollars needed annually to assure first-class care for all preschool children will not be easily found in family budgets. And the Federal Government, cutting back everywhere else, is certainly not about to fill the gap. **********Perhaps the largest impediment to change is Americans' failure to acknowledge, for better and worse, that the 1950's world of ''Leave It To Beaver,'' and ''Father Knows Best,'' is history and that Mom is working outside the home for good. Until attitudes reflect the reality, day care is likely to remain the latch-key kid of public policy. Meanwhile, Roger Brown concluded, ''the people who need good child care most are the people least likely to get it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/06/news/but-intelligence-unit-is-said-to-stay-behind-in-kurdish-region-us-sees.html": {"writer_name": "Brian Knowlton", "pub_date": "1996-09-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 562, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "But Intelligence Unit Is Said to Stay Behind In Kurdish Region: U.S. Sees Expanded Zone as Permanent (folo)", "print_headline": "But Intelligence Unit Is Said to Stay Behind In Kurdish Region: U.S. Sees Expanded Zone as Permanent (folo)", "body_text": " **********Washington\u2014                     Brian Knowlton of the International Herald Tribune reportedfrom Washington: **********The extension of the southern flight-exclusion zone in Iraq, from the 32d Parallel to the 33d, about 95 kilometersfarther north, is now considered permanent, Pentagon officials said Thursday. **********The State Department reacted obliquely to an announcement thatthe French governmentwould resume its air patrols over the old flight-exclusion zone in southern Iraq on Monday, but that its planes would not fly in the expanded portion of the zone. **********The State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said Washington would pursue its goals in Iraq regardless of the allies' stance.\"We are accomplishing our objectives,\" he said. \"If we have to do it alone, or alone with the British, we will do it.\"Britain has strongly endorsed the U.S. moves to punish Mr. Saddam for his moves into the north. **********But the U.S. air strikes against Iraq drew blunt criticism Thursday from the Russian security chief, Alexander Lebed.The Interfax news agency quoted him as having said:\"There is one big strong master who spits on everybody.

Gerald Cantor is not a household name. If they know Mr. Cantor at all, it is as a generous art patron whose private collection of Rodin sculpture is unsurpassed. **********Wall Street knows Mr. Cantor, who is nearly 80 and goes by his nickname, Bernie, as the pioneering founder of Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., one of the largest Government bond brokers in the country, with a blue-chip institutional customer list that includes the nation's biggest banks, pension funds, mutual fund managers and corporate treasurers. **********But in the tidy files of the Court of Chancery in Wilmington, Del., Mr. Cantor is known simply and sadly as a figure in Case No. 14887: Cantor Fitzgerald L.P. and CF Group Management v. Cantor Fitzgerald Inc. **********The confusingly similar names give the impression that Cantor Fitzgerald is suing itself -- and in a larger sense, it is. Indeed, some advisers to family businesses say the Delaware case could scar the firm, its partners and its prospects for years to come. However the firm's troubles turn out, they are a textbook example of the difficulties of providing for the next generation of leadership at a company whose success has been tied closely to a powerful founding figure. **********Cantor Fitzgerald Inc., the defendant, is a Cantor family entity, owned by Bernie Cantor and his second wife, Iris. It is one of two general partners of Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., the business that Wall Street knows and one of the plaintiffs in the case. The other general partner, and the other plaintiff, is CF Group Management, owned by Howard Lutnick, Mr. Cantor's 34-year-old protege and, for at least three years, his designated successor at the firm. **********In human terms, then, Howard Lutnick and the firm he has managed for five years are suing Iris and Bernie Cantor, who control about 55 percent of the firm. At issue is who should run the house that Bernie built, now that Mr. Cantor himself is gravely ill. **********Mr. Cantor, a diabetic, has required regular kidney dialysis since 1990 and has lost much of his eyesight to retinal bleeding. He experienced a medical crisis in late December and was hospitalized in New York for several weeks. He is now being treated at his home in the Los Angeles area, with occasional hospital visits, according to court records. **********A spokesman for Mrs. Cantor would not comment on her husband's current physical and mental condition; Mr. Lutnick's lawyers, in court papers, contend that Mr. Cantor is still too ill to run the business and lacks \"sufficient mental capacity\" to understand the legal steps being taken in his name. Doctors hired by lawyers for the firm are scheduled to examine Mr. Cantor  today. **********In any event, on Jan. 2, just days after Mr. Cantor's medical crisis began, Mr. Lutnick took steps to implement the partnership's succession plan, which transferred to Mr. Lutnick the role of \"managing general partner\" previously held by Mr. Cantor's family partnership. That step, which left the Cantor family entity with very limited powers despite its majority ownership stake, immediately provoked Mrs. Cantor's opposition. The move, she said in court papers, was premature and disrespectful to her husband. **********By early March, the wounded feelings on both sides had congealed into icy arguments between teams of lawyers. To the firm and Mr. Lutnick, Mrs. Cantor was undermining the clear wishes of Mr. Cantor, was acting improperly in his name and was derailing the smooth transfer of power that Mr. Cantor desired. **********To Mrs. Cantor, Mr. Lutnick had taken advantage of Mr. Cantor's medical crisis to stage a \"palace coup,\" as one of her advisers described it, and had therefore betrayed Mr. Cantor's trust and forfeited his role as successor. **********On March 7, Mr. Lutnick and the firm filed suit in Delaware, the partnership's legal home, to enforce the succession plan. A few weeks later, Mrs. Cantor countersued, to evict Mr. Lutnick from office. She charged that an incapacity ruling, which set off the succession plan, was invalidly obtained from a special committee of the firm and that Mr. Lutnick had breached his fiduciary duties to the Cantor family by unilaterally amending the partnership agreement on March 5 to make it harder to remove him as managing general partner. Vice Chancellor Jack B. Jacobs, who will try the case in Wilmington starting on May 6, will determine the winner. **********But \"winner\" is an elusive concept in this laceratingly bitter litigation. **********Even if Mr. Lutnick wins in court, he has already lost the companionship and  guidance of Mr. Cantor and the trust of Mrs. Cantor, who is wealthy enough to hire lawyers to torment Mr. Lutnick and the firm for years. And even if the Cantors win, Mr. Cantor has lost his dream of a smooth succession at his firm and, further, has lost his fatherlike relationship with Mr. Lutnick and other young senior executives who have supported Mr. Lutnick in the fight. **********The firm itself may face the biggest losses, regardless of the decision. **********Although Mr. Lutnick has pushed Cantor Fitzgerald into foreign markets and expanded its role in the domestic equity markets, the dispute tarnishes that successful image by revealing an office culture that makes Oliver Stone's vision of \"Wall Street\" look beatific by comparison. Battle lines have cut through office friendships and family ties. Management time and attention has already been diverted by depositions and other legal tasks. And, say people allied with  Mr. Lutnick, angry partners are vowing future legal action against Mrs. Cantor that could extend far into the future. **********WILL the feud unsettle the firm's sophisticated clients and leave it vulnerable in a highly competitive business? Absolutely not, Mr. Lutnick said in an interview Thursday night. \"Our operating business is far removed from the battles of the executive suite,\" he said. Other partners said the firm's customers are \"very relaxed\" about the dispute, while the firm's bankers, accountants and regulators see it as a \"ho hum\" matter. **********With nearly $200 million in capital, Cantor Fitzgerald is financially secure, the partners said, but they declined to provide other details about the private  firm's finances. One measure of the partnership's profitability, however, is an  estimate by Financial World magazine that Mr. Cantor alone drew out about $50 million from the firm in 1995. **********But if the fight drags on -- as partisans on both sides say it will -- many talented people may be loathe to build their careers in a war zone, family business experts say. **********\"It is O.K. for two people with a lot of power to disagree -- but they have to find a way to co-exist or it will tear the organization apart,\" said Mark Rubin, founder of the Metropolitan Group, a consulting firm in Leonia, N.J., that specializes in closely held and family businesses. \"If not, say I'm a Harvard M.B.A. who can work anywhere. Will I pick this company or pick a competitor? You know the answer to that.\" **********Samuel P. Starr, a tax partner with Coopers & Lybrand in Washington, agreed that battles this bitter could have devastating consequences. \"Without commenting on the merits in this case, any succession plan is ultimately about human relationships,\" Mr. Starr said. \"It is that simple. Any time you end up with a 'cram down' solution through litigation, you will have soured the relationships sufficiently as to really raise the question of whether the organization can survive.\" **********Mr. Lutnick said he did not fear that the fight would hurt the firm. \"But what it does do,\" he added after a moment, \"is -- well, it's got to be hurting Iris Cantor. And it certainly is hurting me, emotionally.\" **********Bernie Cantor is a seminal figure on Wall Street. He founded his firm in Los  Angeles in 1945 as Cantor & Company -- it took its current name from the addition of a partner, John Fitzgerald, who died in 1964. The firm now employs 1,800 people in Los Angeles, New York and other North American cities, and in Europe and East Asia. **********At first, the firm designed sophisticated tax strategies for Hollywood stars  like Kirk Douglas, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Clint Eastwood. Later, Mr. Cantor's clients included Meshulam Riklis and other brash conglomerate-builders of the 1960's. **********But in 1972, Mr. Cantor acquired a controlling stake in the Telerate information service and started to post public price quotes for Treasury securities on Telerate's computer screens. This pierced the secrecy that had traditionally veiled trading in Treasury securities, and allowed Mr. Cantor to widen his customer base sharply. In 1981, he sold Telerate to Exco International for about $100 million, more than 30 times his original investment, retaining an exclusive contract to provide broker prices to the service. (Telerate is now owned by Dow Jones & Company.) **********Two years later, Mr. Cantor hired a young trainee, Howard Lutnick, a high-school tennis star who was just one year out of Haverford College. For about 18 months, Mr. Lutnick moved from one sector of the firm to another, learning the ropes and gathering information. The last stop on his orientation tour was a desk in the corner of Mr. Cantor's office, where the boss frequently  interrogated the young man about what he found in his travels around the firm. **********\"I would tell him something that the executive or manager of the unit hadn't  told him, and the next thing you know, Bernie would be on the phone yawping to the guy,\" Mr. Lutnick recalled. \"I was aggressively lectured by every executive  who walked out of his office. But hey, my theory was that the guy whose name was on the door was the one who mattered.\" **********Mr. Lutnick was then assigned to a tiny unit that managed Mr. Cantor's personal investments and those of a few of his friends. With Mr. Cantor's nod, he brought in additional clients and transformed the unit into one of the firm's most profitable. **********His personal relationship with Mr. Cantor deepened. Mr. Lutnick, who said his parents died before he left college, choked with emotion recounting how Mr. Cantor had talked him out of leaving the firm to get an M.B.A. by promising him  \"private lessons.\" **********The legacy that Bernie Cantor was preparing for Howard Lutnick was not pristine: Cantor Fitzgerald is known as a very sharp-elbowed firm, and occasionally it has cut corners too close for the comfort of Wall Street's regulators. **********The firm, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, was disciplined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1994 for record-keeping violations in connection with investigations stemming from the Treasury auction scandal at Salomon Brothers. And Mr. Cantor raised some eyebrows by hiring Peter DaPuzzo, who in June 1992 had paid $100,000 and agreed to a brief suspension to settle a  New York Stock Exchange complaint arising from the manipulation of the price of  Conagra shares in 1990 while he was at Shearson Lehman Brothers. Mr. DaPuzzo neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing. **********A WIDELY known investment manager, S. Jay Goldinger, had a serious run-in with regulators while he was employed at Cantor Fitzgerald: in 1991, he and four others, including two at Cantor Fitzgerald, were accused by the S.E.C. of insider trading. A Federal District Court judge in Los Angeles has dismissed the case, but the S.E.C. is appealing the ruling. (Mr. Goldinger later struck out on his own and, early this year, filed for bankruptcy after being sued over his derivatives-driven investment strategies.) **********As far back as 1974, Cantor Fitzgerald paid $265,000 -- a substantial amount  in that era -- to settle an S.E.C. case charging that it had participated in a scheme that defrauded investors of $9 million through a mutual fund. The firm denied wrongdoing, saying it settled the case to avoid the expense of litigation. **********Outside the office, though, Mr. Cantor, whose net worth was estimated at more than $400 million in 1992 by Forbes magazine, moved in a very different world. A genial and generous benefactor of medical institutions and museums since the late 1960's, he and Mrs. Cantor have made major gifts to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Brooklyn Museum and the Los Angeles County Art Museum. Driven by a single-minded passion for Auguste Rodin, he helped polish the reputation of the turn-of-the-century French sculptor through study grants and exhibitions. **********Perhaps his best-known effort was the casting, at his expense, of Rodin's original and powerfully disturbing designs for a massive bronze work, \"The Gates of Hell,\" which was permanently installed at Stanford University in 1985. **********Those gates would have made an appropriate entry into the executive suite at  Cantor Fitzgerald, where seething political battles among rivals for Mr. Cantor's approval were common though the 1980's. Former and current executives tell their war stories with great relish -- indeed, Mr. Lutnick himself attributes his own elevation in the firm to a former competitor's fatal effort to fire him on Aug. 13, 1990. The rival, the firm's president, was forced out, Mr. Lutnick said; his position, though not his title, fell to Mr. Lutnick, who managed the firm from that point on. **********It was in this environment that Mr. Cantor dropped, in 1992, his original plan to leave the ownership of Cantor Fitzgerald to his charitable foundation and decided, for tax reasons, to convert the firm from a corporation to a partnership. The next spring, the firm admitted 75 employees as its first limited partners and added a succession plan. **********\"A key issue for them is, who will run the partnership if something happened  to Bernie,\" Mr. Lutnick said. \"He decided, well, I would run it -- but if he chose to change his mind, he could do so. My deal with Bernie was, as long as he was around, I would work for him, and if he wasn't around, I would run the company.\" **********IF the deal were indeed that simple, the litigation now scorching its way through the Delaware courts would never have been ignited. **********For one thing, according to supporters of Mr. Lutnick, Mrs. Cantor's legal advisers had raised questions as early as mid-1993 about how she would be treated after Mr. Lutnick took control. Mr. Cantor responded with a side agreement that insured her a substantial stream of income after a change in management. Mrs. Cantor declined to be interviewed for this article. **********And last fall, after an earlier scare about Mr. Cantor's health, Mrs. Cantor  was approached by Mr. Lutnick about selling her stake in the firm, supporters of both sides said, although people familiar with Mrs. Cantor's case said the approach was \"very tentative\" and was declined without rancor. **********Missing from the overall partnership plan, family partnership experts said, was any requirement for mediation of disputes that might arise over such sensitive issues as succession and the powers of the Cantor family entity as the non-managing general partner. **********Moreover, while the partnership agreement does indeed call for Mr. Lutnick to become managing general partner in the event of Mr. Cantor's death, it also allows a shift if Mr. Cantor is deemed to be \"incapacitated\" by a five-member panel he appointed. But the partnership agreement does not define \"incapacity,\"  nor does it specify how this committee is to operate or whether its vote must be unanimous. **********As of December, this panel consisted of Mrs. Cantor; Stuart Fraser, her nephew and an executive at the firm; Rod A. Fisher, her niece's husband and an executive at another family firm; Philip Ginsberg, another executive of the firm, and Dr. Peter S. Bing, a Stanford University trustee and longtime friend of the family. **********The committee was thrust into the spotlight when Mr. Cantor was rushed to New York Hospital in late December. On Jan. 1, he aspirated fluid into his lungs and was put on a respirator. Family members gathered in great distress, advisers to  both sides confirm. **********The next day, according to court papers filed by both sides, Mr. Lutnick approached three members of the incapacity committee -- Mr. Fraser, Mr. Fisher and Mr. Ginsberg -- and solicited their opinion that Mr. Cantor was incapacitated under the terms of the partnership agreement. All three initially  agreed, and Mr. Lutnick thus activated the succession plan, according to the court records. **********It may now seem unwise for Mr. Lutnick to have acted on the succession plan in the midst of an emotional crisis in the Cantor family. But people who support Mr. Lutnick insist that senior partners had been concerned about Mr. Cantor's physical and mental health since the fall of 1995, when he had been unable to complete a deposition in an unrelated lawsuit. With the firm preparing to offer  new partnership units to employees in March 1996, these partners pushed to have  the management situation clarified. **********In any case, Mrs. Cantor was shaken and enraged by the action, according to documents filed in court on her behalf. \"She believed that Mr. Cantor's illness  no more interfered with the successful carrying out of the partnership's business than it had theretofore,\" her counterclaim asserted. Any incapacity declaration, her complaint continued, \"was inappropriate, unnecessary, disrespectful and demeaning to Mr. Cantor.\" **********Her lawyers argue, indeed, that the committee vote is invalid and Mr. Lutnick thus has not lawfully assumed the role of managing general partner. Their argument is based on the lack of a formal committee meeting, on misrepresentations that Mr. Lutnick was accused of making to Mr. Fisher in soliciting his vote and on Mr. Fisher's own subsequent decision to revoke his support for the ruling of incapacity. That change of heart was noted in a letter he sent to the firm on March 4, a day before Mr. Lutnick amended the partnership agreement to make it more difficult for him to be removed as managing general partner. **********Mrs. Cantor's lawyers further challenge the validity of earlier partnership amendments in 1994 and 1995 that reduced the powers of the non-managing general  partner; they were initiated by Mr. Lutnick, they charge, in violation of the fiduciary duty he owed the Cantors. **********The level of anger in the case escalated when the firm refused to recognize as valid the powers of attorney that Mrs. Cantor submitted when she attempted to retrieve artwork owned by her husband from the firm's Los Angeles office on March 8, the day after Mr. Lutnick and the firm filed their lawsuit in Delaware. The result was an ugly scene; Mrs. Cantor has since been barred from the firm's  premises. Mr. Lutnick's supporters defend these steps as necessary to prevent Mrs. Cantor from using what the firm's lawyers say are \"bogus powers of attorney\" to undermine Mr. Cantor's wishes. Mrs. Cantor's advisers cite the incident as an example of the churlish treatment she has received from Mr. Lutnick. **********The refusal by Mr. Fraser, Mrs. Cantor's nephew, to join Mr. Fisher in retracting support for the incapacity ruling has caused more pain and division among the families that overlap the Cantor Fitzgerald executive suite. **********Mrs. Cantor has removed both Mr. Fraser and his mother, Enid Fraser, who is Mrs. Cantor's sister, from the board of the Cantor family partnership, along with Mr. Lutnick. The firm and Mr. Lutnick dispute her authority to effect those changes, however, under their general position that she is acting without Mr. Cantor's authority. **********Mr. Fisher, besides being married to Mr. Fraser's sister, is also a first cousin to Stephen Merkel, general counsel of Cantor Fitzgerald, said by many partners to be the architect of Mr. Lutnick's legal strategy in implementing the succession plan in January. **********On Saturday, April 6, partners at the firm received a letter signed \"B. Gerald Cantor,\" with a shaky scrawled signature, announcing that Mr. Lutnick had been dismissed and that he and Mrs. Cantor were looking for a new management team. **********\"As you all know by now,\" the typed letter said, \"Howard Lutnick has betrayed the trust I placed in him\" by \"taking advantage of my current medical condition\" to \"declare himself the sole managing general partner\" of the firm. \"I am actively reclaiming our company and ask for your support,\" the note continued. \"I will protect and restore our company, and your help will be forever appreciated.\" **********An accompanying typed letter, bearing the names of both Bernie and Iris Cantor, accused Mr. Lutnick of an \"unauthorized attempt to seize control,\" and added, \"This is not the succession plan we intended nor envisioned.\" **********Mr. Lutnick responded with a letter to the firm's partners on Monday, April 8: \"Those letters did not come from Bernie,\" he wrote. \"His physical and mental  condition rob him of the capacity to understand what is in them; his name is being misused by the one person who above all should honor it.\" Business would continue as usual, he continued, with him at the helm. \"Our management team remains intact and is performing superbly,\" he wrote. **********There matters stand as the case speeds toward trial on an expedited basis in  Wilmington next week. Armies of lawyers have been engaged on both sides. **********The Los Angeles firm of Munger, Tolles & Olson, best known for its links to the investment guru Warren Buffett, is representing Mrs. Cantor, with the help of Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell in Wilmington and the Kekst & Company public relations firm in New York. President Clinton's former legal counsel, Bernard Nussbaum of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, is leading Mr. Lutnick's team, along with the Delaware firm of Young, Conaway, Stargatt & Taylor. **********Several dozen people -- doctors, nurses, household help, Cantor family lawyers, partners at the firm -- have been summoned to give depositions in the case; boxes of legal documents, partnership records and correspondence have been demanded on both sides. **********Lately, there have been a few whispers among Mr. Lutnick's advisers about possible settlement talks, involving some deal for the other partners to buy Mrs. Cantor's stake in the firm. But the parties have not been able to agree on  a simple plan to maintain the status quo at the firm until the judge reaches a decision, so a truce in the core dispute seems like a long shot. **********So far, neither side has proposed bringing in an independent professional mediator who could perhaps turn down the emotional heat under this cauldron and  achieve a negotiated peace -- an approach that several family business specialists endorsed. \"That would be the ideal way to resolve something like this,\" said Mr. Starr of Coopers & Lybrand. **********What lies ahead for Cantor Fitzgerald? Any decision in the Delaware action is certain to be appealed, advisers on both sides agree. Given the various jurisdictions involved in the dispute -- the Cantor family partnership is registered in Nevada, Mr. Lutnick's company is incorporated in New York and the  Cantors live mainly in California -- new battles can be waged in other places after the Delaware action is concluded. \"We'll fight until Iris Cantor comes to  her senses,\" one of Mr. Lutnick's supporters said. **********While the battle for control of Cantor Fitzgerald may be an extreme example,  such fights are common at large, complicated partnerships -- and several consultants see the case as a cautionary tale for all family businesses that have not yet tackled the sensitive and potentially divisive issue of succession. **********But for those who assert devotion to Bernie Cantor but who are waging war on  each other in his name, the lesson to be drawn from the case may simply be that  the gates of hell, once opened, are not easily closed again."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/24/business/saks-and-isetan-plan-to-bid-for-barney-s.html": {"writer_name": "Jennifer Steinhauer", "pub_date": "1996-07-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 673, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Saks and Isetan Plan to Bid for Barney's", "print_headline": "Saks and Isetan Plan to Bid for Barney's", "body_text": " **********The suitors for Barneys New York are beginning to flirt openly. **********Saks Holdings Inc. said yesterday that it had joined the Isetan Company of Japan to create a proposed plan of reorganization for Barney's Inc., which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January.

Isetan, which paid for the costly construction of three Barneys stores in New York, Chicago and Beverly Hills, Calif., would lease these stores to Saks and continue to use the Barneys Asian trademark. **********\"We've been talking for quite a time in terms of the possible synergies of a  relationship together and decided there obviously are some,\" Philip B. Miller, the chairman of Saks, said in a telephone interview. **********Barney's executives yesterday seemed deeply displeased with the idea, issuing this statement: \"We are outraged that Isetan has entered into an agreement with  Saks that interferes with Barney's negotiations with Saks and other prospective  investors during the company's exclusive period.\" The exclusive period is the time given to companies in Chapter 11 to devise their own reorganization plans. **********The person with knowledge of the bankruptcy case, who spoke on the condition  of anonymity, said yesterday that while Saks may be more open about its intentions, other retailers have also expressed interest in Barney's. Among them are Canadian and Parisian companies, as well as Dickson Concepts Holdings Ltd.,  a Hong Kong-based retailer, that have already gone to Blackstone to sign a confidentiality agreement. **********\"There are a host of people interested in making an investment,\" this person  said. \"Dickson is the furthest along on the curve.\" Dickson executives have been circumspect about their true intentions, but do not deny their interest. **********Saks could be a good fit for Barneys, if it were able to keep the two stores  distinguishable. Such a retail merger could also offer economies of scale and operational consolidations that would benefit Saks. And Barneys, which is best known for its excellent merchandise team, could gain from Investcorp's long history of fixing up luxury merchants. **********\"What Barneys says are its sales and gross margin are great,\" said Lisa Stern, an analyst at M. J. Whitman, which specializes in distressed securities.  \"With financial and operational discipline, you can have a fabulous business.\" **********There is the question of how Saks, which went public just this spring with $945 million in long-term debt, would pay for Barney's. \"I don't think we have the answer to how to pay for it,\" Mr. Miller said. \"Obviously, the main issue for us is that this adds value to the Saks enterprise and for our shareholders.  We have not determined what the currency will be.\" He said that some amount could be paid for in Saks stock. **********But the biggest unanswered question is what, if any, role Bob and Gene Pressman, the brothers who share the title of chief executive of Barney's, would play in a new company. **********\"The view in the market is that somebody else is going to end up with this company,\" Ms. Stern said. \"On the one hand, you don't need the Pressmans as operators because they are terrible at that, but do you need them as merchants?

''We're counting on everyone to act responsibly, and maybe we're counting on too much.'' **********Most of Bosnia is still essentially in three pieces, each controlled by a single ethnic group that wants to keep out refugees from other groups.

A Muslim refugee from Srebrenica, for instance, will have to somehow get to the Muslim town of Kladanj, then wait for a bus ride to the outskirts of Srebrenica, well over an hour away. **********The round trip, and the time waiting to vote, will take nearly five hours, according to United Nations officials. Then the voter will have to somehow get home again. **********There had been considerable concern by foreign officials that once some voters were taken near their former homes, they would try to stay. **********Even though the peace agreement gives people the right to move freely in Bosnia, most people have not been able to go home, and voters using the buses will be required to leave as soon as they have voted. **********In a few towns, Muslim refugees will be voting very near to where Serbian refugees are being brought in from Yugoslavia. **********The confusion, and the fear of violence may keep the number of voters low, especially refugee voters. **********With refugees clamoring for information at the front door to his building, an Bosnian official, Fuad Ekmecic, opened today's newspaper looking for help. **********''I have nothing official, no information,'' he said.

You've socked away every stray penny in retirement accounts, resisting the temptation to live it up, in order to accumulate a comfy nest egg. Now it's payoff time: Hawaii beckons. But all the aging spendthrifts -- the folks who bought fishing boats instead of mutual funds -- persuade Congress to tax your savings and slash your Social Security checks in order to spread the wealth. **********A far-fetched prospect in the home of the free and the land of the 401(k)? Don't be so sure. For while the baby boom generation's slowly building retirement crisis could be resolved in a variety of ways, punishing the thrifty  will always be a tempting option in a world of too many old people chasing too few condos in the sun. **********At one extreme, Washington might resolve the conflict between the boomers' expectations and the nation's fiscal realities by reneging on the promises of retirement benefits that it cannot easily underwrite. If it does, it might start by limiting benefits or raising taxes and financial penalties on those who have  saved significant amounts. At the other extreme, the baby boomers may gang up on the next generation of workers, heavily increasing taxes to sustain Social Security and Medicare. Conceivably, though, a middle ground could be found that  encourages or forces most Americans to save more and thereby softens the blow to both generations. **********The truly affluent will always be able to fend for themselves, and poor retirees will probably be protected -- few people, after all, are prepared to let granny eat Gravy Train. \"It's the retirees in the middle who are most vulnerable\" to falling short of their expectations, argues Sylvester Schieber, an economist at Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a pension consulting firm, \"the people with incomes between $50,000 and $100,000.\" **********Practically everybody has an inkling that the retirement of the big generation born in the first two decades after World War II will strain the nation's resources. But the magnitude of the problem has yet to sink in. Between 1990 and 2030 the number of Americans over 65 will double, while the working-age population will grow by just 25 percent. Hence just 2.8 workers will be around to produce the goods and services consumed by each 65-plus retiree, compared with 4.8 workers today. **********Gilding this poisonous lily, the elderly population will be, on average, considerably older than it is today, and a greater percentage will need custodial care. **********Not every analyst paints the boomers' retirement prospects in shades of black. Three years ago a Congressional Budget Office study concluded that the baby boomers were actually a bit ahead of their parents' generation in accumulating assets for retirement. But for William Beeman, director of economic studies at the Committee for Economic Development, a policy group financed by business, any sense of relief disappeared after a look at the fine print. **********For one thing, he said, the boomers have a higher living standard -- and, presumably, higher expectations for retirement -- than their parents did in midlife. So merely saving on their parents' track will not take the boomers as far as they want to go. For another, the study assumed that today's workers would enjoy the Social Security and Medicare benefits provided under the current law. But that is hardly likely: projecting current tax and spending policies into the future, another, more recent C.B.O. study estimates that the budget deficit will rise from 2.2 percent of gross domestic product in 1995 to an astonishing 37 percent in 2030. **********Douglas Bernheim, an economist at Stanford University and consultant to Merrill Lynch, offers sobering confirmation. Each year he constructs an index of retirement-savings adequacy based on Merrill Lynch's survey of 2,000 baby-boom households. The latest, based on the November 1995 survey, puts the index at just 36, where 100 would be sufficient to sustain the living standard the boomers are expected to enjoy in their last working years. **********Wait -- it gets worse. The figure assumes that taxes will not go up and Social Security benefits will not go down. But if income taxes were raised by 63 percent in 2009 -- and that is what it would take to balance the Federal budget  through raising taxes alone from then on, according to an estimate by Lawrence Kotlikoff of Boston University and Alan Auerbach of the University of California at Berkeley -- the retirement index slips to 27. Alternatively, if the fiscal accounts were balanced exclusively through a 70 percent across-the-board cut in  Social Security benefits, the index would fall to just 15. **********These numbers are averages, reflecting the inadequacy of the entire generation's savings. Those who are prudent or lucky can expect to do much better. Using data from Watson Wyatt's own survey of corporate pension plans, Mr. Schieber calculated that workers covered for 30 years by both traditional \"defined benefit\" pension plans of average generosity and 401(k)-style \"defined  contribution\" plans can expect to retire with incomes equal to about 60 percent  of their preretirement wage. That, plus Medicare, Social Security and modest personal savings, should be sufficient to sustain their preretirement living standard. **********The catch, apart from the problematic nature of Government entitlements and the risk of higher taxes down the road, is that relatively few workers can boast of such belt-and-suspenders security. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, only about half of all private-sector employees aged 30 to 50 participated in any sort of retirement plan in 1993. What is more, while the percentage of the work force with some retirement coverage has remained roughly the same, there has been a sharp shift in the last decade from traditional-pension to 401(k)-style plans. **********In theory, there is nothing wrong with retirement accounts that give workers  discretion to invest their own assets instead of having their employers do it. In practice, though, they tend to invest far too conservatively to take advantage of the gains from investing in the stock market over the long haul. **********And a variety of rules, imposed by Congress in recent years in the scramble to limit revenue loss so that tax rates would not have to be raised, limit the amounts that can be socked away. Worse, many workers in 401(k)-style plans give  in to temptation and spend the money before they need it in retirement. **********While the laws of politics suggest that Washington will duck Social Security  and Medicare finance issues as long as possible, the laws of arithmetic guarantee a day of reckoning. Just how the chips will fall from this multitrillion-dollar collision between expectations and reality is anyone's guess. But a handful of possibilities are now being debated, some of them in Washington and some only in ivory towers. **********You Did Well, So You Lose! **********The trustees of the Social Security System estimate that revenues will fall short of scheduled outlays by about 30 percent between 2019 and 2043. Mr. Schieber argues that this projection is optimistic; he reckons that it will take a 40 percent across-the-board cut in outlays to balance the books without tax increases. **********Cuts would not necessarily be across the board. More likely, retirees who had saved more would take a bigger hit in order to keep those near the bottom out of poverty. This could be done directly by limiting or eliminating Social Security  benefits for those with more than a certain income. Or it could be done indirectly by taxing more heavily the nonwage income, like interest and dividends, of affluent retirees. Or it could be done by lowering the amount that can be withdrawn annually from retirement-plan savings without financial penalty. Even today, people who have accumulated large amounts in their retirement accounts and who make excessive withdrawals (currently $155,000 a year) pay penalties to the Government. The levels that constitute an excess amount could be reduced, or at least not allowed to rise with inflation, punishing the people who have saved to help those who have not. **********Those who expect this soak-the-prudent strategy could presumably sustain their living standards by redoubling their savings effort. But to make up for a 60 percent cut in Social Security, Mr. Schieber calculates, middle-income workers would have to save an extra 4 percent of their income over 30 years -- an astoundingly high figure, given that the average family saves less than 5 percent of its income today. **********So Washington will likely seek other ways to cut the system's liabilities. Of these, Mr. Beeman reckons that raising the age of eligibility for full pension benefits is \"the least unpalatable.\" After all, the life expectancy of 65-year-olds has risen by five years in the last 50 years, and the number of extra years Americans can expect to enjoy in good health has risen at least in proportion. **********But under the 1983 amendments to the Social Security law that promised to guarantee the system's solvency for three-quarters of a century, many boomers already face an increase in the age of eligibility for full benefits, to 66 in the year 2020 and 67 in the year 2030. In any case, the very idea bucks the trend toward ever-earlier retirement in wealthy industrialized countries. **********Mr. Bernheim points to a less noticed but more important obstacle: Keeping older workers on the job for the extra years needed to ease the retirement squeeze would increase workplace tensions. It is customary to increase pay as workers' tenure rises, he notes, even though their productivity typically begins to fall in their 50's. That explains why many employers are eager to ease out employees by their early 60's, and why they would resist efforts to solve the retirement-finance problem by keeping aging workers on the job a few years more. \"Just because somebody wants to work doesn't mean they will be able to,\" Mr. Bernheim argued. **********Delaying retirement does not require a mandate from Washington. When 65-year-olds discover they cannot afford full-time leisure, they may cling to their jobs or look for others. It already seems to be happening in the Sun Belt, where 60-somethings are returning to the labor force in increasing numbers. But  the free-market fix will not make everyone happy. **********\"Many of these 'second careers' are flipping hamburgers,\" Mr. Schieber noted. **********The most serious objection to reducing or delaying Government benefits may be the disincentive to personal saving. Until 1991 Australia relied on a national pension system that used a stiff means test to sort retirees in need from those  who could pay their own way. But the system's cost ballooned under the weight of a perverse incentive to depend on the state. \"It became fashionable to spend down your personal savings to become eligible for a public pension,\" Mr. Schieber said, much as it has become commonplace in America for the elderly to give away their wealth in order to become eligible for nursing-home care under the means-tested Medicaid program. **********Just Shift the Burden **********The boomers are, in effect, paying for the retirement of their parents by keeping Social Security and Medicare afloat with their payroll taxes. Why not ask their children to do the same for them? For that matter, why ask? Why not just use the weight of boomers' votes to force them? **********That approach has a certain realpolitik appeal, but there are problems. For starters, the tax increases needed to cover the costs would probably be enormous. Mr. Schieber estimates that it would take a 40 percent increase in payroll taxes, starting now, to square Social Security's accounts without reducing benefits. If Congress waits -- a sure bet -- the numbers would quickly  become staggering. **********How staggering? **********Mr. Kotlikoff and Mr. Auerbach calculate the extreme case. Under current law, they estimate, Americans who are now working will pay about 34 percent of their  lifetime wages in taxes. If, however, everyone alive in 1993 were exempted from  the extra taxes needed to pay for currently mandated services, the hapless people born after 1993 would have to pay 84 percent of their wages in taxes. **********One way to soften the blow would be to invite more young, taxpaying immigrants to join the American work force. But Mr. Beeman notes that to get much bang from an extra green card the immigration laws would have to be made more selective, admitting more working-age immigrants with lots of earning power and few dependents. **********And the numbers would have to be huge to make a material difference. The Committee for Economic Development calculates that in 2030, some 110 million workers would have to be added to a projected labor force of 160 million to restore the worker-retiree ratio to 1990 levels. \"Immigration could be part of the answer,\" Mr. Beeman concluded, \"but not much of it.\" **********Saved by the Savings **********This is the handy-dandy, all-purpose solution for those eager to avoid a showdown between the generations. **********Savings translates into bricks and mortar and productivity-enhancing machines. So if savings were higher -- everybody's savings, not just the boomers' -- national income would eventually grow faster and the sacrifice required to support the elderly in the style they see as their due would shrink. But wishing won't make it happen. \"There's a lot of talk, but I don't see any basis for believing that savings is rising,\" said Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution. **********The Committee for Economic Development offers a laundry list of regulatory changes that could made a difference. High on the list is a reduction in the cost of administering defined-benefit contribution pension plans, which according to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation now run to $455 a year per employee for small companies. If that cost were cut sharply, maybe more companies would offer such plans. **********The pension consultants are also enthusiastic about the simplest of fixes, namely more aggressive efforts by employers to inform midcareer workers of the pressing need to save for retirement. \"Education does work -- especially one-on-one counseling,\" Mr. Bernheim said. **********Tax incentives to save -- in particular, liberalized retirement savings accounts -- are also perennial favorites. But Robert Litan, director of economic studies at Brookings, points to the Achilles' heel of virtually all these tax carrots. A substantial portion of the money going into tax-sheltered accounts, he argues, would have been saved anyway. And even if the incentive to save is relatively effective it still reduces tax revenue, which in turn makes it more difficult to reduce the budget deficit. **********Mr. Litan has proposed a novel way around this problem: requiring middle- and upper-income families to save a minimum percentage of their income, with severe  tax penalties for noncompliance. But he acknowledges that this is a political nonstarter. **********There are subtler means, though, toward this same end. Since 1991 Australia has had a mandatory retirement-saving system, to which employers and employees will eventually be required to contribute a total of 12 percent of wages. The savings accounts, which work much the way 401(k) plans do, are portable from job to job. **********Edward M. Gramlich, an economist at the University of Michigan who heads the  Social Security system's advisory commission, wants to try something similar in  the United States, supplementing the existing Social Security system with mandatory individual retirement savings accounts financed by an additional few percentage points of payroll tax. \"The attraction,\" Mr. Litan noted, \"is that workers would identify the money as their own,\" rather than just another tax that disappears into the black hole of Social Security. **********Every proposed solution to the retirement-finance crisis would meet objections, and for good reason: someone must pay. But one way or another, the cupboard must be replenished or the next generation of retirees must learn to do without. Once this message really gets across, perhaps sweet reason will prevail. \"Attitudes could change,\" Mr. Bernheim concluded, \"as people become more desperate.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/21/world/the-battle-cry-reform-rocks-the-house-of-lords.html": {"writer_name": "John Darnton", "pub_date": "1996-04-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1376, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Battle Cry 'Reform!'

Then a workman appears with a pocket full of thick one-penny copper coins. He deftly dangles from a railing and carefully adds or subtracts a penny from a tiny pile on top of the 13-foot pendulum, thereby gaining or losing two-fifths of a second over the course of 24 hours. **********Down below, the Houses of Parliament run much the same way as the clock. Nothing fancy, nothing digital, and when something needs fixing give it a rap on the knuckles or a smidgeon of oil. After all, it has been working for 731 years. **********So it's a bit surprising that the Labor Party, flexing its muscles as it contemplates winning an election within the next year, is preparing to tackle one of the most delicate and intractable political issues in Britain: reforming  the House of Lords. **********\"It's bizarre that we are the only legislature anywhere in the world in which there is a substantial number of people who are hereditary peers, the vast majority of whom are Conservative, that are entitled to vote just on the basis of birth,\" Tony Blair, the party leader, said in an interview. \"And from time to time they have considerable impact on legislation.\" **********As every schoolchild knows, the House of Lords has been gradually emasculated over the years, leading Gilbert and Sullivan to pen the saucy line that it \"did  nothing in particular and did it very well.\" Its vestigial power lies in the capacity to delay bills passed by the House of Commons for one year. But in practice it operates as a revising body, reworking the raw bills from the lower  chamber and filling in the details and closing the loopholes. **********\"The Commons is not superlative when it comes to nuts and bolts,\" remarked Ivor Richard, a life baron who is the Lords Labor leader. **********The upper chamber includes hereditary peers, who inherit the right to sit there along with their titles; life peers (appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Prime Minister), and 26 bishops and archbishops from the Church of England. **********It has long attracted humorous jibes. Lord Beaverbrook, the statesman and newspaper magnate, called it \"the house of make-believe.\" And Winston Churchill, in his fiery younger days, said it was \"filled with old doddering peers, cute financial magnates, clever wirepullers, big brewers with bulbous noses.\" **********Since 1968, when Labor's last big push to undermine the symbolic seat of privilege went down to ignominious defeat, some 34 bills to change the Lords have died at various stages. But this time Labor says it is serious. The first step, according to Mr. Blair, is to take away voting rights from the hereditary  peers who make up about three-fifths of the active body. **********But Mr. Blair is vague when it comes to talking about the second stage of reform, turning the Lords into an elected body. Backtracking from more radical pledges, Labor now says that this is a project for the far future, that it is a  subject that needs consensus and perhaps even a royal commission to sort it out. **********Since the middle of the last century, the occasional reformist gust has swept through Westminister's fabled upper house. There have been some notable advances, like the 1958 law that created life peerages, which cannot be passed on to descendants, and that also allowed women to take seats. But more often than not the winds of change dissipate into nothingness as they blow through the ornately carved Gothic chamber with its statues, frescoes and stained-glass windows. **********Through it all, the House of Lords endures, something of a cross between a genteel debating society and a well-appointed gentlemen's club, the bane of constitutional modernizers, the only feudal remnant in Europe in which an octogenarian can dine, snooze on television and vote because an ancestor won the king's favor back in the 13th century. **********Everyone except the most dyed-in-the-wool Tory will acknowledge privately that things must change. After all, the anomaly is striking of a legislature that debates the Maastricht Treaty on European Union one minute and the next tries to untangle the tricky question of who should succeed Lord Moynihan, who died five years ago while running a string of massage parlors in the Philippines -- his half-brother, an Olympic rower, or the 5-year-old boy who is said to be his son by a belly dancer? **********The problem is in agreeing upon what the House of Lords should change into. Few people seem to want a one-chamber Parliament. But if the upper chamber is retained and democratically elected, how should its members be chosen? By regions? By countries -- meaning England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland?  What is to prevent it from rivaling the House of Commons? **********Each new proposal to change it only reveals how deeply embedded it is in the  fabric of national government, a jigsaw puzzle piece that can't be rearranged without disturbing those around it. **********Boosters of the Lords -- and there are many -- say it functions as a sort of  legislative pause for a rethinking. They point out that its debates are elegant, non-adversarial and informative and sometimes lead to significant amendments. They insist that many of the life peers have a depth of expertise from earlier careers and that a number of the hereditary peers have eclectic backgrounds surpassing those of the homogeneous lawyers and other professionals that crowd the Commons. **********In fact, they are a varied lot. The roll call has the occasional ring of history: there is the 13th Lord Byron (a solicitor) and the 9th Lord Nelson (a retired police detective sergeant). Some of the once aristocratic families have  fallen on hard times and others use their wealth to pursue private passions. One lord was a shelf-stuffer in a supermarket and another was a bus driver (he is on the transportation committee). A third, who has gone off to Australia, lists his occupation as \"rabbit salesman, used-car dealer and encyclopedia salesman.\" One  lady is a fortune-teller named Lady Strange, who is given to reciting poetry in  her speeches, which sometimes refer to supernatural phenomena. **********Bankruptcy is ground for losing the right to attend -- a prospect two lords are currently facing -- though other misdeeds seem to be tolerated. Scandal is not unknown in the chamber. But the house is not looking forward to the day when it will get a specialist in prisons -- the Marquess of Blandford, who has a lengthy record of committing forgery, assaulting policemen, possessing cocaine and failing to pay child support, and will be entitled to wear the ermine collar of a lord as the 12th Duke of Marlborough. **********Altogether there are 1,199 lords, including 151 who have never taken up office or are on leave. Of the rest, 400 are life peers, 622 are hereditary peers and 26 are \"lords spiritual,\" archbishops and bishops of the Church of England. The body tends to be Conservative, because so many of the hereditary peers (332) are Conservative and so few (13) are Labor. A significant number of  the lords -- 287 -- are \"cross benchers,\" without party affiliation. **********The tilt to the right shows up in the voting record. During years when the Conservatives are in power, the Lords almost always vote with the Government, and when Labor is in power they usually vote against it. **********As an example of their impact on legislation, Mr. Blair cited the poll tax pushed through by the Thatcher Government in 1988, a community charge for local  services.

One thing at least is certain: Hedge fund managers in the 1990s have made a name for themselves in the financial markets and the wider world. **********That the epithets applied to them are not always polite is partly because of the great European Exchange Rate Mechanism spree of 1992.In the autumn of that year, the foreign exchange markets \u2014 with hedge funds in the vanguard \u2014 \u2014 went on a gigantic spree at the expense of the ERM. Today, some observers are asking whether the political and technical problems facing European Monetary Union \u2014 the merging of European currencies, and the next step forward from the ERM \u2014 will provide too tempting a target. **********During the ERM debacle a succession of European currencies were either forced out of the grid of exchange rate parities (the British pound and the Italian lire) or were forced to \"realign\" themselves by devaluing and trying to hold a lower rate (the Spanish peseta and the Irish punt). **********One prominent hedge fund manager, George Soros, made some dollars 1.5 billion by using aggressive derivatives positions to bet on a sharp fall in the value of the pound. The question now being asked is whether something similar will occur to the French franc's value against the Deutsche mark before 1999, when the currencies participating in the ERM are expected to join in the single European currency. **********If the franc and the Deutsche mark were not to be joined in what is to be called the Euro, it is generally accepted that EMU would be less of a union of currencies than a\"mark zone,\" including the Dutch guilder and the Belgian franc, which are closely associated with the Deutsche mark. **********Individuals, therefore, who are thinking about a hedge fund investment and are impressed by the clever hedge fund management of 1992 and 1993 (when, among other things, the markets had a summer run against the French franc) should ask themselves a few questions: **********First, is there a general perception that the French franc \u2014 or other significant currencies within the EMU core \u2014 is vulnerable to sustained selling? **********If so, and EMU is thereby effectively prevented from occurring, what will be the major financial consequences? **********Finally, how important is the role of the hedge funds? Specifically, do hedge fund managers exert such influence \u2014 directly through their buying power, or indirectly through their reputations \u2014 to influence the markets simply by advertising their investment decisions? **********Will the markets sell the franc? **********\"There is a growing possibility that the French administration has done it. They've survived all the major political storms of 1995, in particular the December strike,\" said Nick Knight, head of strategy at Nomura Research Institute Europe. \"Before selling pressure builds, the markets will need to see a greater visibility of failure to deliver on the budget deficit limits as specified in the Maastricht treaty.\" **********Ciaran O'Hagan, an analyst at J.P. Morgan in Paris, argued that the French government had \"for the moment, at least, got away with it.The resolution of the December strike had minimal budgetary implications for 1996 or 1997.\" **********Michael Goldman, London-based managing director of Momentum Asset Management, which has 10 diverse hedge funds under management, added that he did not believe the franc was in imminent danger of coming under attack: \"People are long of German government bonds and several have been buying the mark and shorting the franc. But those are long-term positions that have been held for some months.\" **********Mr. Goldman cited the gold, oil and dollar-yen rate markets as the most active among hedge fund managers. **********But from January 1996 to January 1999 is an eternity in the volatile currency markets, and few can rule out a speculative attack on the franc in that time. **********Mr. Knight at Nomura identified an aura of returning confidence about the hedge fund industry that might lead to more aggressive strategies in the medium-term future: \"Hedge funds had a great 1993, a very poor 1994, and quite a few enjoyed 1995, especially the second half. So self-confidence is returning, and we may see hedge funds as a more potent force in 1996 and after that they begin to throw their weight around again.\" **********What will be the likely financial consequences? **********The Zurich-based Bank Julius Baer published a booklet, \"Scenarios for European Monetary Union,\" at the end of last year in which it rated the likelihood of EMU's not going ahead at 30 percent. The bank argued that if EMU did not occur or were to be postponed for several years, European interest rates generally would fall, with \"significantly greater devaluation in the soft currency countries.\" **********By \"soft currencies\" the bank means denominations such as the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo and the Greek drachma. Its assumptions are predicated on its assertion that EMU \"stands or falls on the Frenco-German axis.\" If the unlikely occurs, therefore, a significant fall in the value of the franc should also be assumed. **********Mr. O'Hagan at J.P. Morgan also regarded the achievement of EMU as more likely than not: \"EMU has two chances in three of occurring. Partly because, little by little, the European Commission is beginning to work out a consensus on the legal difficulties involved.\" **********Mr. O'Hagan cautioned against the automatic assumption that the proposed Euro currency would instantly take over as a unit of account from the ECU basket of currencies. Although this positive development seemed likely in Germany, he said that the replacement of one unit by the other was one of many legal problems yet to be solved. **********How important are the hedge funds? **********Acting with typical alacrity, a Congressional committee hearing was called into the activities of hedge funds on hearing of Mr. Soros' successful sterling play in the fall of 1992. Mr. Soros was asked to give evidence before the committee in April 1994, at which time he argued that hedge funds were a stabilizing force in the market, since they tended to bet against irrational investment decisions and erratic capital flows. He also argued that, in the overall context of the market, hedge funds were simply too small to have a major impact on currency rates. **********This point of view is, by implication, shared by Charles R. Taylor in a paper on currency and option intervention published in October by the London-based Center for the Study of Financial Innovation. Mr. Taylor argues that derivatives \u2014 the favorite securities of the hedge fund managers \u2014 are really a form of insurance, and that governments seeking to protect an exchange rate would be well-advised to make use of these instruments themselves. **********Mr. Goldman at Momentum agreed that the effect of hedge funds was generally overrated, but he added that once a hedge fund manager had a following in the market, his decisions would be copied and their effect multiplied by the \"herd mentality.\" Nevertheless, it was difficult to envisage hedge funds leading an assault on a currency so as to derail EMU."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/18/business/futures-markets-crude-oil-prices-settle-higher-despite-speculation-on-iraq-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 346, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FUTURES MARKETS;Crude Oil Prices Settle Higher Despite Speculation on Iraq Deal", "print_headline": "FUTURES MARKETS;Crude Oil Prices Settle Higher Despite Speculation on Iraq Deal", "body_text": " **********Crude oil prices settled higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, after plunging early in the day, as traders bet that stockpiles are so low that even a limited oil sale by Iraq would be absorbed by the world market. **********On other markets, corn prices also rebounded from an early dip, and coffee rose. **********Speculation that Iraq was close to an agreement with the United Nations that would allow it to sell as much as $2 billion of crude oil over six months sent crude prices plunging on Tuesday and early yesterday.

Chernomyrdin. **********Mr. Yeltsin will still hold onto the nuclear button, the President's spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said. But in a move that seemed partly aimed at curbing the ambitions of the national security adviser, Aleksandr I. Lebed, the ministers of defense, foreign affairs, intelligence and the interior, who normally report to the President, will now report to Mr. Chernomyrdin. **********As the ailing Mr. Yeltsin, 65, prepares for bypass surgery this month, the Kremlin is struggling to lock in the chain of command and contain a power struggle that picked up steam when Mr. Yeltsin acknowledged last week that he would undergo heart surgery. **********The Russian Constitution says that  if the President dies or is incapacitated, the Prime Minister takes over as Acting President until new elections are held within three months. **********While the decision today confirmed that Mr. Chernomyrdin will run things if Mr. Yeltsin cannot, it did not settle who, if anyone, will receive Mr. Yeltsin's blessing to run in the next presidential race, which given his health could occur well before his term ends in the year 2000. **********As Mr. Yeltsin has receded from public view, the three men most likely to compete to succeed him have suddenly sprung up all over the place, doing things that look eerily like the first steps of a presidential campaign. **********Mr. Lebed is seeking peace in Chechnya by noisily declaring war on vested interests in the Kremlin. **********The powerful Mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, has recently begun voicing strong views on foreign policy and national security matters, and vividly attacked Mr. Lebed last week, denouncing his peace plan for Chechnya as ''capitulation to armed bandits.'' **********And the stiff, buttoned-down Mr. Chernomyrdin suddenly left Moscow last week to attend the opening of a newly restored Russian Orthodox Church in his home village, Chorny Otrog, accompanied by the Patriarch Aleksy II. Mr. Chernomyrdin, wearing a tie and a borrowed workman's jacket, also drove a harvester and talked about his log cabin roots. **********Russians are suddenly talking openly about political life after Yeltsin, weighing scenarios and evaluating the various candidates' chances. **********''Now, when the President's illness is known and nobody knows when the next presidential campaign will be, the question of who will be the next President has become legitimate,'' said Vyacheslav A. Nikonov, a political consultant who worked on Mr. Yeltsin's re-election campaign this year. **********But he warned that unless or until Mr. Yeltsin anoints someone as his chosen successor, ''they will also start running against each other -- and create enough division and chaos for a Communist revanche.'' **********The decision today reined in Mr. Lebed, who had received and asserted sweeping powers over a wide range of national security issues. Mr. Lebed, who has brokered a controversial peace agreement in the secessionist republic of Chechnya, is Mr. Chernomyrdin's main rival for influence inside the Kremlin -- and in the next presidential race. **********Mr. Lebed will continue to report directly to the President, according to the Kremlin. But Mr. Chernomyrdin, who usually oversees the economy and social issues, was given additional authority to decide national security and military matters. **********The Kremlin did not give any details about how long Mr. Chernomyrdin will be in charge or whether he will take over in full during the actual operation. Mr. Yastrzhembsky did not even say exactly when the operation would take place. **********Mr. Yeltsin, who for a long time fiercely resisted any talk of undergoing heart surgery, does not seem eager to contemplate a political landscape stripped of his presence. Today he did not anoint Mr. Chernomyrdin as his chosen successor -- he mainly seemed intent on temporarily lending his power to someone he could trust to return it. **********''Chernomyrdin is loyal,'' an official close to the Kremlin said. ''The President trusts Chernomyrdin, he can be secure that while he is in hospital, Mr. Chernomyrdin will not use the pause in his functioning to become a de facto president.'' **********Mr. Chernomyrdin proved his loyalty today by refusing to view himself as an acting president. ''For me this means that he will remain President even during the operation and during the entire course of medical treatment,'' Mr. Chernomyrdin told reporters. He described a transfer of power as ''far-fetched and tactless.'' **********Mr. Lebed did not comment on the transfer today, and it was not clear how informed he was of the decision ahead of time. His spokesman said  the National Security Council's press service learned of the decision only when it was announced by the news agencies. **********When Mr. Yeltsin announced that he would undergo a major heart operation, many politicians began demanding that he formally transfer his responsibilities to the Prime Minister during the operation and until he recovers. **********Mr. Lebed was among the most vehement. He seemed mostly worried that without such a formal transfer, the President's chief of staff, Anatoly B. Chubais, would in effect run the Kremlin. **********Mr. Chubais has not hid his coolness toward Mr. Lebed, who has not hidden his intention to run for the presidency as soon as he gets a chance. Mr. Chubais is too unpopular with voters to run for President, but he is very popular with the bankers and financiers who bankrolled Mr. Yeltsin's re-election effort; his support would be essential to any establishment candidate seeking to succeed Mr. Yeltsin. **********Kremlin aides say the chief of staff's relationship with Mr. Chernomyrdin has so far been fairly smooth and conciliatory, but Mr. Chubais has been careful to not appear totally in the Prime Minister's pocket. Last week Mr. Chubais told reporters that Mr. Luzhkov might soon be granted an audience with Mr. Yeltsin, who has remained secluded at a Government hunting lodge 60 miles from Moscow. **********Mr. Chubais's relationship with Mr. Luzhkov has been stormy. When Mr. Chubais headed the Government's privatization program, the Mayor rejected it and devised one of his own for Moscow. **********Political experts in Moscow interpreted the invitation to Mr. Luzhkov as an attempt to repair Mr. Chubais's relations with the powerful Mayor, who is close to influential Russian bankers and businessmen. **********Some suspected that Mr. Chernomyrdin's future prospects were enhanced by today's decision. ''He's getting presidential experience,'' Mr. Nikonov said. ''No one else has that.'' **********The Communists, who had vehemently demanded that Mr. Yeltsin identify a constitutional successor, have also kept a close eye on the political maneuvering on the other side of the aisle. **********''In Russia, it is unethical to talk about a presidential race when the President is sick,'' said Aleksandr Shabanov, the chief ideologist of the Communist Party. ''But there are figures who are acting publicly like politicians, which is natural under the circumstances.'' **********Mr. Shabanov said his party would not identify its future candidate until elections are announced. But he said that Gennadi A. Zyuganov, Mr. Yeltsin's unsuccessful Communist challenger in the presidential election, ''is the only and recognized leader of the opposition.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/06/business/international-briefs-pharmacia-upjohn-to-cut-10-of-jobs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Pharmacia & Upjohn To Cut 10% of Jobs", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Pharmacia & Upjohn To Cut 10% of Jobs", "body_text": " **********Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc. confirmed yesterday that it would trim its work force by 4,000, about 10 percent, and set up headquarters near London.

Two of the leaders, in a marked departure from usual Islamic practice, were women. **********The program they presented generally followed the militant Islamic line, rejecting the \"unjust\" Israeli-Palestinian treaties, declaring Palestine to be an \"Islamic, Arab and Palestinian\" land with Jerusalem as its capital, and proclaiming Islam as the \"solution for all problems.\" **********But the party also declared that its means for achieving its ends was \"legal  political struggle,\" and that it acknowledges religious, cultural and political  pluralism. **********The statement concluded by saying, \"Our compliments are to the chairman Arafat and to everyone who has financially and spiritually supported the establishment of our party.\" **********Mr. Arafat is expected to give the party representation on his executive committee, or Cabinet, and the party is certain to run in municipal elections expected in summer or fall. **********There was no way to predict how much support the new party might attract. But the potential was large because Islam is strong in Gaza, while Hamas has lost standing since Mr. Arafat has taken charge. Hamas also is currently in disarray, with most of its political leaders in jail and its international sources of financing threatened. **********At today's session of the Palestinian Legislative Council, there was speculation among deputies that Mr. Arafat would channel money to the party to enhance its standing, and thus further isolate Hamas. **********There was no immediate comment on the new party in Israel. **********-------------------- **********More Suicide Bombs Threatened **********BEIRUT, Lebanon, March 21 (AP) -- The Party of God's \"human bombs battalion\" will carry out more suicide bombings to force Israeli troops from southern Lebanon, the leader of the Iranian-backed group said today. **********The leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, spoke a day after a suicide bomber charged into an Israeli Army convoy in southern Lebanon, killing an Israeli captain along with himself, and wounding seven others."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/24/business/treasury-auction-and-other-offerings-planned-this-week.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-06-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 662, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasury Auction And Other Offerings Planned This Week", "print_headline": "Treasury Auction And Other Offerings Planned This Week", "body_text": " **********The Treasury's schedule of financings this week consists of bills and notes,  beginning with today's regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills.

Equipment makers and broadcasters worked for eight years to develop a new standard for advanced digital television broadcasting. **********As recently as early summer, it appeared assured that the F.C.C. would adopt both the resulting ''Grand Alliance'' technical standard and the allocation of spectrum to broadcasters, the two prerequisites to move the country toward digital broadcasting. **********Enter Microsoft. Arguing that the standard under consideration could hinder the computer industry's future use of broadcast spectrum, Microsoft set about making its objections clear to the Clinton Administration, Congress and the F.C.C. The television industry quickly retorted that the standard would advance the computer industry's entry into broadcasting by digitizing transmissions and allowing data to be sent while video is played. **********Microsoft organized around a July 11 counterproposal by the Computer Industry Coalition on Advanced Television Service, a group backed by Apple Computer Inc., the Intel Corporation and the Compaq Computer Corporation, as well as Microsoft. The coalition proposed a video system technology now used by the computer industry, which is not wholly compatible with current broadcasting systems. The proposal also abandoned the superior high-definition picture quality that was the original goal of advanced television. **********At the end of July, Microsoft joined the three high-technology companies and several film industry organizations, including Dreamworks SKG, the Directors Guild of America and the International Photographers Guild, in a new lobbying organization called Americans for Better Digital TV. **********In one of the group's first press releases, William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, said, ''The standard being considered by the F.C.C. would stand in the way of future innovation and force consumers to use inferior technology over time.'' **********Craig Mundie, Microsoft's senior vice president for consumer platforms, said: ''A few months ago people said this train was coming down the track and couldn't be stopped. Now you could say it has slowed down and is approaching a switch. No one will predict when it will arrive at its originally planned station.'' **********As evidence, he points to a Sept. 27 speech by an F.C.C. commissioner, Susan Ness, one of the four people who will vote on the standard. In the speech, she reiterated her calls for setting a standard and then said, ''I have asked all the parties to sit down together to see if a joint recommendation can be made to the commission that will benefit all.'' **********Ms. Ness, through a spokesman, said that her words were not intended as a nod to Microsoft's position, but simply a plea for any discussions that could lead to speedy resolution of differences. **********In an interview on Friday, Ms. Ness's fellow commissioner, Rachelle B. Chong, offered another compromise: adoption of the ''Grand Alliance'' standard as it was proposed by the F.C.C. in May and then setting a time ''in the future to relook at the standard -- a technological reality checkpoint.'' **********Even Richard E. Wiley, who is in effect the godfather of the currently proposed standard because it evolved under his eight-year stewardship of the F.C.C.'s advisory committee on advanced television, has urged compromise, pointing out that television is an international business and that time-consuming squabbles among industries in this country give an advantage to overseas competitors. **********''This religious war should not continue to delay the establishment of a new standard,'' Mr. Wiley said in a speech recently. ''As we debate the issue in the United States, TV systems developed in Europe and elsewhere are being promoted in China, Latin America and other developing world markets.'' **********Television standards being promoted abroad are incompatible with the needs of the computer industry. Widespread adoption of these standards would foreclose opportunities for the United States computer industry overseas. **********The last delays on the standard had seemed to be over earlier this year, but two letters from officials in the Clinton Administration, in effect urging the F.C.C. to adopt the ''Grand Alliance'' standard, led to objections by Microsoft and its allies in the computer industry. **********Technically the issue is whether the 18 video formats specified in the standard should be retained. These include 14 formats in ''progressive'' scanning used in computers, in which lines are painted continuously down the screen, and 4 formats in ''interlaced'' scanning used in television today. Broadcasters insist that all these formats can be included in new digital receivers at minimal added cost. The computer industry wants fewer specifications for video, to leave room for other potential uses. **********Dozens of companies and laboratories spent an estimated $500 million testing systems for eight years to produce the ''Grand Alliance'' standard. Some of those who contributed to this effort were computer companies -- I.B.M. in particular. **********Ms. Ness and Ms. Chong, along with their colleague James H. Quello, have long publicly favored the ''Grand Alliance'' standard reflected in the Federal Register's notice of proposed rules. The commission chairman, Reed E. Hundt, who alone has the power to bring the issue up for a vote, has appeared ambivalent. **********In an interview last week, Mr. Hundt said if a standard were ''nonproprietary, dynamic and not static, and inclusive not exclusive, then I'd consider sprinkling regulatory holy water on it.'' **********''I wouldn't stand in the way of a vote,'' he continued, adding that his goal was ''to get it done by the end of the year, yes.'' **********The final lobbying push by Microsoft and its allies is infuriating some of the broadcasters. **********''Their counterproposal doesn't meet the needs of broadcasters; it doesn't provide full high-definition television capability on day one, nor is it based on a proven, tested system,'' said Robert Graves, chairman of the Advanced Television Systems Committee, an industry-wide group of the broadcast and consumer-electronics industries that had reviewed the standard and filed a brief supporting it with the F.C.C. **********''The television industry needs both to move ahead, and their proposal provides neither,'' Mr. Graves added. **********The continuing argument, long after the issue was to have been settled, has frustrated some Administration officials. ''People have been talking around each other and not to each other,'' said Larry Irving of the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration. **********''I've sat through six hours with representatives of all industries and dozens of hours with other players,'' he said, ''and we're still trying to get them to work together. The Administration has said repeatedly that we need an industry compromise.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/26/business/wrigley-plant-in-russia.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wrigley Plant in Russia", "print_headline": "Wrigley Plant in Russia", "body_text": " **********The Wm.

David L.

Mr. Threlkeld said in the letter that Mr. Hamanaka \"informed me  that we would find no record of the trades.\" Mr. Threlkeld said he declined to \"confirm details of nonexistent trades.\" **********Sumitomo offices in New York and London declined to comment, as did the London Metal Exchange. The Securities & Investment Board, a U.K. regulatory authority, said it had received the letter from the London exchange and was \"aware\" of the allegations. The Commodity Exchange acknowledged it had received  correspondence from Mr. Threlkeld but wouldn't say whether it was looking into the matter. **********In Tokyo, Mr. Hamanaka expressed his surprise at Mr. Threlkeld's action, saying, \"We are puzzled at the letter since we can't understand\" why Mr. Threlkeld wrote it. But he declined to comment for now, saying, \"we don't know yet what's going on.\" **********Copper for December delivery ended 2.05 cents a pound lower at 98.5 cents; the actively traded March contract fell 1.15 cents to 98.45 cents. The possibility of increased regulatory and public scrutiny of Mr. Hamanaka led traders to believe his trading activity -- which many believed had held up copper prices recently -- would be curtailed for a while."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/02/business/layaway-plan-helps-finance-a-new-generation-of-pcs-wireless-services.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Schiesel", "pub_date": "1996-12-02", "snippet": "Makers of equipment for new wireless voice and data networks known as personal communications services (PCS) are finding out what it is like to sell on credit; in few, if any, other industries must small companies make such large capital investmen...", "word_count": 804, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Layaway Plan Helps Finance a New Generation of P.C.S. Wireless Services", "print_headline": "Layaway Plan Helps Finance a New Generation of P.C.S. Wireless Services", "body_text": " **********When Sprint Spectrum wanted huge amounts of sophisticated electronic equipment to build a new national wireless telephone network, it went to the telecommunications equipment titans Lucent Technologies and Northern Telecom Ltd. Little surprise there. **********But when the venture needed billions of dollars to pay for the equipment, it did not get the money from the bond market, or commercial banks or even its owners -- Sprint and the large cable television operators Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast and Cox Enterprises. Instead, the company turned to Lucent and Northern Telecom, which this spring committed up to $3.1 billion in financing to help Sprint Spectrum buy their products. **********Think of it as a layaway plan for a corporate giant. Vendor financing is well known to consumers, who get car loans from auto companies and ''no payments till June'' offers from discount furniture stores. Airplane makers have helped finance corporate customers for years. Now makers of equipment for the new wireless voice and data networks known as personal communications services, or P.C.S., are finding out what it is like to sell on credit. In few, if any, other industries must small companies make such large capital investments to get off the ground. **********Having spent billions for airwave space, many small P.C.S. operators are spurned by traditional lenders and have nowhere to turn for equipment financing but their suppliers. (Equipment, in this case, is rarely the handsets consumers buy but the software and base stations that are the backbone of wireless networks.) **********Taking advantage of rivalries among competing vendors, larger P.C.S. operators like Sprint Spectrum are demanding generous financing. **********And the equipment manufacturers are discovering that in the battle for market share, balance sheets can be as potent a weapon as technology -- but one that must be wielded carefully. In underwriting their customers, P.C.S. equipment makers put their own credit ratings on the line. **********It is not a risk all are willing to take. Motorola, another large wireless manufacturer, has hung back. But Lucent, Northern Telecom and Ericsson have financed aggressively, as have fledging P.C.S. equipment providers like Nokia and Hughes Electronics, a unit of General Motors. While lending to a potential nationwide operator like Sprint Spectrum appears a sure bet to many, equipment makers often wager on small start-up companies whose success is far from assured. **********Lucent now carries at least $2.3 billion in vendor financing obligations for P.C.S. equipment on its books as contingent liabilities, more than half the value of the new wireless sales contracts announced this year. Northern Telecom's potential exposure is almost $2 billion. Ericsson reported about $400 million in potential equipment financing losses last year; that figure has at least doubled. The plans of every equipment maker call for spinning off North American P.C.S. financing obligations to traditional lenders. So far there are no takers. **********Vendor financing is ''clearly something that people can get carried away with,'' said Gregory S. Geiling, a telecommunications equipment analyst at J. P. Morgan. ''Investors need to know when they're buying that stock that they're buying some P.C.S. risk. But at least so far the reward has outweighed the risk.'' **********Only two major builders of P.C.S. networks have been able to manage without vendor financing: AT&T Wireless and Primeco Personal Communications, a cash-laden consortium of Nynex, Bell Atlantic, U S West and Airtouch Communications. **********Most experts estimate the cost of building a P.C.S. network at around $25 for each resident of the coverage area. Building a traditional cellular telephone system for a city of two million people costs about $8 million, while a P.C.S. network there could cost as much as $60 million, according to John W. Stanton, chief executive of the midsized wireless operator Western Wireless, which has a $200 million financing agreement with Northern Telecom. **********Charles A. DiSanza, an analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison & Company, said P.C.S. providers ''need to build a very expensive infrastructure for many, many customers before they get even a single customer.'' **********Pocket Communications, a privately held company based in Washington, has financing agreements with Northern Telecom and Ericsson to provide equipment for P.C.S. networks in Las Vegas, Nev., and Honolulu, respectively. ''We're a start-up company; we don't have any revenue,'' said Bill Getch, a Pocket spokesman. ''It's a reality in the market that you need these kinds of agreements.'' **********The equipment makers recognize that, but are not happy about it. ''Of course we'd prefer not to have to finance these customers,'' said Lucent's treasurer, Meg Walsh. **********But they do, because even Sprint Spectrum, with its deep pockets, required it. ''We could have bought the equipment straight out,'' said Robert E. Sleet, treasurer of Sprint Spectrum. ''We were looking for an opportunity for the vendor to be tied closely to us, in terms of them having a stake in the game.'' Robert J. O'Brien, a Northern Telecom spokesman, added, ''It would be irresponsible for us not to pursue an opportunity like Sprint Spectrum with vigor.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/19/world/world-news-briefsus-official-dismissed-opposed-all-land-mines.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-04-19", "snippet": "In a speech today at Georgetown University, Defense Secretary William J.

The company's reports had been inaccurate from 1988 through 1992, the commission said. **********Given that the disclosure has already been made, why file the suit? The S.E.C. seems to be trying to send a message, particularly to foreign companies that choose to trade in the United States. ''If they are going to sell their securities in this market,'' said Paul Gerlach, the S.E.C.'s associate director of enforcement, ''then they are going to be held to the same disclosure requirements, and the same books and records obligations as other issuers.'' **********Montedison, in a statement, emphasized that the facts in the case had been disclosed, and that it had new management. It said its only arguments with the commission were whether it was appropriate for a Federal judge to issue an injunction barring future violations of securities laws, and over how large a monetary penalty was appropriate. The S.E.C. did not disclose how large a payment it was seeking. **********The commission's action does not mean that any company paying bribes now has to disclose that, or face securities law penalties in addition to whatever criminal penalties might apply. **********Indeed, , there are judicial decisions that point to the Fifth Amendment protection from self-incrimination against forcing companies to disclose criminal conduct, notwithstanding the risk that committing a crime involves a potential liability if it is detected and prosecuted. **********But the S.E.C. takes the position that this does not mean that inaccurate financial statements may be filed. **********Had the bribes that were paid been so small that they were immaterial to the company's financial statements, then there would presumably have been no case. But while the standard for immateriality varies with size -- a $1 million payment might be highly material for a small company but immaterial for a company the size of Exxon or General Electric -- there are no companies for whom $400 million is immaterial. **********And had Montedison hidden the bribes by classifying them as another type of expense -- say, as consultant's fees or salaries -- then the commission would have had a more difficult time making a case. While the specifics would have been inaccurate, the overall picture painted by the financial statements would not have been meaningfully misleading. **********In this case, however, Montedison hid the payments not as other expenses, but as payments for assets. When an asset is bought, the books record that as substituting one asset (cash) for another one (here, a loan that was owed to the company, or real estate). And that has no effect on the income statement. **********As a result, Montedison's net worth was overstated, and so was its profit. And the company, which has suffered greatly in recent years in part because of the bribery disclosures, will suffer one more loss when the financial penalty is determined. **********In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Montedison's American depository receipts, which sold for $25 in 1989 while the books were being falsified, fell 25 cents, to $6.875.

But often, ads that blend actors, models and actual customers of disparate racial and ethnic backgrounds are the sole pitches an advertiser is making. **********Occasionally, mosaic advertising can be a publicity gimmick. And the campaigns can be counterproductive if they alienate consumers whose attitudes are less Brown v. Board of Education and more Plessy v. Ferguson. **********Yet considering that as recently as 1967, 18 states prohibited intermarriage  -- and that a year later a sponsor withdrew from an NBC television special because Petula Clark touched Harry Belafonte -- the changes are profound. **********\"We're featuring a variety of people because of the diversified and changing  family structure today,\" said Linda Sawyer, executive vice president and account management director at Deutsch Inc. in New York. \"It's part of a more realistic  depiction of where America is.\" **********In a television commercial by Deutsch for the American unit of Inter Ikea Systems B.V., the home furnishings retailer, actors portray an interracial couple discussing efforts to conceive a child. Bob Garfield, critic for the trade publication Advertising Age, praised it as an \"advertising breakthrough.\" **********As indicated by Ikea, a Swedish company, this trend is in large part attributable to the penchant of multinational corporations to leap borders with  messages of inclusion. **********\"We sell products in 76 countries, so our advertising is international,\" said Diana Loguzzo, media director in New York for the Diesel USA unit of the Italian fashion marketer Diesel, which is running print ads about a Don Juan who marries brides of all races. \"We might have an Italian advertising director and a Swedish photographer -- and they usually shoot in Miami Beach.\" **********Posters for Club Monaco, a chain of 115 apparel stores in Canada, Japan, South Korea and the United States, show an interracial couple in an affectionate pose. \"We try to have a modern, stylish approach, reflecting modern, stylish people,\" said Christine Ralphs, vice president for marketing and store design at the Club Monaco unit of Dylex Ltd. in Toronto. **********The trend is also motivated by the substantial demographic shifts remaking America. The Census Bureau last month released projections that by 2050, 53 percent of the population will be non-Hispanic whites compared with 74 percent now. **********\"We wanted to use real people you can identify with,\" said David Roth, associate publisher of the Fodor's Travel Publications produced by the Random House unit of Advance Publications in New York. A print and outdoor campaign by  Spot Design in New York to introduce \"Fodor's Gay Guide to the USA\" in May will  include a gay interracial couple, David Reese and Ron Anderson, who run a jewelry design company. **********The appearance of interracial couples, straight or gay, can raise eyebrows, as Mr. Garfield noted in Advertising Age, among \"racists of both major complexions.\" Ms. Sawyer disputed a suggestion the Ikea spot was \"waving a flag  to get attention.\" Rather, she said, it was \"about a varied portrayal of America.\" **********Michael Toth, chairman and creative director at Toth Design and Advertising in Concord, Mass., and New York, which creates multiracial campaigns for the apparel lines marketed by the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation, agreed with Ms. Sawyer that such ads were \"not a ploy.\" **********\"The idea is showing people getting along and enjoying themselves,\" he said.  \"We don't want to force anything because the moment the campaign starts to look  contrived is the moment Tommy starts to lose what he has.\" **********As the examples above indicate, many rainbow ads are for products aimed at so-called niche markets or for \"badge brands\" sold through perceptions they are  hip or trendy. For instance, a print campaign by Jordan Hamilton in New York for Naya water, marketed by Nora Beverages Inc., includes everyone from white heterosexuals to drag queens. **********\"You create an identity for water,\" said Gunnar Jordan, creative director at  Jordan Hamilton, \"and Naya is identifying with the ultimate aspiration of a desire for equality.\" **********Yet mainstream advertisers are taking part, too. A print ad by the Euro RSCG Tatham unit of Havas Advertising in Chicago for Head & Shoulder shampoo -- marketed by the staid Procter & Gamble Company -- features a mosaic of men and women who are thisclose together. **********\"The ad shows a group of friends from different racial backgrounds, which is  particularly fitting because more people use Head & Shoulders than any other dandruff shampoo in the world,\" said Don Tassone, a spokesman for P.& G. in Cincinnati. **********\"We have been running the ad about six months,\" he added, \"and it's working.  Sales of Head & Shoulders are up.\" **********So perhaps someday soon, Ms. Clark and Mr. Belafonte will rejoin for a duet of \"The best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/01/world/clinton-leads-two-memorials-for-victims-of-saudi-bombing.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1996-07-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 853, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Clinton Leads Two Memorials For Victims of Saudi Bombing", "print_headline": "Clinton Leads Two Memorials For Victims of Saudi Bombing", "body_text": " **********President Clinton led two memorial services today for the 19 airmen killed on Tuesday in a bombing in Saudi Arabia, telling their families, \"America stands with you in your sorrow and in your outrage,\" and vowing that \"we will not rest\" until their killers are caught. **********\"There is a passage in Isaiah in which God wonders, 'Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?' \" the President told 4,500 friends and colleagues of the fallen airmen this morning at Eglin Air Force Base, in the Florida panhandle. **********Isaiah answers: 'Here am I, Lord.

Sergeant  Heiser had given the President a small medal with the insignia of his unit -- Mr. Clinton keeps a display of such medals behind his desk in the Oval Office -- and the photograph of their meeting had been on the mantelpiece in the grandparents' home. **********The first service today took place on the sprawling Eglin Air Force Base, where 12 of the 19 men had been based. In the front row of a huge air hangar were 11 men who survived the bombing. They came to the service on foot, in wheelchairs, and in a few cases on hospital beds that were wheeled into the huge space. **********\"Our Nomads have ceased their wandering,\" Mr. Clinton said, a reference to the nickname of the 33rd Fighter Wing at Eglin, which is responsible for keeping planes serviced and flying. \"They have come home. May God embrace their souls. And may God bless America's mission of peace and freedom, for which they gave the last full measure of their devotion.\" **********Mr. Clinton steered clear today of any comment about security at the base in  Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, or about reports that the Saudi Government had not cooperated when the United States asked for a wider perimeter around the base. **********But a survivor of the explosion, Master Sgt. William Sine, 39, said he thought security was \"extra tight\" compared with his previous visits to the base. He added that he \"had heard some talk\" about expanding the security perimeter before the explosion. **********Sergeant Sine, a large man who wore a red beret to today's service here, said he had escaped with minor injuries because he had just left his suite in the building and was a few steps from the elevator. **********Air Force officials said Saturday that in a case of mistaken identity in the  chaos after the bombing, they had initially told the family of one airman who had been killed that he was alive, but seriously injured, in a hospital in Dhahran. **********The mistake involved Airman 1st Class Christopher B. Lester of Pineville, W.  Va.. Air Force officials said members of Mr. Lester's unit had incorrectly believed that an injured airman, Paul A. Blais, was Mr. Lester.

The incident forced the holy man to flee by car, when everyone knows he travels by horse. **********''It was really a sad moment,'' said St. Nicholas, who when not dressed for the part is a schoolteacher named Johan. He had recovered his nerve, donned the robes and miter, and was back out on the street, touring a neighborhood in Amsterdam. ''Joking is fine, but such attacks in front of children, that's going too far.'' **********Sinterklaas, as he is known here, has been a fixture of Dutch culture since the Middle Ages, and in Amsterdam he is the patron saint. His feast day, Dec. 6, is a national event, and the the celebrations, songs and parades in his honor start as early as mid-November, when the saint arrives by boat from Spain, along with his white horse and black pageboy. **********He appears in every town, stopping in schools, hospitals and even homes and, like Santa, he delivers presents. But being a bishop, he is a bit more solemn than Santa, and often carries a big book with notes about the naughty habits of some children. **********The attack on St. Nicholas in Amsterdam is unusual, but lately, other irreverent residents have lampooned him and mocked him in cartoons. Some have even yelled in his presence that he is a fake. In fact, the holy man has been the object of such fierce deconstruction that some of his followers wonder if he will make it into the next millennium. **********Animal lovers have criticized Sinterklaas because his character sometimes wears a mantle with white furry trim. One critic wrote in a published letter that ''removing the fur would make a better, more animal-friendly impression.'' **********Some feminists have said they regret that the yearly ritual involving the bishop and his pageboys remains an all-male event. Just before the feast day this year, an historian, a man, wrote in a local newspaper that by now the saint should be aware of the spirit of our time and include a woman in his entourage. **********And an intense debate has sprung up about the racism of Sinterklaas because his chief assistant, known as Zwarte Piet, or Black Pete, is supposed to be Moorish and traditionally stains his face black. **********An anti-discrimination group has tried launching alternative Pete characters whose faces are painted blue or green, but the change has not caught on. **********According to the Amsterdam Sinterklaas foundation, a kind of rent-a-saint center, it is the white Dutch who are self-conscious about the color issue. An employee at the center said that immigrants from Suriname, a former Dutch colony where many of the people are descended from African slaves, often try to get a Black Pete job and ask to have their faces painted even blacker. **********''Here's a white bishop with a black servant and this looks like something from the time of slavery,'' said Peter-Paul Spanjaard, a student. But he said that after talking things over with his friends, they agreed the issue was not that clear-cut, because Black Pete was not subservient and in fact was the more sympathetic character. **********''Zwarte Piet gave you sweets,'' said Mr. Spanjaard, now 18 and wiser. ''He comforted you when you cried. He could climb on the roof like an acrobat. Black Pete was my hero. Sinterklaas is frightening. He has the big book, he knows everything.'' **********The travails of St. Nicholas reflect other changes in the once-homogeneous Dutch social landscape. **********Sinterklaas, alias Johan, said the teen-agers who had ripped off his beard the other day were the sons of Moroccan immigrants. He said the boys were wedged between two cultures. Their school, like every Dutch school, celebrates the St. Nicholas feast day with songs, presents and a visit from the holy man. But at home, their Muslim parents dismiss the festivities as nonsense. **********The more humiliating change for the ancient bishop, though, may be the growing competition from a young upstart, the American figure of Santa Claus. In the past few years, Santa has been gaining ground here, a development that suggests the closing of a curious historical circle as he crosses back over the Atlantic. **********The historical St. Nicholas lived in the fourth century, and was a beloved bishop of Myra, in today's Turkey. After astonishing miracles were attributed to him around the Mediterranean his bones were taken to Italy. Later his fame crossed the Alps and spread over Northern Europe. Dutch settlers took their Sinterklaas tradition to America, where he merged with the English Father Christmas and became Santa Claus. **********Images of the jolly American figure have now been making their way into the shops, along with ''Jingle Bells'' and other seasonal tunes popular in the United States, helping to turn Christmas into more of an occasion for gift-giving and inevitably stealing some of the allure of St. Nicholas Day three weeks earlier. **********Many adult Dutch, who remember Christmas as a strictly religious event, are scandalized. Just a generation ago, the Dutch regarded the more commercial Christmas spirit of the English-speaking world as a profanity. **********This shift has become a topic for sociologists, who theorize that the invasion of Santa Claus is part of the globalization of cultural images, or that the Dutch have become less religious, or that Sinterklaas is essentially for children and people have fewer or no children, or that they are perhaps lazier, because Sinterklaas gifts must be accompanied by satirical or clever rhyming verses. **********One recent market study said the Christmas hype of the past few years was set off by the large garden centers outside the big cities because they have nothing to sell in winter. It said that these stores started imitating their American cousins, stocking Christmas trees, avalanches of decorations and Santa figures, and that other stores followed. **********Some people are upset about the competing versions of the same character. The city of Assen has even decided to keep St. Nicholas and Santa Claus apart. City fathers have told shopkeepers to wait with Santa Claus motifs until after the departure of St. Nicholas, Dec. 6, even posting signs at the city limits: the image of a fat Santa, crossed out with a large red X."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/27/world/tax-cut-for-bosnia-gi-s.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 82, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tax Cut for Bosnia G.I.'s", "print_headline": "Tax Cut for Bosnia G.I.'s", "body_text": " **********President Clinton asked Congress today to grant $40 million in tax relief to  20,000 American troops serving with the NATO-led peacekeeping force in the Balkans. **********Mr. Clinton said in a statement that such tax breaks were normally set aside  for American troops serving in a \"combat zone.\" **********The proposed legislation, similar to bills already pending in Congress, would exempt the pay of American enlisted personnel and warrant officers serving in Bosnia, Croatia and Macedonia from federal income taxes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/04/business/international-business-3-billion-later-japan-financier-is-bankrupt.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 350, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;$3 Billion Later, Japan Financier Is Bankrupt", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;$3 Billion Later, Japan Financier Is Bankrupt", "body_text": " **********Shinkyoto Shinpan, a Japanese finance company, filed for bankruptcy today, under the weight of $3.24 billion in debts. **********The bankruptcy is Japan's seventh largest since the end of World War II, according to Teikoku Data Bank, a research company specializing in bankruptcy analysis. **********The bankruptcy heightened concern about the stability of the Japanese banking industry, which has slowly been trying to dispose of mountains of bad debt.

Linerboard, which is used for boxes  and cartons, has been under similar pressure. **********The Procter & Gamble Company said last week that it was cutting list prices for its facial tissues, bath tissues and paper towels by 4.8 to 8.6 percent, citing the lower pulp prices. **********Competitors are expected to make comparable cuts. **********Though many newsprint producers have their own integrated pulp mills and do not buy pulp on the open market, the weakness in pulp prices has been a factor in their recent decisions to cancel price increases for newsprint. **********Canada is the world's largest supplier of pulp. In the first two months of this year, shipments fell 18 percent, according to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association. **********As producers increased prices in 1995, pulp on hand at mills in Canada, the United States and the Nordic countries, the principal supply points, shot up to  2 million tons from 1.1 million, the fastest rise in inventory levels since the  mid-1970's. **********Struggling to get inventories down to more manageable levels, North American  mills have announced extensive shutdowns. MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., a giant producer in British Columbia, is closing its lumber and sawmill operations until May 4, affecting 1,250 workers. **********Crestbrook Forest Industries, Slocan Forest Products and Repap Enterprises are among other Canadian companies that have announced temporary shutdowns. Georgia-Pacific idled 14 lumber mills from Maine to Arkansas in the last two weeks of December. **********After price weakness and the severe winter, which has also affected bottom lines, analysts expect that first-quarter earnings of many paper companies will  take a dive. **********\"In the first quarter we'll see virtually every company with far lower earnings and further deterioration in the second quarter based on the sharp drop that's already occurred in pricing,\" said Mark Rogers, paper industry analyst for Prudential Securities in New York. **********Yet some analysts expect a turnaround later this year. Patricia Mohr, a vice  president of economics at the Toronto headquarters of the Bank of Nova Scotia, pointed to the \"relatively favorable\" underlying demand for most paper products. \"This is a big inventory correction but it will come to an end over the next few months,\" she predicted. **********And Sam Magid, an analyst with Salman Partners of Vancouver, British Columbia, said that as mills go through temporary shutdowns to reduce pulp, they also reduce supplies of lumber, a commodity that has recently had rising prices. Since the fourth quarter, the producer price of a bellwether grade of two-by-fours has risen to $295 for 1,000 board feet from $244. \"The death of the pulp market,\" Mr. Magid said, \"brings with it breaths of life to the lumber market.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/03/business/calgene-upheld-in-patent-case.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-02-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Calgene Upheld In Patent Case", "print_headline": "Calgene Upheld In Patent Case", "body_text": " **********Calgene Inc.'s genetically engineered Flavr Savr tomato does not infringe patents held by Enzo Biochem Inc., a Federal judge ruled today. **********The ruling by Federal District Judge Joseph J.

Yeltsin plans 16 campaign trips this month. In April the 65-year-old Russian President's punishing schedule sent him from Moscow to Norway and then across the Asian continent to China. In between, he presided over a hectic summit meeting held for the leaders of the world's richest nations. **********\"I do not have any time to remember my illnesses,\" Mr. Yeltsin wrote this week in response to a series of personal questions submitted by voters. \"I work  from 5 in the morning until late each night.\" **********But with little more than a month before the Russian people must almost certainly choose between Mr. Yeltsin and a return to Communist rule, the President's often precarious health -- and the drastic choices that would remain should he die or become seriously ill for the third time in a year -- has become for many voters a central issue. **********Whatever else a vote for Mr. Yeltsin means, it will be a vote for a man with  a long history of health problems, including two heart \"ailments\" last year that kept him hospitalized and often totally inaccessible for weeks. It will mean a vote for a man who has already lived seven years beyond the current average life expectancy for a Russian man. And it will mean a vote for a man whose past problems with alcohol have been so obvious to the average Russian that Mr. Yeltsin felt the need this week to comment on them. **********\"To say that I abuse alcohol would be untrue,\" he wrote in a response to a question from a voter. \"To say that I do not drink would not be convincing. People would doubt it and say: 'What kind of Russian man are you if you cannot drink?' \" **********Doctors here and in the United States insist that there is no real way to assess with certainty the severity of Mr. Yeltsin's heart problems or predict what they will mean in the future. But most of those interviewed agreed that, based on what is known about Mr. Yeltsin and based on general information about  the health of men his age in Russia, the picture is unlikely to be bright. **********\"I cannot speak directly about the President's health,\" said Dr. Mikhail Alshibai, one of Russia's foremost heart surgeons, who has never treated Mr. Yeltsin. \"But in our country men that age with heart problems are dying at rates that it is almost impossible to believe. It is one of our worst social problems.\" **********Mr. Yeltsin has had many illnesses and his physical condition vacillates wildly. He has a long history of sudden and prolonged absences from public view. He has acknowledged occasional spells of depression. He was, by many accounts, including those of close aides, so drunk on a 1994 stop at Shannon Airport in Ireland that he was unable to leave the plane to meet the Irish Prime Minister,  Albert Reynolds. **********Mr. Yeltsin's principal opponent, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the 51-year-old Communist leader, wastes no opportunity to speak about Mr. Yeltsin's drinking. **********\"A bus driver cannot go to work without a medical examination,\" Mr. Zyuganov  says in his standard stump speech, referring to the tests for alcohol that are supposed to be administered to all public transportation workers before they take the wheel. \"But now, a person can rule the entire country in any condition.\" **********Polls show that while Mr. Yeltsin's drinking may not bother many people, his  age and his recent health problems do. **********Yet to the degree that the future of Russian reform relies on the victory of  Mr. Yeltsin -- and most political analysts increasingly agree it relies heavily  on such an outcome -- there is a lot riding on the President's continued good health. **********Russia has no vice president. If Mr. Yeltsin were to die or become incapacitated before the June election, his Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, would temporarily take over the Government. But neither he nor any other political ally could run for President in Mr. Yeltsin's place because the  law does not permit it. **********Even for a Russian leader, Mr. Yeltsin has been particularly vague about the  nature of his heart ailment and about the treatment he received during his many  weeks of convalescence last year. **********The Kremlin did not respond to written requests seeking information about Mr. Yeltsin's health and permission to speak with his doctors. Nobody who knows will say whether Mr. Yeltsin had two heart attacks last year or whether his ailments  were less severe. **********And although Mr. Yeltsin is clearly running as energetically as Mr. Zyuganov, who has no such history of serious illness, even his strongest supporters entertain constant worries about his health. **********\"I think he looks extremely vigorous,\" said Igor B. Malashenko, the president of Russia's Independent Television Network, who has become a senior media adviser to the President's campaign. \"But nobody really wants to think about what would happen if President Yeltsin were to become unable to do his job. It is a problem in our system that we need to work out.\" **********Last July 11 Mr. Yeltsin was admitted to the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow with chest pains that officials attributed to ischemia of the heart. He was admitted again in October. But ischemia is really a symptom of an illness, not the illness itself. Ischemia means that oxygen-rich blood is not getting where it needs to go, in this case to the heart. **********It can be minor -- millions of people suffer from some level of ischemia because of blocked arteries and many do not know it -- or it can be bad enough to cause a major heart attack. It depends how serious the blockages are -- again something easy to discover but something nobody has reported about Mr. Yeltsin. **********Because the Kremlin said there was angina, or pain, associated with the ischemia, most doctors interviewed agree that the chances of the episodes having been minor are not good, particularly the second one, which hospitalized him from late October to mid-December. **********\"Heart ischemia can indicate very serious problems, particularly if it is repeated,\" said Valery Shumakov, director of the Research Center of Surgery in Moscow, who has performed more heart transplants than any other Russian surgeon. **********Like all those interviewed, Dr. Shumakov stressed that he had no personal knowledge of Mr. Yeltsin's case, and therefore could not know what shape his heart is in. **********\"Everyone is different,\" he said. \"It depends on the state of the blood vessels. Obviously though, your age, your weight, your level of physical activity and the amount of stress you have in your life all contribute to any diagnosis and any prognosis.\" **********Mr. Yeltsin appears overweight.  He is far less physically active than he used to be, and few people could have a more stressful life. **********\"I will tell you this,\" said Dr. Norman D. Anderson, who runs what is often regarded as the most successful American executive fitness program, at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. \"I never worry about my executives as long as they are in charge. But the greatest stress is when events control their lives and they are not in charge.\" **********Mr. Yeltsin seems to know what the doctor is talking about. **********\"My family reproaches me for taking everything to my heart,\" he said in his written comments this week, the first time he has commented so fully about his health in more than a year. \"This is not noticeable at first, but when concerns  accumulate, the load makes itself felt. Large emotional and physical stresses brought me to the hospital last year but the doctors put me right.\" **********Mr. Yeltsin also noted that all his grandfathers and great-grandfathers lived until they were 90 or older. Genetics, experts agree, play a significant role in life expectancy and in the development of heart disease. Nor does he smoke. **********Still, if looked at solely on a statistical basis, Mr. Yeltsin's prognosis would not be comforting. Russia has by far the highest death rate from cardiovascular illness in the world, according to the American Heart Association. The total death rate is also the highest of countries that keep records. **********In 1994, the last year for which full statistics are available, the death rate from cardiovascular illness was 1,318 for every 100,000 Russian men between the ages of 35 and 74. The total death rate in that age group was 2,940 men per 100,000. **********That is nearly 10 times the heart disease death rate of Japan, which is the lowest in the world. But it is also about three times the rate for the United States, where heart disease kills 460 of people for every 100,000 men of that age range. **********One of the largest unanswered questions about Mr. Yeltsin's health is what medication he takes, if any. **********\"We have offered more than once to help in any way we could,\" said a senior American diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"The Russians have always said no thanks. He looks better these days, of course. But we cannot even say for certain what the problem is. Obviously there is a problem, however, and of course it worries us a lot.\" **********Rumors swirl constantly about Mr. Yeltsin. If he stumbles, people wonder if it's from alcohol or from drugs. The Russian leader was in a very rough emergency helicopter landing in 1990 and may still take painkillers, but again there is no way to be certain. **********\"I have been in accidents with nearly every kind of vehicle,\" Mr. Yeltsin noted. \"Planes, helicopters, cars, a train and once, when I was a child, a horse.\" So far he has managed to shake them all off. **********\"Seeing Yeltsin very often now I could say that he is now in really good shape,\" said Anatoly B. Chubais, who is working for Mr. Yeltsin's re-election although he was recently dismissed by the President from the post in which he led Russia's industrial privatization effort. **********\"It could be seen on television that his activity is very energetic in the same way he looked in 1991-92,\" Mr. Chubais said. \"So in this situation we need  to hope for the best and investigate the worst scenario after it happens. As the Russian proverb says, let's cope with the problems when they come.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/19/world/canadians-keep-pressing-for-african-aid-mission.html": {"writer_name": "Anthony Depalma", "pub_date": "1996-11-19", "snippet": "Canadian leaders press to keep alive international aid mission to rescue Rwandan refugees as support dwindles among allied nations and resistance grows at home (S)", "word_count": 272, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Canadians Keep Pressing for African Aid Mission", "print_headline": "Canadians Keep Pressing for African Aid Mission", "body_text": " **********As support dwindled among allied nations and resistance grew at home, Canadian leaders tried today to keep alive the international aid mission they planned to lead in Central Africa. **********''It is much too early to say the crisis is over,'' said Doug Young, Canada's Minister of Defense, before  Parliament today.

A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 9, and the company said it was convinced the court would not approve the Conrail board's ''wholesale abrogation of its fiduciary duties to all of its constituencies.'' **********Most analysts and investors say that Norfolk Southern must win the court battle, otherwise the monetary value of its offer will decline over the two years it must wait, making the bid less enticing for shareholders. In that case, CSX would most likely proceed to the next stage in the merger process: regulatory approval. **********''It makes a lot of sense for Norfolk to raise its bid in conjunction with trying to smash the lockup provision,'' Anthony Hatch, an analyst at NatWest Securities, said. ''Both tactics must work for this to succeed. But if they can't break the lockup provision, $115 a share is not enough for people to wait until 1999. I think we're finally coming to the end of the game.'' **********Whatever the outcome, Conrail shares continued to climb, gaining $1.75 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday to close at $100.75. The stock price for the once-troubled railroad has climbed a giddy $29.75, or 42 percent, since the bidding war began on Oct. 15 with the announcement of a friendly, $8.1 billion agreement between Conrail and CSX. CSX stock, however, fell $1.50 on the Big Board, closing at $43.75, while Norfolk, which did not announce its new offer until after the stock market had closed, gained $2.125, to $87.375. **********Conrail shareholders gave yesterday's events mixed reviews, with some anxious to grab CSX's new offer and run, while others continued to favor Norfolk Southern's sweeter bid. The lockup provision and various anti-takeover statutes in Pennsylvania, however, provide CSX and Conrail with a formidable defense against Norfolk Southern's hostile bid. **********Until yesterday, many shareholders had complained bitterly about CSX's failure to close the $1.5 billion gap between the offers. CSX would have almost certainly lost a shareholder vote next Monday on a proposal to allow the company to buy more than 20 percent of Conrail stock. Yesterday, Conrail moved that meeting to Jan. 17, allowing CSX more time to assuage stockholders with its new offer. CSX also agreed to provide stockholders with cash or stock early next year, rather than waiting until after the merger receives regulatory approval. **********''It's a three-pronged attack on Norfolk Southern, and I think it'll be successful,'' said Thomas R. Angers, vice president of the Glenmede Trust Company in Philadelphia, which has 10,000 shares of Conrail. ''The gap between the two offers has narrowed significantly.'' **********John Snow, chairman of CSX, said he was optimistic that the bloodletting was finally over. ''We're hopeful that by increasing our offer and by extending the no-solicitation period to the end of December 1999 that we'll be able to move to the next phase of the merger,'' Mr. Snow said. **********But not everyone has been won over. CSX, which already owns 20 percent of Conrail stock, is offering $110 cash for another 20 percent. But it is offering a stock swap for the remaining 40 percent that values Conrail at $102.34 a share, based on yesterday's closing price. In contrast, Norfolk Southern is offering $115 cash for all shares. **********''It's heartening to see that CSX raised its offer after figuring out that they couldn't win the vote on Monday,'' said Ann Yerger, research director at the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents 100 private and public sector pension funds and has been critical of the CSX offer. ''But it's clear that no serious consideration has been given to Norfolk, whose offer is still higher than CSX.'' **********Institutional investors hold about 40 percent of Conrail stock, and arbitragers, who by no means favor CSX, have another 20 percent.

The October figures were lower than expected; analysts had predicted a drop of three-tenths of 1 percent last month. **********The figures reflect actual closings. **********Even though mortgage rates are falling, the housing market for 1997 is not expected to sustain the big contribution it made to the economy this year, analysts said.

''It's been a banner year for housing,'' he said. ''Next year, while it will be a good year, probably will be off 5 percent.'' **********Even if the housing market slows, many economists still think the economy will sustain its moderate growth and low inflation through next year.

GIULIANI was on hand to announce: \"Live, from New York, it's CNNFN!\" So was Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who waited patiently to make an appearance. CNN's new financial news network even recruited a psychic, the Amazing Kreskin, to predict the direction  of the stock market in 1996 (down, sharply). **********About the only thing missing from the Dec. 29 start of CNNFN was Ted Turner himself. **********Mr. Turner, who founded the original CNN, was in Florida on a hunting trip, said a spokeswoman for Turner Broadcasting System. But if Mr. Turner was not there in person last week, his spirit was everywhere in the network's freewheeling and frantic debut. **********On Thursday evening, 12 hours before the new financial news service signed on, workers were still hurriedly tacking up posters and running cables through the studio. They had just finished repairing the ceiling, which had been damaged earlier in the week by a fire on the floor above the newsroom. **********Nerves were so frayed that Lou Dobbs, the executive vice president of CNN and head of the new network, hired a string quartet and a massage therapist to soothe employees as they rushed to gather material to fill the network's 12-hour daily schedule by 7 A.M. Friday. **********\"It's been a crazy week,\" said a weary Mr. Dobbs, as he squatted on a stepladder in the middle of the crowded newsroom. **********The last-minute improvisation and cheerful chaos was eerily reminiscent of CNN's debut 15 years ago. But the birth of CNN-pere represented something genuinely new in television -- round-the-clock news -- and quickly became a worldwide phenomenon. **********Last week's debut of CNN-fils seemed more like a game of catch-up. NBC already has an all-business-news channel, and companies like Bloomberg Business  News, the ITT Corporation, and Dow Jones & Company are getting into business news. **********The question for CNN is: How many channels can survive by reporting on the daily swings of the Dow or the occasional pronouncements of the Fed? **********\"The whole audience for all-news is minuscule,\" said Porter Bibb, an investment banker at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company who specializes in the media  industry. \"CNN is only jumping into this because it will help extend its brand name.\" **********With a staff of 170 journalists and a 26,000-square-foot newsroom and studio  in midtown Manhattan, CNNFN clearly aims to be the leading business news channel on television. But to do so, the network must overtake CNBC, which now has 56 million subscribers in the United States and roughly 120 million subscribers worldwide. **********Turner's new service is starting out with only 5.5 million subscribers. And three million of those are getting it via rooftop and backyard satellite dishes, an audience that is less attractive to advertisers. (It will begin broadcasting  in New York City tomorrow on Time Warner Cable.) **********The new service will benefit from CNN's strong reputation for news gathering. And Turner Broadcasting has potent ties to Time Warner, the nation's second-largest cable operator. Nevertheless, it will be difficult for CNN's financial news network to match the distribution of CNBC. **********\"The big question is when will cable operators be willing to carry two channels in the same category?\" said Larry Gerbrandt, a cable analyst at Paul Kagan Associates. **********Beyond rival business news services, Turner's fledgling network faces future  competition from two other all-news cable networks: one from NBC and the Microsoft Corporation, the other from Capital Cities/ ABC. NBC and Microsoft also intend to distribute their network, which goes by the initials MSNBC, on Microsoft's on-line service. **********Executives at Turner are quick to note that CNNFN will have an even wider multimedia distribution than MSNBC. In addition to cable, it is being distributed through a site on the World Wide Web (http:// www.cnn.com); on desktop computers via CNN at Work, a joint venture of CNN and the Intel Corporation, and through the AT&T Business Network, an on-line service. **********And while NBC and ABC plan to roll out their services in 1996 and 1997, respectively, CNN's network is already up and running. \"They talk the talk, we walk the walk,\" Mr. Dobbs said. **********Mr. Dobbs, who anchors CNN's daily business news program, \"Moneyline,\" in addition to his corporate duties, is proud that his troops designed and built the service from scratch in six months. The network is also a classic example of how Turner squeezes more from less: It has kept its payroll down by using digital production and editing equipment and by doing without scripts for its anchors, which reduces the need for writers. **********As a result, Turner has been able to start his financial news network with an upfront investment of less than $50 million. NBC and Microsoft, by contrast, plan to spend about $200 million to start MSNBC. **********But ingenuity alone does not guarantee success. In particular, CNN must still solve the riddle of making business news watchable. For all its success, CNBC remains essentially an electronic trade magazine for the individual investor --  complete with a stock tape scrolling across the bottom of the television screen  giving the latest information on market activity. **********To attract a broad viewership, CNN's network is consciously striking a slicker pose than CNBC. In a decision that was opposed by many staff members, Mr. Dobbs persuaded Mr. Turner to do without the stock tape. The network's sprawling newsroom is painted in soft hues of green and turquoise, and looks like a cross between a Wall Street trading pit and a Southwestern cantina. And its programs have names like \"Digital Jam,\" \"Biz Buzz\" and \"Street Sweep.\" **********CNNFN has some indisputable advantages. CNN's 29 news bureaus will enable it  to offer comprehensive global coverage. And if its first day was any indication, the network will have no trouble attracting A-list guests. In addition to Mr. Levitt, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and the Presidential candidate Malcolm S. Forbes Jr. appeared on the network. **********In the end, though, the success of CNN's financial news network will hinge on its ability to make the quotidian events of business interesting. As Mr. Gerbrandt noted, \"There's only so far you can take a story about rising interest rates, or what the Hang Seng index closed at.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/20/business/international-briefs-reltec-of-us-to-buy-rainford-of-britain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-07-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 86, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Reltec of U.S. to Buy Rainford of Britain", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Reltec of U.S. to Buy Rainford of Britain", "body_text": " **********Reltec, an electronics company controlled by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, said yesterday that it would buy the Rainford Group, a British maker of cabinets for electronic equipment, for L80 million ($124 million).

He loaded large plastic bags with bark chips and wood shavings destined to be sold as mulch or landscaping materials to suburban shoppers at garden stores around the nation. **********Two months ago, on Oct. 21, he reported to work for the last time. At approximately 10:15 A.M., he was operating a forklift when it skidded on gravel, overturned and pinned him underneath. He died before an ambulance arrived. **********Within the same hour, a former deli owner who worked part time as a courier was fatally crushed beneath the wheels of a van in Wilmington, Del., a day laborer in El Paso died in a construction accident and an Indiana man who was being paid to drive a used car to an auto auction was killed when he lost control and the vehicle flipped over. **********By day's end, at least nine more people were killed or fatally injured on the job in the United States. **********It was an extraordinary day only for the victims, their families, friends and co-workers. Few of the deaths got more attention than several paragraphs in the local newspaper. **********Indeed, an average of 17 people die daily in the United States because of the work they do, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. **********That amounted to 6,210 job-related deaths in 1995, almost exactly the number (6,217) recorded in 1992, the year the bureau conducted its first 50-state census of work fatalities. The figure covers accidents, homicides and suicides on the job, but not deaths from natural causes. **********As big as those numbers are, they are a mark of progress, even after taking into account the somewhat fuzzy and haphazard data-gathering that went on in previous years. A half-century ago, in 1947, some 17,000 job-related deaths were estimated to have occurred in a work force that was less than half the size of today's. **********Fatalities in manufacturing and the construction trades have fallen sharply over the years because of mandated safety measures and education programs, officials of the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and state agencies say. **********''One clear success story of governmental vigilance over workplace safety is the steady reduction of fatalities even as the work force has grown,'' Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said in an interview. **********Still, as the overall numbers have gone down, new areas of concern have appeared. The danger has shifted from the factory floor to service industries and outdoor occupations, areas more difficult to regulate or supervise, safety experts acknowledged. **********And workplace violence -- a category not even counted before 1992 -- is now responsible for one of every six job-related deaths, roughly the same proportion that is attributed to accidents with machinery and equipment. (Transportation-related mishaps, a category that includes everything from jackknifed trailer trucks to school crossing guards hit by a car, accounted for most of the rest.) **********Violence -- whether inflicted by robbers, co-workers or estranged spouses -- is so prevalent that it is now the leading cause of job-related deaths for women, who make up a sizable proportion of the work force at convenience stores and other retail outlets that are favorite targets of criminals. **********Joseph A. Dear, Assistant Labor Secretary for OSHA, observed that those who wrote Federal job safety regulations in years past ''would probably be surprised to see how our focus of concern has changed to workplace violence, repetitive motion and nursing home injuries.'' **********Proposed OSHA guidelines offered earlier this year to lower the risk of violence to millions of retail clerks and cashiers met stiff resistance from the fast food and convenience store industries. A modified set of guidelines is expected to be proposed in 1997 after consideration of industry objections. **********Critics of these and other efforts to expand safety guidelines say the cost and time spent in dealing with Federal and state agencies place a burden on employers far out of proportion to any gains in safety. **********OSHA, Mr. Reich said, ''remains a lightning rod for highly contentious disputes over how much death or injury is preventable.'' **********Last year, in addition to the 6,210 people who died, some 3.6 million Americans suffered disabling work injuries, according to the National Safety Council, which placed the cost at $119 billion in lost wages, employer expenses and medical care. **********The list of workplace deaths on Oct. 21 was put together with the assistance of OSHA and a number of state safety offices and state and local police agencies. Almost certainly, additional deaths occurred that day that have not yet been tallied; it will take more than a year for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to compile the complete figures for 1996. **********The 13 known deaths that day were unusual only in the fact that none involved intentional violence. In other respects they fit well within the sudden and traumatic dimensions of workplace fatalities. **********Some of the accidents were cases of simple bad luck -- of being in the wrong place at the wrong time when a piece of machinery failed. Others appeared to be the product of a misstep here, a loss of concentration there, a failure to take simple precautions because the task had been done a thousand times without a mishap. And alcohol was a factor in at least one death. Experts note that drugs and alcohol play an incalculable role in workplace accidents. **********The human toll of the deaths that occurred on Oct. 21 was also familiar. Many of those who died were of modest means and in the prime of their working lives. For financial sustenance, their survivors now have to look to workers' compensation, Social Security and the possibility of litigation. **********No one day, of course, produces a list that meets a precise ''average'' based on a year's toll. Each day is special, marked by the individuality of the men and women who died in the course of their labor. Here is a look at those who reported to work for the last time on Oct. 21. **********The Metals Worker **********The first of the group to die that day was Thomas Fishback, who lived with his wife and four small children in a modest rented house in Turtle Lake, Wis., a town of 900 more than an hour's drive northeast of Minneapolis. **********Mr. Fishback, 39, worked the graveyard shift at the American Steel and Industrial Supply Company, one of a patchwork of scrap metal yards hugging the banks of the Mississippi River just north of downtown Minneapolis. **********''That meant they didn't get to mix much socially,'' a Turtle Lake neighbor, Greg Greschner, said of the Fishbacks. ''But they liked the town and were shopping around for a house to buy.'' **********All those plans ended at 2:39 that morning. Mr. Fishback and a co-worker were standing on a platform about 30 feet above a concrete floor inside a company shed, trying to adjust steel arms that held supplies in place, the police reported. As Mr. Fishback tightened an arm, he lost his balance and fell backward to the floor below. He was dead by the time an ambulance arrived. **********Within days, Mr. Fishback's widow and children left Turtle Lake, moving in with relatives in Minnesota. **********''One minute he's working and the next minute he's dead,'' Mr. Greschner said. ''The only good thing is, they never had a chance to buy that house and be stuck with a big mortgage now that he's gone.'' **********Mr. Greschner also conceded that he was  now more safety-conscious at his own job in a local window factory. ''If I go up on an elevated platform now, I make sure the safety rails are up,'' he said. **********The Oil Rigger **********Danny Gilchrist, 46, died in the early-morning hours after an accident in the oilfields 17 miles east of Artesia in southeastern New Mexico. **********A mechanical failure in an oil rig caused a piece of equipment to crush him against a control panel, the Eddy County sheriff's office reported. His employer and co-workers could not be reached for comment. **********The Ironworker **********Dereck Bridges, 42, came from a family of ironworkers near Florence, in the Tennessee River Valley of northwestern Alabama, where playing hard is as much a part of a man's life as working hard. **********''He rode Harley-Davidson motorcycles,'' said one of his two ironworker brothers, Kent. ''That was his only hobby, that and work, and he did both pretty hard.'' **********Keith Michaels, an ironworker who was with Dereck Bridges on the morning he died, agreed that his co-worker was a character. **********''Many didn't like him at first because they didn't know how to take him,'' Mr. Michaels said. ''He was that type of fellow. **********''But once they got to know him, he was a lot of laughs. He was always cutting up.'' **********They were employed by the B & H Craig Construction Company, a Florence contractor hired by the Reynolds Metals Company to dismantle the roof of a mill located across the river near Muscle Shoals. The mill is part of a huge factory that has produced aluminum since World War II. It is Reynolds's largest plant in the world, employing about 2,000 workers. **********At 8:40 A.M., Mr. Bridges was removing rivetlike fasteners that locked 12-foot-long roof panels in place when one panel apparently gave way beneath him and he plunged 44 feet to his death, investigators said. **********Mr. Bridges was wearing a body harness at the time, but for unexplained reasons was not hooked to a secured safety rope, a measure that might have saved the life of a man who also didn't care much for wearing a helmet when he skimmed along back-country roads on his prized Harley Heritage Soft Tail. **********The Maintenance Man **********The job was routine but the circumstances were not. **********Anthony Marks, 34, was preparing to perform maintenance work near a steam boiler in a municipal water plant in Cleveland when it blew up at about 10 A.M. and killed him. **********City water officials said the boiler automatically shut down over the weekend when it malfunctioned for unknown reasons. It was restarted Monday morning at 8:15, but safety devices shut it down again 20 minutes later, they reported. **********''No one was attempting to do anything at the time of the explosion,'' explained Ron Schwarzwalder, assistant water commissioner. **********Mr. Schwarzwalder added that Mr. Marks was the first worker at the city water department to die on the job in at least 20 years. **********The Deliveryman **********Howard G. Cohen had been a deliveryman for only a few months. **********Until June he had operated a sandwich shop and restaurant, All That Food, in northeastern Wilmington, Del., and before that a kosher meat market. Businessmen favored the hefty pastrami and corned beef sandwiches and flirted with a pretty waitress from West Virginia named Betty. **********Things went well for Mr. Cohen and his wife, Deborah, until the last few years. First, the state tore up the road in front of the shopping strip where the restaurant was located, blocking easy access for an extended period, and then another takeout deli moved in next door. **********The competition and the aggravation were too much, friends said, and Mr. Cohen closed the restaurant and took a part-time job with Brooks Courier Service of Wilmington. His new job, at age 64, was delivering packages, commercial papers and nonnegotiable financial materials, said Robert Williams, a Brooks vice president. **********About 11 A.M., residents of a street named Todds Lane heard cries for help. Mr. Cohen, who had stopped his van to make a delivery, was pinned under a wheel. There were no witnesses to the accident. The police said later that he had apparently fallen and the van had rolled over him. **********Paramedics rushed Mr. Cohen to Christiana Hospital and he was able to talk to doctors after his arrival. But he soon became unconscious and died a short time later. **********The Driver **********The day's assignment was a short run for George C. Philpot, 50, a down-on-his-luck man with a thirst for strong drink who ferried cars for an auto auction company. **********Drivers like Mr. Philpot are not paid by the hour, but receive a set sum for a trip. That places a premium on driving fast. ''On some jobs, you make less than the minimum wage if a car breaks down or a battery needs jumping,'' said Mary Napier, Mr. Philpot's 52-year-old companion and fellow driver. **********She said he had worked 20 years as a casket maker in Richmond, Ind., where they lived, was divorced and had four grown children. **********''He was a fun-loving guy,'' she recalled, ''a big guy, 6-foot-1 and weighing maybe 220, a guy everyone liked.'' **********According to Ms. Napier, Mr. Philpot had downed two pints of vodka late the night before but did not appear drunk when they drove across the state line that morning to report to work in Franklin, Ohio. ''It was a perfect day,'' she recalled. ''We stopped at McDonald's and had biscuits and eggs for breakfast.'' They were among eight drivers carried in vans to a Buick dealership about seven miles to the north, where each was assigned a used car to transport to Franklin. **********Mr. Philpot's car was a green 1994 Pontiac Firebird. ''I told him to be careful with that performance car,'' Ms. Napier said. ''I drove one just like it two weeks before and it got away from me.'' **********Mr. Philpot made it only halfway back to Franklin. **********On a southbound ramp connecting Interstates 675 and 75, the Firebird suddenly fishtailed off a curve in the road and Mr. Philpot, trailing Ms. Napier's car, struggled to regain control. **********''I caught sight of him in my rear-view mirror,'' she said. ''I could see the look on his face. He knew he had lost it. It was such a horrible look.'' **********She watched the green car roll down an embankment, tumbling end over end and ejecting Mr. Philpot before coming to rest. ''He lived maybe 15 minutes,'' she said. **********Sterling Cockerham, 66, another driver in the group, told Ohio Highway Patrol investigators that the Firebird had passed him traveling 70 to 75 miles an hour before entering the ramp. **********''He passed me pretty good,'' the police accident report quoted Mr. Cockerham as saying. ''I remember thinking, 'Why is he going so fast for $4.75 an hour?' '' **********The Montgomery County Coroner's office reported later that the dead man's alcohol blood level was .270, nearly three times the legal standard for drunken driving. **********The Wood-Chip Bagger **********It had not been an easy 29 years for Rick Risdal. He had a drinking problem ''because he was so unhappy,'' said his mother, Sharon Risdal of Boone, Iowa, a custodial employee at Iowa State University. His girlfriend had moved back to Michigan with his children, Mrs. Risdal explained, ''and his heart was dripping with blood because he couldn't see his kids.'' **********Drinking led to drunken driving convictions, she said, and after the fourth one he served two years in an Iowa prison. When he got out last year, he moved to the Cordova area to be near his divorced father, who was in declining health, Mrs. Risdal explained. **********Rick's mother continued: ''He was a good-looking guy, with brilliant steel-gray eyes, and he loved working on cars. I still have a classic '78 Buick sitting out back, with a bucket of bolts and engine parts, that he never finished.'' **********Mrs. Risdal said she thought about a possible lawsuit against the bark-processing plant where her son died, but she said she was confused about her legal standing in the matter and doubted she could afford a retainer to hire a lawyer. **********''I was told the seat belt on that forklift didn't work,'' she said, referring to the vehicle her son was operating when it turned over on him. ''They should make damn sure those things work.'' **********Charles Dornfeld, Mr. Risdal's employer, said he would not comment on the accident because he had been told there might be lawsuits stemming from it. **********Willie Ziegler, a 19-year-old co-worker of Mr. Risdal who witnessed the accident, held out another version. **********''We had finished loading trucks and had some down time when Rick made some skidding turns coming out of the shed pretty fast,'' Mr. Ziegler said. ''It was pretty much horsing around. **********''Anyway, he hit some loose gravel and skidded off the pavement and flipped. He tried to jump out, but hit his head on the cage and fell to the ground with the forklift on top of him.'' **********Mrs. Risdal was notified about the accident at work and drove with a daughter across Iowa without knowing his fate. ''I wept all the way out there,'' she murmured. ''I knew he was going to die and I wanted to say goodbye.'' **********The Day Laborer **********It was Ismeal Acero's first day on the job and few of the other workers at a high school construction site on the south side of El Paso knew his name. **********''I believe his family lives in Juarez,'' said Roberta Cordova, secretary-treasurer of the El Paso Crane and Rigging Company, the outfit that hired him. Ciudad Juarez is just across the border from El Paso, where west Texas drives a pointed wedge deep into the sandy wastes of the Chihuahuan desert. **********''He seemed like a nice young man,'' Ms. Cordova continued. ''His in-laws said he worked at any job he could find.'' **********Because of El Paso's promixity to the border, and to cheap Mexican labor, hourly pay for men like Mr. Acero, who was 23, runs from the minimum wage to $7. **********Mr. Acero had earned about $10 by the time he was killed shortly before 10 A.M. Those present said later that they were not sure what went wrong. It was perhaps a language problem or just a misunderstanding, they said, or someone else goofed. It wasn't clear. **********Workers had erected concrete wall panels, some weighing more than 15,000 pounds, in the locker area of the school gymnasium, Ms. Cordova said. Mr. Acero's job was to move tools out of the way as other men worked, she continued, and somehow he removed or knocked away an unbolted brace supporting one of the panels. **********''It was a smaller panel with a big opening for a door built into it,'' she explained. ''But seven tons are going to get you every time.'' **********His back was turned to the wall when it tipped over and fell on him, she added. By the time other workers maneuvered a forklift truck to raise the slab from Mr. Acero's body, they could find no pulse. **********In the next few days, Ms. Cordova met with his young widow, Belinda, who is left with an infant girl, to offer assistance in filing workers' compensation and Social Security death claims. **********''She said she was O.K.,'' Ms. Cordova recalled. ''Things were fine. She didn't need help.'' The widow said her family would take care of the forms. **********Ms. Cordova paused, and a wry but not unsympathetic thought struck her. **********''As a widow, she and the baby may receive more money a month in benefits than Ismeal could earn while he was alive,'' she said. **********The Painter **********Bogdan Modrzejewski, 56, was a Polish immigrant who spoke little English but was handy with a paintbrush. He and Jacob Olkiewicz, 29, were painting soffits at 11:20 A.M. on the third-floor roof of an expensive house undergoing renovations in Winnetka, Ill., a well-to-do suburb of Chicago. **********''I couldn't see him from where I was working,'' Mr. Olkiewicz later said. ''I just heard him shout, and a crash.'' **********The police said Mr. Modrzejewski apparently fell through a plastic-covered opening in the roof that was being prepared for a skylight and landed in the basement three floors below. He died of head injuries 10 days later in an Evanston hospital. **********The Lineman **********Power company linemen spend much of their working time just inches from death -- dangerously close to cables or wires alive with thousands of volts of electricity. The challenge is to guard against the casual or accidental move that closes the distance. **********That moment arrived for Michael Pitts at about 2:30 P.M. that day. He was part of a three-man Duke Power Company crew installing a cross arm to a new electrical pole in a remote, forested section of western South Carolina, near Lake Keowee. After 17 years on the job, Mr. Pitts had a good work record and was conscientious about safety. He relished having an outdoor job that carried him up and down the Blue Ridge Mountains, where he had lived all his 40 years. **********He was raising himself and the cross arm in the cherrypicker-like bucket of the company truck when contact with a 7,200-volt primary line produced a crackling pop and a smoking flash that startled his co-workers on the ground. His shoulder touched the line, a company spokesman later said, and by the time the others lowered the bucket he was beyond help. **********''Just the month before, he paid off the mortgage on his home in Westminster,'' said his father, Ray E. Pitts, in a shaken voice. **********He was buried in the Coneross Baptist Church cemetery in Westminster, leaving behind a widow and two sons. **********A Working Woman **********Every year, Beryl Rockwell, 65, and her male companion of 49 years, Ora Hardy, escaped the hard winters of northern Maine by renting a place in Ocala, Fla. Watching her play shuffleboard, she might be mistaken for the retirees on the court, basking in the golden years. **********In fact, the 5-foot-3 Ms. Rockwell -- Brownie to her friends -- was a hard-driving working woman who could do the labor of a man half her age. **********''She was soft-spoken but tough,'' her niece, Diana Rockwell, said with pride. ''Whether it was driving a gravel dump truck, bulldozing or running a jackhammer, nothing fazed her.'' **********''Just two weeks before she died,'' Ms. Rockwell added, ''she cut half her thumb off on a job and drove 35 miles by herself to get to a hospital.'' **********Brownie and Mr. Hardy -- who is in his 70's -- lived together in Merrill, a township in rural Aroostook County, which forms the sparsely populated crown of Maine. The couple also worked together, the niece said, and their specialty was laying water and sewer pipes. **********On that Monday afternoon, they went to the trailer home of Lisa Condon in nearby Smyrna Mills to put in a well. ''It was the kind of job they must've done a thousand times,'' Ms. Rockwell said. **********The only difference this time was that it had been raining hard for two days, and the ground was heavy with mud. **********Mr. Hardy operated a backhoe to dig a trench 83 feet long, 3 feet wide and 7 feet deep. Brownie worked behind him, setting water pipe in the trench. **********''Ora's back was to her and he didn't see what happened,'' Ms. Rockwell said. ''Something made Brownie get down into the ditch. Probably a rock was in the way and the pipe wouldn't lay flat.'' **********It was a few minutes past 3. **********''Ora turned around and saw the trench wall had caved in on her,'' the niece continued. ''The only part of her not covered was hair on the top of her head.'' **********Mr. Hardy scrambled frantically to claw the earth and gravel away to allow her to breathe. Neighbors came running to help while the police and rescue squad were summoned. But they were too late. **********Winter now grips the north woods and the ground is frozen, too hard for even the steel teeth of a backhoe to gouge. Yet friends say Ora Hardy won't make the long trip to Florida this year by himself, preferring to spend this hard winter, as the past 49, close to his Brownie. **********The Insurance Man **********The same rains that made the earth unstable in Maine also made driving conditions wretched in the coastal section of New Hampshire. **********On I-95 near Hampton, Philip Fitzpatrick of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., pulled his car onto the shoulder of the southbound lanes at about 6:40 P.M. He had spent the day attending a training course in Dover, N.H., put on by his employer, the Liberty Mutual insurance group, and told others in his class he was off to see someone. **********No one knows why Mr. Fitzpatrick, a claims adjuster, pulled over, turned off his lights and got out of the car. All the police know is what the driver of an 18-wheel tractor-trailer with a load of frozen French fries told them. **********He said he spotted the reflector lights of the parked car and made out the dim outline of a man crouched down in the darkness near the front fender. He could see the man's face in his headlights, he told investigators. **********''Suddenly he feels an impact, brakes and pulls over,'' said Trooper Peter Gould of the State Police. **********Mr. Fitzpatrick, 36, was hurled more than 200 feet, the officer said, and was dead at the scene. **********''We checked the parked car and everything was operational and did not appear to be disabled in any way,'' Trooper Gould reported. ''It wasn't out of fuel, didn't have a flat tire, wasn't flooded out -- nothing.'' **********And somehow, he continued, the victim was struck by the center grille of the truck in the middle of the lane. ''It was odd and raised some real big questions that we haven't figured out,'' the trooper said. **********What was even stranger, in a creepy way, was the name hand-lettered on the side of the truck's door. **********''It was 'Fitzpatrick,' '' the officer said. **********Neal Comer, a White Plains lawyer representing the Fitzpatrick family in a possible lawsuit growing out of the accident, said Mr. Fitzpatrick had complained before his death about a loose bolt in the engine mount of his car that made the vehicle shake uncontrollably when driven. **********The Teen-Ager **********The last of the group to die was also the youngest, Rex Kim Lester, 17, of Salt Lake City. **********Since June, he had worked for his father's contracting business, and that evening, around 9:45, the teen-ager and his father were digging an 8-foot-deep trench for a sewer line in Riverton, a suburb. **********Investigators said the father, who was operating a backhoe, told them the earth wall collapsed on his son after he jumped into it to retrieve a surveying tool. It took 30 minutes of digging to uncover the youth's lifeless body, investigators said. **********Until last June the teen-ager had lived with his mother, Jackie Cook, in Green River, Wyo., before moving to Utah to work for his dad. The couple had divorced when Rex was a small boy. **********''He had a 3.8 grade point average in high school here,'' Mrs. Cook said the other day. ''He needed just one more English course to graduate and then he planned to go to technical college in Colorado.'' **********Mrs. Cook said her Mormon family had been in Utah since the 19th century. ''My great-grandfather on my mother's side helped settle Lehi in Utah,'' Mrs. Cook, who is assistant manager of a Subway sandwich shop, said with a note of pride. **********Lehi, like Riverton, lies in the early morning shadow of the snow-capped Wasatch Mmountains, a range he crossed on Oct. 18 to visit his mother back in Green River. **********''His older brother gave him a used van and he was real proud of it,'' she said. ''He fixed it up and wanted to show it off to his high-school buddies.'' **********When he left for the return trip to Utah the next day, a snowstorm was blowing down from the mountains. Mrs. Cook, who had lost 2 of her 10 children to childhood illnesses, wanted him to delay the return trip. When he persisted and told her not to worry, she prepared an Italian sub sandwich for the ride. **********Then she watched as the van went down the road and was swallowed up by the swirling snow."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/14/business/western-national-sells-stock-to-american-general.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-09-14", "snippet": "Western National Corp agrees to sell another $130 million of its stock to American General Corp, increasing American General's stake in company to 46.2 percent from 40 percent; Western National will issue 7.3 million shares of newly created prefer...", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WESTERN NATIONAL SELLS STOCK TO AMERICAN GENERAL", "print_headline": "WESTERN NATIONAL SELLS STOCK TO AMERICAN GENERAL", "body_text": " **********The Western National Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to sell another $130 million of its stock to the American General Corporation, increasing American General's stake in the company to 46.2 percent from 40 percent.

Gen. James R. Clapper Jr., former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. ''It shows how much the Russians have turned inwards.'' **********A senior American official who requested anonymity said the nearly two months without satellite pictures also ''shows the incredible depths to which the Soviet military has fallen.'' **********This official said Russian military officers may feel less need for satellite photos than their American counterparts, in part because the threats Russia faces are regional rather than global. ''They really don't care when Brazil puts its navy out to sea,'' he said. ''We do.'' **********Russia, the United States and France are the only countries with significant capabilities for photographing the Earth from outer space. China's program for satellite reconnaissance is in its infancy. **********Although it never lost all of its photo satellites, the American reconnaissance program was stretched thin by the 32-month grounding that followed the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. **********During the cold war, the Pentagon nervously watched as the Kremlin extended its reach into space. **********The Soviet Union deployed spy satellites to eavesdrop on communications and to intercept electronic emissions from the armada that accompanies American aircraft carriers. It launched satellites that provide advance warning of ballistic missile attacks and transmit messages to military units. **********It also managed an ambitious program of photo-reconnaissance satellites. Between 1962 and 1994, Moscow launched more than 800 photo-reconnaissance satellites into orbit, making up for their lack of durability with quantity. Over time, the Soviet satellites became more sophisticated and longer-lived. **********With the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the number of Russian photo satellites orbiting the earth sharply declined. In 1993 and 1994, the Russians launched only seven photo-reconnaissance satellites, according to Nicholas L. Johnson, an expert on orbital debris at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. **********Russia generally had two or more photo-reconnaissance satellites in space during that time, but this year Moscow ran into problems. **********On June 11, Kosmos 2331, one of two Russian photo-reconnaissance satellites in space, reached the end of its operational life and fell out of orbit. Nine days later, the Russians tried to launch a replacement satellite into orbit. But the mission failed within seconds when the rocket crashed a few miles from the launch site. That left the Russians with a single photo satellite, Kosmos 2320. It fell out of orbit on Sept. 28, and the Russians have yet to launch a replacement. **********Public concern arose here only last week when the newspaper Izvestia reported that the Russian military was been left without a single photo-reconnaissance satellite. **********Along with this week's dramatic failure of Russia's $300 million Mars mission, the photo-reconnaissance gap is embarrassing for a nation that sent the first man into space. **********The setbacks in Russia's space programs have experienced other embarrassing signs of financial strain. Because of budget cutbacks, Moscow had to turn to the Americans for help in tracking the errant Mars spacecraft. **********Russia has also postponed bringing astronauts from its Mir space station back to Earth because of delays in building the necessary rockets. To raise badly needed cash, the Russians allowed Pepsi-Cola to use the Mir space station as a prop in the company's campaign to advertise its new blue soda cans."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/18/business/suit-over-restrictions-on-encryption-software-clears-early-hurdle.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Lewis", "pub_date": "1996-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 461, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Suit Over Restrictions on Encryption Software Clears Early Hurdle", "print_headline": "Suit Over Restrictions on Encryption Software Clears Early Hurdle", "body_text": " **********Ruling that software code is speech that deserves First Amendment protection, a Federal judge has refused a request by the Government to dismiss a mathematician's lawsuit accusing it of wrongly blocking him from freely publishing and exporting his computer program. **********The ruling, by Judge Marilyn Hall Patel of Federal District Court in San Francisco, comes at a preliminary stage of what is expected to be a long courtroom struggle over the Government's policy of restricting the export and publishing of encryption software.

A year ago, when that debt stood at \u00a38.2 billion, Eurotunnel announced that it was suspending interest payments and seeking a restructuring of its obligations. **********Under the deal, Eurotunnel's banks will take \u00a31 billion of what is owed them and convert it into shares in the company.

Those approvals are expected by late March. **********Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, said the deal would leave the company \"in a position to endure enormous pressures for years to come.\" **********Freely acknowledging the deal's complexity, however, Sir Alastair characterized it as containing a series of interlocking conditions where \"every-thing is dependent on something and nothing is protected from everything.\" **********What is clear is that the deal gives the company a variety of financial options that could help it through difficult commercial conditions without having to ask for fresh assistance, analysts said. **********\"I think their No. 1 priority was a reconstruction that was seen to work, to ensure that there would be no chance of the company coming back for another refinancing in three more years,\" said Jeff Summers, head of research at the debt-trading concern Klesch & Co. in London. **********Among those options are such complex instruments as the stabilization notes that Eurotunnel can \"pay\" to its banks should it not have enough cash to pay them interest on debt.

He remembers, too, how eagerly local broadcasters in Egypt and Bahrain agreed, when given the chance in the early days of the war, to pass the  network's satellite feed to their viewers. **********The lesson -- if, indeed, they needed it at all -- was not lost on some influential and wealthy Saudi businessmen interested both in an investment opportunity and in gaining some measure of control over the distribution of information and entertainment to 300 million Arabic speakers across the Middle East and North Africa. **********This triggered people's interest in the power of satellite television,\" Mr. Abdallah said in a recent interview. Indeed, over the last five years, three privately owned satellite broadcasting companies have begun targeting people around the world who speak Arabic. Borne aloft by several billion dollars of Saudi investments, together they are transmitting 26 channels, most to the Middle East and North Africa but also to Europe and the United States. **********So it was hardly surprising that, at the same time as CNN's ghostly images of aerial bombs or Scud missiles exploding were appearing on television sets in Cairo, a group of investors led by a Saudi businessman named Walid al-Ibrahim -- a brother-in-law of King Fahd -- was starting the Middle Eastern Broadcasting Center, or MBC. Using Arabsat satellites operated by a consortium of Arab state television companies, MBC started broadcasting news, sports and entertainment from London in 1991. **********The early broadcasts of MBC and the Egyptian Government's satellite channel were the beginning. Eventually, Arabic-language broadcasts could reach 16 million households with television sets in the Middle East and 10 million more in North Africa. In the process they are beginning to provide a homogenous -- and decidedly secular -- cultural experience in a region most known for cultural and political divisions. At a time when Muslim fundamentalism, with its deep distrust of foreign and secular influences, is challenging governments across the region, satellite television is opening the region to the rest of the world. **********In 1993, Arab Radio and Television, or ART, began broadcasting in Arabic and  English from its headquarters in Fucino, a town in central Italy. It has added two new channels a year since then, with films, children's shows and sports programs. Mr. Abdallah left CNN to become ART's executive vice president. **********In 1994, another station that is based in Italy, Orbit Satellite Television and Radio Network, began transmitting 19 television channels to the Middle East. Two are Arabic-language channels, the rest use either English or French. **********These private satellite businesses, along with government-owned satellite broadcasting systems already running or being readied in a number of countries including Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, are developing in tandem. Sometimes they work together -- Orbit carries Jordan's state-run service -- but  more often they are engaging in lively competition. \"The next five years will bring very tough competition,\" said Mustafa Karkouti, an executive at MBC in London. **********The Saudi-backed private satellite broadcasters receive revenue from a combination of advertising and subscriber fees, but thus far none is profitable. Advertising rates are extremely low by American standards; MBC typically charges between $2,140 and $3,780 for a 30-second advertisement in prime evening viewing hours. By comparison, the cheapest such ad costs $80,000 in the United States, while a 30-second spot on NBC's perennial hit \"Seinfeld\" costs $490,000. **********The Saudis' biggest government-supported rival is the Egyptian Satellite Channel, or ESC,which, according to the president of the Egyptian Radio and Television Union -- the equivalent of a government ministry for broadcasting --  brings in $5 million annually in advertising revenues and subscriber fees. The groups under the E.R.T.U. that are responsible for producing programs are equally profitable, said the E.R.T.U.'s president, Amin Bassiouny. **********Viewer fees for the new services -- the equivalent of the monthly rates paid  by subscribers to cable or direct satellite broadcasts in the United States -- vary widely. **********In addition to broadcasting over ESC, the E.R.T.U. joined with private investors in 1992 to start Cable Network Egypt, which charges subscribers a flat $90 monthly rate for a package of services including CNN, MTV and three other channels. Private stations like Orbit are more sophisticated. Orbit's Cyprus-based automatic booking system allows subscribers to phone in and change  the number and choice of channels on a monthly basis. They are then billed accordingly. **********While none of the executives of these private concerns believe that profit is possible before 1998 at the earliest -- and some in the business say it will take far longer -- the size of the potential audience, makes them believe it is  worth the wait. In Egypt alone, the E.R.T.U.'s president contends there is an audience of at least a million people for ESC. **********The three commercial networks -- MBC, Orbit and ART -- are also vying to gain sizable audiences by securing rights to material like the Turner Broadcasting System's CNN and Walt Disney's ESPN International sports channel, which Orbit broadcasts, or N.C.A.A. basketball, which is featured on ART. **********And the commercial broadcasters are also producing fresh Arab-language programs. ART, for instance, produces soap operas, talk shows and children's programs at studios in the Middle East and Western Europe. This growing market for Arabic material has spawned new television production centers and revived old ones. In Cairo, the traditional hub of the Arab-language film and entertainment industry, the Government is building a new, $300 million production center. **********But despite the Egyptian origin of most programming, the gush of Saudi Arabian money behind the satellite television revolution is still raising concerns that the popular new channels could exert a dominant influence. For if  Egyptian tastes, accents and slang has predominated until now, producers are increasingly attentive to more conservative Saudi attitudes in such matters as the way women are attired and how they speak and behave. **********\"Many movies cater to Saudi tastes,\" said Selim Hussein, a Cairo civil engineer who two years ago banded together with 12 other tenants in his apartment house to buy five fixed satellite dishes. Each tenant chipped in $1,200. Satellite broadcasts, he suggested, might be the antidote as well as the ailment. \"With open skies, at the end, you have a choice,\" he said. **********And the sometimes prohibitive cost of the hardware required to receive these  broadcasts -- which has meant the viewers of satellite broadcasts tend to come from the wealthy and Western-educated slice of the Arab world -- is slowly coming down. In Cairo, Samsung sells a package of a fixed dish, receiver and television set for about $740. **********The broadcasters themselves are in the market for hardware and services. Orbit, according to the network's spokesman Thomas Kington, gets its satellite decoders from Scientific Atlanta, a satellite equipment maker in Georgia. **********Though all three private stations began by using the Arabsat satellites, Orbit and ART have switched to commercial satellites. Orbit's broadcasts are sent via an Intelsat satellite that hovers in a geostationary orbit over the Mediterranean Sea. This spring, ART will begin using a new Panamsat satellite over the Indian Ocean. And the Egyptian Government has signed a $180 million contract with France's Matra Marconi and Alcatel Espace to build and launch on a French rocket Egypt's own broadcast satellite. **********So, while the state-owned terrestrial broadcasters still are the sole source  of television in most cities like Cairo, the number of satellite dishes grows daily. Executives for all three companies are reticent about numbers. Orbit says it has 80,000 subscribers, up from 56,000 in December. The other Saudi-backed businesses send their signals for free, so they have as yet no way to make accurate estimates of how many viewers they have. **********Some broadcasters offer decoders capable of filtering out selected material,  a feature that is proving popular. \"What you would call PG-13, I would call PG-18,\" said Ghada Shahbander, a marketing consultant who is Mr. Hussein's wife. They have four children. **********Orbit's chief executive, Alexander B. Zilo, an American who once did the same job at Rupert Murdoch's Star TV has described Orbit's viewers as \"college-educated, usually having studied abroad,\" and \"nostalgic for the American sort of life style.\" **********Orbit was put together two years ago with about $1 billion in investments by  the Saudi-controlled Mawarid Group, one of the largest private conglomerates in  the Middle East. ART, which began about a year earlier, was started by one of the original MBC investors, Saleh Abdullah Kamel, another Saudi executive. He sold his stake in MBC for $60 million, added to this from his own substantial personal resources and formed another group of investors to get the new project  started. **********The Saudi-backed companies chose to base their operations in Italy and Britain to ease satellite links and tap a reservoir of European and American technicians -- and, possibly, to avoid political pressure from Arab governments. **********Indeed, the reaction of Arab governments to the private commercial broadcasts has not always been cordial. In 1994, Orbit contracted with the British Broadcasting Corporation's Arabic service to provide newscasts, and an early BBC program featured interviews with Saudi Arabian dissidents. **********[Last week, Orbit abruptly announced it was ending the contract with the BBC  in outrage over a recent report by a Panorama news program on capital punishment in Saudi Arabia. **********In a statement that appeared dictated by Orbit's Saudi owners, Mr. Zilo attacked the report as a \"sneering and racist attack on Islamic law and culture.\" Panorama had shown preparations for a public execution in Saudi Arabia and interviewed a Filipino woman who described how she had been flogged for breaching Saudi law by appearing in public with male companions. **********The BBC's contract with Orbit required Panorama to \"take account of local sensitivities,\" Mr. Zilo's statement said. \"This they did not do,\" he added. **********A BBC spokesman, Phil Johnstone, said the contract with Orbit gave it \"full editorial control,\" and said the BBC was satisfied it had complied with its obligations \"as to editorial standards, content, quality, and local sensitivities.\"]"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/20/world/for-israeli-settlers-a-dream-revived.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas Jehl", "pub_date": "1996-07-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 834, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "For Israeli Settlers, a Dream Revived", "print_headline": "For Israeli Settlers, a Dream Revived", "body_text": " **********For nearly three years, Yaldena Nawi and her young family have gazed wistfully at a house that stands empty in this remote Jewish settlement on a rock-strewn hillside surrounded by Palestinian villages. **********Built by the last Likud Government, the house was locked shut before it became a home, declared off-limits by a Labor Government that tried to curb Jewish colonization of occupied Arab lands. **********But now that Israel's pendulum has swung to the right again, emboldened advocates are calling for the steel doors and iron bars here and across the West Bank and Gaza to be flung open as part of a surge that would allow Jewish settlers like the Nawis to move to the house they call their own. **********\"We've had enough of the trailer,\" said Mrs. Nawi, who with her husband and two children took refuge there rather than abandon a plan to settle here. \"But of course we wanted Netanyahu to win, and now we can have some hope.\" **********With the United States and the Palestinians warning darkly against erecting new obstacles to the quest for peace, Israel's new Prime Minister has not yet said whether he shares his supporters' vision of a doubling or tripling of the ranks of Jewish settlers in Arab lands in the next four years. **********But the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has made clear that he is not willing to force new settlement to a halt, and it is a fair bet that his first step will be to lift the restrictions that have left some 3,000 housing units like the ones in Nili vacant. **********That prospect alone outrages Palestinian leaders and some on the Israeli left, who say that an Israeli Government serious about peace should be preparing to evacuate Jewish settlements, not expand or build new ones. **********\"This is the clearest sign that the new Government is regressing to four years back,\" David Zucker, a member of Parliament from the leftist Meretz party, said of the notion of unlocking latched doors. \"This is the end of the drying-out period for the settlements, and the beginning of their rebirth.\" **********Nili, established 15 years ago, is one among a chain of Jewish settlements originally intended as a barrier to a widening of Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank. Unlike settlements closer to Jerusalem endorsed by Labor and Likud leaders alike, the more far-flung community is among those seen by critics as staking a claim on Arab lands too vast to be compatible with any final peace settlement. **********On his visit to Washington last week, Mr. Netanyahu pointed to what he called the \"natural growth\" of settlements in the last four years. During that period,  the number of settlers increased from about 98,000 to 145,000. **********But under Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, most of that increase took place in the outskirts of Jerusalem, and Mr. Netanyahu's policy will not be measured by the magnitude of further settlement alone, but also by where it takes place. **********With a population that stands now at just 500, Nili may prove to be a telling gauge. **********One-third of its 120 families live in trailers, unable to build or buy houses of their own. While costly private construction has gone forward, the Government has not begun work on a new unit since July 1992, when Mr. Rabin and his Labor Party took power and called a halt to the huge building campaign in the settlements that was begun by Ariel Sharon, the last Likud housing minister. **********Of the projects then under way in Nili, only five prefabricated duplexes -- each housing a pair of mirror-image units -- were permitted to be completed. **********Mrs. Nawi, then 30, had fully expected that she and her husband would buy one of the 600-square-foot homes priced at $45,000 when they planned their move here with an infant son in August 1993. They had even picked a favorite. **********Their timing proved unfortunate. By the time the Nawis were ready to buy, the Government had tightened its restrictions, barricading the four houses that remained unsold in a ban that Phineas Wallerstein, chairman of the influential Judea and Samaria Settlements Council, still scorns as Labor's \"decree from the  skies.\" **********Like others whose hopes were dashed, the couple stayed in Nili, squeezed into a modest trailer they rent for $100 a month. Their presence, they believe, helped to reinforce Jewish claims to biblical lands. **********In conversations here, Mrs. Nawi and others said they recognized that the opening of the closed houses could have broad consequences. The trailers that would be vacated would be filled by new settlers, swelling Nili's population, they said, as would a parallel ruling easing restrictions on towing new trailers to the settlement. **********But Mrs. Nawi, who will turn 33 next month, said she was inclined to think more personally, about the weeds that have grown and walls that have leaked as her intended home and those nearby remain untended. **********\"Three thousand houses -- well, maybe that's a matter of policy,\" she said, holding her son Nimrod in her arms. \"But four houses -- that's just being stubborn.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/05/world/incumbent-in-romania-a-leftist-faces-a-runoff.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1996-11-05", "snippet": "Romanian Pres Ion Iliescu faces runoff election on Nov 17 against Emil Constantinescu; with 50 percent of votes counted in Nov 3 Presidential election, Iliescu reportedly has 33 percent and Constantinescu 28 percent (M)", "word_count": 276, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Incumbent in Romania, a Leftist, Faces a Runoff", "print_headline": "Incumbent in Romania, a Leftist, Faces a Runoff", "body_text": " **********A third term for President Ion Iliescu, who has led Romania on a leftist course since the collapse of Communism, seemed uncertain today after partial results from the presidential election on Sunday were announced. **********Mr. Iliescu, 66, faces a runoff on Nov. 17 against Emil Constantinescu, an academic and centrist politician. **********With 50 percent of the votes counted, Pro-TV, a private television station, reported tonight that Mr. Iliescu had about 33 percent, with Mr. Constantinescu at 28 percent and Petre Roman, a former reformist Prime Minister, at 21 percent.

Yet although the trading of sulfur emissions between utilities is now permitted, there is not much activity in this market, and prices of marketable permits are far below initial projections. Does that mean the system is not working -- that free market environmentalism is being sabotaged by myopic corporate executives or hostile state regulators? **********According to the latest studies, the answer is both cheerier and more complicated. So far, it seems, trading among utilities has not been needed to meet Federal standards. Indeed, A. Denny Ellerman, director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy at M.I.T., argues that thanks to the plunging price of low-sulfur coal \"compliance has been essentially free\" in some parts of the country. **********It is not yet known, though, whether the utilities will exploit the advantages of trading when pollution controls are tightened in coming years. \"The issue has yet to be tested,\" says Daniel J. Dudek of the Environmental Defense Fund. **********Federal law requires utilities to limit the sulfur emissions from the country's 110 dirtiest plants -- all of them coal-fired -- to 2.5 pounds for every million British thermal units of energy generated. In 2000, the limit will be extended to all power plants and maximum sulfur emissions will be pared to 1.2 pounds to a million B.T.U.'s. (A million B.T.U.'s is enough heat to make about 100 kilowatt-hours of electricity, a little less than the typical American household uses in a week). **********Unlike earlier legislation, the Clean Air Act of 1990 applies to the corporate emissions average: a utility may exceed the limit on one plant by running a very clean operation at another. What's more, it allows individual utilities to buy permits from other power producers, or to bank excess compliance for future use. **********In 1990 the Environmental Protection Agency estimated that the right to emit  of ton of sulfur would be worth about $750. The figure represented the agency's  best guess about the cost of the alternatives -- shutting dirty plants, switching fuels and adding catalytic sulfur scrubbers. But permits have generally run below $150 a ton, and organized trading on the Chicago Board of Trade has been far lighter than expected. Just one utility in six is using the market to comply with the law. **********One explanation is that the market has been sabotaged. If, for example, state regulators allow utilities to earn a guaranteed return on outlays for expensive  scrubbers, but don't allow them to profit from skillful emissions trading, there would not be much demand for marketable permits. **********In fact, there has not been much trading because utilities have taken advantage of their newly won flexibility to offset emissions by cleaning up other plants within their own systems. \"Two-thirds of gains have come through intra-utility trading,\" said Robert N. Stavins of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. **********One key has been access to cheap, clean fuel. Increased competition among railroads, made possible by rail deregulation, has sharply reduced the price of  low-sulfur coal mined in the Plains states for delivery to the Midwest and the South. That allows utilities to burn coal in some plants with as little as a half-pound of sulfur in each million B.T.U.'s, reducing overall utility emissions to the allowable tonnage at little or no cost. **********Dallas Burtraw, an economist at Resources for the Future, also notes that new technology has lowered the cost of meeting the sulfur standard. Fuel blending -- mixing low- and high-sulfur coal -- has proved easier than expected. And the price of scrubbing sulfur from smokestacks has fallen by half since 1989. **********What's yet to be determined, though, is whether utilities will use the market when pollution requirements tighten and the economic advantages of emissions trading emerge. A number of states are putting pressure on power producers to buy high-sulfur coal from local mines. Indeed, last year a Federal appeals court struck down Illinois legislation that would have required utilities to install scrubbers -- and thus become a captive market for high-sulfur coal. **********Even the states without such parochial agendas are sending out mixed signals. Some environmental groups are still ready to cheer on local regulators who frown on utilities that choose to \"pay to pollute.\" And no state has ruled that utilities with the foresight to buy marketable permits cheaply will be allowed to keep the benefits. **********Perhaps the best hope is that the wave of electric utility deregulation will  end the states' will or capacity to micromanage environmental fixes. If states forgo the right to dictate who sells power at what price -- if electricity is sold in a national market -- competition will force producers to minimize costs. \"At least a billion dollars a year in savings\" is on the line, Mr. Burtraw says."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/26/world/despite-doubts-official-gives-go-ahead-to-bosnian-vote.html": {"writer_name": "Chris Hedges", "pub_date": "1996-06-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 971, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Despite Doubts, Official Gives Go-Ahead to Bosnian Vote", "print_headline": "Despite Doubts, Official Gives Go-Ahead to Bosnian Vote", "body_text": " **********The European diplomat in charge of organizing national elections in Bosnia said today that although conditions had not been met for free and fair elections, the vote should nevertheless go ahead in September as scheduled. **********Under the Balkan peace plan the official, Flavio Cotti, as chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, was supposed to certify that conditions in Bosnia will allow fair elections before setting a date and supervising the vote.

A copyright problem, it seems.", "body_text": " **********AS they careen into the information age, the media are increasingly becoming  the butts of their own jokes. **********The Internet is awash in spoof press releases (some may recall the classic, \"Microsoft Buys Catholic Church\"). The comedian Dana Carvey simultaneously blisters and bows to the gods of advertising on his new television series. The hilarious cable television show \"Mystery Science Theater 3000,\" now a feature film, provides acidic yet affectionate commentary on movies and pop culture via  two robots and a guy who sit in the front row of a theater and wisecrack their way through stunningly bad films. **********And considering today's preoccupation with all things interactive, it's not  surprising that a couple of Hollywood multimedia types would find a way to stir  technology into today's irreverent media attitude. The result is a CD-ROM title, still in development, that they call Movieoke. **********The Movieoke concept is derived from the karaoke sing-along, a popular pastime in Japan that has been moderately successful in the United States as well. Karaoke companies license the rights to record a popular song from a music publishing company. Then they record the sound track, without vocals, mix it with some video, and print song lyrics along the bottom of the video screen. **********Karaoke happens when a normally thoughtful human being gets up on a stage, usually in a bar and after a certain amount of imbibing, and proceeds to sing the song, accompanied by aforementioned sound track and video. Fun is had all around. **********Public humiliation, however, is not a requisite of Movieoke, which can be performed in the comfort and privacy of your computer nook. O.K.? There, the disk plays scenes from classic movies -- the demonstration version uses scenes from \"Casablanca\" and \"Young Frankenstein\" -- strips out the dialogue, and allows you to dub your voice in place of, say, Humphrey Bogart's or Madeline Kahn's. **********Speaking into your PC's microphone, you can read the real movie script as it  scrolls along your computer screen -- whether in your own voice, your best Bogie or, say, an imitation of Mr. Ed, the talking horse. As with karaoke, this provokes much hilarity. And you can save the dubbed dialogue to a hard disk or diskette so you can replay it for the amusement of your friends and family, or to send along to other Movieoke players. **********Who knows if there's a mass market for such a toy, but the developers -- Harry Marks and Jim Lambert -- have interesting resumes. Mr. Marks, a former television vice president and creative director for both ABC and CBS, is now a multimedia graphic designer and senior adviser to the American Film Institute's  Advanced Technology Program. Mr. Lambert, a multimedia author who developed the  recently released Hot Wheels Computer Cars for the Mattel Corporation, also just shipped three CD-ROM's -- \"Cine*Noir,\" \"Bimbo Movie Bash\"and \"Sci-Fi Movie Machine\" -- that enable users to splice together their own movies using clips from different B-grade genres. **********Mr. Marks and Mr. Lambert, who've been working on the project since January 1995, want to ship Movieoke's dubbing software, along with 10 movie scenes, on the first Movieoke CD-ROM. Later versions would bundle the dubbing software with scenes from specific genres like noir, romance and action adventure. **********Movie studios are lining up for the opportunity to participate, right? After  all, most Hollywood studios became involved with interactive media in the first  place because they saw it as a way to \"repurpose\" existing assets and recoup a few more dollars from material they had already paid to produce. **********But as it turns out, Hollywood doesn't have much of a sense of humor when it  comes to sacred cash cows like \"Casablanca.\" Mr. Marks and Mr. Lambert have found they can't finish Movieoke, even though the technical guts of the program  are completed, because they can't buy the rights to use the classic movie scenes that everyone recognizes. **********\"Because amateur performers could make a mockery of the film, on an ongoing basis rather than a one-shot parody, this kind of usage could damage its value,\" said Mickey Kapp, a music industry consultant and former Warner Music executive who has dealt extensively with copyright issues. He said that parody writers in the music world have been successfully sued for \"damaging a copyright\" if they changed the interpretation of the original material. **********Because of this, Mr. Kapp said, he finds it unlikely that the film studios would want to risk such damage by issuing licenses for Movieoke. **********This situation isn't necessarily curtains for Movieoke. Though dubbing a B-movie doesn't have the same cachet as intoning your own \"Hasta la vista, baby,\" as Arnold Schwarzenegger glowers from your monitor, the purveyors of B-grade footage are usually more than willing to license for laughs. And if Movieoke were to incorporate the requisite software tools so that folks with their own video and computer equipment could create their own Movieokes, then there still may be a business in the technology. **********But whether or not Movieoke ever makes it out of development, the larger issues it raises are worth pondering. Garry Hare, the president of Fathom Pictures, a multimedia developer in Sausalito, Calif., likes to tell the story of a baseball CD-ROM title he wanted to create in the early 1990's. By the time  he toted up what he would need to pay to the players to use their likenesses, and to Major League Baseball, and to music publishers -- and on and on -- Mr. Hare said he would actually be paying out more in licensing fees than he could recoup from any reasonable retail price for the disk. **********The artistic and intellectual property issues of media re-use are important,  in an era when digital technology is making replication instantaneous and infinite -- with or without the permission of the copyright holder. **********But whether or not they choose to play along with new-media pranksters like Movieoke, entertainment companies may need to begin rethinking their old-media notions of copyright sanctity. Otherwise, they may end up copyrighting themselves right out of the few potentially lucrative markets in multimedia."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/11/business/need-to-cut-costs-order-out-outsourcing-saves-money-but-labor-is-frustrated.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1996-04-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1697, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Need to Cut Costs?

From the spotless white floors to the cool, filtered air to the young workers in white hair nets and white plastic laboratory coats, the factory seems more suited to the production of computer components than auto parts. **********Far different are the cavernous buildings in Dayton, Ohio, filled with endless rows of clanking, roaring machinery, where the General Motors Corporation makes brakes for nearly all its cars and trucks. A few rusting fans  hang from the exposed support beams, the only relief when temperatures soar above 100 degrees in the summer. The floors are concrete painted black, and the  air smells of oil and sweat. The workers, mostly graying men in their 40's and 50's, wear greasy orange jump suits or blue jeans -- and nobody has a hairnet. **********Across America, executives at big companies like G.M. are looking at their less efficient operations with dismay and trying to find ways to buy more parts  from low-cost outside vendors like ITT. By buying more of their parts, executives can save money and keep their businesses competitive; for them, the difference between G.M.'s factories in Dayton and ITT's plant here is the difference between yesterday and tomorrow. **********But for many workers, the executives' tomorrow is a frightening prospect. G.M.'s unionized employees in Dayton earn about $19 an hour, and when they get sick they can go to almost any doctor, paying no deductible and a minuscule co-payment. ITT's nonunion workers earn $9.90 an hour and choose their doctors from the lists of two health maintenance organizations. **********The contrast between the two brake plants makes stark the logic that has compelled so many manufacturers to shift jobs to low-cost, outside suppliers over the last decade, as well as the uphill -- if not quixotic -- resistance from labor unions. **********Because of the United Automobile Workers union's success in driving up wages  and benefits at the Big Three auto makers, the savings from buying outside parts are especially large in the auto industry. Wages and fringe benefits at the average auto parts factory are only a third of what the Big Three pay their unionized workers. As a result, the parts industry has become a front line in the battle between management and labor over corporate downsizing. **********But outsourcing is a prime cost-saving strategy throughout the economy, from  the insurance company that replaces its security guards and cafeteria workers with outside contractors to manufacturing giants like the Boeing Company, which  buys airplane parts from factories in Japan, Mexico and Xian, China, that its own employees once fabricated in the United States. **********With the most to lose, labor unions have fought a largely unsuccessful rear guard action against the shifting of jobs to outside contractors. In settling a  strike last year, Boeing pledged only to look for other jobs for workers displaced by foreign parts purchases and to notify its union of future plans for the purchase of outside parts. **********Similarly, the 17-day strike last month at G.M.'s Dayton brake factories stemmed largely from worker objections to four G.M. contracts to buy outside brake parts. G.M. settled the strike with a pledge to hire 417 more workers in Dayton and inform the union about future plans for parts purchases; the four contracts remain in place. **********Indeed, Timothy D. Leuliette, the president of ITT Industries' automotive operations, declared in a speech earlier this year that it was inevitable that auto makers would buy more parts from outside suppliers, because the public was  demanding affordable cars. \"Fighting to defend higher-cost jobs in an industry undergoing strategic restructuring ultimately can have little success,\" Mr. Leuliette said. **********The U.A.W. contends that the problem lies with corporations that would rather turn to outside vendors than invest the money in their old factories. **********\"They're fooling themselves when they say we've got to compete with other factories that have the best techniques, that have the best manufacturing processes,\" said Richard Shoemaker, the U.A.W. vice president who oversees relations with G.M. \"They have an obligation to put money in the plants.\" **********The issues are seldom drawn as clearly as by comparing ITT's factory here with G.M.'s two brake plants in Dayton. **********Morale is high at the ITT factory, partly because of a collegial relationship between managers and the nonunionized workers. Walk the immaculate factory floor here and the cheerfulness is unmistakable. **********\"I like it a lot,\" said Deanna Cayton, a 26-year-old worker who paused as she assembled brake valves. \"The people are great, the work's not hard; it's clean,  very clean.\" **********W. Steve Dickerson, the plant manager here, dresses much like his workers, wearing a short-sleeve green polo shirt on one recent day and putting on a hairnet and white plastic laboratory coat before going on the factory floor. He  knows the workers by name and talks easily with them about their families.    ITT manufactures brakes for all the Big Three auto makers. When the factory won a Ford Motor Company quality award last year, ITT spent $50,000 on a lavish  party in which Mr. Dickerson and other managers dressed in tuxedos and served roast beef to the 900 workers. **********Yet ITT's intentions in throwing the party were not just philanthropic. \"In the next two weeks, we picked up $200,000 in productivity,\" Mr. Dickerson said. **********Even before last month's strike, morale was terrible in Dayton. Some workers  there refer to the factories as the \"state prison.\" They labor under the watchful eye of security guards and foremen. Few workers smile or wave as Daniel E. Warrell, the factory manager, strides by in his dark blue pin stripe suit. **********The floors in Dayton are filthy, with oily slime in spots. When an aide to Mr. Warrell reached down recently to pick up an oil-sodden, crushed cardboard box in an aisle, the factory manager waved him away. \"That's O.K.,\" he said. He  later apologized for his factory's dirty appearance, for which he blamed the need to bring production back to normal quickly after the strike. **********Another reason is that Dayton factories do produce some mechanical parts not  made in Asheville, contributing to difference in noise and dirt between the factories. **********While the Dayton factories had a cookout last year, there were no parties or  big staff gatherings when the strike ended. \"Management had meetings,\" Mr. Warrell said, but relied on the foremen to talk to the assembly workers. **********The sheer complexity of the union work rules agreed to by management over the years at the G.M. factories make management's own job much more difficult. Partly because the Dayton factories produce a wider range of parts, but mostly because of the work rules, the G.M. brake operations have 35 different categories of semiskilled workers, including those who work on the assembly line. There are also 16 categories of skilled workers, like electricians. **********ITT has only two categories of semiskilled workers in Asheville, and skilled  workers are on salary. The company buys most of its equipment from outside vendors and asks employees to change work assignments frequently, partly to keep their jobs interesting. \"We never get into 'It's not my job,' \" Mr. Dickerson said. **********The difference in labor-management relations is particularly striking when it comes to the sharing of information. **********In Dayton, one of the strikers' demands was that G.M. begin telling them more about future brake plans.  But in Asheville, without strikes or union contracts, Mr. Dickerson makes monthly presentations to assembly line workers. He provided  a detailed appraisal in late March of the factory's contracts and business plans for the next several years, even discussing a $650 million Ford contract that ITT did not disclose publicly until the following week. **********But while the Asheville factory may offer a much more pleasant, open work environment, the pay and benefits are considerably inferior to G.M.'s. Workers in Dayton earn an average of $69,000 a year, including close to $30,000 in overtime from working six- and seven-day weeks. ITT's workers earn around $20,000 a year, with little overtime available. **********Yet the workers here have few complaints about their pay. One of the reasons  is a basic shift in American society: the young, married employees typically have working spouses, so they have two incomes to support their households. By contrast, many U.A.W. workers in Dayton still support their families on a single paycheck. **********But the bigger reason for workers' acceptance of lower pay here is that the burden of history weighs much less heavily on Asheville, where pay scales have long been much lower than in the industrial Midwest. **********The Asheville factory stands on land that used to belong to the Biltmore Estate, which surrounds the 250-room French chateau built in 1895 by George Vanderbilt as a bucolic summer retreat. ITT was the first big auto parts company to build a factory in the area, setting up operations in 1989. The main competitor then for industrial workers was a Burlington Industries textile factory that paid $7.50 an hour and closed in 1991. At $9.90 an hour, the wages  at ITT seem generous. **********\"The pay is great,\" said Malina Mcasee, a 39-year-old former Burlington worker, as she used tweezers to insert a pin into each anti-lock brake passing on the assembly line.  The health care benefits are also the best in the area, said Ms. Cayton, who is expecting a baby in mid-May. **********The burden of history is very different at G.M.'s factories. Dayton has been  a high-wage, unionized town of skilled industrial workers for generations. One of the G.M. plants bears a small historical marker noting that the Wright Brothers built some of their first commercial airplanes at the site. **********In the late 1980's, G.M. was a pioneer in making anti-lock brakes, and the units turned out by the Dayton factories rely more on mechanical parts than the  electronic gear at the heart of ITT's slightly less expensive but equally reliable brakes. **********Now, G.M. plans to install a \"clean room\" production line for highly sophisticated electronic brakes inside one of the Dayton plants by 1998. And while that will not eliminate the differences between the Dayton and Asheville operations, it likely means more U.A.W. members will be wearing hairnets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/03/world/soweto-journal-dreamer-with-a-bookstore-wakes-to-fiscal-facts.html": {"writer_name": "Donald McNeil", "pub_date": "1996-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 862, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soweto Journal;Dreamer With a Bookstore Wakes to Fiscal Facts", "print_headline": "Soweto Journal;Dreamer With a Bookstore Wakes to Fiscal Facts", "body_text": " **********Soweto's first bookstore is now one year old. It is still the only bookstore  in this immense black township. That probably won't be true for long. **********If its owner, Solomon Sikakane, is right, there may be three in local townships soon. If his wife, Edith, is right, soon there will be none. **********Mr. Sikakane, a retired school administrator, says that his Imfundo Thuto bookstore in the new Dobsonville Mall here is a labor of love. \"I'm not looking  at this on a profit basis,\" he said at the opening last year. \"I'm looking at it as the social upliftment of my people.\" **********Still, a book lover has to eat. The Sikakanes are barely able to pay the $450 monthly rent on the store. **********The small store has few shelves, and a lot of air between the books.  Many are simply samples of what can be ordered. Even the impulse buys -- the daily papers -- are in very short stacks. The store has a handsome display stand for Nelson Mandela's autobiography, \"Long Walk to Freedom,\" but no copies. **********\"Even today, someone will ask for it -- Mandela, Mandela, Mandela,\" said Mrs. Sikakane from behind the counter one recent morning. \"But we have no capital, and the publisher will not give them in advance.\" **********Mr. Sikakane has great dreams. Developers planning the first malls in nearby  Kagiso and Tembisa townships have asked about franchising the name Imfundo Thuto, which means Education, Education in Nguni and Sotho, the country's two African language groups. A New York office supply company is talking about a partnership printing school stationery -- if he can find interested schools and  build a printing plant. A Denver bookstore owner wants to distribute books about black Americans through him -- if he can build a customer base. **********But all these things take capital, which Mr. Sikakane, like many would-be businessmen in South Africa's black townships, does not have.  He lacks the retail experience to qualify for bank loans. He is applying for small-business grants from the World Bank and the United States Agency for International Development, but grant-writing is a skill that is foreign to him, so he has an American friend helping him with that. **********Suddenly, the police are at the door. Mr. Sikakane brightens at the sight of  one of his best customers, Tiro Matshoe, a trainee patrolman with the Soweto Traffic Department.  His request almost too perfectly illustrates the store's predicament. **********Officer Matshoe wants the complete works of William Shakespeare.  \"To expand  my knowledge,\" he explains. \"I meet members of the public, and I want to be able to quote from Shakespeare. Because I think of being a leader someday.\" **********Virtually any other South African bookstore would have the book, which costs  about $15 wholesale. Mr. Sikakane does not, and it is a mark of Officer Matshoe's loyalty that he is willing to wait a week for the order. **********He is followed by Gugu Ngema, who heads adult education at Funda Community College here. As part of his desire to \"build a culture of learning\" in Soweto,  Mr. Ngema wants to order his textbooks through Mr. Sikakane's store instead of sending students to stores \"that really cater for the needs of white people.\" But, he said, he faces resistance from a surprising source. **********\"A lot of my colleagues are still worried about whether you can get quality service from a fellow African,\" Mr. Ngema said. \"I have to use my powers to convince them -- and to be ready to fight.\" **********When he started a year ago, Mr. Sikakane had no retailing experience.  He met his former partner, a white housewife named Barbara Malk, through a group trying to start a library in Soweto, where 80 percent of adults read below seventh-grade level. In February, Mrs. Malk remarried and moved to Cape Town, withdrawing from the partnership. **********Imfundo Thuto is in the first real shopping mall in this virtually all-black  city, which may be home to as many as four million people. Under apartheid laws, blacks were mot allowed to own businesses, though there were spazzas -- informal living-room stores. Even now, black enterprise is in its infancy: several of the mall's shops are Indian-owned, and the larger ones are chain stores. Fortunately for Mr. Sikakane, neither of the country's two large bookstore chains has yet taken a chance on the malls slowly springing up in black townships. **********Although the store just had its first birthday, Mr. Sikakane is delaying the  celebration until October because that is when Clara Villarosa, the owner of the Hue-Man Experience African-American Bookstore in Denver, Colo., is supposed to arrive.  She has promised to ship him hundreds of used children's books, which will be collected by African-American bookstores in the States from their customers. Mr. Sikakane wants to give them to children here. **********Ms. Villarosa met Mr. Sikakane last year on a trade mission by black American entrepreneurs. She came hoping to sell new books. Now she is collecting used ones to give away. **********\"Everybody else found business opportunities,\" she said. \"I found a philanthropic mission. You do what you have to do.

Britain did make some exceptions, like allowing Slovenia to conclude an association agreement with the European Union. **********\"Our policy of noncooperation now ceases, as of now,\" Mr. Rifkind said, ending the most vigorous display of sovereign cantankerousness in Europe since France tried a similar tactic three decades ago. **********European leaders repeatedly denounced the British tactic as unworthy, and the president of the European Parliament, Klaus Hansch of Germany, urged the leaders, meeting in Macchiavelli's hometown, to live up to his dictum that princes should solve problems before public emotions made them unsolvable. **********The British have challenged the beef embargo in the European Court of Justice as an illegal ganging up of 14 members against one, and expect a ruling within weeks. **********But the worst of the crisis appears to be over, allowing leaders to turn to other pressing problems, like the 10 percent unemployment rate besetting the continent and disarray in their attempt to revise decision-making procedures to  prepare for an influx of new Central European members in the next century. **********The Executive Commission imposed the worldwide ban on British beef exports on March 27, a week after the British Government disclosed that scientists had concluded that a link between a degenerative brain disease that has afflicted more than 100,000 head of cattle in the United Kingdom and a similar disease in  people could not be ruled out. **********That statement seemed to make nonsense of years of previous British Government assertions that mad cow disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, was nothing to worry about. Suddenly it seemed possible that Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, which destroys the human brain, could be contracted from eating meat or meat products from cows with the bovine disease. **********At least 11 young adults in Britain and 1 in France have come down with Creutzfeldt-Jakob since the mad cow outbreak started in Britain in the late 1980's. In the past, most people who contracted the rare disease have been elderly. **********The source of the bovine disease is thought to be animal feed from processed  offal and other parts of slaughtered sheep, which are susceptible to a degenerative brain disorder known as scrapies. Britain banned the use of such feeds for cattle in 1990, but did not totally ban the use of meat and bonemeal in all animal feeds until last March. **********To get today's European agreement to lift the embargo on beef exports, the British have also agreed to immediate culling of up to 147,000 head of cattle that scientists have identified as being at particularly high risk of the disease, if Parliament will agree to the slaughter. **********The British have also agreed not to sell beef to anyone from animals over 30  months old, the ones most likely to have come into direct or indirect contact with other infected animals or the infected feeds, and will slaughter a million  such animals over the next year, according to the Government. **********The European plan, adopted in the context of what it called \"considerable misgiving about the effectiveness of past actions taken by the U.K.,\" requires the British to submit evidence that the cattle disease has been eliminated from  the various classes of beef they want to start exporting. **********Step by step, after consulting its experts, the Executive Commission can then recommend governments a gradual relaxation of the ban. **********\"Such decisions will be taken only and exclusively on the basis of public health and objective scientific criteria and of the judgment of the commission that these criteria have been satisfied,\" leaders here agreed. **********But it is consumers who will determine how much British beef will be sold abroad, and millions of them right now will not even buy beef that butchers swear does not even have distant relatives across the Channel. One sign of the crisis for farmers is that the leaders also agreed today to stock a relief fund  with more than $1 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/06/business/market-closings.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-04-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Closings", "print_headline": "Market Closings", "body_text": " **********The stock and commodity markets in the United States are closed today in observance of Good Friday, but there was limited trading in bonds and currencies.

North Sea and West African oil meets those requirements. **********Some 40 firms, representing about 16 million barrels per day in oil refining capacity, showed up at the Singapore meeting convened by Norway's Statoil in March. **********They account for the great majority of the oil that is refined to make gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, naphtha and other products for Asia's transportation, power, manufacturing and petrochemical industries. **********Despite the fact that it takes more than three times as long and costs twice as much to ship oil from the North Sea to Singapore as it does from the Middle East, Taiwan's China Petroleum Development Corp. has started to buy Norwegian oil on a regular basis. **********Mr. Fesharaki said that other Asian refiners were expected to follow as West African oil production and prices peaked, making the economics of North Sea supply attractive. **********Statoil says it takes a large tanker from the North Sea 38 days to reach Singapore at a cost of $1.10 per barrel of oil, compared to 30 days at 95 cents from West Africa. **********Norway is one of the world's largest oil exporters.

Mr. Kerkorian, the wily billionaire  who bought and sold Metro Goldwyn Mayer Inc. twice before, is buying it one more time. **********The French bank Credit Lyonnais, which owns the ailing film company, said yesterday that it had accepted a $1.3 billion offer from an investment group led by Mr. Kerkorian's holding company, the Tracinda Corporation. **********The Kerkorian group includes MGM's chairman, Frank Mancuso; Seven Network Group Ltd., an Australian broadcasting company that is 15 percent owned by the News Corporation, and J. P. Morgan & Company. **********The group beat out rival offers from Polygram N.V., a subsidiary of Philips Electronics N.V., and the film company Morgan Creek Productions. **********The News Corporation was initially an independent bidder, but executives familiar with the negotiations said it was not willing to spend more than $1 billion for the studio. **********Under Mr. Mancuso, who was brought in by Credit Lyonnais in 1993, MGM has cut its losses, but the company has still been running out of cash in recent months. **********Tracinda will put up $650 million of the purchase price, with $250 million coming from Seven Network. J. P. Morgan will provide $800 million in financing. **********Mr. Kerkorian was a latecomer to the bidding for MGM, having become involved  last week. But he has a long history with MGM, having originally bought the company in 1969 and then sold it to the Turner Broadcasting System in 1986. He subsequently bought back much of the company, only to resell it in 1990 to Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian financier who later lost it to Credit Lyonnais. **********Mr. Kerkorian and other members of his group did not comment. **********The 79-year-old Mr. Kerkorian had known Mr. Mancuso from the days when Mr. Mancuso ran Paramount Pictures and Mr. Kerkorian owned MGM. The two companies jointly owned United International Pictures, which distributed their films overseas. **********In the recent round of bids, the Kerkorian group had an advantage because it  has no other film production companies. MGM has an agreement to distribute the home video versions of its films through Warner Brothers, and other bidders like Polygram were concerned that Warner might insist on distributing their films as  well. **********That issue was particularly crucial for Polygram, a large film producer that  already has alternative distribution agreements, and it was apparently a factor  in the News Corporation's reluctance to pursue a bid; it owns the 20th Century Fox studio. **********Morgan Creek already distributes its films through Warner Brothers. **********In recent years, Mr. Kerkorian has added to his fortune by investing heavily  in the Chrysler Corporation. He owns 13.75 percent of Chrysler, a stake that has a market value of $2.9 billion. He also owns 72 percent of the MGM Grand hotel-casino company, with a value of $1.4 billion. He has homes in Las Vegas, Nev., where he spends most of his time, and in Beverly Hills, Calif. **********Credit Lyonnais gained control of MGM in 1992 after Mr. Parretti defaulted on his loan payments to the bank. The bank is believed to have invested nearly $2 billion in MGM, according to The Associated Press, meaning that it is taking a significant loss on the sale. **********Mr. Kerkorian's relationship with Credit Lyonnais has often been bitter. In 1992, Credit Lyonnais sued Mr. Kerkorian in a Los Angeles court, contending that he had left MGM in a financial shambles when he sold it to Mr. Parretti. That suit was settled last year. **********MGM is not in good financial shape. Last year, it reported a net loss of $159.3 million on revenues of $860.9 million, according to documents that were circulated to potential buyers. The bulk of that loss, $102 million, was from operations. But it also included $66 million in interest payments on bank loans. **********Still, those losses were barely a third of MGM's losses in 1993, when Mr. Mancuso took charge.

But the resulting tax liability may offset the benefit, he said. **********Japanese savers have even better cause to gripe. Interest rates, as determined by government-backed short-term bonds, are 0.8 percent for three-month deposits, 0.62 percent for six months and 0.87 percent for one year. Karl Hancock, an analyst at stockbrokers County NatWest in London, attributed the particularly low six-month figure to a lack of money supply for that period, which is pushing the price up and the rate down. **********In Britain, the prospects for short-term savers are only marginally brighter. According to MoneyFacts, a monthly guide to investment and mortgage rates published in Norfolk, bank and building society money-market rates on \u00a350,000 ($77,000) deposited in February for three, six or 12 months ranged between 3.75 percent and 6.25 percent. **********Offshore accounts pay slightly better returns: up to seven percent for \u00a350,000 deposited in a two-month notice account and 5.25 percent for $50,000 in dollars. **********\"Investors with more than \u00a350,000 should consider approaching banks with bespoke services,\" said Stephen Renals, a director at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson's private banking division in London. These can access interbank market rates, or the rate at which banks and financial institutions lend to each other. Currently, the interbank rate on sterling is about 6.3 percent. **********For the totally risk-averse investor, that is the end of the story. But caution doesn't have been thrown entirely to the winds to obtain the prospect of a far higher return on short-term investments. **********One possibility is a hybrid savings products, such as Kleinwort Benson's Investors Deposit Account, which pays a return linked to the performance of the FT-SE 100 index, rather than a rate of interest. **********This account, which requires a minimum deposit of \u00a32,500, pays the investor 70 percent of the index's average return over a three-month deposit period, 95 percent for six months and 121 percent for 12 months. If the market declines, the original deposit remains unscathed. Therefore, the most an investor stands to lose is the interest he or she would have made from a more traditional savings product. **********Another option is a money market fund, including single currency or managed currency funds. These generate higher rates of interest than retail accounts because, like the customized services, they are able to tap into the wholesale rates available to very large depositors. **********Currency funds also offer more competitive foreign exchange rates and generally make no charge for switching currencies, an added attraction for investors moving abroad or with liabilities in more than one country. **********Cash and currency management funds account for more than $800 billion in the U.S. market alone. **********\"Managed currency funds can be very volatile so they are really better for investors with a four-year time frame,\" cautioned Mogens Kjoller-Petersen, chairman of Northstar Fund Mangers (Cayman) Ltd. \"Single currency funds are better for short-term deposits.\" **********In fact, short-term depositors probably do better to avoid most money market funds: The average return of the 631 funds tracked by Micropal for the past 12 months was 6.82 percent, hardly better than retail bank interest."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/28/world/critic-of-arafat-free-now-says-he-ll-keep-speaking-out.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 486, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Critic of Arafat, Free Now, Says He'll Keep Speaking Out", "print_headline": "Critic of Arafat, Free Now, Says He'll Keep Speaking Out", "body_text": " **********A Palestinian human rights advocate who was jailed after he was quoted as criticizing Yasir Arafat's self-rule administration said today that he planned to continue speaking out. **********Dr. Eyad R.

Chrysler is highly profitable and selling mini-vans and sport utility vehicles as fast as it can build them, which might make the company more willing to make  concessions to avoid a strike. **********The current national labor contract expires on Sept. 14 and talks will begin  in June.

These would fall particularly hard in Switzerland, where a weak economy is struggling to cope with the strength of the Swiss franc, and unemployment, particularly among young people, is matter of growing national concern. **********And the big Swiss banks, while they have been huge employers, have been rapidly shedding jobs of late. A number of large institutions, such as Bank Leu  and Swiss Volksbank, have been swallowed up. **********Also, big mergers depend on the personalities leading each institution and the willingness of each to set aside some of their ambition to make sure that a  merger can be completed and made to work. Yesterday, some Wall Street investment bankers said that the Union Bank team was more likely to take the top management jobs, and those who know Rainer Gut, the forceful chairman of CS Holding, speculated that he might not be ready to take a back seat to insure that a merger went ahead. **********\"I am not sure that Gut will really like it,\" said a Wall Street banking specialist who declined to be named. \"A lot of it will depend on that.\" **********Union Bank's capital may be as much as 50 percent greater than that of CS Holding, and that is why this banker surmised that its top managers would have to play the leading role in a combined institution. **********There also could be a negative reaction to such a deal in Switzerland, where  mergers have been rare. In recent weeks, Switzerland witnessed a huge merger in  another of its hallmark businesses: pharmaceuticals. Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, both world leaders, announced that they would merge, sending ripples through Swiss business. **********\"That has already shaken up the Swiss financial community,\" a senior CS employee in London said yesterday. Interestingly, the two drug companies were each advised by American investment banks -- J. P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley. **********And the bank merger, if it goes ahead, may not pan out so well for many of the investment bankers who work for either institution in world financial centers -- like Wall Street, London, Tokyo and Singapore. These high-paid employees would probably be among the first to be culled by a management eager to cut costs. **********This would indeed be a reversal. The big three Swiss banks have been buying investment banking talent and institutions in London and New York in recent years. Swiss Bank Corporation, for example, late last year paid more than $1 billion to acquire the venerable S. G. Warburg merchant bank of London. **********For some investment bankers at Union Bank's New York unit, such a merger might prove an eerie experience, as it would put them back to work with colleagues they only just left. In recent months, several investment bankers, including John Costas, a managing director in charge of much of the firm's debt  business and Thomas Hanley, a leading bank analyst, have switched jobs from CS First Boston to Union Bank's Wall Street unit. Neither Mr. Hanley nor Mr. Costas could be reached late yesterday. **********On Wall Street, CS Holding has an established presence with its CS First Boston subsidiary, while Union Bank has in the last two years spent hundreds of  millions trying to build a world-class investment bank. The overlap would be substantial, leading to hundreds, if not thousands, of expected layoffs. **********\"The North American investment banking businesses would be decimated,\" an employee at one of the two banks' Wall Street businesses said yesterday. \"It's lucky that a lot of firms are still hiring.\" **********Wall Street has been rife with jokes about the high salaries that Union Bank  paid to entice top talent. Its top executives' guaranteed pay packages of $2 million for four years, or $3 million for five years, have become known as 2-by-4's and 3-by-5's, prompting Wall Street wags to nickname the UBS investment bank \"the lumber yard.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/01/business/company-news-sungard-to-buy-a-unit-of-national-computer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-06-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;SUNGARD TO BUY A UNIT OF NATIONAL COMPUTER", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;SUNGARD TO BUY A UNIT OF NATIONAL COMPUTER", "body_text": " **********Sungard Data Systems Inc., a computer services company, has a definitive agreement to buy the Financial Systems business of National Computer Systems Inc. for $95 million in cash, the companies said yesterday.

There's the bouncy foam-rubber one. There's another made up of wooden rods. And, of course, don't forget that old favorite, the covered tunnel slide. **********Still, there's yet one more slide that the kiddies might not know, even though the company's investors sure do. It's called the sickening slide. **********That's what the share price of Discovery Zone has been on for years. After being one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street, Discovery Zone started tumbling  more than a gymnast. Last week came the final indignity: The company announced that it might have to file for bankruptcy protection, and its shares hit the mat, dropping 50 percent in one day. By Friday, Discovery Zone shares closed at  87.5 cents in over-the-counter trading. **********How could such a disastrous fall happen? A better question might be: How could it not? Indeed, the story of Discovery Zone offers investors a pointed example of the dangers of fad stocks. **********The Discovery Zone concept is simple. The company owns and franchises what are effectively indoor playgrounds, made up of a series of tubes, slides, trampolines and ball bins for children. With the company's stress on fun and fitness, parents who took their children to Discovery Zone could easily have walked out with the mistaken impression that this was a company with an incredibly profitable idea. **********Apparently, it was a common thought. In June 1993, when the child-recreation  company went public, it quickly became one of Wall Street's hottest offerings. On the first day of trading, shares of Discovery Zone jumped 61.4 percent from their offering price of $22, to close at $35.50. (Prices have since been adjusted to account for new shares.) Making the stock even more attractive was the identity of a 20 percent shareholder: Blockbuster Entertainment, which had made its video-store chain one of the most successful stocks of the 1980's. **********Then, just a year later, more good news. Blockbuster increased its holdings in Discovery Zone to more than 50 percent of the outstanding shares. On the same day, Discovery Zone announced it would buy its only national competitor, Leaps & Bounds Inc., from the McDonald's Corporation for more than $100 million in stock. Then, a few months after that, Discovery Zone purchased about 60 facilities that were owned by affiliates of Blockbuster. **********With no big competitors, and two of the most successful companies in America  betting on it, Discovery Zone seemed destined for success. But from that point on, Discovery Zone flopped at every opportunity. **********Its rapid expansion -- building up from eight play centers to almost 350 in just a few years -- proved far too costly to make any money. In 1993, Discovery Zone had $3 million in profits on $61 million in revenue. By 1994, revenues had tripled, but profits had vanished, and the company lost $25 million. **********Last year, with things falling apart, Blockbuster took control. But the hemorrhaging got worse: In the first nine months of 1995, Discovery Zone lost an eye-popping $114 million. **********Now, shareholders might have avoided these troubles if, back when Discovery Zone was the Wunderkind of Wall Street, they had asked one question: Exactly what is it that this company is offering that anybody else couldn't copy? Think  about it. Nobody can patent slides or ball bins or trampolines -- the main attractions at Discovery Zone. So if the company proved to be the moneymaker that Wall Street so clearly hoped for, every two-bit operator could open a competitor down the street. And they would be able to avoid whatever mistakes Discovery Zone made along the way as an industry trailblazer. **********In other words, if it was successful, Discovery Zone was destined to be swamped with competitors. And if it wasn't, well, then it wouldn't succeed. **********Last week offered the latest evidence that Discovery Zone is failing. It has  moved to the brink of bankruptcy due to high real-estate costs from its excessive expansion, and its inability to negotiate more credit from its banks.  But savvy investors suspected from the start that trouble, one way or another, was likely. **********True, there was one possible path to success for a company like this -- but Discovery Zone did not take it. The company might have been rigorous in creating a brand identity, just as Blockbuster has done with video stores. But, in fact,  the centers differ widely in construction, supervision, security and even in what foods are offered. **********A result is that local operators of competing play centers have just as much  chance of attracting children as does Discovery Zone. Meanwhile, other companies, like Ikea and even McDonald's, have hit upon the idea of setting up slides and ball bins in their stores.  That offers something Discovery Zone does not: an attraction for parents like the chance to shop or have a decent lunch. And, after all, it is the parents who decide where the tots will play. **********Any doubters of the flaws in Discovery Zone should have been convinced in 1994, when McDonald's sold the company its indoor-playground business.  While it was true that the deal meant Discovery Zone had no national competitors, investors should have asked: What does McDonald's know that I don't? **********Most corporations don't walk away from big moneymakers. In essence, the stock deal with Discovery Zone allowed McDonald's the best of both worlds: If the concept took off, McDonald's would profit from its Discovery Zone shares. If it  didn't, the losses would be limited to its investment. **********In the end, while Discovery Zone doesn't offer much profit, at least it provides an important lesson for investors: Companies that offer something readily copied should have plenty of playmates in the same business."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/03/business/when-the-consultant-s-cure-is-worse-than-the-ailment.html": {"writer_name": "Lawrence Gelder", "pub_date": "1996-11-03", "snippet": "Anecdotes on consultants' impact on companies; drawings (M)", "word_count": 691, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "When the Consultant's Cure Is Worse Than the Ailment", "print_headline": "When the Consultant's Cure Is Worse Than the Ailment", "body_text": " **********Guess who has an image problem? Could it be those busybodies known as consultants? So the recent mail would indicate. But not to worry. Surely someone out there knows how to restore their tarnished image. All that consultants need is some advice from a good consultant. As to how some consultants earned their reputations, read on. **********Like many managers, this boss hoped the consultant he hired would deliver the magic elixir: a way to cut expenses, increase sales, attract new customers. **********So, recalls Lia Moskowitz of Brooklyn, the boss made the consultant privy to all his business records and transactions. **********Flash forward a year. **********The boss has filed for bankruptcy. The company has been sold by a bankruptcy court. **********The new owner? Funny you should ask. **********The consultant, of course. **********While going through the corporate records, it seems, the consultant came upon some questionable transactions the boss made. Being a noble soul, the consultant reported them to the appropriate authorities. The result was a fine. When the boss could not afford to pay it, the company went bankrupt. **********As the old saying goes, it's an ill wind that blows no good. **********In October 1994, Jim Gialamas of Manhattan was put in charge of a production group of 30 people at the Wall Street subsidiary of a Fortune 500 company. ''Somewhere, behind the scenes, the firm hired a consultant to scale down the operating environment,'' Mr. Gialamas writes. The two had met before. **********Mr. Gialamas remembered him as a man who spoke aggressively, belittled anyone without seniority, armed himself with incomprehensible jargon and shielded himself from criticism behind recent articles from PC Magazine. ''A combination of ill-humor and conceit earned him credibility,'' Mr. Gialamas writes. **********Before long, Mr. Gialamas's group was reduced to half. New work stations would enable each of the survivors to do the work of two, he was told, but the technology never materialized. When the consultant discussed the department's software, he got its name wrong. Morale withered. Work quality deteriorated. Those who remained -- terrified that they would lose their jobs -- worked overtime without pay. Another revamping followed. The consultant even replaced Mr. Gialamas's boss. **********Mr. Gialamas soon quit. **********''Eventually, an old colleague forwarded me an E-mail announcing the consultant's resignation as managing director,'' Mr. Gialamas writes. ''In a desperate act of vanity, the departing director wrote, 'I am choosing a new career path in order to succeed elsewhere. . . . ' As far as I know, he's still consulting. **********''As for me, I work out of my home now. When I invoice clients, they ask if my title is 'consultant.' **********''I respond, ' ''vendor'' will be fine.' '' **********''It was the dry cleaning bills that irked us,'' writes Helen S. Paxton of Montclair, N.J. **********''We were low-paid employees in a medium-size nonprofit organization, and he was the consultant from the Midwest who wore very nice suits and impeccable shirts.'' He had been brought in to develop a new plan for the organization, including a campaign to raise significant endowment funds. The hope was that the board, the executive director and the staff could execute the plan and put the organization on a stable footing for the first time in its history. **********''But then someone discovered that the dry cleaning bills for the consultant's shirts were being reimbursed by our financially strapped nonprofit organization,'' Ms. Paxton writes. ''A small rebellion ensued.'' **********Soon the consultant was back in the Midwest, leaving behind the fund-raising plan his assistant had typed so beautifully. **********''Fund raising is more than writing a fancy document,'' Ms. Paxton says. ''It's about people connecting with people, about the chemistry that happens between the askers and the givers. Plans give you perspective and hope, and that's pretty important, too. Eventually, through a lot of hard work and chemistry making, the organization began to realize some of the goals that the consultant had helped us to articulate. **********''If you look at this through the capitalist lens, he came out the winner. We were the chemistry makers who brought our lunch to work and shopped for bargain-basement deals on nice shirts. **********''His fees allowed him to buy fancy shirts, he didn't have to budget for dry cleaning and he never got his hands dirty in the chemistry lab, either.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/04/world/nine-slain-in-sri-lanka.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nine Slain in Sri Lanka", "print_headline": "Nine Slain in Sri Lanka", "body_text": " **********Tamil Tiger rebels carried out several raids against the Sri Lankan military  today, leaving at least nine people dead, including three Government servicemen, officials said. **********One airman and six rebels were killed when Tamil guerrillas attacked an air force camp in the eastern Trincomalee district, 142 miles northeast of Colombo,  a military official said.

A senior official of Flextech, the largely U.S.-owned television-program packager, said Tuesday that he hoped by the end of the month to wrap up a deal with the British Broadcasting Corporation to create up to six new theme-television channels for distribution around the world. **********Stanislas Yassukovich, Flextech's chairman, predicted that an agreement would be reached by September. \"This partnership will bring our financing capability together with the BBC's library and its ability to commission new programming,\" he said in an interview. **********He said he expected the half dozen new channels to each contain a mixture of fresh programming and so-called time-warp material \u2014 programs from the BBC's vast warehouse of previously broadcast dramas, documentaries and more. **********Behind the new joint venture is an expected growth in the need for programs with the arrival of digital television.

Furthermore, it has the financial muscle that the BBC sorely lacks. **********Andrea Kirkby, an analyst with the Daiwa Institute of Research, offers a third explanation as to why the deal might be attractive for the BBC. \"The BBC is good at general-interest programming, but it has never run a special-interest or niche channel in its life.

And just as radio has found a quiet place for itself in the cacophony of technological revolutions since 1906, classical music is doing quite nicely in the Arbitron-driven world of radio today. **********The American Radio Systems Corporation's recent agreement to pay $66.5 million for two of Marlin Broadcasting Inc.'s radio stations -- and to retain their classical music format -- is only the latest sign that a tradition as old  as radio can survive. **********But classical music broadcasters say patience and hard work are required. \"If you track the performance of classical over the past five years, you'll see  a steady increase of shares across the country,\" said Steven Dodge, the chairman and chief executive of American Radio, which is based in Boston and owns, or has agreements to acquire, a total of 63 stations -- none of the others with classical music. \"There are so many formats in radio that when you're in a niche format like this, it's a good place to be.\" **********While many popular-music stations bounce up and down in the ratings as they tinker with their formats, classical programming remains a stable moneymaker with a virtually guaranteed audience that is demographically attractive to advertisers. **********\"We just agreed to advertise on classical music broadcasts for the first time in a long time,\" said Dan Haughton, director of marketing services at Merrill Lynch. \"We're doing this to show our support for the arts, and we feel it's a good way to reach a very affluent client base.\" Merrill Lynch is sponsoring \"Evening at the Pops With Skitch Henderson,\" which the Concert Music Network, a  national satellite network, transmits to 35 affiliates. **********Robert Unmacht of M Street Journal, an industry newsletter, said the number of commercial stations playing classical music had remained fairly steady over the last five years -- currently 39, including WQRS-FM in Detroit and WFLN-FM in Philadelphia, the stations that American Radio bought from Marlin. The number of noncommercial stations with such programming has decreased somewhat, he said. **********Few cities have more than one commercial classical station. Chicago and San Francisco each have two, while Boston and the Portland, Me., area each have three. In New York City, the only commercial station playing classical music is  WQXR-FM, owned by the New York Times Company. The audience is also served by WNYC-FM, a noncommercial station which plays more than a dozen hours of classical music a day, and blocks of music on smaller stations. **********\"If you go classical, you need a marketing strategy, you need to be in it for a long haul, you need to go after the better advertisers,\" said Mr. Unmacht. \"It's much easier to tell an agency, 'Here's how many bodies we have ages 25 to  54. Send us the Ford spot, and the check.' \" **********Peter Newman, the general manager and program director of one of the most successful classical stations, KING-FM, in Seattle, said: \"If you look at where  the big advertising money is, it is usually in beer and soft drinks. Classical owners have to consider how much money this format, with its bias, will be worth in a given market.\" **********The programming format, meanwhile, is not monolithic. \"We run our radio like  a Top 40 station,\" said Howard Tanger, the president and chief executive of Marlin Broadcasting. \"It must be entertainment.\" Mr. Tanger said Marlin stations run contests, golf tournaments and Beethoven birthday parties. **********Marlin sold the two stations to American Radio \"to provide liquidity for myself and my other stockholders,\" Mr. Tanger said. The company, which is based  in Boston, is repurchasing WTMI-FM, a classical station in the Miami area, for $18 million. **********Mr. Tanger's father, Alexander M. Tanger, owns and operates a classical station, WBQQ, in Kennebunkport, Me.; his brother Doug has WBOQ-FM in Gloucester, Mass. Many other stations were founded in the 1940's and 1950's, with relatively small investments, by individuals dedicated to classical music. **********Classical music on the air predates commercial radio, back to when Enrico Caruso sang from the Metropolitan Opera House in a live broadcast in 1910. During the 1930's, concerts were common, and in 1937 NBC formed its own symphony, led by Arturo Toscanini. **********But as prices for stations have surged, many owners have been tempted to seek a more mainstream audience. **********In New York City, for example, WNCN-FM, a classical music station, had a 1.7  share of the radio audience and could not crack the top 20 among adults 25-54. Now, as hard rock station WAXQ, it recently scored an Arbitron rating of 6.2 among men 18-34, which places it third in the market, and its revenues are about 50 percent higher, said Randy Bongarten, the general manager. The station was owned by GAF Broadcasting during the makeover. On March 15, GAF sold it for $90  million to a small company that in turn traded it to Viacom Inc. for three stations in Seattle. Owners of classical stations have learned that they have to market the buying power of their audiences and persuade media buyers to look beyond the ratings. \"If you're strictly buying the numbers you're not doing the job properly,\" said  Richard Cotter, regional broadcast manager at J. Walter Thompson.    KING-FM, which is owned by Classical Radio Inc., is one of the country's most successful classical stations, averaging about a 4 share over the last five years in Seattle, a city that has emerged as a leader in pop music. **********But the most profitable classical station in the country is WGMS-FM in Washington, said James Duncan Jr., the publisher of Duncan's American Radio, a trade paper. The station has pretax earnings of close to $3 million on revenues  of about $7.5 million. It is owned by Colfax Communications Inc. **********WQXR, in New York, and KKGO-FM, which broadcasts in Los Angeles and is owned  by Mount Wilson FM Broadcasters Inc., have similar revenues, he said, but higher marketing costs. **********Mr. Newman in Seattle said his approach was to keep the programming clean and simple, concentrating on the music, without wine ratings and business reports. **********The station has three tiers of music: about 200 well-known pieces that are broadcast once each month, a second tier of less-well-known fare and a third of  programming that is \"pleasant but without a strong presence.\" **********\"I have a 40-minute Brahms symphony, but I'm not going to play it at 8 in the morning,\" Mr. Newman said. \"In the morning we play shorter, lighter things, as we do in the afternoon drive.\" **********Generally classical stations are optimistic. As baby boomers age, classical programmers are hoping that their tastes will turn toward Bach and away from the Beatles, Mr. Newman said. **********The classical broadcasters are also testing the syndicated market. Marlin hopes to offer a worldwide classical music service. Sony Worldwide Networks has  signed six affiliates since August, when it offered a classical format. **********\"It is slow going,\" said Susan Solomon, the president and chief executive."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/25/business/markets-closed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 39, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Markets Closed", "print_headline": "Markets Closed", "body_text": " **********All financial and commodity markets in the United States, and most markets overseas, are closed today in observance of Christmas.

No one expects war any time soon, but some diplomats  and government officials warn that in the long term, the disagreements could become a source of major conflict. **********I think there's a potential here for more than just diplomatic wrangling,\"  said Kent E. Calder, a Princeton University scholar who has just published a book, \"Pacific Defense,\" (William Morrow & Company), about security risks in the region. \"Beyond that, the disputed areas are part of a larger danger of tensions between China and Japan. **********\"This will be a central issue in Sino-Japanese security for the next 5 to 10  years and perhaps beyond.\" **********The backdrop is the growing unease in Japan about the military implications of the rise of China. Japanese Government officials often say that in the long run, the most important external issue facing their country is China. **********Just this month five Chinese research ships conducted sonar exploration of what Japan regards as its seabed. Last fall a Chinese ship searched for oil on what Japan considers its side of the dividing line in the seas between them. **********Japan occasionally scrambles its fighter aircraft when Chinese warplanes approach the Senkaku Islands, a few uninhabited islets that both countries claim. But some Japanese officials acknowledge that their warplanes and warships are a bit like dogs chasing cars, and that if the Chinese ever fired a missile,  the Japanese forces would beat a hasty retreat. **********One complication is oil, for the East China Sea bears promising geological formations that some experts say resemble those of the North Sea, with its huge  oil reserves. Japan is acutely aware of its vulnerability on imported oil, and China has been a net oil importer since 1993. So both sides are dazzled by estimates that the East China Sea may contain 10 billion to 100 billion barrels  of oil. **********China's oil exploration in the disputed area last fall may be a sign that it  will try to exploit reserves in the sea. So far Japan's Foreign Ministry has discouraged Japanese oil companies from drilling in the area, but if China goes  ahead there would be strong political pressure for Japan to do so as well. **********Sadayuki Hayashi, Deputy Foreign Minister of Japan, said in an interview that it was important to work toward finding common boundaries under the Law of the Sea Treaty. But he added that Japan would draw its exclusive economic zone on the basis that the Senkakus are a part of Japan. **********\"It is very clear that this is part of Japan,\" Mr. Hayashi said. He noted that China had not much contested Japan's sovereignty until reports surfaced that the area includes a lot of oil. **********The issue has arisen because Asia, like most of the world, is moving to the Law of the Sea Treaty as the new framework for determining who controls the ocean's resources. South Korea ratified the treaty late last year, China did so  on Wednesday, and Japan is expected to do so in the coming month. **********The treaty allows nations to establish 200-mile \"exclusive economic zones\" in adjacent waters -- but the problem is that China and Japan and South Korea are less than 400 miles apart. This means that they have to figure out how to draw the line dividing their zones. **********China's claims are raising anxieties to its south as well as its east. On Friday the Philippines and Vietnam reportedly denounced Beijing's claims under the Law of the Sea Treaty to a vast stretch of water in the South China Sea. **********Japan proposes drawing the line at the halfway mark, although for this purpose it conveniently ignores a sometimes-submerged island off the Chinese coast. China, on the other hand, makes a sweeping claim to \"inviolable sovereignty\" over its continental shelf, which it argues juts into the ocean most of the way to Japan. **********China also has disputes about maritime boundaries with South and North Korea. Although North Korea and China often hail their friendship, North Korean gunboats are said to have fired on Chinese fishing boats that stray into what North Korea regards as its waters. **********Ji Guoxing, a Chinese scholar in Shanghai who has written extensively about maritime disputes in the seas around China, said it would take China some time after it ratifies the Law of the Sea Treaty to fix its exclusive economic zones. Mr. Ji added that while disagreements may be difficult to resolve, a war is unlikely. **********\"This may be an area of potential conflict, but I don't see a real battle there,\" he said. \"Both Japan and China will exercise restraint while sticking to their own claims.\" **********To solve the disputes, the parties could refer the matter to the International Court of Justice or seek mediation or arbitration. **********For now, though, the countries have been taking the alternative approach of bolstering their navies. China and South Korea have been pouring money into their navies in recent years, and Japan, which already has a very credible navy, is considering whether to upgrade it further."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/16/business/international-business-us-issues-strong-warning-to-china-about-copyrights.html": {"writer_name": "Patrick Tyler", "pub_date": "1996-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 431, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;U.S. Issues Strong Warning To China About Copyrights", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;U.S. Issues Strong Warning To China About Copyrights", "body_text": " **********The Clinton Administration has delivered a sharp warning in private to Chinese leaders that China's failure to comply with a 1995 agreement on copyright piracy of American products is undercutting the Administration's credibility in Congress and will force tariff sanctions on up to $2 billion in Chinese imports sometime next month, Westerners who were briefed by the Administration said. **********The ultimatum was delivered by Charlene Barshefsky, the acting United States  trade representative, who held two days of talks here last week and then left Beijing without public comment. **********Ms. Barshefsky was said to have conveyed the prevailing view in the Clinton  Administration that the President will not be able to credibly push for the annual renewal of China's most-favored-nation trade privileges if Beijing continues to tolerate the rampant trade in pirated American music, films and computer software. **********Mr. Clinton must make his recommendation to renew China's low-tariff trade privileges by June 3.

In the wake of last week's decision by the Justice Department to block the American Radio Systems Corporation's purchase of two radio stations, ''the radio industry is in free fall,'' Mr. Smulyan said. The purchase would have given American Radio control over 64 percent of the radio advertising revenues in Rochester. **********Stocks of virtually all the independent radio companies -- including American Radio, Emmis Broadcasting, Jacor Communications Inc. and the Evergreen Media Corporation -- have been retreating in recent weeks after hitting 52-week highs earlier, and several fell sharply after the American Radio decision. **********''Wall Street hates uncertainty, and the new Justice Department rulings raise the specter of increasing uncertainty in the industry,'' said one radio industry executive who insisted on not being identified. **********Since the Telecommunications Act of 1996 allowed radio companies to own as many as eight stations in a single market -- though not more than five on either the AM or FM band -- the Justice Department has started looking assiduously at the antitrust implications of mergers. In a speech on Thursday, Lawrence Fullerton, an official in the department's antitrust division, said the department was investigating about 20 radio mergers around the country. **********What has riled radio executives is the seeming inconsistency of recent decisions. In August, the Justice Department said Jacor could not proceed with an acquisition that would have given it control over 50 percent of the radio advertising revenues in Cincinnati. As a result, Jacor agreed to buy only one of the two stations it had planned to acquire. **********''When the Jacor decision came out, it was seen as a one-time event,'' said John Reidy, an analyst who follows radio companies at Smith Barney. ''But the Justice Department moved way up on the radar screen last week when it requested revisions in the American Radio deal.'' **********To some people, the Justice Department's direction is unclear. Edward Henneberry, who specializes in antitrust law at the law firm of Howrey & Simon, said: ''The Justice Department does not really seem to know where it is going. It is feeling its way.'' **********David Turetsky, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the antitrust division, disagreed with that assessment. ''With the explosion of transactions, it is necessary and natural that we investigate their impact,'' he said. ''We have actually given quite a lot of guidance in a very short time.'' He said the department had been concerned in the Rochester case because there were a limited number of stations with strong signals and because American Radio would have owned six of the eight there. **********The stricter rules certainly limit the flexibility of the radio industry, but it is still too early to measure the mergers' benefits. Indeed, Mr. Smulyan contends that one reason radio stocks have come under pressure is that the industry has exaggerated how much such concentration can increase profitability. **********To be sure, even without merger benefits, the radio industry is extremely healthy. Advertising revenues have been growing at about 7 percent a year. **********But what has really driven the stocks for the last two years has been mergers and acquisitions activity,  Dennis H. Leibowitz, an analyst at  Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said. **********''Historically, stations had sold at 9 to 12 times cash flow,'' Mr. Smulyan of Emmis Broadcasting said. ''When CBS bought Infinity Broadcasting, it paid 20 times cash flow.'' **********Not only are flagging stock prices nagging at radio industry executives, but also there is the uncertainty about what the Justice Department will do next, since it has not laid out absolute guidelines. ''After the American Radio decision, people are assuming that you can't go over 40 percent,'' Mr. Leibowitz said. ''But as a result of all the mergers, some companies are already that high, and they are bumping up against a wall.'' **********The Justice Department has said it will make market-by-market decisions. And in addition to future mergers, it may also disqualify existing joint sales agreements, which are arrangements in which one station agrees to sell the advertising time for another station. **********The Justice Department is worried that such agreements, like mergers, give companies too much influence with advertisers. Measuring the absolute percentage of advertising dollars a single company controls in a single market is not the only issue. **********The Justice Department is also raising questions about single companies controlling too many stations with the same or similar formats in a single market. It may let an owner retain control of a number of stations if they have widely different formats, like classical music and rock music, that do not attract similar advertisers. But if a company has formats that give it a lock on a single target advertising market, the Justice Department may be more inclined to intervene. **********Radio industry executives contend that radio does not get its fair share of advertising dollars, considering the time people spend listening to it. They note that radio advertising revenues account for only 7 percent of all advertising sold in all media. **********For now, it looks like the Justice Department is putting a bit of a damper on the radio merger frenzy. As a result radio stocks are cooling, at least slightly.

Grant and James A. Garfield. **********Pablo Picasso, D. H. Lawrence and Howard Hughes, unconventional until the end, didn't bother to leave one behind, either. **********All went to their graves without writing wills, the granddaddy of all mistakes in estate planning. In the worst-case possibilities, the lack of a will can turn potential heirs against each other as lawyers feast on diminishing assets of the deceased. **********The need for a will has grown ever more important in American society as people live longer and become more affluent because of various retirement plans, rising real estate and stock values, experts say. **********Nevertheless, an estimated two out of three Americans die without a will, or  \"intestate\" in legal parlance. Many of these people have few worldly possessions, or they own property like bank accounts, houses and cars that pass  directly to a spouse or other joint owner outside probate, a system by which an  estate's debts are paid and assets distributed under court supervision. Life insurance and retirement fund benefits also bypass probate court. **********For anyone with substantial assets, though, an updated, valid and properly witnessed will is essential. It should designate an executor, who will administer the estate and see to it that debts are paid and assets distributed according to the wishes expressed in the will. **********Dying without a will is the biggest but not the only blunder made by people who fail to organize their finances before succumbing to infirmity and death. **********Many people who die with valid wills leave their families scrambling to find  the documents. A Manhattan widow, for example, left her will in the freezer for  safekeeping, reckoning -- incorrectly as it turned out -- that her family would  want ice cubes for a drink at her wake. **********The preparation of the will itself sometimes causes a problem. When people draw up their own wills or use standard forms, some of them generated on computers, certain mistakes can make the will invalid in New York and many other states: typing in provisions instead of writing them in longhand or having beneficiaries like children witness the signature. **********Because handling the affairs of a deceased family member often means dealing  with complicated issues and finances at a time of emotional distress, people should conduct a frank discussion with their heirs well before the onset of illness and death. **********But there is a reluctance on both sides of the generational divide to discuss death and personal finances when parents enjoy good health. Also, changes in American society have reduced opportunities for quiet exchanges of information around the dinner table. Divorce, remarriage and the mobility of retired parents and adult children often fracture family alliances, weaken bonds and open gaping emotional and geographic distances. **********\"There is great reluctance and discomfort about bringing up unmentionable things like dying,\" said Judy Pollatsek, a clinical therapist in Washington and  a lecturer on death and grief. \"Both parents and children may be in denial about death. **********\"And asking parents where the safe deposit key is or how much they own can create guilt about prying, an invasion of privacy second only to asking your parents what they do in bed,\" she said. **********Ms. Pollatsek speaks from experience. When she asked her mother, who lives in California and has suffered several strokes, about her assets, she was cut short and told it was none of her business, she recalled. **********\"There are so many things an adult child who doesn't live near a parent needs to know in case of death,\" she added. \"But here I was, a professional who counsels others on dealing with emotions, and I'm reduced to tears because my mother is a couple of thousand miles away and being unreasonable.\" **********The fears of some parents are not baseless. Greed on the part of relatives anticipating an inheritance can reveal itself before and after a death. \"I had a client who divulged her net worth to a daughter who then became very agitated and demanded part of inheritance right away,\" recalled Vincent J. Russo, a lawyer in Westbury, L.I., who specializes in wills and estates. **********Protracted court battles between family members who contest wills are growing in number, state court officials say. **********\"You are dealing with people fighting over money in one of the most difficult periods of their lives,\" said A. Gail Prudenti of Suffolk County, one of the 63  Surrogate Court judges in New York State who supervise estates, trusts and contested wills. **********In Westchester County, Surrogate Judge Albert J. Emanuelli agreed. \"Heirs today are much more prone to litigate than they were just a few years ago,\" he observed. \"Any latent hostility that existed during mom and dad's lifetime rises in full bloom.  The children don't have to worry about mom and dad's feelings any more and they really take it out on each other.\" **********Some court fights concern emotional issues rather than money, he said. Disputes over relatively inexpensive heirlooms last for years and result in legal fees that add up to many times the value of the items. **********Divorce and remarriage spawn the most bitter legal battles, Judge Emanuelli said. \"I think the 10 years I spent in private practice specializing in matrimonial law has been the best preparation for this job,\" the judge said with a sigh. **********These battles fall into a category that Prof. Thomas J. Reed of the Widener School of Law in Wilmington, Del., calls \"David and Bathsheba\" after the Biblical king and his second wife. **********Professor Reed was co-author of \"Will Contests\" (Clark Boardman Callahan) with Eunice L. Ross, a Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas judge; in the book, they used literary and cultural allusions to label the most common reasons why wills are contested. Others are \"Uriah Heep,\" after the clerk in Dickens's \"David Copperfield,\" a symbol of a person who abuses his position of trust; \"Judge Pyncheon,\" from Hawthorne's \"House of Seven Gables,\" who exerts undue influence to share in an estate; \"Esau and Jacob,\" based on the Old Testament brothers who represent the issues of sibling rivalry and parental favoritism, and \"Mary Worth,\" the comic strip protagonist who represents the kindly old busybody named chief beneficiary in a neighbor's will. **********Trying to arrange one's final affairs with a trust, either to avoid estate taxes or probate, does not eliminate the potential problems of not having a will. A will is still needed to cover items not transferred to the trust, said Ernie Wruck Jr., an estate and trust lawyer in Patchogue, L.I. **********\"There are a lot of do-it-yourselfers out there right now who are drawing up  living trusts to avoid probate,\" Mr. Wruck said. \"Nine out of 10 times they are  going to forget to put all of their assets into the trust. We have one guy with  a $15 million estate who neglected to include another $2 million he owned. That  sum goes to probate, and unless he has a will naming beneficiaries, the court will distribute it according to a state formula, not necessarily the people he intended it to go to.\" **********Putting One's Affairs in Order **********Dying without a will is considered the biggest of all estate-planning mistakes. But even if you have a will, you should take these precautions to make sure there is no confusion among your heirs. *********** Make sure the will is properly witnessed and otherwise valid, is up to date and is placed in safekeeping. It should name an executor to handle the distribution of assets and other essential legal tasks. *********** If you move to another state, have your will reviewed by a lawyer there. *********** Apart from the will, create a folder marked \"open in case of death\" and put in it the names, addresses and phone numbers of an executor, lawyers and financial planners and the location of the will. Family or close friends should  be informed in writing where the folder can be found. *********** In the folder, keep a list of property, along with the names and account numbers of bank accounts, insurance policies, stocks, bonds, retirement and pension funds, veterans benefits and all other sources of income. Note your personal debts and include copies of recent state and Federal income tax returns. *********** Also in the folder, list your preferences on burial versus cremation, funeral  versus memorial services.

French troops had been patrolling the capital, Bangui, at the Government's request, but most of the troops retreated to their bases, witnesses said, as fighting and looting continued. **********[A French military plane flew out with 138 French nationals, and an American  military plane was used to evacuate 13 Americans as American marines arrived to  help. French troops were flown from Gabon and Chad to reinforce those already in the Central African Republic.] **********In response to worried appeals by clients across the continent over rumors of an impending cutback of French troops, Mr. Chirac's Government pledged that Paris's military presence in Africa, totaling some 8,700 soldiers, would not be  reduced. **********If the announcement soothed Paris's main political allies , however, it has also stirred a public debate in Africa's increasingly free press and among opposition parties about France's mission on the continent. **********Late last year, France's Minister for Foreign Assistance, Jacques Godfrain, explained the sense of his country's continuing military presence in Africa in terms of stabilizing democracies. Paris \"will intervene each time an elected democratic power is overthrown by a coup d'etat if a military cooperation agreement exists,\" he said. **********Given that France had never done such a thing and that most of its African-based troops are billeted in countries of dubious democratic credentials, Mr. Godfrain's remarks unleashed a storm of skeptical commentary throughout West and Central Africa. **********The skepticism turned to derision when Niger's first democratically elected Government fell to a military coup in February. At the time, France, which has a defense treaty with Niger, said it regretted the development but would not intervene. **********\"What justifies this kind of presence?\" asked an editorialist in the Ivory Coast daily Le Jour. \"An external threat? Nothing could be less certain.\" For the Ivorian newspaper, and for commentators throughout this region, France's presence here has more to do with perpetuating Paris's predominance in an area that it has long considered its \"natural\" zone of influence. **********\"Only the African continent gives France the illusion of being a great power,\" another Ivorian editorialist wrote, under the headline \"France Comes to  the Rescue of Dictators,\" in response to Mr. Godfrain's remarks. **********Some countries where French troops are stationed, like the Ivory Coast and Gabon, represent rich markets for France or, like Niger and Chad, are current or potentially important sources of strategic resources such as uranium and oil. **********For many experts on African affairs, the history of France's military role in post-colonial Africa can be neatly condensed in the experience of Gabon, where Paris launched the first of many full-fledged interventions in 1964. **********When Gabon's first President, Leon M'ba, was overthrown in a broadly popular  military coup in 1964, French paratroopers were flown in to reinstate Mr. M'ba,  whose devotion to France was legendary. **********Mr. M'ba was soon weakened by illness, and by France's promotion of a young aide, Omar Bongo, to near figurehead status. Jacques Foccart, the chief adviser  on Africa to the French President at the time, Charles de Gaulle, wrote in his memoirs that Paris literally auditioned Mr. Bongo for the role of head of state, which he assumed in 1968 upon Mr. M'ba's death. **********Shortly after taking office, Mr. Bongo banned opposition parties in Gabon, and ruled unchallenged until a democratic reform movement began sweeping much of Africa in 1990. With his huge mansions throughout Gabon and around the world, diplomats say Mr. Bongo has used the country's large oil revenues to become one  of the continent's wealthiest leaders. **********Diplomats say corporations and businessmen from France, which retains an unusually high degree of influence here, even by the standards of its former colonies, have also done well by Gabon's oil-based economy. **********To protect that investment, from their bases in Gabon, the 600 or so French troops here have intervened twice, in 1990 and 1994, to help put down civil disturbances directed against Mr. Bongo's rule. **********A second wave of riots occurred after Mr. Bongo declared himself the winner of an election that international observers called \"a very flawed exercise,\" with 51 percent of the vote. **********These days, Mr. Bongo, who is also protected by Moroccan security units and privately hired former French military officers, never goes anywhere without first closing off nearby streets to traffic. **********\"There is no threat to Gabon other than the disaffection of the population towards its leader,\" said one Gabonese businessman who is sympathetic to the opposition. \"When someone needs this kind of protection, that should tell you immediately that something is badly wrong.\" **********For diplomats of other Western nations, France's high-profile security role in countries like Gabon has more to do with preserving Paris's privileged access to business opportunities than it does with questions of democracy. **********\"You could talk about the French presence for hours and hours, but it comes down to two things: prestige and business,\" said a Western diplomat here. \"And they are absolutely determined not to let go of either.\" **********Though more and more Africans have begun to openly criticize France leveraging its military presence and tight network of political ties in Africa to maintain a commercial grip on its foreign colonies, French officials have been frankly unapologetic. **********\"When we aid a country, we must have a minimum in return,\" said Bernard Debre, a former minister of foreign assistance, in an interview with the Paris-based magazine Jeune Afrique. \"For France, Africa is also a market. Not a  captive market, certainly, but not a sieve either.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/19/business/people.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-11-19", "snippet": "Recent promotions in advertising field noted (S)", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "People", "body_text": " **********David Ward was named to the new position of senior vice president, responsible for media and the primary research departments at Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, Boston.

The nation's unemployment rate eased to 5.4 percent in April from 5.6 percent in March and was at the lowest level in 14 months, even though there was no growth in business payrolls. **********The results reduced chances that the Federal Reserve would find it necessary  to tighten monetary policy soon.

The slowdown reflected surprisingly weak sales at Ford and some shortages of General Motors autos, which were slow getting to dealers because of the strike.

H. Macy & Company, abruptly announced yesterday that it was \"discontinuing its aggressive style\" of investing in the stocks, bonds and bank debt of weak and insolvent companies. **********\"Today, aggressive investing can require a large ownership position and involvement in the reorganization process, including sitting on boards of directors and seeking to effect management changes,\" said Perry Chlan, a Fidelity spokesman. \"Those are not consistent with our approach to investment management.\" **********In the future, he said, Fidelity will limit itself to smaller, \"value-oriented\" holdings \"consistent with our mutual fund investment practices.\" **********The unexpected policy shift, which could jolt the thinly traded market for bankruptcy-linked securities, was confirmed by Mr. Chlan after Fidelity, the nation's largest mutual fund company and a unit of the FMR Corporation, announced the resignation of three key figures in its bankruptcy investing team: the money managers David J. Breazzano and Dan Harmetz, and the legal specialist  Judy K. Mencher. **********Mr. Breazzano was until yesterday the manager of the $2.3 billion Fidelity Capital and Income Fund, a substantial investor in the distressed securities market. Mr. Harmetz and Ms. Mencher were the dominant figures in the Macy bankruptcy in 1994, which led to Macy being merged into Federated Department Stores. In addition, Mr. Harmetz has managed three private investment partnerships, similar to highly leveraged hedge funds, with investments estimated at $750 million, largely in distressed securities. **********According to Fidelity, Mr. Breazzano's spot at the Capital and Income Fund will be taken by David L. Glancy, who now manages the Spartan High Income Fund.  That fund, in turn, will be taken over by Thomas T. Soviero, who had been managing private high-income accounts since 1994. **********Mr. Glancy, an accountant by training, worked for three years as a bond analyst before joining Fidelity in 1990. Mr. Soviero had four years' experience  as a bond and equity analyst before Fidelity hired him as an analyst in 1989. **********While both are described by colleagues and competitors as extremely intelligent, neither man has the reputation of Mr. Breazzano, who was a well-regarded bankruptcy investment manager at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore before he joined Fidelity in November 1990, or Mr. Harmetz, whose pre-Fidelity experience included managing the junk-bond portfolio of Columbia Savings and Loan in California. **********Nor have either Mr. Glancy or Mr. Soviero been deeply involved in the troubled companies in which Fidelity is currently playing an important role: Harrah's Jazz Company, Merry-Go-Round Enterprises and the El Paso Electric Company. **********All three have been substantial headaches -- and major disappointments -- for Fidelity. Harrah's Jazz collapsed into bankruptcy in November, barely a year after selling nearly $500 million worth of bonds to develop a casino and hotel complex in New Orleans. Since the bankruptcy filing, Fidelity has emerged as an  aggressive creditor -- it has already filed litigation against various figures involved in the case. **********In addition, Ms. Mencher has been playing a substantial role in the efforts of Merry-Go-Round, the retailing chain, to emerge from bankruptcy. The company's plan for reorganization, which was expected to be approved by last June, has been delayed amid continuing losses and weak sales. **********And while Fidelity successfully negotiated a reorganization for El Paso Electric, the result was an embarrassing regulatory bind: Fidelity stood to own  nearly 30 percent of the reorganized company, a stake so large that the mutual fund company could have been deemed to be a \"public utility holding company\" under Federal securities laws. To avoid that designation, which would have radically limited the fund group's investment options, it had to obtain an S.E.C. exemption from the Federal statutes. **********Asked about how Fidelity would deal with these on-going situations, Fidelity's spokesman, Mr. Chlan, said that Fidelity expected all three departing executives \"to work with us to help us meet our obligations to all our clients.\" He said the specific terms of their future involvement with Fidelity had not yet been determined. **********The three were the core of Fidelity's high-income division, which manages about $8 billion through four public mutual funds and at least three private investment partnerships. Besides the Capital and Income Fund, the public mutual  funds managed by this unit include the Fidelity Spartan High-Income Fund, the Fidelity Advisor Strategic Income Fund and the Fidelity Advisor High Yield Fund. The three private partnerships managed by Mr. Harmetz are the Belmont Fund, the  Copernicus Fund and the Galileo Fund. **********None of the three departing executives returned calls made to their offices yesterday, but according to Fidelity, they intend to unite to form an independent asset management company specializing in distressed securities. With their Fidelity track record, all could reasonably expect to easily raise money from private investors -- indeed, Donald J. Trump, who knows Mr. Harmetz from his own dealings with Fidelity, is said to be among the investors lined up  for the new firm. **********Wall Street has always been home to so-called vulture investors -- people who buy the bonds and other securities of insolvent companies for pennies on the dollar, and then push for corporate changes that could make those securities more valuable. But public mutual funds did not enter the field in large numbers  until the late 1980's, when major junk-bond issuers started to collapse into bankruptcy. **********While many junk bond funds thus became \"accidental vultures,\" Fidelity quickly expanded its presence and increased its power in the field. In December  1990, it officially converted its former junk-bond fund, renamed the Capital and Income Fund, into a fund specializing in both junk bonds and distressed securities. **********Since then, it has been an active player in dozens of important cases, including several of the Trump casino bankruptcies, the Bally's Grand casino-hotel case and, most visibly, the Macy bankruptcy reorganization."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/01/business/company-news-shares-of-chip-maker-lsi-logic-fall-for-a-second-day.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;SHARES OF CHIP MAKER LSI LOGIC FALL FOR A SECOND DAY", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;SHARES OF CHIP MAKER LSI LOGIC FALL FOR A SECOND DAY", "body_text": " **********The stock of the LSI Logic Corporation fell again yesterday, a day after it joined other computer chip makers in warning of disappointing profits.

Yet many worry that the market could well be lulled  into complacency when it should instead be concerned about the red flags raised  by Orange County since it filed for bankruptcy in December 1994. **********\"Things that were once unthinkable are now being thought of,\" said Joe Mysak, editor of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer, a trade publication. \"This wasn't like nothing happened. This was a big deal. Yet I don't think people appreciate  the risks that this crisis revealed, because they haven't been touched by them yet. There's just a lot less security in municipal finance. This is a seismic event. Yet it will take a while to measure the reverberations.\" **********Unlike the corporate bond markets, in which risk is scrutinized from a variety of angles and security holders know that they could lose most of their money, the municipal markets have always been viewed as sleepier and less risky. There has been less scrutiny of the underlying risk of municipal deals, of the creditworthiness of municipalities and the risk of default, because investors have always been assured that municipalities would raise taxes to pay off their  borrowings -- and if they did not, the state would step in to help. That, in fact, is how financial crises in New York, Philadelphia and Cleveland were resolved. **********In Orange County, not only did the county do the unthinkable -- make its creditors fight it out with the county in bankruptcy court -- but it did not raise taxes to cover its debts. And the State of California made it clear that it would not step in to help. **********\"The municipal system did receive some interesting tests,\" said Paul S. Maco, head of the Securities and Exchange Commission's office of municipal securities. \"The edges of the envelope were tested.\" **********In the end, the crisis was resolved when Orange County engineered an elaborate plan, dubbed Project Robin Hood, to divert funds coming into some of the county's agencies and use them instead to repay bondholders. In addition, some Orange County municipalities agreed to accept only 80 cents on the dollar for claims they had against the county from the losses in the county's investment pool, with the rest to be made up from any proceeds of litigation filed by the county against its former financial advisers. **********\"Investors will interpret the resolution of Orange County as an affirmation that there is no risk in municipal debt,\" said Chris Varelas, an adviser to the  county at Salomon Brothers. \"But Orange County proves that the safeguards to investors may not be there. We've recalculated risk. What does 'full faith and credit' mean when you have no ability to raise taxes and you have a community with high antitax sentiment. Does it mean you will be paid in full?\" **********He added: \"The risk was always there. But people's perception of risk was not calibrated with the actuality of it.\" **********Orange County exposes the risks inherent in municipal finance: that municipalities can file for bankruptcy, that their elected officials may not be  responsible or right-thinking, that default is possible and that financially pressed municipalities may have neither the resources nor the willingness to always honor their obligations. Especially in an era of taxpayer revolt and the  shifting of the burden for costly health and welfare services from the Federal Government to cash-short local governments, these issues are expected to come into play even more in the future, experts say. **********\"Orange County gave us a fundamental lesson that wasn't there before,\" said Jeremy Ragus, a municipal portfolio manager for Scudder, Stevens & Clark, a mutual fund company. \"Before, the willingness of any major voting group to pay was never in question. There are now limits of what you can do with taxes -- you just can't raise them.\" **********In addition, Orange County's bankruptcy was the catalyst for several other trends. There is some debate about whether the apparently successful resolution  will encourage more municipalities to seek bankruptcy protection. **********Some argue that it has given the S.E.C. a broad platform to make its case for greater financial accountability by public officials and more prudence in the investment of public funds. And there may well be a shift in the type of borrowing used by municipalities -- more toward project finance, with limited protection given to borrowers, and away from general obligation bonds and their  unlimited promise to repay investors. **********At least two groups are thinking about proposing amendments to the Federal Bankruptcy Code to make it more difficult for municipalities to seek bankruptcy  protection. As this goes on, some say that Orange County has moved municipal bankruptcy from the unthinkable to a possible financial tool. Others say that the pain and disruption that resulted in Orange County show how costly a tool this is. **********Bankruptcy, after all, does not reduce the payment of obligations, it only slows it down. In Orange County's case, the county has $800 million more in long-term debt than when it filed for bankruptcy, and services to many of its citizens, mainly the poor, are being drastically cut. **********With some Orange County officials facing civil and criminal charges over their roles in the county's $1.6 billion loss, a warning shot has been fired against poor public oversight. \"There's a great level of fear and concern among  local officials over the S.E.C. enforcement actions,\" said Robert Dean Pope, a bond attorney with Hunton & Williams, a Richmond firm. **********James Spiotto, a lawyer with Chapman & Cutler in Chicago, added: \"It won't be amateur hour any more. The professionals and the officials will be required by the S.E.C. and by the market to know and stand by their product.\" **********One market analyst, who insisted that he not be named, said: \"Orange County was a near miss. Every time this happens, all bets are off. Before, the market got used to municipalities doing what they promised for bondholders and then more. Now municipalities may well just do what they promised -- and no more.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/11/business/ge-reports-11-increase-in-third-quarter-earnings.html": {"writer_name": "Claudia Deutsch", "pub_date": "1996-10-11", "snippet": "General Electric Co says third-quarter earnings increased 11 percent over period last year; sales were up more than 15 percent, to $20 billion; actual earnings were $1.788 billion, up 11 percent over corresponding quarter last year; table (L)", "word_count": 513, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.E.

Reports 11% Increase In Third-Quarter Earnings", "body_text": " **********The General Electric Company announced yesterday that third-quarter earnings increased 11 percent over the period last year. **********''It was a truly solid quarter,'' said  Ann M. Schwetje of Smith Barney.  Nicholas P. Heymann, a NatWest Securities analyst who is among the most bullish of G.E.'s fans, readily agreed. ''It shows everything is A-O.K. and on track there,'' he said. **********Indeed it is. G.E., a conglomeration of 12 disparate businesses, has always been well hedged -- a sluggish European market can always be offset by a boom in Asia, while one good sweeps week at NBC can make up for a badly timed entry into on-line information markets. And lately, only G.E.'s smallest businesses, like transportation and information systems, have been hiccupping. Indeed, the company's sales were up more than 15 percent, to $20 billion. **********''One of the joys is that our largest divisions, like GE Capital, power systems and NBC, led the record growth,'' said Bruce Bunch, a G.E. spokesman. **********G.E. has been cutting costs across the company. Its manufacturing divisions are chasing service and spare parts contracts, far less capital-intensive businesses than equipment manufacturing. And all its businesses are trying to sell more to existing customers, which is less expensive than trying to woo new ones. **********The cost improvements have freed up a staggering amount of cash. So far this year G.E. has generated $5.4 billion in cash, compared with just $2.4 billion in the first nine months of last year. Much of that money has been used to increase dividends and to buy back stock. In fact, the stock buybacks were in part responsible for raising earnings to $1.08 a share. The gain over the third quarter last year was 13 percent a share, exactly what analysts had predicted. Actual earnings were $1.788 billion, up 11 percent over the corresponding quarter last year. **********Both the sales and earnings reflect a nonrecurring bonanza from last summer's Olympics, which analysts say tacked $650 million onto NBC's sales numbers and added close to $60 million in profits to the company's  coffers. The sluggish economy in Europe, an area that accounts for about a fifth of G.E.'s sales (a quarter, counting exports from the United States), reined in some sales. **********Still, the good news far outweighed the bad. G.E.'s major appliances, despite a flat market, saw sales increase about 4 percent, as G.E. continued to grab share away from Whirlpool, Maytag and other makers of washers, dryers and the like. **********G.E. plastics and silicones did well, despite soaring chemical costs, primarily because demand was high and no new capacity came on stream. **********G.E.'s power systems division, which has had technological problems with some of its newer turbines as well as a flat market from American utilities, got a tremendous boost when Nuovo Pignone, the Italian company it purchased in late 1993, received a $1 billion contract to supply compressors to Gazprom, Russia's huge natural gas company. Power system's sales were up 30 percent and its profits up 35 percent for the quarter. **********Even G.E.'s nuclear businesses are enjoying a turnaround, as more utilities hire the company to manage existing nuclear power plants."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/26/world/east-german-ex-activists-continue-as-a-force-in-west.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1996-05-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1192, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "East German Ex-Activists Continue as a Force in West", "print_headline": "East German Ex-Activists Continue as a Force in West", "body_text": " **********When Chancellor Helmut Kohl dropped by to visit the human rights advocate Barbel Bohley in her small Berlin apartment recently, a storm of controversy erupted. **********Ms. Bohley helped organize the mass protests that brought down East Germany's Communist Government in 1989, and many of her former comrades felt she was betraying their cause by sipping tea with someone who epitomizes the political establishment as completely as Chancellor Kohl. Left-leaning journals condemned  her with headlines like \"Former Dissident Makes Peace With Power.\" **********The criticism did not seem to bother Ms. Bohley, who has spent much of her life as an outsider. But when a satirical magazine devoted its cover to a photomontage in which she appeared to be having sex with the Chancellor, she sued. A judge is now considering the case. **********That such a furor should erupt around Ms. Bohley's political choices reflects the influence that leaders of the East German revolution still have here. Although very few have moved into positions of power in the united Germany, they still have a call on the nation's conscience. They join demonstrations, sign petitions, write articles and preach sermons. Whatever they say or do, people in both east and west take note. **********\"These people play a very interesting role in our society,\" said Peter Schneider, the Berlin novelist and screenwriter. \"We naturally admire them for their courage, but there's also another side to it. Some people resent them because they are living proof that the individual can resist evil. Many Germans  are uncomfortable facing that truth, because we've built a national myth out of  the belief that there is no alternative to submitting to tyrants.\" **********The former dissidents often attract large audiences when they speak in western Germany, and they are regularly quoted in newspapers throughout the country. Leading politicians compete to honor them. A few months ago, President  Roman Herzog awarded 28 of them the Federal Merit Cross, Germany's highest civilian award. Chancellor Kohl has met with them several times and is planning  to be a co-sponsor of a new lobby group that will represent victims of repression in East Germany. **********\"We have the greatest respect and admiration for the men and women whose courage in the face of tyranny made this peaceful revolution possible,\" Mr. Kohl said recently in Leipzig. \"The civil rights movement played a crucial role in the collapse of the Communist dictatorship.\" **********What is odd about this flow of tributes is that they honor a small group of people whose views about unified Germany are far from uniformly positive. In a series of interviews, several complained that the country they helped create is  too materialistic and that easterners have not been given a fair voice. **********Instinctively critical of capitalism but also acutely aware of the importance of freedom, the 1989 leaders today weigh the success of their movement against what they see as its failure to create a caring, idealistic society. **********\"The most important success is that we now have democratic freedoms, which is something I will never undervalue,\" said the Rev. Friedrich Schorlemmer, a Lutheran minister based in Wittenberg who runs several social projects in addition to his parish responsibilities. \"It's also great that in this region where everything was falling apart, so much is being done to rebuild schools and roads and other things we need. **********\"But two things have gone very wrong. The first is that although we have escaped from the tyranny of ideology, we fell into the tyranny of money. The way wealth is distributed in this society is something I find very hard to take. **********\"The second thing is that we easterners lost our feeling of dignity, because  the west ignored all of our suggestions for change. They didn't take our experience seriously. Looking back at it now, I see that a true unification was  not possible. The west was too big and powerful, and we were too small and poor.\" **********An even stronger critique came from another Lutheran pastor, the Rev. Christian Fuhrer. His church in Leipzig was a hotbed of dissent during the Communist era, and a new film about his exploits in those days has renewed his aura of heroism. He speaks bitterly about unification. **********\"I feel a sense of disillusion, of dreams falling away,\" Pastor Fuhrer said in his cluttered parish office. \"You have to remember that we East Germans had no real picture of what life was life in the west. We had no idea how competitive it would be. The whole system was unknown. **********\"The chance to renew Germany was not taken. A very conscious decision was made not to create a new Germany. People in the west simply do not believe that  their system needs any change. Unification was like a marriage in which one partner expects the other to do everything his way, but doesn't make that clear  until after the wedding.\" **********Not all veterans of the 1989 movement hold such regrets. One who offered a more positive view was Ulrike Poppe, who was a co-founder of one of East Germany's first dissident groups in 1983 and who helped plan many anti-Government protests in and around Berlin. **********\"I had hoped for more from unification, something more than just a reaffirmation of the West German political system,\" said Ms. Poppe, who now organizes seminars on human rights and social issues. \"I thought there would be  a little more in the way of reform. But fundamentally, we got what we wanted. We live in a state of law. The conditions of life allow us to pursue our own goals.\" **********Like several other former East German dissidents, Ms. Poppe turned down chances to pursue a political career. One who made the opposite choice is Joachim Gauck, a Lutheran clergyman from the northern city of Rostock. Mr. Gauck now holds one of Germany's most sensitive jobs: He runs the agency charged with  holding, analyzing and releasing the vast archives left behind by the Stasi, the East German secret police. **********During the tumultuous days following the collapse of the Berlin wall in November 1989, Mr. Gauck strongly urged quick German unification. He rejected the view, held by Ms. Bohley and others, that East Germany should remain apart and try to build a new society of its own. Today he is certain he was right. **********\"I'm more pleased with the results of unification than a lot of other people  who were active in the East German opposition,\" Mr. Gauck said. \"As I see it, we now have just about everything we fought for. We won. Naturally I'm not pleased to be living in a society where 10 percent of the people are unemployed. But we have basic freedoms, and that gives us the power to build whatever kind of society we want.\" **********The failings that many easterners see in unification, Mr. Gauck asserted, are partly their own fault. **********\"I wish easterners would participate more in public life,\" he said.  \"We aren't used to doing that, because we grew up under dictatorship. The idea of active participation was bred out of us over 40 years. Now we want to enjoy freedom, but we don't understand what it is. We don't realize that it takes work.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/08/world/pinhas-alter-69-israel-orthodox-leader.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Obituary; Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pinhas Alter, 69, Israel Orthodox Leader", "print_headline": "Pinhas Alter, 69, Israel Orthodox Leader", "body_text": " **********Pinhas Menachem Alter, one of Israel's rigorously Orthodox rabbis, died today in Jerusalem.

Of the largest carriers, Northwest faces perhaps the least competition from feisty low-cost airlines. With the help of an industry recovery, Northwest's stock has risen from an initial offering price of $13 in 1994 to yesterday's close of $49.625 a  share. **********And to reward its senior managers, Northwest disclosed last week that it was  seeking to raise the number of shares available for bonuses to five million from two million. **********This quiet prosperity, though, may be disrupted this fall when Northwest's union contracts expire. **********At the very minimum, the unions will get so-called snapbacks to return their  annual wages to what they were before they gave up about $280 million in wages.  In return for those concessions, the unions got almost a third of the company's  stock and three seats on the 15-member board. **********But union leaders say they will be looking for far more than simply a return  to old wage levels. Rather, they want to reap rewards above and beyond an appreciating stock price. Just how hard they will negotiate represents a question that many investors do not fully appreciate. **********\"The market hasn't fully factored in the uncertainty surrounding the snapbacks and the accompanying labor negotiations this fall,\" said Jeffrey Long, an analyst at J. P. Morgan. **********Grumbling from organized labor prior to contract talks is to be expected. But warnings from Northwest's union leaders cannot be easily dismissed. Of the big airline employee-ownership deals in recent years, including one at United Airlines, Northwest Airlines benefited the most from swapping stock for wage concessions -- the move that helped it avert a bankruptcy filing. **********\"Their rescue was the deepest,\" said Joseph R. Blasi, a professor of management-labor relations at Rutgers University. **********That fact is not lost on Northwest's labor leaders. \"Now is the day of reckoning,\" said Marvin Sandrin, president of the International Association of Machinists local that represents Northwest mechanics. \"If we are going to take a chance on the downside, we sure as hell want a part of the profits on the upside.\" **********Bruce Retrum, president of the teamsters' local that represents Northwest flight attendants, added that he, too, would be asking for something above and beyond the snapbacks. \"Northwest is a revitalized company, much to the credit of the hard work of its employees,\" he said. \"It has been a difficult three years for our members,\" whose wages were cut 12 to 13 percent. **********Although John H. Dasburg, the president, gave back a $750,000 bonus he earned in 1994, he more than made up for it last year by cashing in on stock options worth $8.7 million. The company's proxy statement also disclosed that Northwest    will also grant him the cash equivalent of 100,000 shares in August, around the  time the union contracts expire. In addition, he will have the chance to earn, depending on his and the airline's performance, the equivalent of 400,000 shares through the year 2004. **********Mr. Dasburg's jump in overall pay mirrors the increases for many other top executives. According to compensation experts, chief executives at some of the nation's largest corporations earned pay packages last year that grew at a rate  far quicker than for most American workers. **********The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents Northwest pilots, is bothered less by Mr. Dasburg's incentive pay. After all, a representative of the union sits on the board's compensation committee. In addition, said Paul Omodt,  a spokesman for the union, the pilots felt that Mr. Dasburg had put a good team  in place and was keeping the airline on firm footing, making an incentive package necessary to keep him. **********\"It is,\" Mr. Omodt said, \"one of the realities of business today.\" **********Kevin C. Murphy, an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley, said he believed that  productive management-labor relations at Northwest in recent years would continue to protect the gains reflected in Northwest's stock price. **********Mr. Murphy also characterized Mr. Dasburg's incentive pay as a bargain, considering the rise in Northwest's stock price. **********\"Any time you're creating enormous value,\" he said, \"you're worth $8.7 million.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/16/business/at-t-to-seek-wide-arbitration-on-gte.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-08-16", "snippet": "AT&T says it will seek arbitration in 20 states to allow it to offer local phone service in areas served by GTE Corp (S)", "word_count": 107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AT&T to Seek Wide Arbitration on GTE", "print_headline": "AT&T to Seek Wide Arbitration on GTE", "body_text": " **********AT&T said yesterday that it would seek arbitration in 20 states to allow it to offer local phone service in areas served by the GTE Corporation **********AT&T wants regulatory panels in the states to settle questions on pricing, availability of GTE services, connection between AT&T's and GTE's networks, ordering, billing and maintenance. **********Under a Federal law passed this year, companies seeking to enter the local telephone market can ask state regulators to settle disputes, AT&T said, adding that the arbitration must conclude by Dec. 12. **********The states are Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/16/business/new-jobs-for-two-agency-executives.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliot", "pub_date": "1996-08-16", "snippet": "Young & Rubicam Inc names Philippe Krakowsky to head its corporate communication department; Richard McGowan will take new position of communications director for Dentsu Y&R Partnerships in Sydney, Australia (S)", "word_count": 119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Jobs for Two Agency Executives", "print_headline": "New Jobs for Two Agency Executives", "body_text": " **********Corporate communications executives at two agencies are getting new assignments. **********Young & Rubicam Inc. in New York yesterday named Philippe Krakowsky, corporate communications director at BBDO Worldwide in New York, to head its corporate communications department.

He spoke at a seminar on Hong Kong's economic future that was organized by a local business lobby. **********\"There were quite serious worries that Beijing might force people to choose between local residency and foreign nationality,\" said the businessman, the holder of a foreign passport. **********But while Mr. Lu's speech is likely to reassure the estimated 700,000 to 1 million people in Hong Kong with foreign passports, he said nothing to diffuse tensions in rapidly polarizing local political circles. **********Mr. Lu's visit coincides with a meeting of the Preparatory Committee, a group appointed by Beijing to decide a host of key transition matters. **********It also comes when many local residents, particularly those who are active politically, are expressing grave fears about China's plans to stifle dissent. **********Beijing's decision to press forward with plans to abolish Hong Kong's first fully elected legislature and replace it with an appointed body that will begin its work six months before the handover has quickly opened a chasm between groups that support and oppose this decision. **********China says it was forced to do this in retaliation for a unilateral decision by Britain to reform rules for the elections held last September. **********The Hong Kong and British governments decry Beijing's plans and refuse to cooperate with any gestures that might legitimize the provisional body. **********A senior Chinese official's demands earlier this month that top-level Hong Kong bureaucrats openly support the coming provisional legislature has badly shaken a largely apolitical civil service. **********At the same time, the refusal by the Preparatory Committee to meet with any local community groups that question the legality of China's plans for a provisional legislature suggests that open political debate in Hong Kong could be endangered, some politicians said. **********\"Hong Kong people seem to be trapped like a bird in a cage now,\" a local legislator, Cheung Man-kwong, told Reuters. **********\"I'd rather become a small bird flying free than a canary in a cage only singing those songs that a master likes to hear,\" said Mr. Cheung, who was barred from the consultations with the Preparatory Committee earlier this week because he opposed China's plan to appoint the legislature."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/29/world/australia-gunman-kills-at-least-32.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 836, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AUSTRALIA GUNMAN KILLS AT LEAST 32", "print_headline": "AUSTRALIA GUNMAN KILLS AT LEAST 32", "body_text": " **********A gunman methodically killed at least 32 people at and near a popular tourist site on Sunday. The police captured him today when he bolted in flames from a guest cottage, which he had set afire with three hostages inside. **********The gunman, whom police described as a 29-year-old with a history of psychological problems, had opened fire with an semiautomatic rifle on Sunday afternoon on tourists at the ruins of a colonial prison on Tasmania. **********It was the worse shooting massacre in Australia in this century. **********The police indicated that they expected to find the bodies of three more victims inside the guest cottage, where the gunman took three hostages and held  the police at bay for 12 hours. **********Witnesses said the incident began at about 1:30 P.M. on Sunday, when the blond man drove up to the prison in a Volkswagen with a surfboard strapped on its top and talked casually with some of the 500 people outside. **********\"He said, 'There's a lot of WASP's around today; there's not many Japs here,  are there?' and then started muttering to himself,\" an unidentified survivor told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio. **********The man then walked into a cafe, pulled the rifle from a tennis bag, and methodically started shooting. **********\"He wasn't going bang-bang-bang-bang,\" a witness, Phillip Milburn, told the Australian radio. \"It was 'bang,' and then he'd pick someone else out and line them up and shoot them.\" **********[An account by Reuters, quoting Deputy Police Commissioner Richard McCreadie  at a news conference in Hobart, the capital, gave this sequence of events: The gunman first opened fire with a high-powered rife in the crowded cafe, killing 20 people.  [He moved on among the ruins, shooting three people dead outside the cafe. He got back into his car and drove to the entrance to the ruins, where he  killed a 3-year-old girl and 6-year-old girl and their mother. He shot dead all  four occupants of a car, which he then drove to a nearby service station, killing a woman there -- his 31st victim. Mr. McCreadie did not account for the  32d victim. **********[The gunman also kidnapped a man and stowed him in the trunk of the stolen car, then drove to the nearby Seascape guest house, where he holed up with the hostages.] **********The bed-and-breakfast cottage was owned by a couple who apparently were friends of the gunman's late father. The Age newspaper of Melbourne identified them as David and Sally Martin. **********By early today, more than 200 local and special police units had surrounded the guest house. **********The police tried to negotiate by phone with the gunman, who fired two heavy-caliber military-type rifles at them and at helicopters airlifting out the dead and wounded. He demanded a helicopter for himself. **********When he set the cottage on fire, flames finally drove him from the building.  He threw his rifle aside. **********\"His clothing was on fire, and he started taking his clothing off,\" said Police Superintendent Bob Fielding. **********Exploding ammunition in the burning house prevented officers from rapidly searching it to learn the fate of the three hostages. \"It doesn't look very good,\" Mr. Fielding said. **********The police said 25 of those killed in the shooting spree were Australians, but the dead also included two Malaysians and a victim who appeared to be Indian. Four people were not identified. **********One American and two Canadians were wounded along with 15 others. The police  said only that the American man, from Washington state, was not badly hurt. **********One Melbourne woman told the Australian Associated Press that she survived by hiding under a table at the cafe. **********\"There were people just sitting there in their chairs where they'd been eating -- dead,\" she said. \"There was a weird sort of calm, as if no one could believe what they were seeing.\" **********Wendy Scurr, who worked at the front desk at the historic site, said the gunman had left \"shooting as he went, shooting everybody he could see.\" She said she \"ran for my life along with hundreds of other people at the site.\" **********Another witness, Karen Jones, told the Australian radio that as the gunman kept firing at fleeing tourists and at tourist buses outside the cafe, \"the guy  that we were with had to go and help take a stretcher in, and the mother was saying, 'You have to get my baby to the hospital, quick, quick.' But it was already dead.\" **********The old Port Arthur prison colony is on the Tasman Peninsula, connected to Tasmania's mainland by one road on a narrow isthmus. The police closed off the road into Port Arthur, the landing site of some of the toughest convicts England sent into Australian exile in the 1800's. **********State gun laws vary in Australia, but it is fairly easy for a person without  a criminal record to buy a rifle or shotgun. Pistols are less commonly owned. **********Tasmania has one of the most lax gun laws in the nation.

In many countries, laws exist that require employers to give women maternity leave and keep their jobs open, sometimes for years after they give birth. **********But the reality for women trying to continue their careers and raise children is often quite different.One of the biggest stumbling blocks is finding and paying for adequate child care. **********In Europe, covering the gap between the end of maternity pay benefits \u2014 usually after three months \u2014 and the beginning of school \u2014 at the earliest usually three years later \u2014 can involve searching out private care. **********As cash-strapped governments rein in welfare spending, there are fewer state-backed child-care options. **********For one British mother, Helen Westwell, there was never any doubt that she would return to her job in advertising as soon as her five-month, partially paid maternity leave ended and her son, Oscar, was old enough to attend a nursery.She also knew that she would have to find private child care. **********Although state-run nurseries exist in Britain, many have been closed down because of funding problems and there is enormous competition for places at those remaining. **********In North London, Ms. Westwell foundplenty of good private nurseries.

At the same time, new product development and marketing are becoming increasingly important to profitability in newly liberalized markets. **********The changing landscape favors the multinational food groups, but the enormity and diversity of the Asian markets is forcing the big foreign players to adapt their strategies to local conditions, according to Mr. Vivarel of Danone. **********\"Multinationals have changed their ways. Once they bought 100 percent control and told the old management to get out,\" Mr. Vivarel said. \"Now many start out as minority partners and slowly build up their positions. It's more cooperation these days than mergers and acquisitions.\" **********The competition is changing, too. **********\"We are facing three types of competition now,\" Mr. Vivarel said. \"The classical contest between Western multinationals; strong local groups like the Salim group in Indonesia and President Foods of Taiwan; a new third type, unexpected, groups of local businessmen joining together to diversify into food businesses.\" **********While multinational groups such as Danone, Nestle\u0301 SA, Kraft Foods, H.J. Heinz Co. and Unilever are busy scouring the region for opportunities to buy out existing family-run businesses or form joint ventures with them, a handful of Asian entrepreneurs have begun looking abroad for products and brands to bring back into Asia. **********National Foods Ltd., one of Australia's largest milk, ice cream and yogurt producers, has become the target of interest by groups based in Hong Kong and Singapore.National is only one of several Australian food firms that are being eyed in recent months as possible takeover candidates. **********Both Camerlin Pte. Ltd., a joint venture between Malaysian, Indonesian and Singapore interests, and Mingly Corp., better known as a Hong Kong property developer, have taken stakes in National Foods, attracted by the company's potential to profit from Asia. **********Butfood groups are divided on the relative benefits of buying existing brands and manufacturing operations versus starting from the ground up with new facilities and products. **********For example, Hong Kong-based Dharmala Holdings Ltd., ultimatelycontrolled by Indonesia's Gondokusomo family, decided a few years ago to turn its experience in trading Chinese agricultural commodities into a chicken-raising operation. **********If managed properly, Dharmala believes, the move from handling grains to producing chickens and, later, operating fried chicken restaurants, should prove more lucrative than commodity trading, where profit margins have narrowed in recent years. **********Starting in 1994, Dharmala has established four joint ventures centered in China's northern Shandong Province that produced 50,000 metric tons of frozen chickenlast year. **********By 1997, Dharmala expects production to triple, increasing exports to Japan and enlarging distribution in China. **********\"We are looking for more opportunities to go downstream,\" said Bernard Pouliot, Dharmala's group managing director. \"We're looking at selling by-products, developing a brand name and expanding our distribution chain throughout China.\" **********Profit margins on chicken, however, have been squeezed by unexpected rises in the price of corn or maize feed because China allowed corn prices to be liberalized as part of the country's opening up and its effort to raise rural incomes. **********Despite the short-term difficulties, Dharmala and dozens of other companies are pouring resources into the Chinese market. **********President Enterprises of Taiwan, for example, has set itself the goal of becoming the world's largest food manufacturer, based on its plans to expand its range of products into China. **********In that country, a report by SBC Warburg says,\"more than in any other industries, the food processing industry

You'd never know it from the hand grenades they toss back and forth. **********In a new report, Mr. Grubman, a prominent telecommunications analyst at Salomon Brothers, said any analyst who would recommend the stocks of regional Bell telephone companies was \"starry eyed,\" \"bull headed\" and \"nuts.\" Mr. Grubman acknowledged that this was a reference to Mr. Reingold, his equally prominent counterpart at Merrill Lynch & Company. **********For his part, Mr. Reingold said Mr. Grubman was \"intuitive and gut-oriented.\" Explaining how he differs from that approach, he said, \"Before making conclusions, I try to do the work.\" **********Such verbal fisticuffs would not be remarkable in the rough-and-tumble world  of stock picking, except that Mr. Reingold and Mr. Grubman are the Hertz and Avis of telecommunications analysts. Mr. Reingold is ranked first, and Mr. Grubman second, in the annual ranking of telecommunications analysts by Institutional Investor magazine. Both also began their careers in the industry they now track -- Mr. Grubman at AT&T and Mr. Reingold at MCI. **********For all their similarities, the two men now have diametrically opposed views  of the industry. The gap between them underscores just how murky the outlook for telecommunications has become as it faces deregulation and no-holds-barred competition. It also smacks of an old-fashioned ego battle between two highly paid, closely followed industry seers. **********\"These are two of the most competitive people I have ever met,\" said Peter Crawford, the executive director of investor relations for the Bell Atlantic Corporation. \"They are both intensely driven by recognition and success.\" **********As fun as it is to watch, the rivalry raises a sober question: Whom should investors listen to as they place bets on a vital industry in the grip of dizzying change? AT&T, GTE and the seven Baby Bells are among the 15 most widely held issues on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Mr. Reingold contends that the Bells will be the big winners from the telecommunications bill, which Congress passed on Thursday, because the legislation would free the companies to compete in the $70 billion long-distance telephone market. Mr. Grubman says that even after President Clinton signs the bill into law, the Bells stand to gain precious little. **********Mr. Reingold is recommending that investors buy the shares of the seven Baby  Bells; Mr. Grubman is steering his clients away. **********\"You have two guys who have looked at the same issue, and one guy sees it flat while the other guy sees it round,\" said Robert M. Kavner, a former top executive at AT&T who now advises Tele-TV, an entertainment programming company  owned by three Baby Bells. **********One prominent fund manager, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said investors should not take either analyst's warnings too seriously. He noted that his fund had large stakes in both local and long-distance companies. **********\"The investment community likes to have black-and-white winners and losers,\"  the manager said. Yet, odds are, both analysts' favorite stocks will do fine, he said. \"If this was going to be a blood bath, we probably wouldn't own these stocks.\" **********What gives the Grubman-Reingold debate an extra dash of theater is that the two analysts play their respective roles to the hilt. **********Mr. Grubman, 43, is the swashbuckler, who boasts about his close ties to the  chief executives of the big telephone companies and whose research reports sometimes read more like polemics than dispassionate studies. Mr. Reingold, 42,  is the Wall Street wonk, who cultivates a network of contacts in Washington to gauge the direction of legislation, and who showers his clients with a stream of briefings and updates. **********\"I bet you that in college, Dan was prepared for every test, while I was cramming at the last minute,\" Mr. Grubman said. **********Mr. Grubman and Mr. Reingold did not always disagree so vociferously. Seven months ago, they were equally skeptical about the Bells. In fact, Mr. Reingold upbraided the companies in several reports for plowing hundreds of millions of dollars into interactive television ventures that he argued had an uncertain payoff, at best. **********\"I mean, those guys really hated me,\" he said. **********Then, in July, Mr. Reingold suddenly changed his tune and began promoting the Bells. He said he was swayed after reading the fine print in the telecommunications bill, which made it clear that the companies would be allowed into the long-distance market at roughly the same time AT&T and MCI would gain entry into the local market. **********Mr. Reingold contends that the Bells have two big advantages as they enter long distance. They have large networks that can easily be retrofitted to carry  long-distance calls in their home regions. And because the Bells handle such a huge volume of traffic, they can demand reduced rates from AT&T and MCI to carry calls for them outside their regions. **********Given these strengths, Mr. Reingold predicted that the Bells would grab 25 percent of the long-distance market within seven years. Because much of that revenue will come without significant capital investment, he said the earnings growth of the Bells as a group should accelerate -- to an average rate of 10 percent a year, compared with 7 percent in 1994. **********Wall Street has embraced Mr. Reingold's rosy outlook. With the exception of the Pacific Telesis Group, the shares of the Bells have outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 index since July. All told, the telecommunications business is growing more quickly than the economy as a whole. **********When Mr. Reingold first came out with his new opinion, he acknowledged that some of his clients reacted angrily. \"It's very embarrassing to say you made the wrong assumptions,\" he said, \"It's much easier to say, 'The market is reading this wrong,' and dig in your heels.\" **********Mr. Grubman makes exactly that argument. He said that for the Baby Bells to realize the kind of profits from long distance that Mr. Reingold predicts, they  would have to gang up to demand bulk discounts from AT&T and MCI for carrying their long-distance calls. **********Moreover, he said, the Baby Bells would have to use hardball tactics to keep  the long-distance carriers out of their local monopolies. **********\"If you believe Dan on the ability of the Bells to collude and conspire,\" Mr. Grubman said, \"the C.E.O.'s of these companies will all be sharing a cell at Leavenworth in five years.\" **********Both analysts agree that it will be difficult for AT&T and MCI to make huge inroads into the local franchises of the Bells, because they are left negotiating in each market with the one company that owns the lines running into homes. But Mr. Grubman, unlike Mr. Reingold, says the Bells will have similarly  little luck in cracking the long-distance market. **********In his new report, Mr. Grubman said that the battle for long-distance customers would be won by the companies with the strongest brand names and the most aggressive marketing. He contends that AT&T and MCI are still better on both counts than their Baby Bell rivals. **********Not surprisingly, Mr. Grubman now draws barbed remarks from executives at some of the Bell companies. \"Dan has done a better job of identifying, crisply and succinctly, the changes in our industry,\" said Mr. Crawford of Bell Atlantic. **********Several Bell executives said Mr. Grubman's pessimism about the local phone industry stemmed from his background. He was at AT&T for eight years and worked  in its Federal regulatory department. **********Mr. Grubman left AT&T in 1985 to join Paine Webber as an analyst. Salomon lured him in 1994 with a salary and bonus that some industry executives said he  had told them is worth $1 million a year. **********Despite his long-distance pedigree, Mr. Grubman noted that he stopped recommending AT&T's stock a year ago and chided the company for its ill-fated foray into the computer business. He said he had also clashed with MCI, though he is currently recommending the stock. **********\"There was a time when Bert Roberts didn't talk to me,\" he said, referring to the chairman and chief executive of MCI. **********Moreover, as Mr. Grubman pointed out, Mr. Reingold spent six years as a corporate planner at MCI before starting on Wall Street in 1989 as an analyst with Morgan Stanley. He switched to Merrill Lynch in 1993 to develop a global research effort for telecommunications. **********Industry executives said Mr. Reingold had put Merrill on the map in telecommunications research. But his strong views can cause headaches for his employer; executives at Merrill acknowledge that his recommendations have occasionally cost the firm lucrative investment banking business. That said, Merrill just won an assignment from AT&T to co-manage a giant stock offering for its new equipment-manufacturing company -- despite Mr. Reingold's qualms about AT&T's broader prospects. **********As for their rivalry, Mr. Reingold and Mr. Grubman say they are not obsessed  with each other. Mr. Grubman says he does not read Mr. Reingold's reports or those of any other analyst. Mr. Reingold says he studiously avoids referring to  Mr. Grubman in his work. He even declined to pose for a photograph with him for  this article. **********Mr. Grubman said he and Mr. Reingold often had friendly encounters in distant outposts like Jakarta, Indonesia, or Lima, Peru, where analysts and investment bankers from Merrill Lynch and Salomon turn up to compete for assignments from state-owned telephone companies that want to issue equity or debt. **********Back home, though, both analysts keep a sharp eye on the Institutional Investor rankings, which are based on extensive surveys of the research directors and chief investment officers at money management firms. **********In the latest survey, published in October, Mr. Reingold unseated Mr. Grubman as the top-rated telecommunications analyst for the first time. **********Not to be outdone, Mr. Grubman noted that the year before, he surpassed the pre-eminent analyst in the field at the time, Robert Morris 3d of Goldman, Sachs & Company, who had ranked first for nine consecutive years. In that survey, Mr.  Reingold ranked third. **********\"There are precious few analysts who can look eyeball-to-eyeball with the C.E.O. and take away an intangible feel for the company,\" Mr. Grubman said. **********For all their bravura, Mr. Grubman and Mr. Reingold both recognize that fame  on Wall Street can be fleeting. As Oren Shaffer, the chief financial officer of  Ameritech, noted, stock picking is an unforgiving profession. \"The selection of  winners and losers is going to become more complex as the volatility of this industry increases,\" he said. **********And unless each analyst keeps picking winners, their great debate over the future of telephones will exist simply between themselves, with no one else listening in."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/03/business/forte-moves-to-thwart-granada-bid.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-01-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 502, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Forte Moves To Thwart Granada Bid", "print_headline": "Forte Moves To Thwart Granada Bid", "body_text": " **********Forte P.L.C., the British hotel company, began a further, aggressive effort today to thwart a hostile takeover bid by the Granada Group. **********Forte, which is resisting a bid valued at L3.3 billion, or $5.1 billion, said it would raise its dividend for the first time in five years, buy back shares worth L800 million and spin off its stake in the Savoy hotels of London. **********While Granada dismissed the Forte defense as \"nothing more than a quick fix,\" investors on the London Stock Exchange reacted favorably. Shares closed 12.5 pence higher at 343 pence, remaining above Granada's offer price. Granada's shares fell 3 pence to close at 642 pence. **********\"We think it's quite a radical departure,\" said Paul Slattery, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson Securities. \"It's more like a prospectus for a new company than a defense document.\" **********Analysts said they expected that Granada would have to increase its bid before Jan. 9, the last day it can change its offer, to win the support of Forte's shareholders. On Nov. 22, Granada offered four shares and L23.25 in cash for each Forte share. A bitter battle has followed. **********\"The question now is what Granada is going to pull out of the bag,\" said Jason Crisp, an analyst with SGST Securities. **********In its final defense document before Granada's offer closes on Jan. 23, Forte pledged to shareholders that it would raise its dividend by at least 20 percent each year for the next three years, provided they rejected Granada's offer. **********Forte, Britain's largest hotel company, also said it would spend L800 million to buy back about 20 percent of its shares outstanding. And Forte plans to spin  off its 68 percent stake in the Savoy luxury hotel group, owner of the namesake  Savoy, Berkeley and Claridges to shareholders in proportion to their holdings in Forte. **********Granada, which operates television franchises and owns Britain's third-largest caterer, dismissed the Forte defense proposals. **********Granada's chief executive, Gerry Robinson, said they were \"nothing more than  a quick fix which fails to address the key issues.\" Meeting Forte's dividend targets could require the company to double its profits in three years, he said. **********\"This is a tall order for a management which has conspicuously failed to deliver profits, earnings and dividends in the past,\" Mr. Robinson said in a statement. **********Forte also announced today a strategy to expand its international chain of Meridien hotels, which were bought from Air France in 1994. **********Forte said it would add 50 new Meridien hotels in the next three years and increase its Posthouse three-star chain to 14,500 rooms. **********In addition, the company said it was negotiating to obtain about 20 management contracts for its Meridien brand and planned to dispose of some of its luxury hotels as \"the market continues to strengthen.\" **********Under British takeover rules, Forte is barred from releasing new information  or defense documents from today until the close of the bid. **********Last week, Forte agreed to sell its restaurant division and British budget hotels to Whitbread P.L.C. for L1.05 billion cash, assuming Granada's bid failed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/17/business/those-403-b-blues-fade-at-nonprofits.html": {"writer_name": "Marcia Vickers", "pub_date": "1996-11-17", "snippet": "New law signed by Pres Clinton last August will expand retirement savings possibilities for some nine million employees of nonprofit organizations, which have until now been limited to 403(b) tax-deferred plans; such employers will now be able to ...", "word_count": 902, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Those 403(b) Blues Fade at Nonprofits", "print_headline": "Those 403(b) Blues Fade at Nonprofits", "body_text": " **********JANE D. SCHWARTZ was excited when she learned that the Federal Government had authorized a new kind of plan for her retirement investing. ''I think our investment choices are too conservative now,'' she said. ''I haven't been able to take full advantage of the bull market.'' **********Ms. Schwartz is the executive director of the Paul Rapoport Foundation, an organization in New York City involved in gay and lesbian issues. And the law that has raised her hopes will allow most nonprofit employers, like the foundation, to set up 401(k) accounts, the popular tax-deferred vehicle of the for-profit sector. Until now, most nonprofits have been restricted to the tax-deferred plans known as 403(b)'s. **********The statute, which was signed by President Clinton in August, will expand the retirement possibilities for some nine million nonprofit workers, who have already invested $300 billion in 403(b) plans. The new provisions, to take effect on Jan. 1, are contained in the minimum-wage law. **********The new law does not guarantee that Ms. Schwartz and others will benefit -- nonprofit employers may balk at the cost of setting up a new plan. But 401(k)'s have many attractions that may lead nonprofit employees to push for them. **********For example, there are more investment options available in 401(k) plans than in 403(b)'s. While the law limits 403(b) investments to mutual funds and annuities, 401(k) plans can have those options as well as  guaranteed investment contracts, individual equities -- often the company' stock -- and other instruments. **********''In a 401(k) you can literally have any investments other than tangible collectibles,'' said Peter Gold, a principal at Buck Consultants in New York. **********Practically speaking, the investment choices in specific 403(b) plans are often  few and conservative. ''People who choose to work in the nonprofit sector generally are not as motivated by money and on average are older'' than other workers, Mr. Gold said. ''For these reasons, they tend to be more conservative investors.'' **********Moreover, all 401(k)'s fall under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known as Erisa, which requires the employer to be prudent and vigilant in selecting, maintaining and reviewing plan investments. But 403(b) plans are covered by Erisa only if the  administrator chooses to be; only about half do so, though the number is growing. That means the rest are subject just to state-law  protections. Perhaps more important, employers' matching contributions -- a common feature of 401(k)'s -- are not permitted in non-Erisa 403(b)'s. **********Moreover, at least until 1999, when the new law will end the practice, retired workers who take a lump-sum distribution from their 401(k)'s can spread their tax payments over five years. Not so with 403(b)'s; investors must pay all the taxes at once. **********But just because 401(k)'s have attractions for workers does not mean they look good to employers. One potential drawback  concerns ''discrimination testing,'' an annual process by which employers with 401(k) plans make sure that the contributions of highly paid employees are not unacceptably high compared with those of other workers. Employers may chafe at the testing, an annual chore that experts say can be costly and time-consuming, while highly paid workers may balk at the discrimination rules themselves, which can limit their retirement contributions. (Beginning in 1999, certain 401(k) plans will be exempt from discrimination testing.) **********Many nonprofit groups are also put off by the idea of setting up a new plan. ''It's a no-brainer,'' said Nancy Palazzolo, director of retirement services at the Daughters of Charity National Health System, a hospital group in St. Louis. ''The start-up costs of a 401(k) would be too high for us, and, I would assume, for most nonprofits.'' **********Also, there is no provision in the new law that allows 403(b) money to be rolled over to a 401(k). Thus, the many nonprofit organizations that already have 403(b)'s -- like Ms. Palazzolo's -- must maintain two retirement plans if they elect to start a 401(k). **********Cherith Harrison, vice president of Diversified Investment Advisors, a consulting firm in Purchase, N.Y., said, ''Many employers we're dealing with say they're not going to do the two plans because it's a communications nightmare.'' **********Despite the strong feelings among both workers and employers, the 401(k) decision is not always clear-cut. While 401(k)'s have many advantages, 403(b)'s also have features that may appeal to some workers. Both 401(k)'s and 403(b)'s allow investors to contribute up to $9,500 a year, for instance. But only 403(b)'s let some participants play catch-up by contributing up to $12,500 a year for five years. **********To muddy matters a bit more, 403(b)'s are evolving. The minimum-wage law, for instance, authorizes 403(b) plans to let their participants change their contribution amounts as often as they wish each year.  The law has always given 401(k)'s this flexibility, but it imposed a once-a-year limit on 403(b)'s. (Individual plans may put their own restrictions on such changes, of course; a common one is once a quarter.) **********And according to a recent survey of 147 nonprofit organizations by Buck Consultants, employees are pushing hard to get  more investment options in their 403(b)'s.  About 46 percent of the employers surveyed, in fact, said they planned to increase the number of mutual funds they offer. **********''It doesn't cost employers anything to expand offerings in 403(b)'s and the administrative work is minimal,'' Mr. Gold said. **********That may give Ms. Schwartz a nice fallback position. If she cannot get her board to start a 401(k), she said, ''I'm going to fight for more funds in my 403(b).''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/06/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-ex-ayer-executive-opens-new-shop.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 139, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Ex-Ayer Executive Opens New Shop", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Ex-Ayer Executive Opens New Shop", "body_text": " **********Janet Kraus, a former managing partner and executive creative director at N.

Though no one was injured by the  blast, which occurred at 1:45 A.M., local police officers and diplomats expressed concern that more unstable explosives could be set off by mistake, potentially with more deadly results. **********Diplomats and Red Cross workers have said they believed that the rebels laid the booby traps in the gardens surrounding the residence to help avert a counterattack by government forces. These officials say some released hostages have also  reported that the guerrillas are keeping reserves of booby traps and other explosives as well. **********Despite the early specter of danger, and few signs of concrete advances toward breaking the standoff, there were some tantalizing signs of movement. Bishop Juan Luis Cipriani of Ayacucho, who visited the  hostages on Christmas Day for six hours, ostensibly to celebrate Mass, suggested that a peaceful solution was possible. **********''Little by little we need to understand each other,'' Bishop Cipriani, a conservative ally of President Alberto K. Fujimori, told reporters staking out the compound this afternoon. ''With a little help from Mary, hopefully we'll see more gestures, not little gestures but bigger gestures.'' **********Bishop Cipriani said he was not a mediator. But a Western diplomat monitoring the hostage-taking noted, ''That was a long Mass all right.'' **********The diplomat added: ''The Bishop is well respected and he does have the confidence of Fujimori. When the President visits Ayacucho, he always calls on the Bishop.'' **********President Fujimori has not budged from his demand that the 20 guerrillas occupying the residence release every remaining hostage and drop their arms before safe passage might be considered. The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement has clung to its original demand that 300 or more of its members be freed from Peruvian prisons, and the rebels have sporadically released more than 400 people since they  stormed the residence. **********But while today's release was insignificant in number, the rebels appeared to make a symbolically rich gesture by liberating Jose Maria Argueta, the Ambassador of Guatemala. Mr. Argueta said that his release ''was an acknowledgement of the historical accomplishments of Guatemala reaching a peace agreement to be signed on Dec. 29'' that will end a 40-year-old guerrilla war. **********Several freed hostages have said that the guerrillas, in conversations with them, spoke of longing to integrate into Peru's political system, the way the Guatemalan guerrillas and so many other rebel groups have done around Latin America in recent years. The freeing of Ambassador Argueta without any other hostages seemed to highlight that desire. **********Gustavo Gorriti, a leading Peruvian journalist, said he believed the  objective of the rebels was to negotiate a new role in Peruvian society after years of military defeats and the capture of most of their leaders and members. But he said that before they could negotiate a settlement with the Government, ''they must show force or otherwise no one will be willing to concede them anything.'' **********Ambassador Argueta looked fit as he left the compound, wearing a gray suit and walking slowly but erectly.  He leaves behind the Ambassadors of Japan, Malaysia, Bolivia, Honduras and the Dominican Republic, along with five Peruvian generals, two Cabinet ministers, several supreme court judges and congressmen, and scores of Japanese and Peruvian businessmen. **********Through diplomatic channels to the Governments in Peru and Japan, the United States continues to offer  help and repeat its view that there should be no concession made in negotiations with terrorists, officials said today. So far, Peru has not accepted the American offer of assistance. But with the release of seven American hostages, and with no other Americans believed to be held in the residence, the United States has slipped further into the background. **********The special task force created at the State Department when the crisis began has been disbanded, although officials in Washington and at the embassy in Lima continue to watch developments closely, officials said today. **********''We're no longer directly involved in this,'' one official said. **********The official also said that United States authorities had debriefed the released Americans, but that they had not ''shed any great light on the motives or the intentions of the terrorists.'' **********While the United States remained in the background, Malaysia's Foreign Minister, Abdullah Badawi, arrived in Lima today and kept to a private schedule, leading to speculation that he might be trying to negotiate a separate settlement to obtain  the release of Malaysia's Ambassador to Peru, Ahmad Mokhtar. **********Rumors are swirling in the Peruvian press and among diplomats that several countries may be trying to make deals as Uruguay apparently did to free its Ambassador earlier this week. **********Japan joined Peru today in sharply criticizing Uruguay for undercutting President Fujimori by releasing two Tupac Amaru guerrillas held in Uruguayan jails for violations of immigration laws. Bolivian Government officials said today that they would not trade the handful of Tupac Amaru prisoners they hold in exchange for their captive ambassador. **********A few hours before the guerrillas freed Tabare Bocalandro Yapeyu, the Uruguayan Ambassador, on Tuesday, an Uruguayan appeals court released Sonia Silvia Gora Rivera and Luis Alberto Miguel Samaniego, who was arrested last December while entering Uruguay carrying false passports. **********According to the Peruvian security forces, Ms. Gora had been responsible for renting safe houses where the Tupac Amaru rebels kept several  captives. Mr. Samaniego, according to security sources, was a senior member of the group's ruling executive committee. **********The two have been accused of masterminding the kidnapping of Samuel Doria Medina, Bolivia's former Economy Minister, last year before releasing him for $200,000 ransom.

Adults, of course, know better. But just how much better? Do we, too, confuse the media world with the real one? **********We do. At least that's the conclusion reached by Byron Reeves and Clifford Nass, two Stanford professors who studied people's reactions to computers and television at the university's Center for the Study of Language and Information. The results, some of them pretty astonishing, are engagingly reported in their just-published book, ''The Media Equation: How People Treat Computers, Televisions, and New Media as Real People and Places'' (Cambridge University Press, $27.95). **********The book's thesis is that on some level we can't help equating media with real life. ''People are not evolved to 20th-century technology,'' the authors say, to explain why the subjects in their studies tried to protect a computer's feelings or were aglow with self-esteem after an electronic gush of flattery. **********To us confused homo sapiens, it turns out, media that communicate with words or pictures seem to be doing something social. In our brains, that adds up to human behavior, and we respond in kind. (Of course, it can occasionally work the other way, as well. A friend of mine used to be married to someone who, when he was tired of arguing, would grab the remote and try to click her off.) **********Even relatively hip technological types are at the mercy of their human instincts. Most of the 35 or so studies that form the basis of ''The Media Equation'' used subjects who were experienced computer users. But despite their stated views that computers were just machines, they responded in ways usually reserved for human interaction. **********In testing their hypotheses, the authors looked for earlier psychological studies that show some rule about human-to-human interaction and then repeated them -- substituting media for one of the humans. **********So what did they find? To start with, people are polite to computers when forced to rate them, uh, face-to-face. That mirrors the psychological rule in human relations: People give a more positive -- and less honest -- evaluation to someone who asks about himself than they do when someone else asks about that individual's performance. **********In the professors' experiment, subjects worked on a computer tutoring exercise, after which the same computer asked half of the 44 subjects how it performed, offering them a choice of adjectives. The other 22 subjects went on to a second computer, which asked them to rate the performance of the first. **********Bingo. The face-to-face evaluators were polite, rating their computer tutors as ''accurate,'' ''fair'' and ''friendly'' much more often than did the students who confided their ratings to another computer. **********And this was all done with text -- no voice, no graphics. ''People don't need much of a cue to respond socially,'' the authors conclude. **********The dynamics of human flattery also worked in the computer realm. When flattered, people usually rate their own performances more favorably. And they tend to bestow praise upon the flatterer -- whether or not they believe the praise is warranted. (Embarrassing, isn't it?) Well, it happened just like that when a computer flashed flattery about a user's performance. Subsequent tests showed that the users lapped it up, felt better and loved the little praise machines. **********The authors, who have consulted for Microsoft, say computer designers should learn a lesson from this. Imagine, they say, a spelling program that points out an especially fine spelling job, along with the errors. Or an electronic Web browser that praises its users for finding unusual sites. Of course, that lesson might never be learned. As one computer designer told the authors: ''I got into engineering because I didn't know any social rules.'' **********Another human frailty -- stereotyping -- was applied to the computers, too. Participants in this experiment worked with identical software, but with different computer audio voices -- some male, some female. The results? Evaluations from male-voiced computers were taken more seriously. And -- get this -- the ''female'' computers were rated as more ''knowledgeable'' about the software content related to love and relationships. All this, even though the subjects were told beforehand that the same programmer -- a man -- had created the software. **********''The Media Equation'' also reports that given the slightest encouragement, people perceive a personality in computers. By designing software with verbal styles that are psychologically linked to various behaviors, the authors created dominant, submissive, friendly and unfriendly computers. Over all, their subjects described the various machines in just this way. They liked best the dominant-plus-friendly ones. That's how it is in life, too, the authors say, adding, in an especially delicious phrase, that this helps explain the popularity of media figures ''from the anchors on the evening news to Mickey Mouse.'' **********The experiment also showed that people who were ''dominant,'' according to psychological tests, preferred dominant computers, and that submissive folks preferred more passive machines. This apparently holds in relationships between humans, too, despite the folk wisdom about opposites attracting. **********Naturally, software designers can't tailor a machine's personality to each user, the authors say, but programmers might eventually create computers that ''offer multiple personalities.'' Who knows, maybe Hollywood could get Joanne Woodward to do ''The Three Interfaces of Eve.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/16/business/time-warner-murdoch-feud-entangles-mci-satellite-plan.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Landler", "pub_date": "1996-11-16", "snippet": "Time Warner Inc is taking its cable-television feud with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp to the skies; Time Warner pres Richard D Parsons, in letter to FCC, urges commission to withhold approval of MCI Communications' application for satellite license ...", "word_count": 604, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Time Warner-Murdoch Feud Entangles MCI Satellite Plan", "print_headline": "Time Warner-Murdoch Feud Entangles MCI Satellite Plan", "body_text": " **********Time Warner Inc. is taking its cable-television feud with Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation to the skies. **********In a letter yesterday to the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Time Warner urged the commission to withhold approval of MCI Communications' application for a satellite license because MCI was being acquired by a foreign company, British Telecommunications. **********The letter, which was signed by Time Warner's president, Richard D. Parsons, said the F.C.C. would open the door to a ''foreign ownership violation'' if it granted the license to MCI. **********The real target of Time Warner's request -- according to several executives familiar with the situation -- was not MCI, but its partner, the News Corporation. It and MCI are equal owners of a direct-broadcast television service that plans to use MCI's high-powered satellite. If the F.C.C. withheld its approval of the license, it would deal a blow to Mr. Murdoch's ambitions to get into satellite television in the United States. **********Time Warner has been enmeshed in a rancorous battle with the News Corporation over Time Warner's refusal to carry the Fox News Channel on its cable systems in New York City. The dispute escalated when the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani tried unsuccessfully to carry the Fox channel on one of the five public-affairs and educational channels it controls. **********The chairman of the F.C.C., Reed E. Hundt, said yesterday that he had not yet read Time Warner's letter and could not comment on it. **********But a former F.C.C. official, who declined to be identified, said the commission was ''most unlikely'' to withhold MCI's license because of its pending merger with British Telecom. MCI has already asked the F.C.C. to allow British Telecom to buy 100 percent of MCI. **********This person said the F.C.C. would probably grant MCI its satellite license and take up the foreign ownership issue as part of its overall consideration of the merger. Indeed, it may issue the license as soon as Monday or Tuesday, according to people familiar with the F.C.C. **********Time Warner's complaint comes as the the News Corporation-MCI alliance may be unraveling on its own. MCI has said it wants to dilute its ownership in the satellite service to less than 20 percent. The News Corporation, however, must retain some relationship with MCI to have access to a high-powered satellite in the United States. **********In his letter, Mr. Parson said the company was objecting to the license because it would mean that the nation's last available slot for a high-powered direct-broadcast satellite would be in the hands of one foreign-controlled company, MCI, and another company, the News Corporation, based in Sydney, Australia. **********The News Corporation and MCI plan to start their direct-broadcast satellite service, which is called A Sky B, at the end of 1997. **********MCI and the News Corporation both attributed Time Warner's request to its continuing battle over the Fox channel. ''First, Time Warner tried to censor the Fox News Channel from competing with CNN, and now they are trying to censor A Sky  B's satellite competition to their cable systems,'' Preston Padden, chairman of A Sky B, said in a statement. **********Tod Hullin, a spokesman for Time Warner, denied that the company was motivated by its clash with the News Corporation. ''We are interested in all forms of distribution for our programming,'' he said. ''And we in the satellite business, through our Prime Star subsidiary.'' **********Despite Time Warner's latest volley, Mr. Parsons said on Thursday that Time Warner and the News Corporation could still work out their differences.

If the other person does not have a keyboard device, the call can be placed through a relay operator who will type the replies and transmit them to the deaf person's screen. **********But that system did not work well for Alan Aronow, who suffered a major hearing loss at the age of 42. Unlike many people who are deaf from birth, Mr. Aronow was able and willing to do his own talking. The vast majority of his business clients, friends and family did not have special equipment, since they  had no hearing problems. **********\"The major obstacle is the poorly designed text-telephone interface,\" Mr. Aronow said in a telephone interview conducted through a relay operator. \"It's really a modernized version of an old-fashioned teletype machine designed to allow two people to type messages back and forth.\" **********So Mr. Aronow set out to design an alternative and came up with a device he calls Look-Hear. **********The unit is about the size of a small clock-radio, with a front taken up almost entirely by a screen that can show several lines of text. It plugs into a standard phone jack and functions as a telephone with a microphone and speaker.  It also has a large, illuminated button on top that automatically dials the relay operator's 800-number. **********After plugging in the Look-Hear, a user would hit the automatic dial button to reach the relay operator and then, speaking into the microphone, ask the operator to dial a specific number. When someone answers that line, his words would be typed by the relay operator and appear on the Look-Hear screen. At the  end of a conversation, the device resets itself to record text messages or make  another outgoing call. **********Mr. Aronow is talking to phone companies, relay services and communications manufacturers about producing his invention.

Some 700 candidates from a bewildering array of blocs and parties have each anted up the  $1,000 registration fee to compete for the ballots of 1,013,235 newly registered voters, most of whom have never voted before. **********For both Palestinians and Israelis, the election of a Council marks a major step on the journey of West Bank Palestinians from an occupied people to full self-rule, in which the Palestinians will have a legitimate government of their  own, with a legislature, executive council and president. **********The elections are part of the agreements between the Israelis and Palestinians signed in the last two years under which the elected Palestinian legislative council and president will form an executive authority, and together they will govern the Palestinians until the end of the century, when a final peace settlement is to be concluded. **********By any measure, the elections do not make a democracy. The domination of the  race by Mr. Arafat and his Fatah movement, uncertainty about the powers of the legislature, continuing disputes with Israel, and Mr. Arafat's failure to bring  the Islamic opposition, Hamas, into the race, have cast shadows over the voting. **********International monitors have complained about the haste and improvisation of the election. The election commission was appointed only two weeks ago, and only last week the number of seats in the Council was increased by presidential decree from 83 to 88. **********During the Palestinian-Israeli talks, neither side could agree on whether the Palestinian chief executive would be known as the President, Mr. Arafat's choice, or Chairman, the Israeli choice. So they settled on \"Ra'ees,\" an Arabic  word that can be translated either way. **********Only one candidate has challenged Mr. Arafat for that office -- Samiha Khalil, a 72-year-old woman known for her ardent left-wing social and political  views, and who pledges to annul the Israeli-Palestinian agreements if elected. **********There is no question that Mr. Arafat will defeat her soundly. He has drawn tens of thousands of Palestinians to victory rallies over the past two months as Israeli soldiers have pulled out of one West Bank city after another, and he is  still a national icon to most Palestinians. **********By contrast, Mrs. Khalil attracted about 200 curious Palestinians, plus several dozen reporters and observers, to a meeting this afternoon at the Al-Qasr Hotel in Nablus, where she declared, \"What drove me to stand for a candidate to the presidency is my wish to lift the burden of oppression from the shoulders of the Palestinian people.\" **********The real action has been in the Council race. In the crush since he announced the election date, Mr. Arafat has failed to issue a law regulating political parties, so candidates have banded together in dozens of parties and blocs. Even the Samaritans, a sect whose approximately 400 adherents live near Nablus, have  fielded three candidates for their one guaranteed seat. **********In the scramble to win votes, many candidates have been using the tricks of more mature democracies. One rich candidate even took over a Nablus coffee shop  for the duration of the campaign, offering free coffee to all comers. **********At the headquarters of the \"Freedom and Independence Bloc,\" a pair of bare rooms in a downtown office building, the bloc's leader, Khair al-Din Barham, sat under a large sheet with a hand-painted seal of his association, \"The Palestinian Association of Revolutionary Ex-Warriors,\" featuring crossed assault rifles. **********As befits a Palestinian of stature, his office was filled with supporters smoking and sipping sugary coffee. As they looked on, Mr. Barham answered questions of a group of observers from the European Union. **********How did his bloc differ from any other, asked one monitor. \"We want to help the people,\" Mr. Barham explained to the approving nods from his supporters. \"If elected we will fight for social issues and economic help.\" **********The observer jotted down the answer, but it was not immediately apparent how  the program Mr. Barham outlined differed from any described on the posters and ads plastering the West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********Out in the street, a poster promoting Fawzi al-Araj, an architect and engineer, featured his photo under the slogan, \"There's no difference between independence and economic development.\" **********Next to it was a picture of Tahseen al-Fares with the message, \"No development without cooperation, no cooperation without development.\" Kamel Afghani, opting for poetic impact, pledged that those who struggled for Palestinian liberation would \"leave their horses only on the fields of Jerusalem.\" **********The only portrait of a woman was that of Mihaya al-Saqa, one of only 20 women who have registered as candidates although women account for 49 percent of registered voters. She pledged to \"create real unity,\" to resolve the issue of refugees, to free all political prisoners, to support farmers and workers and to defend women. **********In the absence of traditional parties apart from Fatah, and with few differences on issues, the campaign has focused on individuals. The qualification most frequently cited is resistance to Israeli occupation, with candidates proudly listing how many times they were imprisoned, beaten or -- most prestigious -- deported. **********Most candidates are from Fatah, the oldest Palestinian movement extant, though democracy has sharply divided its ranks. Initially, Mr. Arafat held primaries within Fatah to select a single slate, but when the results came in he put them aside and announced his own list of candidates, setting aside many veteran guerrillas in favor of men with entrepreneurial or legal skills, as well as a broader representation from villages and refugee camps. **********In Nablus, Mr. Arafat tapped Mayor Ghassan Shaka, scion of a powerful local clan and head of the West Bank lawyers' association, to head his slate. Sitting  in his storefront office among coffee-sipping supporters, Mr. Shaka, 53, said he had resigned the mayoralty to run for the Council because \"this is the most important moment of Palestinian history -- the building of a state.\" **********The most yawning gap in the campaign is the absence of Hamas, the Islamic opposition group that has the strongest backing among Palestinians. Mr. Arafat opened talks on Dec. 20 with Hamas in hopes of persuading them to join the election. **********Evidently expecting Hamas to do so, Mr. Arafat issued a presidential decree adding five seats to the Council and extended the registration deadline. But Hamas refused to participate and ordered three moderate members in Gaza who had registered as independent candidates to drop out. Mr. Arafat's only gain was that Hamas tacitly agreed not to call for a general boycott of the vote and not  to mount terrorist attacks during the campaign. **********Mr. Arafat's attempt to attract Hamas through last-minute changes in the size of the Council and the rules of the campaign drew a sharp rebuke from European Union election observers. **********In a statement titled \"Enough is Enough,\" the head of the team, Carl Lidbom,  complained that extending the deadline for registering shortened the campaign to 14 days, and that Mr. Arafat did not have the authority to change the rules. **********\"Over all, the events of the past few days have created confusion and uncertainty, and give the impression of the arbitrary use of power to redesign the electoral architecture,\" Mr. Lidbom declared in a press release, though he did not note that the intention was actually to make place for the opposition. **********Mr. Arafat has made sure that the Palestinian Christian minority will be in the Council, making them the only minority aside from the Samaritans to have guaranteed seats. Though the Christians comprise only 3 percent of the population, Mr. Arafat granted them six seats, recognizing their disproportionate wealth and influence among Palestinians, especially in Jerusalem. **********The race for Jerusalem's two Christian seats drew a number of prominent Palestinians, including Hanan Ashwari, a former peace negotiator; Hanna Siniora, a publisher and head of the Palestinian-European Chamber of Commerce, and Jonathan Kuttab, a lawyer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/18/business/accounts.html": {"writer_name": "David Barboza", "pub_date": "1996-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 31, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Tia's Tex-Mex Restaurants, Dallas, a unit of Ruby Tuesday Inc., to Berry-Brown Advertising, Dallas, to handle advertising and marketing, which had been handled in-house.

Bill Would Extend Pensions in Small Business", "print_headline": "G.O.P. Bill Would Extend Pensions in Small Business", "body_text": " **********House Republicans plan to pass legislation on Wednesday that would make it easier for small businesses to offer retirement savings plans for their 36 million workers. And in a break from decades of pension policy, the bill would let owners reap tax benefits for themselves even if their workers do not participate. **********The retirement provisions are part of a $7.5 billion bill filled with changes sought by owners of small businesses to simplify tax, pension and other rules that bedevil companies with fewer than 100 workers. **********For example, over seven years the bill would increase to $25,000 from $17,500 the value of equipment purchases that can be deducted immediately, instead of being depreciated over several years. The bill would also phase out tax breaks for companies that build factories in Puerto Rico and reinvest the profits on the island, using the increased revenues to offset the small business tax breaks. **********These provisions will provide political cover for Republicans who oppose another aspect of the bill, increasing the minimum wage by 90 cents an hour over two years, to $5.15. Polls have shown that raising the minimum wage is widely popular despite concerns expressed by small-business owners and many economists  that it would cost jobs. **********Republicans, citing a rising public concern about retirement income and the safety of nest eggs, sought to focus attention today on changes to pension law. **********Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the proposals would help workers in small business by \"making it easier to get a secure pension and by providing increased security for existing retirement accounts.\" And he said all 120 million working  Americans stood to benefit from one or more of the two dozen pension changes in  the bill. **********Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich called the bill \"a watered down version of what President Clinton has already proposed.\" And he noted that it did not require accountants or other professionals who find indications that retirement  savings are being embezzled to report their suspicions to the Government. **********But the centerpiece of the bill is what the Republicans call a Simple pension plan for small businesses, which is short for \"savings incentive match plan for  employees.\" **********Companies with fewer than 100 workers at any time during a year could create  a sort of mini-401(k) plan in which workers could save up to $6,000, compared with $9,500 under existing 401(k) plans. **********Existing 401(k)'s require expensive and complex tests comparing the contributions of highly paid and low-wage workers to insure that tax benefits do not flow only to the highly paid. In Simple plans, these tests would not be necessary if the employer either deposited 2 percent of each employee's pay into the employee's account or matched dollar-for-dollar the first 3 percent that employees saved. Employers who choose the matching option could reduce the match in two of every five years if they fell on hard times. **********Under the bill, the owner of a small business could save $6,000 on tax-deferred basis and match the savings with another $6,000, even if none of his or her employees participated in the Simple plan. **********A critic of existing pension laws, Karen Ferguson, co-author of \"The Pension  Book,\" called the bill \"a radical departure from decades of pension policy requiring that lower-paid workers get benefits as a condition of owners and managers' getting tax breaks.\" **********\"This is shortsighted, crazy and foodhardy,\" she said. **********Republican staff members said they were confident that millions of workers, even those earning modest wages, would leap at the chance to save money on a tax-advantaged basis for retirement, especially when their money would be matched by their employers. **********Mr. Reich noted that the President's proposal would require small- business owners to contribute at least 1 percent of their workers' wages to a retirement  savings plan before their own contributions could be tax-deferred. **********Another provision of the bill would allow the one in six workers who are employed by nonprofit organizations to have 401(k) accounts. Currently, workers  at nonprofit organizations are limited to less generous 403(b) plans. **********The bill would also protect the assets of state and local government pension  plans from creditors, putting them on the same footing as business and nonprofit pension plans. This provision was added in response to the bankruptcy filing by  Orange County, Calif., which focused attention on the disparate treatment of government and business plans. **********The bill would also protect truck drivers, carpenters and others who participate in pension plans paid for by groups of employers by making retirement benefits mandatory after five years, the same as the law requires of  plans provided by a single employer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/09/world/after-nato-overtures-france-is-ready-to-resume-military-role.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1996-06-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 543, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "After NATO Overtures, France Is Ready to Resume Military Role", "print_headline": "After NATO Overtures, France Is Ready to Resume Military Role", "body_text": " **********President Jacques Chirac said today that France would rejoin all the military structures of NATO from which it pulled out in 1966 if the alliance's decision this week to give European countries a stronger leadership role was fully carried out. **********French officials said it would take about a year for NATO nations to draw up  detailed contingency plans for the new command procedures on which its foreign ministers agreed last Monday in Berlin, and that Mr. Chirac could then make the  decision to end France's 30-year estrangement. **********The NATO foreign ministers approved plans to give a European defense organization, the Western European Union, the ability to use NATO command structures, heavy transport aircraft and other assets in European-led military operations in regional crises even when the United States did not become involved. **********\"The decision, to the extent that it becomes reality, opens the way to full and complete French participation in the structures of an alliance whose principles and operating procedures will have been profoundly transformed,\" Mr.  Chirac said in a major defense policy speech today. **********American officials have welcomed the French moves, even while insisting that  they find it hard to imagine any NATO military operation that the United States  would not want to join. **********Abandoning the go-it-alone policy adopted by Charles de Gaulle 30 years ago,  Mr. Chirac has committed France to developing a European defense strategy within the American-led alliance rather than outside it. **********France announced last December that it would take part in meetings of NATO defense ministers and military chiefs of staff, in which it had not participated since 1966, on condition that the alliance transform itself to reflect changes since the cold war ended, including a diminished American military presence in Europe. **********Mr. Chirac has also started changes to make the French armed forces all-volunteer and reduce their numbers from 500,000 to 350,000 over the next decade, with the ability to send large units quickly to trouble spots like Bosnia. **********NATO sent a 60,000-member peacekeeping force into Bosnia late last year only  after the United States agreed to lead the operation. **********\"Success in Berlin was not guaranteed in advance on a subject where the temptation to resist was strong on both sides of the Atlantic,\" Mr. Chirac told  an audience of high military officers and strategists at the Institute of Advanced National Defense Studies here. **********French defense officials said one obstacle was the reluctance of the alliance's American commander, Gen.

That way you can maximize your giving. **********The Internal Revenue Service says charitable giving is the second most frequently claimed deduction, showing up on a quarter of all individual tax returns. The average amount claimed is about $2,400. **********To be deductible, a donation must be made to a ''qualified'' organization. Most churches, schools, and familiar charities, like the Red Cross, qualify, though not all nonprofits do. Club dues do not, nor do gifts to specific individuals. Gifts to governments qualify, such as land for a town park. **********First and foremost in any donor's mind is usually the hope of doing some good. So if you have settled on a cause that you care about, it may pay to spend a little time looking at the group's finances. Good signs are when a charity spends a big portion of its budget on program services, or good works, and a small portion on fund-raising and administration. This way, the chances are greater that your money will wind up in the right hands, whether a hungry child or a cancer researcher. **********If you are planning to make a really big donation, you may find that a foundation or a trust allows you more control and to direct gifts for years. You may even get something in return. **********Of course, the timing of a donation can be important from a tax standpoint. If your tax bracket is higher this year than you expect it to be next year, that's a good reason to give before the year is out. And if you are giving late in December, how you pay can be important. A check made out to a charity is considered to be given on the day you mail it. A contribution charged on a credit card is deductible in the year you make the charge, regardless of when you pay the bill. A pledge is a gift once it is honored. **********To get a tax benefit, you must itemize on your Federal return. A single person with more than $4,000 in deductions and a married couple with more than $6,700 will find that itemizing makes sense. The general rule is to deduct the full value of cash gifts, the current value of appreciated securities and the market value of other donated property, like real estate or used clothes. **********Record-keeping is a little tricky. A canceled check, an account statement or a simple receipt is generally fine for gifts of cash or property worth less than $250. For bigger gifts, you need a more detailed written receipt, including how much you gave, what, if anything, you received in return and what it is worth. **********Charities also have to provide a written statement if you give more than $75 and get something significant in return, like a dinner. You can take a deduction only for the difference in the two amounts. **********If a gift of property is worth more than $5,000, you generally need a professional appraisal for tax purposes. **********And if you give of your time, some out-of-pocket expenses, like travel to and from events, are also deductible. Confused by it all? The rules are spelled out in I.R.S. Publication 526, Charitable Contributions. **********Finally, take note of two I.R.S. limits. **********The amount of your deduction may be limited if your gifts exceed 20 percent of income. Whether the limit is 20 percent, 30 percent or 50 percent of your adjusted gross income depends on whether a gift is cash or property, what type of organization receives it and what terms and conditions are attached to the gift. (Excess deductions can be carried forward to future years.) **********Second, like all other deductions, charitable ones are phased out for high-income taxpayers.

Earlier this month, Croats in the Bosnian city of Mostar rebelled against plans drawn up by a European Union administrator, Hans Koschnick, for the reunification of the city, which is divided between Croats and Muslims. For several hours, angry crowds blocked Mr. Koschnick in his car. **********Mr. Milosevic, the Serbian President, who met privately with Mr. Holbrooke this morning, will presumably be asked about the refusal until Friday of senior  Bosnian Serb military commanders to meet or talk to NATO officials. **********The Bosnian Serb boycott against the meetings came as a protest against the extradition to The Hague of two Bosnian Serb military officers by the Bosnian Government as suspected war criminals. **********On Friday, as a first sign of reduced tension, several contacts between Bosnian Serb and NATO officers took place, including one between Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Walker, the commander of NATO ground forces in Bosnia, and Gen. Zdravko  Tolimir, the Bosnian Serb army's deputy commander. **********Mr. Izetbegovic, the Bosnian President, will presumably face questioning about NATO charges that a building near Sarajevo raided by NATO on Thursday was  a terrorist training center, run with the aid of the Muslim-led Bosnian Government, and that the operation was conducted by the Bosnian Army with the help of foreign experts, including some from Iran."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/11/your-money/IHT-home-away-from-home-call-a-professional.html": {"writer_name": "Aline Sullivan", "pub_date": "1996-05-11", "snippet": "FINDING a new home abroad while adjusting to an unfamiliar culture can be a bewildering experience.

Fortunately, there are plenty of companies able to help expatriates find the right home away from home. **********Orientation tours, house hunting, and moving and storage are some of the services being offered. Some companies will even assist clients in obtaining driver's licenses and a place for their children at the top of a school waiting list. Others throw in home management, rental services and cultural assimilation programs. **********None of this comes cheap, of course. Home-search companies charge between 1 percent and 2 percent of the purchase price, or about a month's rent. Charges mount as the services become more complex: Managers at London-based PRIcoa Relocation reckon that one international relocation can cost a company as much as five times an employee's annual salary. **********Companies like their employees to be able to hit the ground running. A \"do it yourself\" move can be both time-consuming and demoralizing. **********Settler International, part of medical evacuation giant Europ Assistance, is among the largest of these consultants. The Paris-based group has offices in all European Union countries and representation in another 40 capital cities around the globe. All told, it operates on behalf of about 140 companies, of which about 40 percent are American. **********\"We can help someone find a house in Harare,\" said Attilio Batilia, Settler International's sales and marketing director. **********\"A third of our business is within Europe, another third are people coming to Europe and the remainder are people moving from Europe to other countries. We select, pre-visit and then present the right house.\" **********In Britain, the Brighton-based Association of Relocation Agents publishes a directory of its 140-member home search and relocation companies. Tad Zurlinden, the association's chief executive, said that the service has become much more professional in recent years as demand has risen. **********\"Ten years ago there were more companies offering home search, but the ones around today are much better, whether they operate on behalf of individuals or companies,\" he said. \"The nature of the work means that most still tend to be regional, however.\" **********A narrow focus may mean a more comprehensive search, but it can also be a drawback to an expatriate who may be entirely unfamiliar with the area. For example, subtle differences among New York City neighborhoods and among the surrounding suburbs of New York State, Connecticut and New Jersey will not be readily apparent to a new arrival from Tokyo. **********That said, house-hunting in the United States is much easier than in Europe or Asia because most real estate agents have access to all available properties in their area. This so-called multiple listing service means that a prospective buyer or renter only need contact one agent. **********\"Multiple listings mean that any real estate agent's firm in the U.S. is in the home-search business,\" said Chris Collie, executive vice president of the Employee Relocation Council in Washington, D.C. \"About 50 companies work exclusively in relocation and home search but most of these are regional.\" **********The few national relocation companies in America include PHH Relocation Services, Coldwell Banker Relocation Services and Prudential Resources Management. **********\"Sometimes the expatriate just gets an allowance and a week's holiday to go find a place,\" said Mr. Batilia. \"But more and more of these services are being offered and to more people. They used to be reserved for top management but now everyone from middle management on up is getting some help.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/15/business/rite-aid-to-buy-thrifty-payless-for-1.3-billion.html": {"writer_name": "Charles Bagli", "pub_date": "1996-10-15", "snippet": "Rite Aid Corp, second-largest druggist in the country, in an acceleration of the wave of consolidation sweeping the drugstore industry, says it will acquire Thrifty Payless Holdings Inc, 1,007-store West Coast chain, for $1.3 billion in stock and ...", "word_count": 676, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rite Aid to Buy Thrifty Payless for $1.3 Billion", "print_headline": "Rite Aid to Buy Thrifty Payless for $1.3 Billion", "body_text": " **********In an acceleration of the wave of consolidation sweeping the drugstore industry, the Rite Aid Corporation, the second-largest druggist in the country, said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire Thrifty Payless Holdings Inc., a 1,007-store West Coast chain, for $1.3 billion in stock, plus the assumption of debt. **********The new entity would create a national chain of 3,816 drugstores and annual revenue of more than $10 billion, second by a slim margin to the Walgreen Company. Prior to the deal, Rite Aid had about half the revenue of Walgreen, though Rite Aid had more stores than Walgreen, even before the acquisition. **********''This industry will continue to consolidate and we plan on being a consolidator,'' said Martin Grass, chairman and chief executive of Rite Aid, which is based in Camp Hill, Pa. ''We want to be a player in markets with a strong market share. The acquisition of the West Coast's largest drugstore chain enables us to extend our geographic reach and provide more opportunities in higher growth areas.'' **********Rite Aid stores are primarily in the East and Midwest. Thrifty Payless, based in Wilsonville, Ore., near Portland, was formed by the 1994 merger of the Thrifty and Payless chains and operates stores in 10 Western states under the Thrifty and Payless names. The deal was first reported in The Wall Street Journal yesterday. **********Under the terms of the stock-swap deal, Rite Aid is to pay 0.65 share of its stock for each Thrifty Payless share. Using yesterday's closing stock price, the deal totals $1.32 billion. Rite Aid will also assume $890 million of debt, much of it incurred when the Thrifty and Payless chains merged. **********Rite Aid's acquisition plans are also a boon for Thrift Drug, a division of the J. C. Penney Company, which is to buy 200 stores in North and South Carolina from Rite Aid for an undisclosed price. Rite Aid was running a distant fourth in the South, so it decided to abandon the market and plans to sell other stores in the region. **********Thrift Drug has also been expanding. On Friday, Thrift completed a $285 million acquisition of Fay's Inc., a chain of 272 stores in New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont and New Hampshire. **********Indeed, Rite Aid and Thrift Drug are only the latest chains caught in the merger wave. Revco D.S. Inc. of Twinsburg, Ohio, whose bid to merge with Rite Aid earlier this year foundered on antitrust issues, is pursuing Big B Inc., a chain of 387 drugstores based in Alabama, with an offer of $330 million. **********The merger trend of the last few years has been spurred by managed health care plans and the shift by consumers to third-party prescription coverage that provides lower reimbursement rates to drugstores. The chains have sought to grow to increase efficiency and spread costs over a bigger base of stores in the face of declining profit margins. **********Analysts estimate that chains of fewer than 20 drugstores account for about 40 percent of the industry's $65 billion in sales. But, they say, the small competitors find it increasingly hard to survive in a cost-conscious environment in which they cannot bargain for better prices from either the third-party providers or the pharmaceutical companies. **********Some critics have contended that the consolidation among drugstores will lead to higher prices, but Mr. Grass at Rite Aid said the merger could benefit consumers. **********''Consolidation may mean lower prices for consumers because we'll be the most efficient provider in the marketplace,'' he said. ''We're in a great position to become a preferred provider for a lot of these H.M.O,'s. To do that, we have to give them the most competitive price.'' **********The merger, however, will eliminate all but a few dozen of the 740 administrative posts at the Thrifty Payless headquarters The company is providing a severance package, Mr. Grass said, ''for everyone from the chairman down to the janitor.'' **********Rite Aid also plans to divest itself of Thrifty Payless's Bi-Mart operation, a chain of 44 membership discount drugstores. But only 2.5 percent of Thrifty Payless's 31,000 employees will be laid off, Mr. Grass said, with Rite Aid retaining store employees and supervisors."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/09/business/ge-and-shamrock-in-latin-media-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-08-09", "snippet": "Pension fund of the General Electric Co and Shamrock Group, an investment firm, buy $30 million of $50 million equity offering by Latin Communications Group, owner of the Spanish-language El Diaro-La Prensa newspaper, New York (S)", "word_count": 83, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.E.

G. Warburg & Company. For Ford, he added, \"the first half of the year is really locked in to be pretty disappointing.\" **********Ford said that it would offer rebates or discount interest rates of 4.8 percent over four years on most 1996 models sold through April 2. Typical interest rates on four-year auto loans are now twice that level. **********No discounts were offered on Lincolns or several Ford models, including the Explorer, the popular sport utility vehicle; the subcompact Aspire, and the 1997 F-150 pickup, which goes on sale this month. The Bronco sport utility vehicle will offer a $2,000 rebate or the 4.8 percent interest rate. **********Analysts generally agreed that Ford had missed the mark in its strategy to add as standard equipment some previously optional features and charge nearly $19,150 for the most basic of its Taurus models. That would be a 5.6 percent increase from the price of the stripped-down 1995 model, which came with a $1,000 rebate last summer. By contrast, the Chevrolet Lumina, a comparable sedan, starts at $16,355, while a Dodge Intrepid from Chrysler starts at $18,445 plus a $1,000 rebate. **********Ford's rebates amount to \"a recognition that the company has recently overproduced,\" said Scott F. Merlis, an independent automotive researcher based  in Westport, Conn. \"Sales were strong, but production was even stronger.\" He said Ford's per-vehicle incentive costs would probably rise $50 in the first quarter, to about $950. **********The announcement came a week after Alexander Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive, had insisted that the company's vehicles were fairly priced and did not need the incentives recently introduced by the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation on selective models. He stressed then that Ford would not offer discounts on its flagship car, the Taurus, despite its disappointing sales in the fall. **********Ross H. Roberts, Ford division general manager, insisted in an interview today that Mr. Trotman, \"told you right last week; we had made up our mind to not put any incentives on it.\" **********But then came the results of a test of incentives that Ford conducted last month in the Midwest. The test bolstered sales so much that Ford decided to offer incentives nationally. **********In Cincinnati, one of the test cities, sales of selected vehicles jumped 22 percent and Taurus sales climbed 34 percent over the November sales. **********The incentives are an embarrassing acknowledgment that Ford misjudged the family-sedan market, where the Taurus has been a best seller for years. Sales in the fall lagged behind 1994 levels, a downturn that Ford attributed to its decision to sell fewer Tauruses to rental fleets. But both customers and dealers have complained about the extensive redesign of the car. **********Mr. Roberts said Ford had not misjudged the market. \"We are just responding the way that other manufacturers have,\" with incentives, he said, adding that the Taurus was the industry's best-selling car in the fourth quarter. **********The problem is that \"the size of the pie\" has been shrinking, he said, adding: \"The car market has just not been that strong. We are getting a bigger piece of the pie than we had.\" **********Mr. Lobaccaro, the stock analyst, said that on Wednesday he would probably lower his estimate for Ford's 1996 profits to $2.25 a share, from the $3.20 he had estimated in recent weeks and the $3.70 figure he had assigned in the autumn. \"The earnings are clearly depressed due to launch costs\" associated with the introduction of the new Taurus, Escort and F-150 pickup truck designs, he said. **********As for Ford dealers, they praised the new sales incentives today, although several said Ford should have offered $1,000 rebates. Nevertheless, Doug Barbour, sales manager at Capitol Ford in Raleigh, N.C., said that even the $600 discount \"should spur car sales significantly.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/07/business/key-rates-709530.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-08-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 128, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/20/business/international-business-an-inquiry-on-metals-by-britain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 513, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;An Inquiry On Metals By Britain", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;An Inquiry On Metals By Britain", "body_text": " **********Responding to the Sumitomo Corporation's copper trading scandal, British regulators put the entire London-based metal market under scrutiny today. **********The Securities and Investment Board said it would conduct a six-month inquiry into trading on the London Metal Exchange, a leading international market, as well as off-exchange dealing. **********The board is already investigating whether British dealers were involved in  trades with Yasuo Hamanaka, Sumitomo's top copper trader, who acknowledged losing $1.8 billion as a result of unauthorized trades over 10 years. **********The investigation could result in tighter regulation by the British Government of off-exchange trading, which has been vulnerable to fraud. **********Details of the copper trading losses emerged last week when Sumitomo dismissed Mr. Hamanaka.

But with additional intelligence, often larger screens, and more often small keyboards, these so-called smart, or enhanced, phones are taking on  some of the attributes of personal computers. In recent demonstrations, in fact, Oracle has been describing a version of the network computer that is actually a  smart phone. **********The three dominant competitors in this new market -- Northern Telecom, a unit of BCE Inc.; Philips, and the combined development forces of U.S. Order and the  Colonial Data Technologies Corporation -- along with a host of smaller players are now lining up partners among the regional Bell companies. The idea is to use the partnerships to distribute the phones and create additional services for them. **********Cidco Inc., a leading maker of phone terminals, announced recently it had licensed the i-phone, an Internet-oriented smart phone designed by the National  Semiconductor Corporation and Infogear, a start-up company based in Woodside, Calif. **********As the market heats up, each company is taking a slightly different approach, adding features like voice recognition, specialized interfaces and touch screens.

In their current incarnations, they are ill-suited to such competition. For one thing, their mostly text-only black-and-white screens  are typically a quarter of the size of a standard PC monitor, or smaller. So, at least initially, the smart phones will be best suited to performing transactions, such as banking and making airline reservations, and for communication, such as sending and receiving E-mail. Their beauty lies in ease of use. Connecting to the bank, for example, can be a one-button operation, far  simpler than starting up a computer, launching an application and connecting with a modem. **********While the vision of the network computer being promoted by Oracle, I.B.M. and others is something of an inexpensive device used by the whole family for education and entertainment on the Internet, the new phones are decidedly utilitarian appliances. Some models, such as the Telesmart 4000 from Colonial Data, even include a credit card swipe. **********\"The screen phone is certainly not a PC, but a very useful device that serves multiple applications, providing access to information services and transactions,\" said Joseph W. Cline, executive vice president of sales and marketing for Colonial Data. \"And it can display information in a very easy to use way.\" **********\"People are going to buy a smart phone because it's the natural next phone you're going to have in your home,\" said John Backus, president and chief operating officer of U.S. Order, in Herndon, Va. **********Instead of having one device or the other, the manufacturers expect that consumers will have a personal computer in the office or a network computer in the den attached to the television set and an enhanced phone in the kitchen, where it will replace the conventional family phone. **********As Mr. Backus envisions it, the products will have very different uses. If you wanted to use the Web to research sport utility vehicles, for example, you would use a PC to browse auto makers' Web sites, download reviews from car magazines and perhaps compare dealer prices. But if you wanted to check the school lunch menu for your 8-year-old, you could probably find out more quickly  using a smart phone. **********Gerrit Schipper, the president and chief executive of Philips Home Services,  says the company's research has shown that consumers are not interested in using a telephone for Internet browsing. **********Berge Ayvazian, a senior vice president at the Yankee Group, a consulting company, said people underestimate the inherent advantages of using an enhanced  phone to connect to the Web compared with using a network computer. **********\"The smart phone has a small screen, but the phone is a multifunction device, while the network computer is a narrow device, only for surfing the Web,\" Mr. Ayvazian said. And, he said, \"The guys that are trying to keep the perceived price of the network computer under $500 are stripping out all but the most necessary and assuming you want to use your television, and want to pay for a modem, which is also separate.\" **********But the new phones are still a long way from becoming the preferred low-cost  Internet access device. Providing a means of translating Web documents into information that can be viewed on the small screens of smart phones is one of the biggest hurdles facing manufacturers. Initially, users will dial in to intermediary servers to provide the translation. Eventually, however, translation will take place in the phone, Mr. Ayvazian said. **********For example, Northern Telecom, or Nortel, a telecommunications company based  in Dallas, is developing a sophisticated phone that will use Sun Microsystems' Java language to translate Web pages into information that can be read on the phone's small screen. **********At least one more cycle of price reductions is expected. Enhanced phones today typically cost $400 to $500, though a few are already much cheaper (Philips sells an Internet phone in the Netherlands for about $350), and the phones can be leased for a few dollars a month. **********The price of smart phones will have to come down to around $250, analysts predict, before most consumers would readily embrace them as alternatives to conventional phones, which can cost less than $20. Nortel's phone is expected to sell for $500 when it released next year, but the company hopes eventually to sell it for about $300, said Rock Faletti, president of Nortel Multimedia Communications Systems. **********\"It is not at all clear yet how these services are going to be packaged and priced,\" Mr. Ayvazian said. **********Philips has been testing its phones in Garden City, L.I., where it delivered  $4 million worth of smart phones to the town's 7,500 households. Initially, residents will use the phones to retrieve local information stored in Philips' own information service which will include supermarket specials and school events. And while they will not be able to browse the Web, they will be able to  send E-mail to friends on the system or over the Internet. **********The project builds upon Philips' early foray into phone-based financial services, which it began in late 1994 with Citibank. Through the Garden City test, Philips hopes to determine just what the demand is for broader information services delivered through the phone, and how much such services will cost."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/04/business/company-news-international-paper-plans-to-eliminate-1300-jobs.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;INTERNATIONAL PAPER PLANS TO ELIMINATE 1,300 JOBS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;INTERNATIONAL PAPER PLANS TO ELIMINATE 1,300 JOBS", "body_text": " **********The International Paper Company said yesterday that it would cut 1,300 jobs in the United States and Europe, resulting in a $70 million pretax charge against fourth-quarter earnings.

This compared with a rate of 11.6 percent in December, revised upward  from a 9.3 percent rate estimated a month ago. **********The Conference Board, a business research group in New York, calculated that its index designed to signal turning points in the business cycle dropped five-tenths of 1 percent in January as the blizzard shrank the length of the average workweek to its lowest point in more than 12 years. **********Still another report found that first-time claims for unemployment insurance  climbed 6,000 in the week ended Saturday, retracing about a quarter of the preceding week's improvement. **********Analysts said the latest data provided little solid information about the state of the economy, which they said seemed to be grinding out further meager gains. **********\"They suggest to me that we're still in the doldrums, especially the manufacturing sector,\" commented Evelina M. Tainer, chief economist at Indosuez  Carr Futures in Chicago. \"We're going to have a soft, sluggish first half and a  rebound in the second half,\" she predicted, with total output expanding an average of 1.3 percent at an annual rate through mid-year and 2.8 percent thereafter. **********The installment debt compilation, once regarded as a quite useful indicator of consumer behavior, is now denigrated by many analysts because of the rise of  home equity loans, which are not included, and the increased use of credit cards for convenience rather than as a means to borrow. Moreover, the series does not  show extensions or repayments, only the net change in the amount outstanding. **********Still, analysts said, the economy is unlikely to be at risk of a significant  downturn so long as installment debt continues to rise at double-digit annual rates. Revolving, or credit card, debt rose at a 16.1 percent pace in January, the fastest since June, today's report showed, while automobile credit slowed to a 9.3 percent rate of increase from 14.4 percent in December. **********Interest rates on new car loans averaged 9.74 percent, down sharply from 10.52 in December. **********The category of \"other\" debt, which includes loans for boats, college or vacations, expanded at a 9.8 percent pace compared with 2.1 percent in December, the Fed reported. **********\"The consumer's balance sheet is not yet as overextended as it was in the late 1980's,\" Joseph Liro, economist at Wood Gundy, advised clients last Friday. \"Therefore we believe the consumer can sustain at least a moderate pace of spending through 1996.\" **********The sizable decline in the recently privatized index of leading indicators, which has also lost esteem over the last several years, had little effect today  not only because most of its components have been previously reported but also because of the blizzard's overwhelming effect in shrinking the workweek. **********Excluding the workweek item, the index would have edged up one-tenth of 1 percent instead of falling five-tenths of 1 percent, the Conference Board said.  Nonetheless, the index has moved lower in four of the latest five months and eight of the latest 12. **********After the workweek, negative impacts were generated by lower building permits, a decline in consumer expectations, a rise in first-time jobless claims, quicker deliveries by suppliers and lower stock prices. **********Positive contributions came from a rise in unfilled factory orders for durable goods (also reflecting the blizzard), higher prices for materials particularly sensitive to the business cycle, higher contracts and orders for new plant and equipment, more orders to factories for consumer goods and a slightly expanded money supply. **********The companion index of coincident indicators fell three-tenths of 1 percent in January after rising that much in December, while the index of indicators that tend to move only after the economy at large was unchanged in January after rising three-tenths of 1 percent in December. **********The Labor Department's report on jobless claims listed 363,000 last week, up  from 357,000 in the Feb. 24 week, with the four-week average inching down by 1,000 to stand at 370,750.

At the same time, Israeli radio reported that the Iranian Foreign Minister would visit Syria and Lebanon within the next two days. **********The dance has begun; we hope the time is ripe,\" an Israeli official said, confirming that Mr. Christopher held long telephone talks today with Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Foreign Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, as well as Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria and Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri of Lebanon. **********In other diplomatic moves, the French Foreign Minister, Herve de Charette, met in Israel today with Mr. Peres and Mr. Barak, though Israeli commentators put little stock in his initiative. Mr. de Charette reportedly asked the Iranian Foreign Minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, to join in the efforts to halt the fighting. **********The Jordanian Prime Minister, Abdul Karim al-Kabariti, is also expected in Israel, on Tuesday, to help mediate. **********Israeli officials said they believed that a cease-fire agreement could be reached within two or three days, in time for residents who had fled from threatened regions of northern Israel to return to their homes by the national holiday on April 22. **********Mr. Peres has not spelled out the goals of attacks in Lebanon, which began last Thursday and have sent hundreds of thousands of Lebanese civilians fleeing  from cities and villages south of Beirut. But Israeli officials have made clear  that the primary objective is to mount enough pressure on Lebanon and Syria to force them to curb attacks by Hezbollah, or the Party of God, a militant Shiite  Muslim organization supported by Iran. **********Once the point was driven home with the combined pressure of the large exodus and incessant air and artillery attacks, including select strikes on Beirut, the plan was for the United States to step in and broker a new cease-fire arrangement, much as Mr. Christopher did after a similar Israeli operation in 1993, which lasted seven days. **********Hezbollah has been fighting a guerrilla war for 11 years against the Israeli  occupation of a nine-mile-wide buffer zone in southern Lebanon. Israel launched  the attacks asserting that the guerrillas had escalated their attacks beyond the limits set in 1993, both inside the zone and against northern Israel. **********Though there was no indication yet what arrangements the United States was discussing, Israeli officials said that as in 1993, there would be no written agreement. The Israelis said the minimum they expected to gain was firm commitments from the Lebanese and Syrian Governments that Hezbollah would not attack inside Israel, either with Katyusha rockets or infiltrations. **********Beyond that, the Israelis said they hoped that Syria would agree to clamp down on Hezbollah, a commitment Israel had been seeking from Syria before their  peace talks were suspended last month. Those talks were broken off in the political crisis that followed a wave of suicide bombings in Israel. **********An American official said Washington was pressing Syria to restrain Hezbollah, which derives much of its support from Iran but which is dependent in southern Lebanon on Syrian tolerance. \"We want the Katyushas to stop,\" one American official said, expressing hope that a cease-fire -- \"for a long-term period, not a week or 10 days\" -- could be established within 48 hours. **********The official American position is that the current violence is a direct result of Hezbollah's firing rockets into Israel. But as the Israeli military response continued, Mr. Christopher decided to try to stop the violence. **********\"His engagement was spurred by the continuing violence, as the rocket attacks continued and Israel responded in a very muscular fashion, and the whole situation became more tenuous and dangerous,\" an American official said. **********Mr. Christopher is to attend a meeting of foreign ministers of 29 countries and organizations in Luxembourg on April 22, designed to be a follow-up to the antiterrorism commitments made in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt, on March 13, a summit meeting called to help Israel overcome the suicide bombings. **********The Syrians and the Lebanese, who refused to go there, have been invited to Luxembourg. American officials hope that if a cease-fire can be arranged in southern Lebanon with Syrian help, Damascus may be willing to send Mr. Sharaa to Luxembourg. Lebanon, a client state of Syria, would follow suit. **********Any agreement ending Katyusha rocket attacks on northern Israel is bound to bolster Mr. Peres's chances in the Israeli elections on May 29. After the suicide bombings that took 63 lives in late February and early March, his ratings took a steep dive because of the popular impression that he was dovish on security. A successful Lebanon operation, commentators agreed, would go a long way to reverse that image. **********But prolonged negotiations, or failure to secure a halt to the rocketing of northern Israel, could turn against Mr. Peres by raising questions about the wisdom and execution of an operation that has attracted considerable censure around the world for using attacks against civilian areas. **********The secretary general of Amnesty International, Pierre Sane, issued a statement asserting that the Israeli declaration of areas of Lebanon as a free-fire zone was \"tantamount to a death threat against almost half a million civilians.\" He continued, \"In what is becoming a major humanitarian crisis, innocent people are being punished in a massive reprisal for attacks on Israeli  civilians by Hezbollah.\" **********Even as the diplomatic contacts gained momentum, the pounding of Lebanon continued unabated. **********Israeli planes struck a power station five miles northeast of Beirut, further reducing electricity to the capital after a strike on a transformer station on Sunday. The Israeli command said the strikes were in retaliation for Katyusha rockets that cut electricity in the northern Israeli city of Qiryat Shemona. **********Once again, Israeli helicopters flew in from the Mediterranean Sea to fire missiles into southern suburbs where Hezbollah has its strongholds. The Israelis said their target was the offices of Hezbollah's consultative council. **********[Three Israeli helicopter gunships rocketed Lebanon's largest Palestinian refugee camp on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported. Lebanese police officials said six rockets were fired into the Ein el-Hilweh camp on the outskirts of Sidon before dawn, hitting the house of a dissident Palestinian guerrilla leader, Col. Munir Makdah, who survived the attack unscathed. Two bodyguards and one of their wives were wounded, the police said. **********[Israeli aircraft and artillery struck elsewhere in southern Lebanon at daybreak on Tuesday, hitting suspected guerrilla bases of Hezbollah after they fired more rockets into northern Israel.] **********The Lebanese Army fired antiaircraft guns at the Israeli planes, but none of  the aircraft were reported hit, and the Israelis did not strike back at the Lebanese. **********Israel also warned another seven villages in southern Lebanon that it intended to shell them, adding more civilians to the stream of people fleeing north. About 100 towns and villages have now been vacated after Israeli warnings, and their residents, said to number more than 400,000 now, are becoming a major problem both for the Lebanese Government and for Syria, which has considerable control over Lebanon by virtue of its 35,000 troops stationed there. **********Israeli planes and artillery continued to hit targets across southern Lebanon, including four strikes near the port city of Tyre and barrages on the town of Nabatiye, northeast of Tyre. **********According to Lebanese tallies, the death toll in Lebanon has remained under 30, and no Israelis have been killed. **********On its side, Hezbollah maintained a steady barrage of Katyusha rockets into northern Israel, though no serious injuries were reported. Though Israeli commanders have asserted over the last two days that the fire was becoming more  sporadic and less accurate, they also acknowledged that their shelling of suspected guerrilla bases was not likely to stop the Katyushas. **********There was no indication that Israel intended to order an infantry sweep outside its security zone. **********Leaders of Hezbollah continued to issue threats of reprisals, including suicide bombings against Israeli and Jewish targets around the world. **********Despite Israeli attacks and pressures in the past, Syria and its Lebanese allies have rejected demands to crack down on Hezbollah, arguing that as a Lebanese militia it has the right to fight against Israeli occupation. **********Seeking support for his country in Paris, Prime Minister Hariri of Lebanon reiterated his argument that, \"If there were no occupation, there would be no reason for Hezbollah to exist.\" **********He also rejected Israeli demands that Lebanon disarm the guerrillas. \"Israel  knows very well that this is impossible,\" he said. The Israelis, he added, \"are  occupying part of our country.\" **********\"What they want us to do is make the occupation easy,\" he said. \"We cannot do this.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/07/news/american-topics-british-stewardess-saves-fishermen-from-aloft.html": {"writer_name": "International Tribune", "pub_date": "1996-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 396, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMERICAN TOPICS : British Stewardess Saves Fishermen From Aloft", "print_headline": "AMERICAN TOPICS : British Stewardess Saves Fishermen From Aloft", "body_text": " **********A British Airways stewardess who spotted black smoke in the Atlantic Ocean helped save three American fishermen whose boat was burning. **********\"It was literally luck,\" Joanne Savage said on returning to London. \"I'm thrilled to bits that all the fishermen are all right.\" **********Miss Savage, 31, said the Boeing 747 was flying over the Atlantic Thursday at 34,000 feet (10,000 meters), en route to New York from London, when she looked out the window. **********\"There was a moment when the clouds parted and I saw black smoke on the water,\" she said. \"Twenty seconds later there was a complete cover of cloud again, so I wouldn't have seen it.\" **********Cabin crew are trained to report anything unusual, and Miss Savage told the head steward, Terry Mills, about the smoke. **********He alerted the captain, Dave Cobley, who switched to the aircraft's emergency channel and picked up a signal from an automatic SOS beacon.

Press), warns that getting starry-eyed about the Net can be a problem. It creates metaphors -- like the medieval cathedral -- which are not just innocent flights of fancy. In any new technology, he suggests, our conception of an invention shapes the way it evolves and the way it is used. And the Internet now is in just such an infancy, awaiting the imprinting of our metaphors and archetypes. **********This is a fascinating assertion about a technology that sometimes risks getting the sort of effusive acclaim once reserved for life-saving medicine. Mr. Stefik prescribes caution and analysis, but the enthusiasm and optimism poke through as he comments on a series of papers about Internet metaphors, arguing that if the Net ever becomes as profound as he thinks it will, part of the reason will be that we are using the right metaphors to describe it. **********Mr. Stefik knows whereof he speaks. He is a principal scientist at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, the same organization that, nearly 20 years ago, created the metaphor of windows for organizing data on a computer screen -- an idea that didn't catch on until the Macintosh was introduced and now, through its marketing, seems self-evident. **********As an example of a limiting metaphor, Mr. Stefik discusses the most popular: the Information Superhighway. The image suggests that like the national highway system, the Internet will allow fast, fluent transport of information, increasing prosperity and commerce. But it is deceptive, for the Internet is not centralized, its pathways are not fixed, and the image does not begin to suggest its potential impact. As Mr. Stefik points out, no one would think of describing the effects of the telephone system on business and private life by referring to a voice superhighway. **********Instead, Mr. Stefik suggests four interrelated and familiar, but resonant, images to describe the possibilities of the Internet: the library, the mail system, the marketplace and the idea of alternative worlds. These are so important, he argues, partly because they invoke primal personality archetypes described by the psychoanalyst Carl Jung: the digital library awakes the Keeper of Knowledge within us; E-mail appeals to the Communicator archetype; the marketplace invokes the Trader or Trickster, and playing with virtual reality attracts the Adventurer. **********This is getting as fanciful as the medieval cathedral metaphor, but luckily, archetypes are superfluous to the argument. They really become themes, as Mr. Stefik reprints essays that illumine their possibilities and ambiguities. Can digital libraries be free and survive? What sort of copyright protection and royalty system will protect digital books? Will the electronic marketplace of the future, with its break-down of geographic and logistical boundaries, change corporate culture? How does the Net change social interaction? **********The past is not irrelevant to the metaphors guiding these questions. The book includes an essay written in 1945 for the Atlantic Monthly by Vannevar Bush, who was director of the Federal Office of Scientific Research and Development. It is reprinted on the Web (www.isg.sfu.ca/duchier/misc/vbush/). **********Mr. Bush suggested that one of the big problems in ordinary libraries was that the indexing system was marred by ''artificiality.'' Libraries made it difficult to follow an ''associative trail,'' in which one piece of information raised questions that led to a search for another. **********He believed that a desk sized device he called a memex might be developed -- a personal library of microfilm equipped with a screen and a keyboard. Each bit of stored information would be instantly accessible and would contain references to other sources. He suggested there would be ''new forms of encyclopedias'' with ''a mesh of associative trails running through them.'' **********This was an extraordinarily prescient imagining of a (nondigital) PC and the possibilities of hypertext. But this vision was not a matter of random fantasy. The shaping of the future came about through finding a resonant image in the present: the memex was a researcher's dream, an icon for a Keeper of Knowledge. **********So, Mr. Stefik would suggest, the technology did not create the dream; the dream of what research could be helped prepare the way for a successful technology. The repeated message is that technology does not drive society on its own; it is not a force independent from our expectations or the context we create for it. **********In a very suggestive historical essay, for example, Scott D.N. Cook, a philosopher and researcher at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, argues that we have completely misunderstood this idea, even when thinking about the impact of moveable type. The Gutenberg Bible did not create a revolutionary change; the new technology did not have a rapid and far-reaching effect on literacy and social institutions. In fact, Mr. Cook, argues, the famous Bible took years of hand work to produce; paper was extraordinarily expensive, and illiteracy in the year 1500 ran at about 90 percent. It did not reach 50 percent until the turn of the last century. **********Moveable type did not by itself create a revolution; it took later inventions along with the transformation of society to allow the technological revolution to take place. Something similar, Mr. Stefik argues, must happen with the Internet. The pace of the transformation is much faster than it was in Gutenberg's day, but still much must take place before the technology has a significant impact. Trade on the Net is still crude; access still awkward; influence, outside the media, relatively negligible. The evolution of the Internet will require not just technological innovation but also social transformation. And, who knows, by then archetypes might be as irrelevant for the Net as they are for the telephone."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/13/business/cox-cable-systems-to-carry-nbc-microsoft-channel.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Carter", "pub_date": "1996-06-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 507, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cox Cable Systems to Carry NBC-Microsoft Channel", "print_headline": "Cox Cable Systems to Carry NBC-Microsoft Channel", "body_text": " **********NBC said yesterday that Cox Communications Inc.'s cable television systems, with nearly 3.3 million subscribers, would carry MSNBC, the new all-news cable channel being started by NBC and the Microsoft Corporation. **********About 1.7 million Cox subscribers will receive MSNBC when it starts up July 15, bringing the total initial subscriber base for the new channel to approximately 22 million.

Yeltsin announced today that he would seek a second term in the presidential election in June. **********His declaration amounted to the formal opening of a campaign that, according  to every measure of public opinion, could well bring back to power the Communists Mr. Yeltsin ousted five years ago. **********His voice croaking with hoarseness after a rash of campaign appearances in his hometown of Yekaterinburg, Mr. Yeltsin -- himself once a member of the Communist Politburo -- told supporters that he alone could head off a Communist  victory and continue Russia's political and economic reforms. **********He also promised a solution within months to the hugely unpopular war in Chechnya, without suggesting what it might be. **********Even as Mr. Yeltsin spoke, the Communists were lampooning him as a weak rival and celebrating the nomination of their standard bearer, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, at their party congress in Moscow. **********Presenting a gentler version of Communism that has left the West wondering if he is really a Social Democrat or a true believer, Mr. Zyuganov spoke vaguely of limiting privatization of the economy and restoring Russia as a great power. **********Other Communist speakers, however, made no secret of their hostility toward the West. **********The dual announcements today marked the start of what promises to be a bitterly fought, raucous campaign over the future of economic and political reforms. **********The growing field also includes Grigory A. Yavlinsky, an economic reformer, and Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, a strident nationalist. Other possible candidates include Aleksandr I. Lebed, a retired general, and possibly Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the former Soviet President, whose popularity in Russia is minuscule. **********To qualify, each candidate must collect at least one million signatures before April 14. The election itself is expected to be a two-phase process, with a run-off in late June between the two top contenders. **********Securing a place in the run-off would be no mean accomplishment for Mr. Yeltsin, whose poll ratings are dismally low. Many reformers, in fact, were hoping that he would retire, opening the way for a potentially more electable candidate, such as Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. But in recent weeks that has seemed highly unlikely. **********Yegor T. Gaidar, the economic reformer and leader of Russia's Choice, predicted today that Mr. Yeltsin's candidacy would benefit the Communists, who came in first in parliamentary elections in December with 22 percent of the vote. **********But Andrei V. Kozyrev, the pro-Western former Foreign Minister, said Mr. Yeltsin could win re-election by strongly backing reforms and, thus, underscoring his differences with the Communists. **********Mr. Yeltsin \"has an opportunity before him to defend the reform cause and not to yield any further to anti-reformist pressure,\" Mr. Kozyrev said in an interview. **********In recent weeks, however, Mr. Yeltsin has delivered a mixed message, praising reform while replacing his Government's leading free-market advocate, Anatoly B. Chubais. **********\"I am for reforms, but not at any price,\" Mr. Yeltsin said today. \"I am for correcting the course, not for backtracking on it.\" **********And tonight, the President showed his sensitivity to unflattering news coverage by dismissing the head of Russian State Television, Oleg Poptsov, because the station's coverage of Chechnya was too negative. Its coverage of Chechnya has drawn fire from hard-line advisers to Mr. Yeltsin. **********The city of Yekaterinburg, where the 65-year-old Mr. Yeltsin was born and served as a Communist Party boss in the 1970's and 1980's, was selected to get his re-election effort off to an auspicious start. **********Sergei A. Filatov, Mr. Yeltsin's former chief of staff who is now involved in Mr. Yeltsin's campaign, told Russian television tonight the voters would decide  the election on three main issues: delayed wages and pensions, corruption and the war in Chechnya. **********Not surprisingly, Mr. Yeltsin today addressed all three: He vowed to end delays in wage payments. He cited efforts to fight corruption. He promised a fast end to the Chechen war. **********\"Elsewhere in the world such conflicts sometimes take decades to resolve,\" he said. \"We are obliged to untangle the Chechen knot much more quickly -- within months.\" **********But Mr. Yeltsin also ruled out an immediate troop withdrawal. And his recent  statements that Dzhokhar Dudayev, the rebel Chechen leader, should be executed,  do not suggest a quick political solution. **********Beyond that, Mr. Yeltsin tried to assure voters that the most painful part of Russia's journey to a capitalist economy was behind them. And he warned that the Communists could reverse hard-won gains and restore totalitarian controls, a development he warned could lead to \"possible upheavals, including a civil war.\" **********\"Today political freedoms are taken for granted,\" Mr. Yeltsin warned. \"But how tenuous is the line that separates us from the suffocating yesterday.\" **********At today's Communist meeting, the 51-year old Mr. Zyuganov read his speech to 208 delegates at a lectern bearing his party's symbol, a hammer and sickle over  an open book. He spoke in a stentorian voice but with little emotion, and received tepid applause from the party faithful. **********He complained that privatization had gone too far. He urged a strengthened union of Russian and former Soviet republics -- a popular theme among the delegates. Reflecting nostalgia for the old Soviet Union, a Ukrainian delegate gave Mr. Zyuganov a piece of Crimean earth. Mr. Zyuganov also promised to protect Russia against the insiduous influence of foreign television. **********\"People in Russia only have three rights,\" Mr. Zyuganov complained. \"The right to steal. The right to get drunk. And the right to have no responsiblity for anything.\" **********Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, a Prime Minister under Mikhail Gorbachev and a supporter  of Mr. Zyuganov, said it would be a mistake to count Mr. Yeltsin out because he  has the authority of the presidency at his disposal and knows how to use it. **********\"He is definitely not the same Yeltsin I used to know,\" Mr. Ryzhkov said, alluding to the President's declining health and low standing in the polls. \"But he still has power.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/28/world/libyan-troops-clash-with-foes-after-jailbreak.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 290, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Libyan Troops Clash With Foes After Jailbreak", "print_headline": "Libyan Troops Clash With Foes After Jailbreak", "body_text": " **********Col.

It is against my Emperor,' '' Mrs. Henson said, without bitterness. ''I realized that the vow of Tanaka to his Emperor was very great, greater than my plea.'' **********Still grateful for small favors, Mrs. Henson, now 68, recently became the first woman in the region to accept a Japanese reparation payment for her suffering in the brothels. The payments have been rejected as inadequate by all but half a dozen of the 500 surviving victims, widely known as ''comfort women,'' who have come forward in the Philippines, South Korea and Taiwan. **********After receiving her payment of about $19,000 and a letter of apology from Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan in August, Mrs. Henson said, she wrote to the Prime Minister to thank him. **********Most of the other women, now in their 60's and 70's, have joined in rejecting the payments because they come from a private fund organized by the Japanese Government rather than from the Government itself. **********Until recently, the Government had denied any involvement in the wartime brothels, which historians say victimized as many as 200,000 women and teen-age girls throughout Asia. Its offer of payments now from what it calls the Asian Women's Fund is in part an effort to avoid opening the door to hundreds of lawsuits from survivors of various wartime atrocities. **********''The victims oppose the private fund principally because it cannot be a substitute for official legal compensation,'' said Nelia Sancho, a spokeswoman for a Philippine support group for the women. **********Demonstrating in front of the Japanese Embassy in August, one of the victims, Gertrudes Balisalisa, said she was rejecting both the payment and Prime Minister Hashimoto's expression of ''most sincere apologies and remorse.'' **********''I would be a hypocrite if I said I didn't need the money, but I need my dignity and honor more,'' Mrs. Balisalisa said. ''I want the money to come from the Japanese Government.'' **********Mrs. Henson said she accepted the money, quite simply, because she needs it. She needs medical care and she wants to provide for her three children and their families after working for most of her life in a tobacco factory. **********And in any case, she said, ''I cannot restore any more my dignity for what happened 50 years ago.'' **********''No amount of money -- even a mountain of money -- can repay the horror of the war.'' **********Mrs. Henson may feel gratitude for small kindnesses, but she has kept her anger alive. Rather than trying to forget her trauma, she said, she has clung to her sanity over the years by remembering everything. **********And she has found a powerful way to avenge her humiliation: she is telling her story. **********After revealing her long-held secret in 1992, as the first of the women  to speak out in public, Mrs. Henson sat down to write about her experiences. The result is a short, blunt book published here and in Japan this year, titled ''Comfort Woman: Slave of Destiny'' (Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism). **********''I am telling my story so that they will feel humiliated,'' Mrs. Henson said. ''It is true: I am an avenger of the dead.'' **********Every day from 2 P.M. until 10 P.M., she recalls in the book, she and five other women in the brothel were forced to have sex with scores of soldiers who lined up noisily outside their small, curtained rooms. **********The women were given four days of rest each month during menstruation, except for Mrs. Henson, who had not yet begun to have her period. **********''We began the day with breakfast, after which we swept and cleaned our rooms,'' she wrote. ''Then we went to the bathroom downstairs to wash the only dress we had and to bathe. The bathroom did not even have a door, so the soldiers watched us. We were all naked, and they laughed at us.'' **********And she wrote: ''When the soldiers raped me, I felt like a pig. Sometimes they tied up my right leg with a waistband or belt and hung it to a nail on the wall as they violated me. I was angry all the time.'' **********Even the Japanese Army doctor who checked the women for venereal disease raped her, she wrote. Even when she was shaking with the fever and chills of malaria she was raped. **********Sometimes Captain Tanaka, who had also raped her, seemed to feel compassion for her, stroking her hair and kissing her cheek. **********''He would hold my face and look straight into my eyes,'' she wrote. ''Sometimes I pitied him.'' **********In January 1944 the camp where she was being held came under attack by Philippine guerrillas and Mrs. Henson and the other women were rescued. **********For months afterward, she wrote, she was so severely traumatized that her mother thought she had gone mad. **********Overcome with shame and guilt, she wrote, ''I kept muttering to myself: 'Why did I not escape? Because they might kill me.' '' **********During this period, she overheard a Philippine doctor saying she might never be able to function or to recover her memory. **********''I told myself, no, I cannot lose my sanity; I will fight,'' Mrs. Henson said in the interview. ''I tried to work my mind all the time, night and day. I did not let my brain stop thinking. Always thinking and thinking.

''He has underlined that Europe must refuse the rule of imperial law in the region that enables the American-Israeli axis to impose just about anything it wants on impotent Arab states.'' **********Winning back the leverage that France used to have among the Arab countries of the Middle East but lost to the United States over the years has been a prime goal of Mr. Chirac's since he took office, and there seemed little doubt that he had made progress on that goal this week. **********Whether his foreign policy play can help him win back lost popularity at home is another question. Only 32 percent of French voters view him favorably now, according to a poll published in the weekly Le Point taken just before his trip. **********By appealing to Arab and Muslim moderation in the Middle East, Mr. Chirac may also have been trying to head off frustration among the millions of Muslim immigrants living in France, frustration that French officials fear could lead to the spread of terrorism here. **********There is nothing they fear more.  Bombs believed to have been planted by terrorists from Algeria killed several people in Paris and wounded hundreds in several cities around France last year, until the police gunned down the ringleaders. **********So some diplomats who know him well believe that Mr. Chirac was also trying on this trip to support people he sees as bulwarks against fundamentalism -- not only Yasir Arafat,  but also King Hussein of Jordan and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. **********And maybe also President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, whom Mr. Chirac, then the Prime Minister, welcomed to Paris in 1975 as ''my personal friend.'' Mr. Chirac's conservative Government, and subsequent Socialist ones, sold enough arms to Baghdad to make France its biggest foreign creditor. **********In 1981 Israeli planes bombed a French-supplied nuclear reactor that the Iraqis were apparently planning to use to make atomic bombs, and in 1991 France sided with the United States and its allies in the Persian Gulf war to get Iraq out of Kuwait. **********But Mr. Chirac did not support the American missile strikes on Iraq early last month, and in Jordan on Thursday he appealed to the United Nations to lift a ban on limited oil sales to let Iraq to pay for food and medicine for its suffering population. **********The United Nations was about to let Iraq sell $2 billion worth of oil for this purpose in September, but held up the sale after Iraq moved forces into Iraqi Kurdish territory and set off the American military reaction. It is probably not coincidental that two French oil companies, Elf and Total, are expected to be the main foreign conduits for the Iraqi oil. **********Like de Gaulle, Mr. Chirac also has ambitions to lead Europe to a greater world role, and he consulted his European Union partners before undertaking this trip. But it was not ''Europe'' trying to get its foot in the negotiating door in Israel and Syria so much as France, which has found little support outside the Arab world in calling for a European negotiator to help the United States put some steam back into the peace effort. **********''The conditions aren't there yet,'' Sir Leon Brittan, vice president of the European Union's executive Commission, said on Thursday of the prospects for a more visible European role. ''If we manage to work together and we abstain from any independent actions, then we will have the ability to work with the United States in this region.'' **********Though French officials insisted that Mr. Chirac's suggestions were aimed at complementing American  policy in the Middle East, not competing with it, American officials accepted that claim with increasingly tight smiles. **********''I salute the U.S. role, but I see the peace process running short of breath because of the loss of trust,'' Mr. Chirac said. ''I see the European and French role in building more trust.'' **********He was careful to stress that he saw Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel as a ''friend.''

Wei Shanshan, Mr. Wei's sister, who lives in Hamburg, Germany, has told  rights organizations that Mr. Wei, who is suffering from heart trouble,  is in a cell where the lights are on 24 hours a day with six inmates whose role seems to be to taunt Mr. Wei. **********''I believe the Chinese are very good at slow torture to break somebody down in a way that eventually makes a person either useless or kills them,'' Robert L.

It just doesn't seem fair. **********We advise people to purchase tickets as soon as possible when they know they are going to be traveling,\" said Steve Loucks, a spokesman for the American Society of Travel Agents, because of the discounts awarded for advance purchases. \"But you may see your fare drop after you buy your ticket. So you're  damned if you do and damned if you don't.\" **********Maybe not. Although some tickets cannot be refunded or exchanged, a nonrefundable ticket, the type most often sold by airlines, can be exchanged for travel at a later date, a credit voucher or a ticket at a lower fare. **********\"I think people are surprised to find out that they can get a refund or exchange on a nonrefundable ticket,\" said Lee Gemlich, a reservations analyst at Northwest Airlines. Nonrefundable simply means you cannot get your money back if you decide not to travel. **********At Northwest, travelers can choose to take a credit that can be applied to the purchase of another ticket. There is no charge for that service. **********They can also exchange the ticket and pocket the savings. The big hitch is that the savings must be substantial to make this effort worthwhile, since Nothwest charges a $50 administrative fee for any change on a nonrefundable ticket. **********Many airlines do not permit credits and charge $50 for any exchange, meaning  the fare has to be much lower to bother. Todd Clay, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines, said, \"There are time and resources utilized in changing the ticket, so we have to charge for it.\" **********Another way for fliers to fight back is to buy the price-guarantee programs that some travel agencies have begun to offer. All About Travel, in Kansas City, Mo., added the Worry Free Price Guarantee about a year ago, and said that almost all its clients now used the service. After a ticket is bought, the agency's computer continues to search for a better fare until the day of the flight. The  guarantee costs $10 a person or $20 a family, and if the fare drops, the customer receives a refund of the difference, minus any airline administrative fee. **********\"We feel that this is a much better gamble for the customer,\" said Kathy Sudeikis, a vice president at All About Travel, which has annual revenue of $25 million. \"If a crazy fare war breaks out, we will get you on the flight with the lower fare.\" **********Some tickets cannot be exchanged or applied to future travel. These tickets do not have a specific name, but are often issued in conjunction with special sales. They usually must be bought at the time of booking. **********With any advertised sale, travelers need to act quickly if they want to buy a new ticket or exchange an old one, because few discount seats may be available on the flights desired. And with oil prices rising in the last couple of weeks,  airlines are expected to limit their discounted seats while their profits are under pressure."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/19/business/worldbusiness/IHT-peugeot-feels-pinch-of-strong-franc-earnings-fall.html": {"writer_name": "Max Berley", "pub_date": "1996-04-19", "snippet": "Price wars, currency devaluations and an enduring recession drove profit down 45 percent at PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn SA last year, Europe's third-largest carmaker reported Thursday..

Its operating margin shrank to 2.3 percent of sales from 4.4 percent, while debt jumped nearly 30 percent. **********The company said it would cut its dividend to 5 francs a share from 6 francs, and Peugeot's shares fell 14 francs, or 1.9 percent, to 731. **********\"The drop in earnings wasn't a surprise, but the cut in dividend was a message to the market that 1996 won't be great,\" Gerard Ewenczyk, an analyst at SAFE, a Paris brokerage concern, told Bloomberg Business News. **********Peugeot's chairman, Jacques Calvet, described the results as \"disappointing, given expectations and the effort made by the staff.\" **********Peugeot, which also makes Citro\u00ebn vehicles and does most of its business in Europe, with 37.5 percent of it in France, had a declining share of a European market that itself showed sluggish growth over the past year. **********In the year ended in March, new-car registrations in Europe grew 3.1 percent, but Peugeot's market share in Europe dropped to 12 percent from 12.8 percent. **********Mr. Calvet said part of the problem was the French franc's strength against other European currencies, as \"competitive devaluations\" by other governments eroded the carmaker's earnings. **********Peugeot's consolidated sales were fairly stable, at 164.2 billion francs, compared with 166.2 billion francs in 1994, but its operating profit was cut nearly in half, to 3.75 billion francs from 7.29 billion francs, partly because of the strength of the franc. As a case in point, he said Italy's currency lost 6 percent of its value in 1995, making it possible for French shoppers to buy a Peugeot in Italy for far less than its French price. **********While Peugeot raised prices an average of 4.1 percent in France in 1995, the company said, it had to reduce prices in Italy, Spain and Britain to compete with carmakers in those countries benefiting from the weakness of their currencies. Currency fluctuations alone, Mr. Calvet said, cost Peugeot 1.3 billion francs in 1995. **********The carmaker's results also suffered from strikes that crippled transportation in France in November and December, paralyzing its distribution of new automobiles to dealers and keeping nervous consumers from investing in expensive items such as cars. **********Mr. Calvet predicted only tepid growth for 1996. **********In Europe, he said the company was counting on no more than 3 percent growth in car sales. He said Peugeot would try to offset Europe's sluggishness by expanding operations in South America and Central Europe and was continuing to study the North American market. Peugeot, he said, hoped to get 25 percent of its sales from outside Europe by 2000, compared with 12.2 percent now. **********James Rosenstein, a spokesman for the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, said European carmakers, including Peugeot, were making the best of a bad situation. **********\"Europe is a mature market,\" he said. \"Most purchases are renewal purchases, the population is getting older, and there are fewer new car buyers.

Since emerging in 1982 from prison, where he was held for 15 years, he has sent 104 petitions to the Chinese leadership seeking rehabilitation, but it has never come. **********In the minds of current party leaders, Mr. Wang, one of the last surviving leaders of the Cultural Revolution, personifies some of the most violent excesses of the onset of China's most tumultuous political upheaval since Mao's  Communists took power in Beijing in 1949. **********Though he regards himself as a scapegoat for much of the chaos that Mao loosed from 1966 to 1976, he continues to praise the party that has shunned him  for nearly 30 years. **********He also praises Mao, who he says was a misunderstood visionary who wanted China to grow closer to the United States and to learn from American successes in agriculture and industry. **********\"I have no regrets about my actions,\" Mr. Wang said in the only interview with a foreign journalist he has given since his release from prison. \"I made mistakes. It was all right to make mistakes in those times, as long as you corrected them. **********\"But I became the scapegoat for the whole party. They said that I caused the  chaos throughout the country.\" **********Prison, he said, \"was the most painful period for me.\" **********\"I was not allowed to use pen and paper until 1980,\" he said. **********Like an old ghost from a bygone era, Mr. Wang seems weighted down by the chains he forged in life. The party has yet to forgive him, even though he asserts that luminaries like Deng Xiaoping, the country's paramount leader, and  Wang Guangmei, the widow of former President Liu Shaoqi, have had nothing but good things to say about him. Liu and Deng were purged as China's two leading \"capitalist roaders\" during the Cultural Revolution. **********But perhaps because Mr. Wang and his comrades incited so much violence by their calls to \"bombard the headquarters\" -- attack party leaders -- on Mao's behalf, some revolutionary elders who survived those years are unable to forget. **********\"Wang Li is a classic scapegoat of the extremism of the early Cultural Revolution,\" said Geremie R. Barme, a China scholar at the Australian National University. \"This is not to say that he was not a willing participant and an opportunist, but you have to remember that Wang Li and people like him were empowered by full sessions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, including Deng Xiaoping and others. **********\"We know that Wang Li was persecuted for crimes against numerous leaders, but we also know that lurking behind his excesses were instructions from Mao and Zhou Enlai, and these may surface if the party archives are ever opened.\" **********For now, the party leaders feel \"there is no need to rehabilitate him,\" Mr. Barme said, adding that Mr. Wang \"can safely be blamed\" for the \"war crimes\" of  the Cultural Revolution. **********In 1966, as a propagandist drafted by Mao from the Communist Party's Red Flag magazine, Mr. Wang rose to become a member of the Leading Group of the Cultural  Revolution, a body at times more powerful than the party's Politburo. **********To be known as a leader of the May 16th Brigade, as Mr. Wang was, inspired fear and awe among the millions of Red Guards roaming the country. It was a time when all of China seemed riveted on the unfolding events of the Cultural Revolution. **********To Westerners, these episodes, if they were ever understood, have dimmed from memory, but for someone who was at the epicenter of history with Mao, they burn  as if they occurred yesterday. **********\"I worked side by side with Mao Zedong for 10 years,\" from 1957 to 1967, \"and Deng Xiaoping was there during that time, too,\" said Mr. Wang, as the wisps of his white hair caught the morning sunlight that splashed across his wooden desk  littered with writings, calligraphy brushes and his pain. **********\"He was not a god,\" Mr. Wang said of Mao. \"He was just an ordinary man and he made mistakes, and he had a bad temper sometimes.\" **********The chaos of the Cultural Revolution included riots and mass rallies at which leaders, university presidents, teachers and literary figures were hauled out for political \"struggle\" that often turned into beatings and torture. **********Countless thousands were killed or hounded into suicide, while museums, libraries and priceless cultural relics were sacked or destroyed. **********On Aug. 22, 1967, at the height of the violence, mobs of Red Guards set ablaze the British Chancery building in Beijing with gasoline bombs and then beat the fleeing diplomats. **********Some of China's most revered leaders, like President Liu and Marshal Chen Yi, then the Foreign Minister, were thrown into prisons where they languished without medical attention and later died. **********Mr. Wang, who delivered a fiery speech at the Foreign Ministry on Aug. 7, 1967, was blamed for inciting the violent takeover of the ministry building that month and the rampage of Red Guards through foreign embassy areas. **********Today, Mr. Wang denies taking part in any of the violence at the ministry, but he admits that his speech was \"somewhat excessive at certain points,\" and thus may have incited the violence. He adds that Mao read his speech in advance. **********\"I was one of the initiators of the so-called theory to 'continue the revolution under the proletarian dictatorship,' \" Mr. Wang said. This call to unceasing class struggle was the call to anarchy that became the party's \"basic  line,\" which Mao exploited to purge his rivals from the party. **********In that first year of the Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1967, Mr. Wang said, \"I took part in almost all of the drafting of important decisions, circulars and commentaries from the party's Central Committee.\" **********\"Most of them, in today's point of view, are wrong,\" he continued, \"and although I did these things according to Mao Zedong's instructions, I, as a writer of these documents, had major responsibilities for the mistakes.\" **********Mr. Wang's meeting with a foreign reporter was arranged at the third-floor walk-up apartment that the Communist Party has assigned to him and his wife, Wang Bingquan. **********Seated in his unheated study, where he has written his memoirs, he seemed a pale reflection of the firebrand who in July 1967 stood atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace overlooking a rally of one million Red Guards in Tiananmen Square as he was declared the \"hero\" who had stood up for Mao during the bloody confrontation in the central city of Wuhan earlier that month. **********In Wuhan, competing revolutionary bands had declared war on each other, and hundreds died in the skirmishing. Mr. Wang himself was taken hostage by a band of 200 partisans armed with guns, knives and spears. **********\"Both of my legs were broken,\" he says. Mao was forced to flee the city, and  Mr. Wang only escaped with the help of Zhou Enlai, the Prime Minister. **********Mr. Wang sighed and chuckled as he remembered that \"triumphant\" return to Beijing. Mao's wife, Jiang Qing -- the top leader of the Cultural Revolution after Mao himself -- escorted him to the parapet of power overlooking Tiananmen  Square. **********\"She told me, 'This whole show is not for you.' \" In fact, Mr. Wang said, she added: \"I don't care if you had been beaten to death in Wuhan. This show is for  Mao, for his reputation.\" **********Raising his delicate hands from the arms of his chair, Mr. Wang said, \"That was when I was raised up to heaven, and it was not long before I was plunged into hell.\" **********Referring to his arrest and imprisonment a month later for the excesses at the Foreign Ministry and the attack on the British Embassy, he said, \"I realized then that I would have a short political life and, as the brightest star of China, I would soon disappear.\" **********Never charged with specific crimes, the imprisoned Mr. Wang took a sizable share of the blame for inciting much of the violence of 1967. **********If Mr. Wang wished he could rewrite any chapter in history, it would be the long estrangement between China and the United States. **********And the greatest lesson of the Cultural Revolution, he said, was the abuse of power. \"There should be the means to control personal power,\" he said, \"to prevent any individual from abusing power and from making great mistakes.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/18/business/company-news-voice-control-systems-agrees-to-buy-voice-processing.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-06-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;VOICE CONTROL SYSTEMS AGREES TO BUY VOICE PROCESSING", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;VOICE CONTROL SYSTEMS AGREES TO BUY VOICE PROCESSING", "body_text": " **********Voice Control Systems Inc. agreed yesterday to buy the Voice Processing Corporation, a developer of speech-recognition computer technology, for more than $40 million.

The car's right headlight is gone, and the alignment is so bad the car seems to ski down the streets, trailing a spume of black smoke. **********There are two children now, who get by on the same amount of milk one used to drink, diluted to go twice as far. Last Christmas, Mr. Sandoval, a graduate of Venezuela's most prestigious university, could only afford to buy a single toy for the two of them. There is three months' rent due at the end of the week, and this one-time paragon of the prosperous middle class has become desperate. **********\"We're living hand to mouth,\" Mr. Sandoval said. **********At a time when the rest of South America is paring down public spending and opening up markets in the quest for foreign investment, Venezuela stands as a peculiarly enduring throwback to an age of excessive government economic intervention, and a reminder of its perils. **********This Caribbean country of 24 million people, blessed with the world's largest oil reserves outside the Persian Gulf, last year became the largest foreign supplier of oil to the United States. But its economy is in a shambles and its public payroll so bloated that hospitals cannot afford to buy medicine or equipment, while the Government remains unable -- or unwilling -- to trim its work force. **********The country is entering its fourth year of recession, and the inflation rate, at 54 percent last year, is the highest in South America. Venezuela's middle class, once accustomed to shopping sprees in Miami, has been reduced to near-poverty. **********\"The middle class is disappearing,\" said Andres Serbin, president of the Venezuelan Institute for Social and Political Studies, a private research institute. \"Now you have a clear polarization between the people who have and the people who don't have.\" **********Juan Carlos Navarro, coordinator of the Center for Public Policy at the Institute for Advanced Administrative Studies, agreed. \"People feel that every day they're getting poorer, and they're right,\" he said. **********At the start of the 1990's, Venezuela appeared to be well on its way toward the free-market economic reforms that other parts of Latin America have since embraced. But austerity measures that were endured elsewhere in the continent proved too difficult an adjustment for Venezuelans who, thanks to a $10-billion-a-year cushion of oil revenues, had grown accustomed to government largess. **********The backlash against the free-market reforms instituted by Carlos Andres Perez, who was then President, included looting and two attempted military coups in 1992. Although the coups failed, they proved fatal to the economic policies and to the presidency of Mr. Perez, who was impeached in 1993 and charged with stealing $17 million in public funds. He remains under house arrest. **********As the country awaited Mr. Perez's reaction to the second 1992 coup attempt in a televised message from Congress, Rafael Caldera, a former president, unexpectedly took the microphone to voice understanding for the frustrations of  the military men who led the coup attempts. **********Swept back into the presidency by a mass yearning for less corrupt, more generous past, Mr. Caldera pledged to restore the kind of state-financed populism that had marked his administration in the 1970's, but he did not address the country's ability to finance such grand promises in the economy of the 1990's **********His measures have failed to check Venezuela's economic slide. **********According to a recent report by Data Information Resources to the Venezuelan-American Chamber of Commerce, in the last 25 years the share of household income spent on food has shot up to 72 percent, from 28 percent. The middle class has shrunk by a third. An estimated 53 percent of jobs are now classified as \"informal\" -- in the underground economy -- as compared with 33 percent in the late 1970's. **********Economists complain that the country has functioned under Mr. Caldera without a coherent and consistent economic program, relying instead on emergency measures. The latest is a plan to compensate working people for rising prices with a system of modified indexation, which will raise wages every few months to help keep up with inflation. In Brazil, this approach led from double- to triple-digit inflation before it was abandoned in 1994. **********The country is struggling back from a banking crisis that was five times the  size of the savings and loan collapse in the United States, in terms of the percentage of gross national product. No sooner had Venezuela won plaudits for coming through the banking debacle, however, than it had to confront a scandal involving the system of severance payments for public employees, in which billions of dollars contributed to the system have disappeared. **********That is one reason the Government has not concentrated on trimming the public sector, although Labor Minister Juan N. Carrido, and most analysts of Venezuela, agree the need is strong. **********\"The question of where you're going to get the money for severance payments is relevant only if you do the layoffs,\" said Fernando Egana, the Government spokesman. \"Reduction of the public sector,\" he added pointedly, \"is very much related to the growth of the private sector.\" **********Although Mr. Caldera came into office denouncing the austerity measures that  were imposed by Mr. Perez (partly to conform with directives from the International Monetary Fund), his own administration has been negotiating for a  $3 billion loan from the I.M.F. since last year. Economists here say Venezuela does not need the money as much as it needs the credibility that such a loan would convey. The country has also been negotiating a second loan of undisclosed size to ease the social impact of any hardships imposed by an I.M.F. agreement. **********Politically, President Caldera's reputation for personal honesty has brought  the Government some measure of credibility, and pulling back from the austerity measures of his predecessor has helped build stability. A slew of state and local elected offices, created over the last half-dozen years, have also provided the country with a fresh crop of potential national leaders, like  the highly popular Irene Saez, a former Miss Universe recently re-elected mayor  of Chacao, a neighborhood in Caracas. **********Another promising sign was the opening last month of the oil sector to private investment -- by the same President who nationalized it 20 years earlier. Industry executives flocked to Caracas to bid on exploration rights in  10 regions, using a formula that guarantees Venezuela at least 85 percent of the profits. But Juan Szabo, who put together the opening, said it would probably be three to four years before the country sees any revenues from privatization. **********\"I don't think Venezuela's problem is really one of income,\" said Mr. Szabo.  \"It's getting the housekeeping done and getting the economic process in line.\" **********Paradoxically, some here feel the oil revenues will only delay the day of reckoning for President Caldera, putting off further the tough decisions he has  been avoiding. The trouble, they say, is that while oil revenues give the President a reprieve, the money is never used \"to accumulate capital and develop social programs that are not politically motivated,\" said Mr. Serbin, of the Institute for Social and Political Studies. **********As Monsignor Baltazar Porros, vice president of Venezuela's Episcopal Confederation, prepares for the arrival of Pope John Paul II, he says the crisis Venezuelans are encountering is as much emotional and spiritual as economic. **********The 1950's to 1980's, he said, were marked by \"a kind of looting of the oil wealth, so young people have never lived in hard times.\" The loss of prosperity  is more shattering than never having known it at all, he said. \"Now, we see that our lives are the same as in any other country in Latin America.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/27/business/quaker-plant-for-atlanta.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 72, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Quaker Plant for Atlanta", "print_headline": "Quaker Plant for Atlanta", "body_text": " **********The Quaker Oats Company will spend about $50 million to build a new beverage  plant and distribution center near Atlanta, the company said today.

Despite the upstart brand's growing sales, the brothers lost control of their baby to venture capitalists and a hotshot professional manager who they say didn't even  return their phone calls. **********Then, this March, H. J. Heinz, the Pittsburgh food-processing giant, bought  the company, Earth's Best, for about $30 million. While it promises to stick to  the founders' principle of purity, it made no written guarantees when the deal was done. What is more, Heinz is considering a move to capitalize on the Earth's Best reputation for quality by attaching its new company's name to everything from pacifiers to soups for grown-ups. And all this from a company whose main brand of baby food has been knocked by one influential consumer group as being \"nutritionally inferior.\" **********The brothers wish they had been able to hold onto their company. Still, they  realize that Heinz can do big things for the brand name they nursed for so long. \"My brother and I got into this because we wanted to see this food available to  children,\" Ron Koss said. **********The Kosses' inability to hold onto their company shows how easy it is for starry-eyed idealists to get waylaid by the earthy realities of American capitalism. All too frequently, beginning entrepreneurs learn an old truth the hard way: No matter how brilliant your concept, it probably won't succeed without marketing know-how and plenty of capital to get you through the bumpy ride of the early years. And the people with the money and the expertise they need -- venture capitalists and big corporations -- are forever on the prowl to  make cheap acquisitions of start-up companies with first-rate products and inexperienced managers. **********Ron and Arnie Koss certainly fit the mold of budding entrepreneurs with no money, a hot idea and only the vaguest notion of how to turn it into a marketable product. They got their brainstorm in the mid-1970's while working as clerks in natural-food stores in upstate New York. They noticed that in the cornucopia of health merchandise for adults there was nary a spoonful of organic anything for babies. **********It wasn't just that they had found an opening for a niche product that big companies had overlooked. Both men felt drawn to the all-natural precepts of the environmental movement. Ron Koss, a vegetarian, remembers reading Rachel Carson's book, \"Silent Spring,\" which describes the dangers of pesticides to animals, and \"imagining that children would be especially sensitive to pesticides, just as the eggs of bald eagles were.\" **********\"I am an environmentalist,\" he added. \"I started Earth's Best because I have  a connection to this planet, and I have a love of nature.\" **********Even so, years passed before the brothers acted on their inspiration. Ron took a job managing a Ronald McDonald house for seriously ill children and their parents in Burlington, Vt. Arnie, who was more entrepreneurial, started a tiny company in the same town that produced handmade brooms in the style of old-time  Shaker communities. **********In 1984, the time seemed right to revive their long-dormant dream. Ron Koss's first son, Gabriel, had been born the previous year, giving the twins their first taste-tester. And, unbelievable to them, a decade after they began to talk about it, nobody else had yet hit hard on the notion of selling organic food to  parents. **********First, they had to find some start-up capital. Arnie sold his business, but that wasn't nearly enough. They hit pay dirt with Ray Pecor, a local businessman who now owns the minor league Vermont Expos baseball team. Mr. Pecor took an immediate liking to Arnie and signed a bank loan for $25,000. \"I was impressed with his enthusiasm and his work ethic,\" Mr. Pecor says of the curly haired man  who appeared in his office in blue jeans. \"This was a love affair with a product for him, rather than a business venture.\" **********That initial cash infusion enabled the Kosses to do some nutritional and product research. But it wasn't enough to lease a factory, buy equipment, purchase organic fruits and vegetables and hire workers. So off they went, knocking on doors of banks and private investors. \"We looked like a couple of curly haired flakes\" and endured lots of rejections, Arnie Koss said. \"But we didn't go away.\" **********They managed to raise $1.3 million, enough to get them started. In December 1987, in a small concrete building on Pond Lane in Middlebury, Vt., with a view  of the Green Mountains, they watched the first jars of Earth's Best bump off the production line. **********\"They were filled with organic apple puree,\" Arnie Koss recalled proudly. **********That moment of glory was short-lived. Like millions of entrepreneurs before them, the Koss brothers soon discovered an unforgiving reality of the marketplace: making a great product is no guarantee that it sold at a profit. **********Within months, Earth's Best was out of money. The Kosses were forced to lay off the 60 workers they had just hired and began a desperate search for more financing. What went wrong? \"Baby food is capital-intensive,\" Arnie Koss explained. Perishable ingredients like blueberries and plums must be bought a year in advance, when they are in season, then frozen. Competition for grocery shelf space is so fierce that some stores charge for it. \"Large amounts of money disappear quickly,\" Mr. Koss said. **********The two partners finally raised an additional $300,000 but went through it quickly as they rehired laid-off workers, bought produce, built inventory and marketed their goods. But sales were zooming, from about $1.5 million in 1988 to about $3.5 million in 1989. **********Finally, in late 1989, they made the fateful decision to seek money from venture-capital firms. These firms specialize in buying equity interests in promising but troubled companies, turning them around and selling them at a big  profit. The brothers got a huge infusion of cash -- more than $6 million -- but  their success was bittersweet. The venture-capital industry is notorious for negotiating tough terms, and many entrepreneurs put off seeking their help as long as possible. But the Kosses were desperate, and in the end they made a huge sacrifice: to save Earth's Best, they gave up a controlling interest in it. **********\"My No. 1 priority was to protect the company and the employees of the company and not my own position,\" Arnie Koss said. \"Ron and I knew before we even raised a penny that we were getting into something that was so big that loss of control was a very high probability.\" **********The new majority stockholders included firms run by Gregory Peters, general partner of North Atlantic Venture Funds and the Venture Capital Fund, both of Burlington, and four other venture capital firms around the Northeast. And the Koss brothers were quick to realize that the price of their financial deliverance was more than just losing control. They were turning over a product  born of idealism to the number crunchers who viewed it as a commodity, not a way to help build a better world. **********\"At some level they believed in the product in terms of its value to society,\" Arnie Koss said of his new partners. But, he added, \"They were making  an investment because they thought there was a huge windfall to be made.\" **********Mr. Peters said the venture capitalists were attracted to Earth's Best in part because of its product. \"We saw a company committed to providing high-quality, healthy foods to infants,\" he said. He declined to comment on whether the venture capitalists were too obsessed with the bottom line. **********One of the first things the new owners demanded was that Arnie Koss step down as president of the money-losing company. \"It became a condition of the investment,\" Arnie Koss said. \"They just decided they wanted their own guy there.\" Both brothers stayed on until mid-1990 as executive vice presidents, then left for good. **********\"Those guys didn't have a clue who Ron and I were and what we were capable of,\" Arnie Koss said. \"Ron and I weren't cut out of the M.B.A. mold.\" **********An entrepreneur's loss of control over the company he or she created is a common tale in American capitalism. Bob Iverson, the founder of Kiwi International Airlines, was ousted as chief executive last year. In 1993, Kendall Square Research, a Boston maker of supercomputers, dismissed its founder, Henry Burkhardt 3d, and in the previous year the Compaq Computer Corporation eased out its founder, Joseph R. Canion. **********Some of the departing founders go down fighting and remain bitter; others prefer dignified exits. Usually, though, the business world concludes that the entrepreneurs have outlived their usefulness. In this case, even the Kosses' original backer, Mr. Pecor, approved the venture capitalists' decision. Arnie Koss \"didn't have the background to manage a millions-of-dollars-a-year business,\" he said. \"The next step needed professional management.\" **********Earth's Best went through two professional managers in two years, the first replacing Arnie and the second coming on board a few months after Arnie left. But the company was still losing money. Then, in November 1991, it hired Jay G.  Shoemaker, who had left Whitman's Chocolates as president after its sales were disappointing and had worked as a manager at General Mills Inc. Mr. Shoemaker, who received an M.B.A. degree at Harvard, makes no pretense that organic baby food has a special place in his heart. For him, business is all about selling; what he sells is secondary. \"I'm not really a product guy,\" he said. \"I don't really come in and say, 'I really love this product so I'm going to buy the business.' It has more to do with strategic opportunity.\" **********ARNIE KOSS has a low opinion of businessmen with such theories. \"They just had one thing on their mind, and that was how to make the most money in the shortest amount of time,\" he said. **********In the fiscal year of Mr. Shoemaker's arrival, Earth's Best had revenue of $8 million -- and losses of $7 million. Despite that huge deficit, there was a bright side: The company had survived four years in a competitive market that had mashed other organic baby foods made by later entries into the field. Mr. Shoemaker diagnosed Earth's Best's problem as poor management and figured he was just the man to turn it around. \"Anytime you can see a business that is succeeding despite itself, then obviously you can come in there and clean up the problems,\" he said. \"Then you're removing the impediments to real growth and to  real earnings.\" **********In January 1992, Mr. Shoemaker thought nothing of moving the company's headquarters from Middlebury, where it all started, to Boulder, Colo. In May, he shut down the Middlebury factory and laid off about 50 workers, farming out production to a California company. Then he turned to the investment arm of SunAmerica Inc., the large insurance and investment company based in Los Angeles, for a $5 million loan. **********The next year, SunAmerica invested another $1.8 million and eventually became the company's largest stockholder, followed by Orien Ventures, an Oregon venture capital firm. Together, they held majority control, with more than 200 other shareholders bringing up the rear. By then, the twins held only warrants to purchase stock that would in the end entitle them to only eight-tenths of 1 percent of the company they founded. **********Slowly but surely, Earth's Best pulled out of the doldrums. With so much money and management expertise behind it, it approached the black for the first  time in the 1995 fiscal year, earning $200,000 before interest payments on $23.8 million in sales. (It lost $800,000 after interest was deducted.) **********Enter H. J. Heinz. The $8 billion food behemoth had been eyeing Earth's Best  since 1988. In 1991, it toyed with the notion of making a bid to acquire it. But like many big corporations, it wanted to wait for the small company to prove it  was viable before striking. **********\"The reason we walked away from it back then is because we thought it could be a fad,\" said Al Banisch, senior product manager for infant feeding at Heinz U.S.A. Also, Heinz wasn't sure that it should be moving into the organic-food business, which by definition requires a steady supply of organic produce. In its early years, Earth's Best was plagued with shortages that resulted in the sudden disappearance and then reappearance of varieties from store shelves -- a  forgivable lapse for a small company but not for a household name like Heinz. **********Still, with sales of organic foods growing more than 20 percent a year recently, other big companies had already embraced health food. In 1989, the J.  M. Smucker Company acquired Santa Cruz Natural (now Santa Cruz Organic), a maker of organic fruit juices. The next year, Welch Foods Inc. bought a controlling interest in Cascadian Farms, which produces organic foods in jars and frozen form. **********LAST year, Heinz had a change of heart. It began in July when a senior executive, Brian Ruder, was named president of Heinz U.S.A.'s retail division, with responsibilities for both baby food and ketchup. Mr. Ruder had seen organic baby food in Europe while serving as a vice president in charge of developing Heinz's worldwide baby-food business. And his own brother, who lived in Boston,  fed his infant son Earth's Best instead of Heinz. **********Within two weeks of his promotion, Mr. Ruder called Mr. Shoemaker. Less than  eight months later, the two had worked out a deal for the sale of the company for around $30 million. Earth's Best's board, controlled by venture capitalists, quickly approved the transaction. **********The Koss brothers, their stake now reduced to less than 1 percent, got less than $300,000. **********Arnie Koss doesn't try to hide his disappointment about the way the agreement was consummated. \"Of course I would have preferred that Earth's Best had remained independent,\" he said. \"My opinion was not sought. I did call Jay Shoemaker and he did not return my call.\" Mr. Shoemaker, who was chief executive of Earth's Best at the time, says he doesn't recall getting the call. **********Mr. Ruder, the Heinz executive now in charge of Earth's Best, is already thinking about ways to exploit its name. He says he hopes to expand the Earth's  Best line to everything from adult foods like soups and sauces to, perhaps, accessories like pacifiers and baby bottles -- all \"made in an environmentally sensitive way.\" **********\"The Earth's Best trademark has become a Good Housekeeping seal of approval for organics,\" he said enthusiastically. \"We think there's very strong brand equity and it's extendable to other categories.\" **********But is there a danger that Heinz, in attaching the name to new products, will water down the brand's appeal? After all, one reason for the success of Earth's  Best was the homey image of two brothers stewing apples in Ron Koss's kitchen and taste-testing them on his six-month-old. The consuming public's perception of such dedication to quality contrasts sharply with its suspiciousness toward an industry with a checkered history of mass-producing baby food. **********In 1989, for example, back when Beech-Nut was owned by Nestle S.A., Niels L.  Hoyvald, Beech-Nut's former president, pleaded guilty to selling sugar water disguised as apple juice for babies. He was sentenced to six months of community service and five years' probation. Nestle sold the Beech-Nut brand to Ralston Purina in late 1989. More recently, Nestle pulled its Libby's Juicy Juice apple  juice out of warehouses because of concerns that what it thought was pure apple  concentrate imported from European suppliers was in fact spiked with high-fructose syrup. **********Heinz's record is free of such scandals. But when making its own baby food, Heinz does allow the traces of pesticides commonly found in nonorganic fruits and vegetables, as do the two other major brands, Gerber and Beech-Nut. (As the  companies point out, the levels of the chemicals that show up in the final product are far below those that the Food and Drug Administration deems unsafe.) **********Also, a 1995 report by the Center for Science in the Public Interest criticized both Heinz and Gerber for adding water and fillers to its little jars of fruits and vegetables. \"Not only are those products a monetary rip-off, they  are also nutritionally inferior to similar products made without fillers,\" said  the report, \"Cheating Babies, Nutritional Quality and Cost of Commercial Baby Food.\" **********\"When I heard about their purchase of Earth's Best, I thought, 'Isn't it interesting: The company that makes the worst variety of baby food is buying the company that makes among the best baby foods,\" said Michael F. Jacobson, one of  the report's authors, referring to a banana-tapioca product. Heinz responds that what the center calls fillers is actually food. Deborah S. Magness, a Heinz spokeswoman, called its accusations \"false\" and \"misleading.\" The tapioca in the criticized bananas-and-tapioca mixture is food that babies like, she said. \"We stand behind that particular variety, as well as all our varieties,\" she said. **********Elaine Lipson, a spokeswoman for Mothers and Others for a Livable Planet, a New York City group that focuses on the purity of baby food and other products,  said she was concerned by all the takeovers of little companies like Earth's Best by large corporations. \"We're not sure what will happen. Earth's Best has been a wonderful company,\" she said. But, she added, if the buyouts result in wider availability of organic foods, \"that's a plus.\" **********EARTH'S BEST, of course, isn't about to monopolize the attention of top Heinz executives. Its $30 million in annual sales are less than one-half of one percent of Heinz's revenues, small potatoes compared with the $240 million in annual retail sales of Heinz ketchup -- the company's top-selling single product -- in America alone. Even dog food and cat food accounts for more; products like 9-Lives and Kibbles 'n Bits fetch more than $1 billion in annual sales. **********Heinz's worldwide stable of baby food brings nearly $1 billion in sales annually -- an amount equal to the entire United States market. Its Heinz brand  retails for about 27 cents less than Earth's Best, at 32 cents versus 59 cents for a 4-ounce jar at many groceries. Organically grown fruits and vegetables cost more, and 100 percent fruit is more expensive than fruit cut with sweeteners or tapioca. **********So is there a danger that Heinz will adulterate Earth's Best products with unnatural ingredients? After all, it made no written commitment to keep them 100 percent organic or to refrain from adding sugar, salt or refined starches when it bought the company. **********No Federal regulations define \"organic,\" although 11 states have standards and the United States Department of Agriculture is developing national guidelines. The department is debating whether to allow the use of certain synthetic chemicals in food processing or as pesticides, said Harold Ricker, program manager of the department's national organic program. **********So why not tamper a bit with Earth's Best if it lowers the cost? **********Mr. Ruder says that just won't happen. \"Are we going to bastardize it?\" he asks. \"The answer is 'no' -- unequivocally.It's not something you play around   with. When we bought into the company, we bought into the concept of the company.\" **********No matter how the company feels about organic food, retaining the Earth's Best purity makes marketing sense, he added. After all, it carries a higher price tag and complements the cheaper, mainstream Heinz baby foods, he said. **********\"It's what we call the bookbinder approach,\" Mr. Banisch, the Heinz product manager, explained. Increased sales for Earth's Best would likely come at the expense of more costly competitors or from parents switching from homemade food, Heinz executives say. **********Indeed, Heinz values the Earth's Best name so much that it has decided to keep its corporate logo off the company's products lest it dilute their upscale  image. **********That doesn't prevent it from manufacturing the organic food at its sprawling  complex across the Allegheny River from downtown Pittsburgh, where it has been making some Earth's Best products under contract since fall 1994. It plans to move most production into the plant by next month. Inside, stainless steel pipes curl 2,600 feet in the main cooking area and the contents of 1,000-gallon tanks  are monitored by computer. Going full speed, Heinz figures it could crank out enough Earth's Best food in 20 days to meet a year's demand. **********What do the Koss brothers make of all this? While they feel mistreated by the venture capitalists, they have no complaints with Heinz, figuring it is in that  company's interest to protect Earth's Best's integrity. **********Indeed, Heinz is taking steps to maintain the products' standards. It is paying an outside quality-control organization to monitor suppliers' compliance  to organic-farming specifications. And it has added several Earth's Best executives to its payroll or taken them on as consultants. One of these is Marty Illick, who stirs up new Earth's Best varieties in the kitchen of her pre-Civil  War home in Charlotte, Vt., then taste-tests them at the walnut table that was a wedding present to her grandmother. **********\"They're a little perplexed as to how you can make baby food in your house,\"  Ms. Illick said of her new bosses. \"You're talking about two different cultures.\" **********Arnie now lives in Hawaii and Ron in Washington state. They have started a new company, Great Circles Inc., to develop environmentally responsible food and agricultural products. They do not plan to make baby food. **********The brothers say they wish Heinz well and hope the big company can make the baby food more widely available. \"I pray for it,\" Ron Koss said of the company he started. \"I pray that they understand Earth's Best and that they take care of it as I think a parent would want their child to be taken care of.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/23/world/pope-is-showing-stamina-on-his-french-visit.html": {"writer_name": "Celestine Bohlen", "pub_date": "1996-09-23", "snippet": "Pope John Paul II winds up trip to France that was test of his health and his popular appeal; many are surprised by his stamina despite busy schedule; major anti-Pope demonstration held in Paris, sponsored by leftist and anti-clerical groups, draw...", "word_count": 463, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pope Is Showing Stamina on His French Visit", "print_headline": "Pope Is Showing Stamina on His French Visit", "body_text": " **********Winding up a trip that was a test of his health and his popular appeal, Pope John Paul II showed today that he still has the stamina to meet the demands of his flock. **********Before a crowd of more than 200,000 people, the Pope celebrated an open-air Mass commemorating the 1,500th anniversary of the baptism of Clovis, a fifth-century Frankish king.

Get  the precise address, or URL (uniform resource locator), and go directly to the World Wide Web site you want. **********Without the Internet address, the chances of getting lost in cyberspace are high indeed. Today's guides are Web sites like Yahoo, Infoseek and Alta Vista, which are Internet directories or catalogues, and they are crude tools at best.  Tap in a key word or two for an Internet search and the result is often hundreds of Web sites, most of them useless, ranked in no apparent order. **********And the fact that search sites, like Yahoo and Infoseek, are among the most  heavily trafficked locales on the Web suggests what people spend much of their time doing on the Internet -- searching, half blind, for something worthwhile. **********The latest entry in the quest for a better search engine is Hotbot, which went up on the Web last night (http://www.hotbot.com). The new search tool is the result of a collaboration between Hotwired, the Internet arm of Wired magazine, and a start-up company, the Inktomi Corporation. Hotwired is contributing design skills, user research and marketing, while Inktomi is supplying the technology. **********Named after a mythological spider of the Indian tribes of the Great Plains, Inktomi was founded by an assistant professor of computer science at the University of California at Berkeley, Eric Brewer, and a former graduate student, Paul Gauthier. They were in the news last fall for warning of security flaws in Netscape's browser program. But yesterday, they had to delay the release of Hotbot until the evening hours for some last-minute tightening of security in their search site. **********Inktomi claims to bring innovative technology, called hive computing, to the  search-engine market. The idea is to link several work stations into a network,  and have each machine work on part of a problem. Inktomi researchers say the result is a system that can mimic a supercomputer, at a fraction of the cost and can be easily scaled up to keep pace with the explosive growth of the Web. **********Thus, Inktomi says it can search the entire Web, more than 50 million pages,  while other search engines can handle only about 25 million. **********Still, people are far less likely to complain of a shortage of information on the Web than to lament that what they find there is of little interest -- personal home pages, company billboards and so on. **********To address the problem, Hotbot enables users to tailor their inquiries not only by several words in categories like \"must include\" or \"should include,\" but also by date of the site posting, domain groups like .edu and .com and other characteristics. **********It is these search innovations that most impress industry analysts who have sampled test versions of Hotbot. \"In the future, search engines are going to succeed or fail because of usefulness and usability,\" said Greg Wester, director of Internet research at the Yankee Group in Boston. \"And Hotbot seems to have some nice features for refining searches.\" **********Yet analysts also agree that Hotbot and the other search tools still have a long way to go. They speak of searching software with \"semantic intelligence\" or \"intelligent agent\" features that will someday hone inquiries according to word  relationships as well as personal preferences and interests. \"The next step is to bring really relevant materials to individuals instead of having to spend a lot of time wading though pages you don't want,\" said Torrey Byles, an analyst for Giga Information Group, a research company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/17/business/fleet-chairman-to-resign-in-wake-of-banks-merger.html": {"writer_name": "Saul Hansell", "pub_date": "1996-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 369, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fleet Chairman to Resign In Wake of Banks' Merger", "print_headline": "Fleet Chairman to Resign In Wake of Banks' Merger", "body_text": " **********Joel A.

As a follow-up to the official bailout of private holders of Mexican debt in 1995, finance ministers and central bank governors suggested changes in contract terms that would make it possible for sovereign borrowers to suspend debt payments \"in certain exceptional cases\" to resolve a financial crisis. **********As international bonds are typically bearer instruments, which do not entail identification of the holder, the officials recommended that contracts provide for collective representation of debtholders in the event of a crisis and that qualified majority voting replace the now standard unanimous vote needed to alter contract conditions. **********It is this very difficulty in identifying holders of bearer paper and the improbability of ever getting unanimous agreement that enabled bondholders to emerge unscathed from the debt crisis of the early 1980s that savaged international banks. But in emerging from that crisis, developing countries have transformed the bulk of their debt into bonds, making it virtually certain that any future payments crisis will require the approval of bondholders. **********As the April recommendation from the Group of Ten stated, the \"evolution of contractual arrangements between sovereign borrowers and their creditors needs to be a market-led process.\" **********But the International Primary Market Association, the organization represent- **********ing banks that arrange and underwrite new issues and oversee the contract language, says its members oppose any change in wording that would enhance the possibility of a borrower defaulting. The association's chairman, Jean-Pierre Wellens of Banque Bruxelles Lambert, said in an interview that adding such contract language could only \"destabilize what is now a flourishing market.\" **********In the first three-quarters of this year, borrowers from developing countries sold a record $65 billion of international bonds. In a low-inflation environment where high-grade medium-term government and corporate debt yields barely more than 6 percent, investors striving to maximize income have lowered risk standards in return for coupon payments that are several percentage points above benchmark rates. **********For example, the Russian issue, expected to be as large as $500 million and with a maturity possibly as long as five years, is expected to pay about 400 basis points, or four percentage points, more than comparably dated U.S. government notes. Russia last week was rated Ba-2 by Moody's, two levels below investment grade, and BB-minus by Standard & Poor's, three rungs below investment grade, but both ratings were higher than many had expected. **********After the central government, the Moscow municipality is also expected to come to the market for as much as $300 million, then St. Petersburg. Other expected new borrowers include Pakistan and Croatia. **********Mr. Wellens said underwriters agreed that requiring unanimous consent to modify a contract was unrealistic and that no single investor should have the power to block a renegotiation of terms. But he said bankers were unable to agree on what amount should constitute the qualified majority sought by the Group of Ten. **********Summarizing the bankers' view concerning an allowance for renegotiation, Mr. Wellens said: **********\"We believe that when a borrower signs a contract, he commits himself to repay the full amount. We believe we shouldn't introduce a major weakness into a flourishing market.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/13/world/japanese-troops-in-golan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 81, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japanese Troops in Golan", "print_headline": "Japanese Troops in Golan", "body_text": " **********The first Japanese troops to serve in a full peacekeeping role formally joined United Nations forces in the Golan Heights today. **********The 45 armed Japanese newcomers arrived at this camp, 35 miles west of Damascus, to join the troops serving as a buffer between Israeli and Syrian troops since 1974. **********The Japanese will serve in a logistics unit within the 1,040-member force. **********The Japanese soldiers will replace a Canadian unit that is completing its mission this month."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/26/business/unit-of-bat-plans-to-sell-6-cigarette-lines.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 305, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Unit of B.A.T.

I've spent all my money just to keep it going.\" **********The stripped-down car, with a Fiat engine, was once the pride of Yugoslavia. The huge Zastava Yugo Automobile plant in Kragujevac rolled out 200,000 vehicles a year beforecivil war broke out five years ago. The cars, which cost about $5,000, were exported to other Eastern European countries and the United States. **********But the plight of Zastava, where production has fallen to 3,500 cars in the first six months of this year, is indicative of the deep economic and political  crisis brewing in Yugoslavia, which now comprises only two republics, Serbia and Montenegro. **********The break-up of Yugoslavia in 1991 destroyed its industrial sector as large manufacturing centers in Serbia were cut off from their suppliers and outlets. International sanctions imposed because of Belgrade's support for the Bosnian Serbs, together with the refusal by the Government to relinquish its grip on state industries, contributed to the withering of manufacturing. (The sanctions, imposed in June 1992, were lifted in January of this year.) **********The central bank's hard currency is almost gone, bringing enormous pressure on the Yugoslav Government to print more money to pay salaries and keep businesses open, but so far officials have resisted increasing the money supply. Once that begins, economists say, the days of hyperinflation are not far away. **********If things do not improve soon -- and there are few signs they will -- the president of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, could face \"serious political unrest within six to nine months,\" according to United States intelligence reports. Union leaders, who led a series of strikes this spring, have given the Yugoslav  Government until September to raise salaries and create new jobs, or face renewed nationwide protests. **********As many people in Belgrade remind visitors, the war in the former Yugoslavia  was as much about the control of diminishing resources, jobs and industries as about nationalist ideologies peddled to whip up popular support. **********An economic disaster here could spell real trouble in flash points like the Kosovo region, where ethnic Albanians, who make up more than 90 percent of the population, are under the thumb of repressive Serbian police and officials sent  from Belgrade. **********\"Foreign companies come in here, take one look at what is going on and pack up and leave,\" a Western diplomat said. \"We don't even bring in trade delegations now; it's no use.\" **********Dragoslav Avramovic recently lost his job as governor of the central bank after criticizing the Government for economic mismanagement and its failure to reform the economy -- a failure that has seen Yugoslavia shunned by every major  international lending institution. Mr. Avramovic, 76, a former World Bank official, now warns that catastrophe looms. **********\"The Government has two ways left to manage the deficit,\" he said. \"Either print more money or stop paying the bills. I am not sure which is worse. The Government has stopped, for now, paying its bills, but we are running into trouble. The Government does not generate any savings. It is barely able to pay  pensions.\" **********The country's infrastructure is crumbling: Belgrade's bus fleet is down to 750, from 900, because of the need to cannibalize vehicles for spare parts. There are increasing power failures. The rail system, with 50 engines that are more than five decades old running on hundreds of miles of poorly kept track, can no longer haul products reliably. The water system works sporadically. **********Salaries are paid months late, if at all. The average wage, rural or urban, is about $100 a month, a drop of 80 percent in the last decade. **********\"I earn $140 dollars a month, and even then my check comes three months late,\" said Milanka Bojanovic, 44, who works for the port authority. \"I have neighbors who have not been paid for six months.\" **********Institutional Investor, the trade magazine, recently ranked Yugoslavia Number 129 of 137 countries as a prospect for foreign investment. Among the countries rated less attractive were Libya, the Sudan, Zaire and Afghanistan. **********There never were many foreign companies here. Those that have looked into investment say the import-export process is cumbersome, with many bureaucratic restrictions and paperwork. The Government makes it tough to get hard currency.  Taxes and fees, piled one on the other, are also barriers to doing business. Nor was there much direct foreign investment; most foreign companies here handled only sales and distribution. **********And there is a powerful lobby, built up in the last five years, that vigorously opposes economic reform, despite the threat of political upheaval. **********\"Milosevic's power is based, as it was under Communism, on nepotism,\" an American businessman said. \"Those who support him get rich, really rich. Those who do not, starve. The middle class is being wiped out, and a new, powerful oligarchy rules this place like a feudal estate.\" **********Nearly every major state industry is now headed by a senior government official.

Based on investigations in Algeria, it concluded that ''all the indications gathered on the ground'' suggested that European targets would be picked because they would provide ''a resonance that no longer exists in Algeria.'' **********The Defense Ministry issued a statement today saying an investigation had been ordered into ''the reasons that led to the divulging of parts'' of a ''note for reflection'' destined for ''internal use.'' **********The ministry, which oversees the Directorate General for External Security, denied Le Monde's report that President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Alain Juppe had been informed of the findings of the intelligence services in mid-November. **********The bombing at the Port-Royal commuter station -- using a gas canister filled with nails -- recalled precisely the methods used by the Armed Islamic Group, an Algerian organization, in a wave of attacks in France last year that killed 8 people and wounded more than 160. No arrests have yet been made in connection with the recent bombing. **********But Said Lahlali, a representative in France of the Islamic Salvation Front, the party that appeared set to win elections in Algeria in 1992 before they were canceled by the army, said today that a senior party official, Anouar Haddam, had been arrested in the United States. **********The detention of Mr. Haddam, who has lived mainly in the United States for the last three years, would appear to mark a distinct shift in American policy. **********Elected to Parliament in Algeria in late 1991, Mr. Haddam has acted as an interlocutor between the Islamic Salvation Front and the State Department. **********In 1995 he represented his party at a conference in Rome that tried to establish a platform for peace in Algeria by rejecting ''violence to gain or maintain power,'' recognizing a multiparty system and accepting the alternation of political office. Earlier, however, he had appeared to endorse the Armed Islamic Group, the most radical and ruthless of the factions that emerged from Islamic Salvation Front after it was banned in Algeria in 1992. **********More than a week after the attack on the train station, a state of high alert continues in Paris, with soldiers deployed in the city, all garbage cans on the subway sealed to prevent the concealing of a bomb, widespread signs urging people to be vigilant, and almost daily bomb scares in department stores or train stations. **********The report from the French intelligence services argued that a blocked military and political situation in Algeria made it more likely that violence would be ''exported'' by increasingly splintered and marginalized groups of Islamic militants in Algeria. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in Algeria since a faction of the Islamic Salvation Front began a campaign of violence to protest the cancellation of elections in 1992. In the latest of a series of attacks in the Blida area south of Algiers, Islamic insurgents slit the throats of 20 passengers on an overnight bus early today, the Algerian Government said. **********More than 60 people have been killed in Blida Province in the last week.

That marked the fourth straight monthly fall since the deficit hit $11.39 billion last June. **********But even with those gains, several private economists projected that the 1995 deficit would total $150 billion to $165 billion, making it one of the highest in history. **********Still, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said the overall trend \"is obviously helpful.\" He added that the trade total, fueled by strong United States exports, \"have been moving inextricably in the right direction over the last several months. **********\"I perceive that is going to continue, but how strongly I can't tell,\" he said. **********Several economists said they were troubled by a jump in the United States trade deficit with Japan, which rose 11.1 percent in October to $4.79 billion from $4.31 billion in September, ending a seven-month stretch of declines. **********But Mr. Kantor said in an interview that the overall trade deficit with Japan had dropped 4 percent in the first 10 months of 1995 over the same period in 1994. **********He said he was more concerned about trade with China. Hinting that the Administration may seek to reimpose trade sanctions against China next month, Mr. Kantor said: \"Things are not going in the correct direction with China. We have focused on China with some intensity, and we intend to be even more intense over the next several months. This goes beyond trade rules to the rule of law. We expect them to live up to their agreements.\" **********Last February, the Clinton Administration suspended $1 billion in tariffs on  imports from China to encourage the Chinese Government to crack down on piracy of American movies and computer software and to halt other discriminatory trade  practices. **********But some trade experts contended that China has not changed many of its practices, and the Commerce report showed that America's deficit with China climbed to $29.09 billion in the first 10 months of 1995 from $24.59 billion in  the same period in 1994. **********Mr. Kantor and several economists said new trade agreements with other countries and a renewed competitiveness by American companies had helped to increase exports. But, noting that exports dipped slightly in October, they also said that any strengthening in the dollar's value, making United States goods more expensive, and the sluggish nature of the Japanese and European economies,  could choke out some of that growth. **********Gary C. Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said the latest trade numbers were \"slightly better than one might have expected,\" and he said he expected a continued decline in the overall deficit. **********But he also said that \"the bigger story is the softness of the U.S. economy,\" which is improving the balance of trade by slowing purchases of imports by American consumers. **********Indeed, the Commerce Department report showed that while exports of American  goods and services rose from $64.68 billion last June to $66.75 billion in October, imports dropped from $76.06 billion to $74.79 billion over the same period. **********Others, such as Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a former Commerce Department official and a critic of some of Japan's trading practices, said they found the  Commerce Department report to be \"discouraging\" because it showed that the United States deficits were still growing with several of its leading trading partners. **********Besides the problems with Japan and China, the report showed that trade deficits had worsened with both Canada and Mexico, the country's partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement. **********In addition, America's trade deficit with Western Europe jumped to $1.15 billion in October from $125 million in September, possibly reflecting Europe's growing economic woes. **********Commerce Department officials cautioned that such figures could be misleading because the total trade deficit is adjusted for seasonal variations in economic  activity, but the country-by-country figures are not. **********But Mr. Prestowitz, now president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington, said he was concerned by the numbers. **********\"Mexico's economy is slowing,\" he said, \"and the forecast is that it will not be robust and Europe will not be robust.\" In addition, he said, \"We have a chronic, big trade deficit with Canada.\" **********Among industrial sectors, some of the biggest declines in October occurred in exports of autos and auto parts, which slipped to $4.77 billion in October from  $5.6 billion in September. Imports dropped even more, to $9.51 billion from $10.42 billion. **********Imports of foreign oil also declined, to $4.25 billion in October from $4.78  billion in September. **********Given the delay in releasing the October figures, economists expect the Commerce Department to follow in early February with the November totals, bringing the trade picture more up to date. **********The Japanese Government is expected to report its 1995 trade figures soon, and most experts believe they will show that Japan's huge trade surplus shrank for the first time in five years.

They were only a fraction of the Pope's audience, for his remarks were carried in direct or delayed broadcasts to television viewers in 70 countries. **********In the 18 years that he has led the world's 960 million Roman Catholics, John Paul's Christmas words have struck varying themes. He has been political, pastoral, often mystical. Today, his comments contained much poetry, but also stern political admonition. **********'' 'God is born; power trembles,' '' he said, quoting the words of an 18th-century Polish poet, Franciszek Karpinski, that have become a popular Christmas carol in the Pope's homeland. '' 'The Lord of Heaven is naked; fire congeals; glare darkens; he who is infinite, has boundaries. The scorned one is covered with glory; the mortal one is a king for centuries.''' **********The Pope said such melodies had now brought peace to places like Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as Guatemala, where after years of war the guns had fallen silent. **********''But the echo of the songs of Christmas must travel much farther,'' he continued. ''It must resound beyond walls where the clash of arms is still heard, shattering the spell of peace brought by this holy day. I am thinking of Bethlehem and all the Holy Land, where Jesus was born and lived: the land which he loved, the land where hope must not die, despite provocations and profound differences.'' **********Moving to another area of turmoil, Africa, John Paul assailed what he called international apathy toward the fate of refugees, saying: ''At its very heart, in the region of the Great Lakes, this young continent is experiencing, amid the general indifference of the international community, one of the cruelest human tragedies of its history.'' **********''Thousands and thousands of people -- our brothers and sisters -- wander, displaced, victims of fear, hunger and disease,'' he said. ''They,  alas, will not be able to feel the joy of Christmas.'' **********The Pope has appealed repeatedly for international aid to help ease the sufferings of a million or more displaced Rwandan refugees who have returned from neighboring Zaire and Tanzania over the last month. **********But the theme of Middle East peace between Israel and the Palestinians also weighed heavily. On Friday, the Roman Catholic Patriarch of Jerusalem, the Very Rev. Michel Sabbah, cautioned the Israeli authorities in a strongly worded Christmas message that they were pursuing ''a path of violence.'' In January, the Pope is expected to deliver similar urgings to Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, when he comes to Rome on a visit. **********The Pope, looking rested, had forgone the public celebration of the third of three Masses he ordinarily celebrates on Christmas.

Those who want to pick their own doctors and hospitals instead of sticking with the cut-rate Communicare Choice network, a company brochure warns, face high deductibles, low payments and, potentially, thousands of dollars of added expense. **********All for a good cause, Gannett vouches. Communicare Choice, the brochure says, \"addresses the dilemma facing most businesses today -- how to continue to provide good health-care coverage and keep costs in check.\" **********A quandary it may be, but not one so serious that Gannett's top executives have to confront it personally. Under their separate plan, the company shows more flexibility in covering deductibles and other payments no matter which doctors they see. **********Gannett is hardly alone. As companies herd their employees into managed care, limiting their choices to doctors and hospitals that have agreed to cut their charges, the chiefs of many of the nation's largest corporations -- including Atlantic Richfield; Charles Schwab; RJR Nabisco; SBC Communications, the parent  of Southwestern Bell, and Gannett -- are leading more by precept than example. According to recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings and the companies themselves, the executives have medical coverage more bountiful than what their  employees enjoyed even before their companies began economizing. **********These perks, worth perhaps a few thousand dollars for a typical chief executive, might seem trivial compared with executive-compensation packages that can total millions of dollars. But in an era of mass layoffs, the special treatment rankles workers and could provide grist for politicians who rail against corporate greed. **********Some executive-compensation specialists wonder how bosses can justify full coverage for themselves while insisting that their workers accept cutbacks. \"Unfortunately,\" said Judith Fischer, a managing director at Executive Compensation Services, a newsletter and research firm in Fairfax Station, Va., \"what is good for the rank and file is not always good enough for executives.\" **********Although companies with executive health plans are in a minority, as many others have done away with them, these companies say the benefits are necessary  to recruit and keep qualified leaders. \"SBC has an outstanding record of retaining its managers, and it's a competitive marketplace,\" said Robert Ferguson, a company spokesman. SBC's executive plan eliminates the deductibles and co-payments for visits to doctors and hospitals that ordinary employees have to pay, up to a limit that Mr. Ferguson said he could not specify. **********For employees of SBC, and of most other companies, traditional coverage with  no restrictions on choice is virtually dead. SBC workers are limited to health maintenance organizations or Prudential's Customcare program. Customcare, chosen by 90 percent, penalizes SBC employees who want to choose their own doctors and hospitals by imposing a $1,215 annual deductible for a family of three and paying only 80 percent of most hospital costs. Employees who limit themselves tomembers of the Customcare network have no deductibles and 100 percent hospital coverage. **********For workers, the lack of choice can be a hardship. Managed-care plans force many people to abandon doctors who have cared for them and their families for years. They also limit the ability of members to shop for the best hospitals and specialists to treat afflictions like cancer or heart disease. **********The restrictions are painful enough, but the realization that they don't apply to the higher-ups hurts worker morale, said Vic Crawley, an official with  the Communications Workers of America who represents workers at SBC. \"They have  no limitations,\" Mr. Crawley said of the top managers' coverage. That inequity \"builds up anger,\" he said, adding, \"I think you have to can those kinds of perks.\" **********When the union brought up the executive benefits in negotiations, Mr. Crawley said, management wanted no part of the workers' managed-care plan. \"We may not like it, but it's not the kind of issue you go to war over,\" he said. **********Mr. Ferguson of SBC said that most other large companies probably have similar executive coverage. But in fact, SBC belongs to a shrinking minority in  assigning a higher value to upper-management life, organ and limb. Towers Perrin, the compensation-and-benefits consulting firm, said that only 12 percent of the nation's largest corporations offered executives special medical perks today, down from 18 percent 20 years ago. **********Companies that have eliminated special health coverage for executives in recent years, according to S.E.C. filings and checks with the corporations, include Western Digital, Time Warner, Wisconsin Electric, Carter-Wallace and Walt Disney. **********DISNEY used to pay $4,000 a year to give each top executive full insurance coverage for expenses not paid by the standard employee plan. The only limit on  benefits was an improbable 20 percent of annual salary -- or hundreds of thousands of dollars, or perhaps even millions, for the likes of Michael D. Eisner, the chief executive who is famous for making $203 million in 1993, most  of it from cashing in stock options. **********Last year, Disney decided that such favoritism sent the wrong signal and dropped the special coverage. \"All employees have the same choice with the same financial commitment, from the guy in the mail room to a senior executive,\" said Ken Green, a spokesman for Disney. \"It was just believed to be the most equitable.\" **********Many compensation specialists have reached the same conclusion. They say the  slight benefit of full coverage to an executive earning hundreds of thousands of dollars or more doesn't justify risking a corporate black eye that even a spin doctor would have trouble treating. **********\"In an atmosphere where companies are installing managed-care programs, cutting back on the benefits they are paying to everybody else, it would be indefensible to employees,\" said Don Sullivan, a Towers Perrin vice president. \"Hey, how can we eat at Le Cirque when we're insisting on employees' going to McDonald's?\" **********BUT some executives still prefer mignonettes de boeuf to Big Macs. \"We look at competitive practices, and that's justification,\" said Albert Greenstein, a spokesman for Atlantic Richfield. In its 1995 proxy statement, the company, known as ARCO, reported that the cost of the executive medical plan the year before had been $8,554 for Mike R. Bowlin, the chief executive, and the same for each of the company's five other top managers. **********Even some companies that have adopted a uniform program for all employees slip in extras for top management, like thorough annual checkups that can cost $1,000 or more. Consolidated Edison, the giant New York City utility, abandoned  the most generous features of its executive plan years ago, but it still gives the bosses eyeglasses twice a year and lets them have private hospital rooms, with no limits on coverage. Unionized employees are reimbursed for a single pair of glasses every two years and shared rooms, with a lifetime maximum of $1 million, depending on their plan. **********executives beyond what other employees receive is a payment of up to $500 each for comprehensive annual checkups, plus as much as $500 for some specialized tests. **********At some companies, the health care largess heaped on senior executives knows  no bounds. W. R. Grace & Company spent $271,000 for what it called \"private nursing and related expenses\" for J. Peter Grace, the chief executive, in the two years before he retired at the end of 1992. It then doled out an additional  $351,000 in the next two years. **********The company's failure until last April, 10 days before Mr. Grace died, to disclose the costs of these and other perks, which included a private chef and the use of a company jet, has prompted a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. The company said recently that the investigation remained open. **********Grace hasn't been the only company to pay five- or six-figure medical bills for current or former executives. Winn-Dixie paid $101,782 for A. D. Davis, a retired vice chairman, in 1994, the year before he died. Also in 1994, Aflac, an insurance company, paid medical expenses of $45,063 for Paul Amos, its chairman. **********But for most workers, frugality rules. A survey by the benefits and health care consulting company Foster Higgins showed that in 1995, 71 percent of employees with company health insurance belonged to managed-care plans, up from  48 percent in 1992. **********These programs limit costs by steering patients to doctors and hospitals that have agreed to fixed, usually discounted charges, and by forcing them to pay some or all of the bills if they go to health care providers outside the network. Partly as a result, corporate medical expenses fell by 1 percent in 1994, the first decline in a decade, and rose just 2.1 percent last year, less than the inflation rate. **********At the Charles Schwab Corporation, the drive for medical savings has spared top management. Senior executives, including Mr. Schwab, the founder and chairman, have supplemental coverage up to a limit that Tom Taggart, a company spokesman, declined to specify. **********Mr. Schwab hardly needs the cushion. Last year, the company lifted a $2.5 million cap on his compensation and awarded him a $7.8 million bonus, more than  tripling his total pay of the year before, to $8.6 million. But, the spokesman said, it's the principle of the thing. \"They are executives,\" he said. \"Executives get perks.\" **********Other employees' choices are limited to a health maintenance organization, which generally restricts them to member doctors and hospitals, and to other plans that expose them to thousands of dollars of expense unless they stick with providers in a Prudential network. Primary-care physicians, or PCP's, as a Schwab booklet calls them, also serve as cost cops who alone can open the doors  to the networks' specialists or hospitals. **********The Schwab health plan guide treats such restrictions as opportunities. \"Look at how much you can save by using your PCP and other network physicians, rather  than non-network doctors,\" it declares. **********Open-ended health care opportunities for bosses became popular in the 1970's  and early 1980's as executives' salaries ballooned and their perks multiplied. \"If you have five neurotic children, all with bad teeth, you have a real benefit,\" said Graef S. Crystal, an expert on executive compensation. Corporate  lobbyists turned back an attempt in the early 1980's to tax benefits that were not extended to other employees, although Congress did tighten the terms somewhat for making these benefits tax-free. **********Most companies are reluctant to discuss these perks. At RJR Nabisco Inc., the 1995 proxy statement tersely mentions supplemental health benefits for top executives. Linda Elkes, a spokeswoman, said that a plan covering executives' deductibles and co-payments was still in effect, but she would not provide further details. **********When it comes to employee health plans, however, the companies are downright  effusive. Gannett promotes its plan to employees as a smart investment. By using doctors and hospitals in the Communicare Choice network, an in-house brochure says, \"You and Gannett spend health care dollars more effectively.\" **********The company steers employees toward this plan by holding maximum expenses for a family of three to $3,750 (not counting some co-payments) and imposing no deductibles. But for those who stray outside the Communicare network, the maximum nearly triples to $10,500, including a $1,500 deductible. **********GANNETT executives, however, enjoy more choice than Communicare Choice offers, and they exercise it under what the company's 1995 proxy statement calls a medical reimbursement plan. While the document lumps medical reimbursements with those for taxes on other perks, it reported that in 1994 Gannett paid John  J. Curley, the chief executive, $14,737; Douglas H. McCorkindale $19,681; Gary L. Watson, the president of the newspaper division, $16,878, and Thomas Curley,  the publisher of USA Today, who is not related to the chief executive, $5,760. **********Mr. McCorkindale said that senior executives often used doctors recommended to them when the company moved its headquarters to Arlington, Va., from Rochester in 1985, and that many of these doctors became part of the Communicare network. So, while top executives see some of the same doctors as their underlings, these executives have more flexibility to go outside the network. **********Mr. McCorkindale and Thomas Curley said they did not know the details of their health coverage or how much of the amounts listed on the proxy statement were for medical costs.

Yet representing Dusan Tadic, the first man to be tried by a new  international tribunal here, is a distinguished Dutch law professor who could be doing far more lucrative work. **********Michail Wladimiroff, 51, also a partner in a high-powered law firm in The Hague, usually defends large companies involved in tax or environmental disputes, charging hefty fees. But he has spent much of the past year in the mountains of northern Bosnia, searching for evidence and witnesses. The indictment of the United Nations tribunal for the former Yugoslavia says that his client, a Bosnian Serb, killed, beat and mutilated Muslims in 1992 at the start of the Serbian onslaught. **********By the standards of his firm, Wladimiroff and Spong, he is paid very modestly by the tribunal. Mr. Wladimiroff has called his work here, thousands of miles from the scene of the crime, frustrating and difficult. **********So why did Mr. Wladimiroff agree to take on such an unpopular case?  \"This is an historical trial,\" he said in an interview. \"This is the first case that involves discussing a new body of international law. For a jurist, being part of this process is extremely fascinating.\" **********While the war crimes tribunal at The Hague follows in the footsteps of the trials at Nuremberg and Tokyo after World War II, there are many differences. New conventions and treaties on the rules of war have since been developed and widely accepted. But those new laws have never been applied to individuals in an international court. **********Mr. Wladimiroff said the tribunal asked him to take on the defense when Mr. Tadic arrived in The Hague in April 1995 from a German prison. \"His German lawyer did not want to handle the case,\" Mr. Wladimiroff said. **********The son of Russian parents who fled Communism, he speaks Russian, which helps him understand his client's Serbo-Croatian. But more to the point, as a board member of several Dutch lawyers' associations, he had previously helped the tribunal draw up rules for its relations with defense lawyers. \"I guess the tribunal remembered my name,\" he said. **********As so much else that was touched by the brutal conflict in Bosnia, matters did not work out as originally expected. \"The tribunal thought the case would be a matter of three months,\" Mr. Wladimiroff recalled. But it has already taken more than a year and the trial, which began on May 7, is expected to last months. **********For prosecutors, hunting down those accused of atrocities has been very difficult, and the tribunal has complained of a shortage of money and a lack of  cooperation from NATO forces in the field. \"The defense has been even more handicapped,\" Mr. Wladimiroff said. \"Countries other than former Yugoslavia are  cooperating well with the prosecution, but not with the defense,\" he said. **********He and members of his team have already made seven trips to Bosnia, mainly to the Prijedor region where Mr. Tadic lived. It was the scene of some of the worst atrocities and the most notorious Serbian-run detention camps for Muslim civilians. The lawyer said he will prove that his client was not involved. **********Most difficult, he said, has been finding witnesses and getting them to talk. The prosecution has announced it will call more than 80 witnesses, the defense says it will have 36, of whom 16 will tesify by satellite. Conditions for the two sides are very unequal, Mr. Wladimiroff said, because all of the prosecution's witnesses are outside Bosnia, but all the defense witnesses are in the Serbian part of Bosnia. **********\"There authorities blocked not only the investigation by the prosecution, but also by the defense,\" he said. \"People could not or would not talk to us.\" People were afraid they too would face war crime charges or they feared the local bosses, he added, because to the local authorities, any cooperation, even  in defense of Bosnian Serbs would mean recognizing the tribunal. **********The tribunal's rules are a hybrid of Anglo-Saxon common law and of the Napoleonic code, which is widely used in Europe. The defense team is also a mix: Mr. Wladimiroff is assisted by Alphons Orie, a Dutch colleague from his own law  firm and by Steven Kay, a British barrister, who resigned from his job as Secretary of the Criminal Bar Association in Britain to come to The Hague. Their goal, the lawyer has insisted over and over again, is to secure a fair trial, despite all the limitations. \"This tribunal has not been established to satisfy  only the victims but to bring justice to all, including the accused,\" he told the court in his opening statement. **********With respected legal scholars as judges, prosecutors and defense counsels, Mr. Tadic's chances for a fair trial would seem strong. Yet Mr. Wladimiroff said he had serious misgivings and as the trial opened he told the court he doubted that a fair trial was possible at all. **********He said the great suffering of the war had made the need for revenge and for  finding a scapegoat very pervasive, and, he added, victims' recollections are inevitably tainted by deep emotion, by hearsay and by extensive news coverage of the war. **********Besides, he said, the tribunal's legal procedures are still plagued by \"novelties that are yet to be sorted out.\" Even though the trial is now under way, the court still needs to establish exactly what evidence will be admitted.  Both defense and prosecution, he said, have asked the judges to define more precisely what constitutes an offense. It would be wrong to use his defendent as a guinea pig, the lawyer said. **********He told the court, \"This is the first case which the tribunal has to try, but the experiment should not be conducted at the expense of the defendent.\" In the  interview, Mr. Wladimiroff went further: \"This is not a normal court, but if accepted standards of fairness are violated, we will file for a mistrial.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/30/business/the-media-business-time-warner-purchase.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 86, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;Time Warner Purchase", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;Time Warner Purchase", "body_text": " **********Time Warner Inc. said yesterday that its Southern Progress Corporation unit had bought Weight Watchers magazine from the H.

The town, on the site of an old Ojibwa village, owes its existence to the postwar uranium boom. Yet today it has only half of the 25,000 residents it had in the late 1950's. **********Reduced military demand, nagging problems with nuclear-generated electrical power and cheaper uranium extraction elsewhere, like Saskatchewan, have resulted in the shutdown of all but one Elliot Lake pit. And that last one, the Stanleigh mine, will deliver up its final ton of rock in June, throwing 600 people out of  work. **********But as one chapter closes for this isolated community in the southern reaches of the Canadian Shield, a rocky, forested area that makes up much of the nation, a new one has already opened. Mrs. Porter and Mrs. Boone are among the 4,000 people who in the last half-dozen years have given Elliot Lake a new feather in  its cap as the \"Retirement Living Capital\" of Canada. **********The retirees and their spouses, mainly from southern Ontario, have been drawn by the low-cost apartments and houses vacated by the miners, the scenic views and the prospect of easy, comfortable, even stimulating small-town living. **********The uranium bust set the conditions for the town's rebirth. The mining companies built thousands of homes for miners they never hired. To cut losses -- for example from real estate taxes owed even if nobody lived there -- the companies decided to tear the homes down. **********But municipal leaders and one of the company vice presidents, Claire Dimock,  66, who retired here herself, had another idea. They obtained seed money for a nonprofit company that bought up the houses from the companies, made needed improvements and began marketing the properties as a retirement getaway. **********\"We made an industry of the seniors,\" recalled Ms. Dimock, who added that their stable incomes \"strengthened the local economy.\" **********The tax base was restored. New businesses were started, some even by the retirees themselves, like a craft shop, a fish and chips shop and a tea room. \"We're now investing in our infrastructure,\" said Dianna Bratina, the town's economic development officer. \"Telecommunications, roads, various things that mean more business.\" **********Auto dealers like the three-term Mayor, George Farkouh, 48, who runs the Chrysler distributorship, and his brother, Fawzi, 60, who owns the General Motors franchise, say business has never been better. \"We crashed in 1990 but have been coming back ever since,\" the Mayor said. **********Although uranium has been mined in the area for years, city officials insist  that radioactivity registers no higher here than in Toronto or New York. Residents say it has never concerned them. The mining companies, with the Government looking hard over their shoulders, disposed of the mine wastes in a lake, to which access is barred. **********Mrs. Porter was born in Vancouver, married her husband, Newton, an Anglican clergyman who has since died, in England, and lived in Ontario and Quebec for years before finally settling in a two-bedroom apartment with her three cats. She has three children but prefers to live independently. Her rent is $348 a month. \"It would be easily three or four times that in Toronto,\" she said, smoothing the soil around her beans. **********Mrs. Boone was born in Berlin, worked as a banking supervisor in Toronto and  moved up here with her husband, Fred, a former railroad maintenance worker, whose hip ailment kept him out of the garden. They live in a two-bedroom unit for the same $348 monthly rent.

The fines are among the biggest  ever paid on Wall Street. **********Edward Bao, who was executive vice president at Gruntal until December 1994  and a director, was indicted by a Federal grand jury in Manhattan as part of a continuing investigation into an embezzlement scheme that prosecutors said had eluded auditors and regulators for more than 10 years. **********\"It's safe to say that we plan to contest these charges,\" Steven Reiss, a lawyer who represents Mr. Bao, said. \"These allegations took place a long time ago. And nothing in there says that Mr. Bao profited personally.\" **********As part of the same investigation, Gruntal agreed to the fines and restitution to resolve investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, New York Stock Exchange and National Association of Securities Dealers. **********\"It's a disturbing set of events that occurred here over a period of time,\" said Robert P. Rittereiser, Gruntal's president and chief executive. \"I'm sorry  that it happened. But we're dealing with these issues and we hope to move the company along.\" The company, which handles trading for individual accounts and institutions, has 29 offices. **********What is amazing about the Gruntal scandal, prosecutors said, is how the participants eluded Federal regulators for 10 years. According to Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Mr. Bao, along with Charles Meizoso, Gruntal's director of operations; Waseem Ahmad, the company's cashier, and Eugene McCloskey, the firm's internal audit manager,  began an elaborate scheme to embezzle money in July 1984 and continued until Mr. Ahmed died of a heart attack in October 1994. **********\"The setup was really impressive,\" said Thomas C. Newkirk, associate director, division of enforcement for the S.E.C. \"There was little chance of them getting caught. Everyone involved with the scam were the same people charged with guarding the hen house, so to speak.\" **********According to the indictment filed yesterday, Mr. Bao and his colleagues diverted unclaimed customer dividends, dividend overages, and uncashed customer  or vendor checks into Gruntal accounts. To hide these transactions, the three routinely transferred money into fictitious accounts. After it was safely hidden, the money was either used to pay the company's expenses, thereby increasing Gruntal's profits. **********According to the S.E.C., the group managed to steal $14 million. Mr. Meizoso  and Mr. McCloskey were accused of stealing $6 million personally, the agency said. On top of that, Mr. Ahmed stole $3 million more. **********The scheme, which had apparently worked smoothly for 10 years, finally ran amok when Mr. Ahmed died in October 1994. According to prosecutors, the company  called in an outside auditor, prompting Mr. Meizoso and Mr. McCloskey to flee to Ireland. Gruntal officials discovered the embezzlement and contacted the S.E.C., the New York Stock Exchange and the United States Attorney's Office. **********On Aug. 11, 1995, Mr. Meizoso and Mr. McCloskey pleaded guilty to two charges of conspiracy: one to divert more than $5 million of funds and property under Gruntal's custody and control and another to embezzle $5 million in funds and property. Both men face a maximum sentence on each count of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000. **********If convicted, Mr. Bao faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a  fine of $250,000. **********Even should the scandal be resolved, it will not be business as usual at Gruntal for some time. Some of the $6.2 million in fines is going to settle other improprieties in the firm's trading and managed account divisions. **********The National Association of Securities Dealers fined Gruntal $250,000 yesterday for trading ahead of its customers' limit orders, late reporting of trades and lack of supervision in this area. And the S.E.C. fined Gruntal $1 million yesterday for several infractions since 1993, including billing its fee-only customers a commission. As restitution for these offenses, Gruntal was  ordered to hire an independent consultant to look into these businesses and identify customers who may have lost money. **********Indeed, Gruntal is no stranger to controversy. In December 1994, Gruntal's former head of fixed income filed a wrongful dismissal suit against Howard Silverman, the firm's former chief executive, accusing him of bilking retail customers by having his own traders buy municipal bonds at less than market cost, then sell them to Mr. Silverman and Barry Richter, a Gruntal executive vice president. At the time, Gruntal spokesman said the allegations were without merit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/05/business/tv-consortium-is-disbanded.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Levere", "pub_date": "1996-09-05", "snippet": "Television Production Partners, a consortium of 10 giant advertisers that was formed in 1992 to produce programming for members to sponsor, has been disbanded, though its efforts may continue on ad hoc basis (S)", "word_count": 273, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TV Consortium Is Disbanded", "print_headline": "TV Consortium Is Disbanded", "body_text": " **********Television Production Partners, a consortium of 10 giant advertisers that was formed in 1992 to produce programming for members to sponsor, has been disbanded, though its efforts may continue on an ad hoc basis. **********''We found that it involved taking more risks than was palatable with very uncertain long-term returns,'' said Jack Myers, chairman and chief executive of the consortium, which produced several programs including an award-winning documentary, ''Hank Aaron: Chasing the Dream.''

''That will be very reassuring to the public.'' **********The Dole tax cut proposals drew high marks from most of the executives -- just the tonic needed, they said, to bring the economy to a higher level of growth than it has been able to achieve during President Clinton's tenure. But most of the bottom-line-oriented executives saw balancing the budget as equally important and wondered whether a Dole Administration -- or any Administration -- could manage the necessary spending cuts to offset those tax reductions. **********''He has captured the spirit of much of the country in saying that we have to have a less intrusive Government,'' said Joseph T. Gorman, chief executive of TRW Inc., a large and diverse manufacturing company based in Cleveland. But ''if Dole's not going to change Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security,'' he added, ''then it is going to be very difficult to find the spending cuts.'' **********Mr. Dole's convention speech on Thursday in San Diego included a call for support of his economic plan, which was first announced on Aug. 5. The main proposals -- lower income and capital-gains taxes, less regulation of business and a balanced budget by 2002 -- have drawn relatively little public comment from the nation's chief executives over the last two weeks. **********On Wall Street, there was concern that the tax cuts could be inflationary if they were not offset by spending reductions. **********''Right now we are close to full employment in a strong economy,'' said Henry Kaufman, chairman of Henry Kaufman & Company, a money management firm, ''And,'' he added, ''if you cut taxes you run the risk of overheating the economy with too much stimulus, bringing on inflation. That concerns the financial markets.'' **********Mr. Peterson has been arguing for years that spending programs for the elderly must be restrained to avoid a ballooning of the Federal deficit to crisis levels when the baby-boom generation retires in the next century. Mr. Dole promised not to change these programs before 2002, Mr. Peterson noted, ''but I hope the Republicans don't say anything that would tie their hands on entitlement reform after that date.'' **********Others, like Sanford Robertson, president of Robertson, Stephens & Company, a San Francisco-based investment bank that is a major backer of several Silicon Valley enterprises, praised Mr. Dole for promising to lower the capital-gains tax. ''I wouldn't be surprised if the Democrats respond with something similar,'' said Mr. Robertson, a lifelong Republican who supported Mr. Clinton in 1992 and still backs the President. He complained, however, that Mr. Dole's program harked ''back to the Reagan era, a little bit more of the 'trickle-down' stuff,'' adding, ''I don't think there's any great inspiration there.'' **********T. J. Rodgers, the outspoken chief executive of the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, a major chip maker in San Jose, Calif., said Mr. Dole's best move was to name Jack Kemp as his running mate. ''They're going to cut taxes and give money back to the American people,'' he said. ''Kemp is going to be the spark plug of this campaign.'' **********Whatever their political leanings, corporate executives were encouraged that Mr. Dole had put the issue of economic growth at the top of the nation's agenda. Several business leaders have been arguing that the right policies could foster a greater output of the economy without higher inflation than the 2.5 percent growth rate now considered the upper limit by many economists. **********Stanley C. Gault, the recently retired chairman of Goodyear Tire and Rubber, praised Mr. Dole for offering policies that Mr. Gault said would promote more growth than the Clinton Administration has considered possible. ''Dole has taken a bold move, one that he and his people have been thinking about and analyzing for many months,'' Mr. Gault said in an interview after Mr. Dole outlined his economic program but before the speech. **********And not everybody on Wall Street is spooked by faster growth. **********''I fall into the growth camp,'' said Elizabeth R. Bramwell, president of Bramwell Capital Management Inc., a money management firm, insisting that Mr. Dole's tax cut proposals are the right avenue to lifting the economy. **********For Tracy O'Rourke, chairman of Varian Associates, a health care and semiconductor equipment company, Bob Dole has upstaged Bill Clinton on the economy. ''Clinton's policies have locked us into a 2 percent to 2.5 percent growth rate,'' said Mr. O'Rourke, a Republican. ''The key thing about the Dole growth plan is that it is a balance of cutting taxes, reducing the regulatory burden and trying to balance the budget.'' **********But many of the executives expressed concern, before and after Mr. Dole's speech Thursday night, that his proposed spending cuts were too vague, and his goal of balancing the budget might be undermined, not only by leaving Social Security and Medicare untouched, but by increasing military spending, as Mr. Dole said he would do. **********''His tax cuts are viable and good,'' said Douglas Durst, who heads the Durst Organization, a New York real estate developer. ''But I don't see any reason to increase defense spending. What enemy do we have that we need a large army to fight against?'' **********Social issues steer Roger McNamee, general partner of Integral Capital Partners, a venture capital firm, away from the Republican camp.

But it put off any international action on the crisis until late next month at the earliest. **********The lack of movement in the Security Council in part reflects the unwillingness of any major power to take the lead in pushing for a stronger measures. At the same time, the delay is providing Burundi's military leaders time to harden their position against outside involvement, threatening to erode  what leverage the United Nations may have there. **********Burundi's envoy to the United Nations, Nsanze Terence, tried today to derail voting on the resolution by objecting to wording that leaves open the possibility of a future arms embargo and sanctions \"against those leaders in Burundi who continue to encourage violence.\" His unusual interruption was ruled  out of order by this month's Council president, Sir John Weston of Britain. **********\"It is important that Burundians take the message seriously,\" said Botswana's representative, Legwaila J.

Diplomats hope that Julius Nyerere, a former President of neighboring Tanzania, who has been drawn into talks on Burundi, will take a larger role in mediating a solution. Only if diplomacy fails will sanctions be discussed. **********The response of the Council has redoubled pleas for action from international relief organizations caring for thousands of refugees and displaced people in Burundi, many from neighboring Rwanda, where similar tensions between a Hutu majority and a Tutsi minority led to a slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Tutsi and moderate Hutu in 1994. **********\"The lack of leadership by any major member of the Council to move real-time  solutions forward is extremely distressing,\" said Lionel Rosenblatt, president of Refugees International and a founder of the year-old Burundi Policy Forum, an umbrella group of concerned organizations. **********\"We seem not to have learned the lesson of Kigali in the spring of 1994,\" he  said in an interview today, referring to the massacres in the Rwandan capital. \"We have before us that graphic example of what happens when you wait.\" **********Mr. Rosenblatt said that his group has recommended protection for Burundi's embattled civilian President, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, a Hutu, who appealed for help on a visit to Washington in October. The Burundi President, whose two predecessors were assassinated, is believed to be a possible target of soldiers  in the Tutsi-led army as well as Hutu guerrillas battling the military. **********Life in Burundi's capital, Bujumbura, has been sharply curtailed by violence, some of it politically inspired terrorism, some common criminality. In the countryside, thousands have been killed in attacks on towns and camps. At least  115 international relief workers are reported to have lost their lives since 1992. **********In a letter to President Clinton on Jan. 19, InterAction, an association of American private voluntary organizations, said that recent assaults on aid workers in Burundi seemed designed to \"force the departure of foreigners whose presence inhibits ethnic violence.\" **********\"After World War II, the international community committed itself to seeing that genocide never again disgraced the human race,\" Andrew Natsios, a former United States Government emergency aid coordinator in Africa, wrote on behalf of InterAction.

Instead, Premier Lucien Bouchard now speaks of the \"shared values\" of French- and English-speakers and quotes the Quebec-born, English-language writer Joyce Marshall, who said it is \"the rub and bite of difference that keeps us alert and alive.\" **********On the night of Oct. 30, after the separatists narrowly lost the independence referendum, Mr. Bouchard suggested that another vote could come as early as 1996. Now, he tells Quebecers, he will call one only when he is sure of winning  and in any case not before the next provincial election, which must come before  September 1999. **********Premier for the last 10 weeks, Mr. Bouchard, who galvanized the referendum campaign with his stirring vision of Quebec as a proud new country, is now concentrating on trying to rehabilitate a province with Canada's highest unemployment (more than 11 percent) and widest budget deficit ($2.9 billion). **********The shift seems to have been welcomed in the province and the rest of the country, giving time to heal fractures from the referendum and perhaps to germinate fresh proposals for keeping Canada together. **********Although recent opinion polls indicate that many Quebecers think separatism is inevitable, more than twice as many say they prefer a new arrangement within  Canada than say they would like the province to go its own way. **********In any event, pollsters say, the last thing Quebecers now want is a new referendum. \"We have gone to the ballot box four times in the past four years, and people are tired of all the politicking,\" said Jean-Marc Leger, president of Groupe Leger & Leger of Montreal. \"Our first priority is economic recovery, and  Mr. Bouchard, who still has a tremendous reserve of popularity in the province,  recognizes this.\" **********The business community, most of whose members oppose separation, also welcomes the respite. \"Since the arrival of Mr. Bouchard and his government,\" said Ghislain Dufour, head of the Quebec big-business organization known as the  Conseil du Patronat, \"all the efforts of the government have been devoted to the expenses of the government, the creation of jobs, and that's the kind of speech  that pleases us.\" **********Is this Bouchard II? the Premier was asked in a recent interview. \"It might be a different angle of myself that people are seeing now,\" Mr. Bouchard replied. \"I am a frugal man. I was brought up in a modest family where everything was paid for in cash. My father would never, never borrow money.\" **********Mr. Bouchard, 57, sat at a conference table dunking chocolate chip cookies into a coffee mug in an office complex, jocularly known as the \"bunker,\" across the street from the Quebec legislature. **********He has refused to take the opulent mansion at 1080 Avenue des Braves that briefly served as the official residence of his predecessor, Jacques Parizeau, who resigned after a diatribe against \"money and the ethnic vote\" on the night of the referendum. **********The Premier, who has returned his $10,500 annual housing allowance to the treasury, usually spends weekday nights in a specially fitted bedroom in the \"bunker,\" and weekends at the family home in the Montreal suburb of Outremont, with his American-born wife, Audrey Best, and their two young sons. **********His frugal side has come out as well with the government's plans, announced last month, to cut $750 million from spending in the current fiscal year. Schools, hospitals, welfare recipients and civil servants are on the block. The  government also said it will close 13 of its 19 foreign delegations. Only Quebec offices in New York City, Mexico City, Tokyo, Paris, London and Brussels are to  remain open. **********After meeting with business and labor leaders, Mr. Bouchard now has a target  year -- 2000 -- for achieving a balanced budget. **********While the government-union-business consensus could prove fragile, the threat of a downgrade from credit-rating agencies, which would raise the cost of Quebec's borrowed money and further strain the economy, may keep the accord intact. **********But if the Bouchard timetable for budget balancing is firm, nothing is fixed  about a new referendum. \"My terms are fluid ones,\" he said in the interview. \"But they are stemming from very material restraints. First I would like to launch a new era of financial and economic responsibility and prosperity for Quebec.\" **********Mr. Bouchard said that while his \"fundamental priority\" remains sovereignty,  his long-term one is the economy. \"This government should be more active in business and the economy and not talk so much about sovereignty first hand -- if there is a question, O.K., you answer the question -- but let's talk business. Business is the best way to forge binds.\" **********Although Mr. Bouchard is by far the most popular politician in the country, with a favorable rating exceeding 70 percent, the highest for any Quebec leader  in 50 years, words like that hardly endear him to the faithful of the Parti Quebecois, which has carried the separatist banner for the last three decades and would probably implode if deprived of its central ideological drive. **********\"Many hard-liners don't trust him,\" said Guy Laforest, political scientist and separatist at Laval University in Quebec. \"Remember six years ago this fellow was a member of the Federal Cabinet.\" **********Mr. Bouchard, who had been a friend and Laval law school classmate of former  Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, broke with Mr. Mulroney  and the Tories over Quebec strategy in 1987. Mr. Bouchard then formed the Bloc Quebecois, a political party representing sovereignty supporters in Ottawa. He came from the Bloc, now Canada's second largest political party after the governing Liberals, to head the provincial government. **********If supporters may be uneasy, so are some members of the English-speaking minority in Quebec. **********\"Where's our representation in the Cabinet?\" asked Tom Velk, a McGill University economics professor, referring to the language law that promotes French at the expense of English. \"The old Bouchard has just put on a new mask.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/16/world/world-news-briefs-saudis-bar-some-africans-as-health-risk-to-mecca.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WORLD NEWS BRIEFS;Saudis Bar Some Africans As Health Risk to Mecca", "print_headline": "WORLD NEWS BRIEFS;Saudis Bar Some Africans As Health Risk to Mecca", "body_text": " **********Saudi Arabia has banned Muslims from four African countries from making this  year's pilgrimage to Mecca because of an outbreak of meningitis in Nigeria, Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. **********Saudi Arabia's official news agency, in a report late Sunday, quoted a Health Ministry official as saying the decision was made on the basis of information provided by the World Health Organization. **********The ban is aimed at protecting 2 million Muslims expected to converge on Mecca month.

The Euro is likely to start out strong, but it will end up weak. **********How is that? When the Euro is finally born, central banks can cut their currency reserves because they will only need to keep a safe proportion of around 15 percent of foreign currency-denominated imports in the vaults. Because intra-European trade would be in Euros, at least for EMU countries, foreign-currency trade would shrink after the birth of the Euro. That reduces the amount of reserves that need to be held. **********Also, international demand for Euros could grow disproportionately. Big trading countries such as the United States and Japan tend to have a greater proportion of international reserves than their share of international trade. Because the new EMU area would be like a large trading country, the demand for Euros as a global transaction and reserve currency could rise. **********European bureaucrats and politicians want a strong Euro. The alternative of a weak Euro to achieve growth and jobs through devaluation is not really an option. A weak Euro would not work economically, either, because high interest rates would kill domestic growth, and export markets outside a large EMU area would be too small to compensate. **********But there are many reasons to doubt the Euro's long-term strength. No other currency in Europe matches the quality of the Deutsche mark. So substituting the Euro for it, which will include weaker currencies, is swapping good money for bad \u2014 unless the other member countries match Germany's economic management as a result of being in EMU. **********But that will not happen because monetary union fails to address some key issues \u2014 the size of government in Europe, the lack of an automatic financial transfer mechanism and the impact of diverging real exchange rates under a single currency. **********The job of shrinking the economic size of European governments has only just begun. European governments still swallow up a greater share of economic resources than those of the United States, Japan or the so-called Asian tigers. So budget stabilizations cannot stop with the Euro's creation. That will expose the real economic divergence within EMU-Europe, namely the difference between the mind-set that wants small government and that which tries to preserve le Grand Etat. **********EMU has another fatal flaw. It lacks an EU-level compensatory fiscal mechanism for regional disparities and curtails existing national ones, but it imposes a common exchange rate and monetary policy. Take the United States as a successful common-currency area. If California has a boom and Texas a recession, there are no political roars out of Texas to leave the monetary union, devalue, re-establish independent monetary and fiscal policy and go for growth. **********The first reason for this stoic endurance of recession in Texas is because of the automatic federal fiscal stabilizers that kick in to help Texas. In the United States, booming California pays its federal taxes, which get transferred to slumping Texas as employment benefits. In Europe, there is not, and will not be, any such mechanism. **********Second, the American union does not break up because the U.S. work force is mobile. It moves to where there is work. Such labor mobility is out of the question in Europe's culturally divided and rigid labor markets. **********A single European currency does not mean that the real exchange rate of Italy will equal that of Germany. The real exchange-rate value is the value of a country's currency after accounting for the relative inflation rates of a country's trading partners. Germany's real exchange rate will not vary much from its nominal one because the inflation impact of a weak Euro will be controlled culturally, and domestic inflation will stay low. That will not be so in Italy. Rising imports prices will get passed on much more in higher domestic prices and rising wage claims. So Italy's industrial competitiveness will be weakened. **********The answer would be for real wage rates to fall in the poor periphery of Europe. But politically that is explosive and probably only achievable with higher inflation. **********The result could be for social and political instability because of joblessness between regions and countries. A weak European Central Bank would be forced to follow a higher inflation policy to allow for changes in real wages. As this happened, the Euro would progressively weaken. **********World investors would seek to diversify out of the Euro into other sound currencies such as the yen and dollar. In Europe, the refuge currency would be the Swiss franc. But the Swiss franc cannot be pegged to the Euro any more than diamonds can be pinned to dirt. The world currency order will be reversed. The yen will re-emerge as the strongest, the Euro will be the weakest and the dollar will be a feeble currency in the middle. **********- **********Mr. Roche is global strategist at Independent Strategy Ltd., a London-based investment research firm."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/17/business/supreme-court-deadlocks-in-key-case-on-software.html": {"writer_name": "Linda Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1996-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 637, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Supreme Court Deadlocks In Key Case on Software", "print_headline": "Supreme Court Deadlocks In Key Case on Software", "body_text": " **********A closely watched Supreme Court case that was expected to define the boundaries of copyright protection for computer software fizzled today as the eight Justices who heard the case last week deadlocked 4 to 4. **********As a result, the Court automatically affirmed a 1995 decision by the Federal  appeals court in Boston that the Lotus Development Corporation was not entitled  to copyright protection for the system of menus and commands used in its pioneering Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet program. **********The Court issued no opinion and set no precedent for future cases, leaving behind dashed expectations and a state of heightened uncertainty. As a legal matter, the effect was as if the Court had simply never agreed last September to hear Lotus's appeal of the ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the  First Circuit. The one difference is that the Court has now broadcast how deeply split it is. **********Lawyers knowledgeable about the software industry said today that the Court would almost certainly need to address the issue in a subsequent case, although  with technology having moved on, the copyright dispute will probably have a different focus than the \"user interface\" at issue in the six-year-old litigation between Lotus and Borland International Inc. **********Following the Court's practice when a case results in a tie vote, the Justices on either side were not identified. The missing Justice was John Paul Stevens, who earlier had taken himself out of the case for reasons he did not explain. **********Based on his most recent financial disclosure form, Justice Stevens does not  appear to own any stock that could be affected by the case, a common reason for  a Justice not to participate.

Gutman, who argued the appeal for Lotus, said today that he and his  client were \"disappointed both in the outcome and in the fact that the Supreme Court did not take an opportunity that would have clarified the law both for the lower courts and for the industry.\" **********Lotus sued Borland for copyright infringement in 1990, seeking $100 million in damages because the Quattro Pro program copied the system of menus and commands used in Lotus 1-2-3, thus letting users benefit from their hard-won expertise with operating the Lotus program rather than having to learn a new set of codes and keystrokes. **********To Lotus, this menu and command system, also known as the user interface, was a form of original expression falling squarely within the protection of the Copyright Act. Judge Robert E. Keeton of the United States District Court in Boston agreed in a 1993 decision, which Borland appealed. **********But to the appeals court, the command structure was not a form of expression  but a \"method of operation,\" which is explicitly excluded from copyright protection under the law. One of the appeals court judges, Judge Michael Boudin, drew an analogy to the familiar QWERTY arrangement of keys on a typewriter keyboard. All typists \"would be the captive of anyone who had a monopoly on the  production of such a keyboard\" if copyright protection were available, Judge Boudin said. **********Esther Roditti, editor of Computer Law and Tax Report, said today that neither Congress nor judicial decisions had yet provided a workable definition of \"method of operation\" in the context of computer software. **********\"I don't think anyone has a clear idea of what it means,\" she said in an interview. \"There is no bright line.\" **********For that reason, Ms. Roditti said, cases exploring the \"dichotomy between expression and ideas will inevitably come up again,\" with judges growing in sophistication as they encounter more such cases."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/21/your-money/IHT-quick-and-easy-money-transferswhere-theres-a-wire-theres-a-way.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Blum", "pub_date": "1996-12-21", "snippet": "RUNNING LATE on that Christmas present?

In a new service started Nov. 20, a joint venture betweenKeyBank of Cleveland, Ohio, and ChinaWire Corp. began improved wire-transfer availability between China and the West Coast of the United States. **********Mexico has also grown as a market for immigrants to the United States who wire money back home, so the systems there are increasingly accustomed to handling such transfers. **********Although almost any amount of money can be transferred, there is a fee that varies depending onthe sending institution. Who pays the fee \u2014 the sender or the receiver \u2014 can also vary. **********Among the biggest wire transactions on record was Texaco Inc.'s 1988 transfer of $3 billion to Pennzoil Co. to settle a lawsuit in the United States over the disputed acquisition of Getty Oil Co. The money had to be sent in three chunks because the sum was too big for the banking system to handle. **********Banks around the world have the capacity to send and receive wire transfers. To do so, they have corresponding bank relationships with one another. Big banks can have thousands of these relationships around the world, so when arranging a transfer it is important to verify that the banks on each end are correspondents. This streamlines the operation byeliminating the need for a go-between bank. **********Understandably, banks are loath to give out information about specific accounts and transfers, unless of course they are yours, so it was hard to track down users of transfers to assess consumer satisfaction. **********But one New York bank customer, who recently was awaiting a several-hundred-dollar transfer from a British bank, recounted a string of mistakes and red tape that left him scrambling. **********First, the sending bank left out the account number. Then, the receiving bank did not inform the customer that the money was in a holding pattern, awaiting a follow-up response from the sending bank as to the account number. Finally, after several days of back-and-forth correspondence, the receiving bank credited the transfer to the customer's account. **********The anecdote shows that a transfer can only work if all the information is available. To properly process the operation, the sending bank needs to know the amount to be transferred and in what currency it is being sent and received; the recipient's name and account number; the receiving bank's name,address, and routing, or ABA, number; when the funds should be payable to the recipient's account, and who is to pay the transfer fee. If this informationis not in order, there can be a problem. **********Generally, once the wire is credited to the recipient's account, his or her bank sends a notice in the mail confirming receipt. Among the information on the form are the sending bank's branch and reference numbers. One such number includes the phrase SWIFT, which is a method of payment for transfers. These numbers can be used to sort out any eventual problems or discrepancies. **********ONE OF THE BIGGEST banks in the wire-transfer business is, naturally, also one of the biggest banks in the world, The Chase Manhattan Bank in New York. **********Patricia Boyce and Robert Blackburn,who are in charge of Chase's wire-transfer operations, described wire transfers as \"painless.\" **********About 87 percent go straight through, automatically, but should there be problems, a staff of 50 people worksto fix them. Such miscues can include a wrong or missing account number, or even a missing name. In that case, the receiving bank has to contact the sending bank and find out what went wrong. **********The bank's wire-transfer operationis in a Chase officein New York City. It looks like a typical big office, with computers, work stations and dividers. Off to the side behind a glass panel is a control room of sorts that monitors a wider range of Chase transactions. **********Thousands of transfers move through Chase's system daily, and there are even more on the day after a holiday. The bank moves an average of$900 billion a day in wire transfers, with the average transfer ranging from $5 million to $6 million. **********The high average is due to the large number of corporate transactions, although many individual wire transfers of far smaller amounts also go through the Chase Manhattan wire-transfer system. **********As in most financial transactions, it pays to shop around and keep an eye on the fees. The KeyBank-ChinaWire venture, which first connected the Seattle area and 30,000 post offices and postal banks in China, allows for wires of up to $10,000 to be sent. Each transaction has a fee; for $100, the fee is $10 **********The service, which is faster than previous transfer methods to much of the Chinese market, is to be expanded on the U.S. end to other states and then will be aimed at other Asian countries, said the ChinaWire president, Gilles Struckor. **********\"Our system is safe, reliable and simple to use for Chinese and English speakers alike,\" he said. \"Our system is equipped to handle transfers of any size, from a few dollars to large corporate purchases and payrolls.\" **********The wire traffic between the United States and Mexico, estimated to be in the billions of dollars, has also given rise to competition between banks and MoneyGram and Western Union, giving consumers a choice of services and fees. **********For members of credit unions, such asthe United Nations Federal Credit Union, fees can be lower than at banks. They are $8 for domestic U.S. transfers and $17 for international transfers. Discounts are available on off-peak days. On the 5th, 10th, 20th and 25th days of the month, fees are $6 for domestic wires and $15 for international **********A RANGE OF FEE and service options are also available in Europe and Asia, depending on whether you use a bank or MoneyGram or Western Union. **********These two operators are owned by the same company, followingthe merger of First Data Corp. and First Financial Management Corp. But under a 1995 Federal Trade Commission consent decree, one of the services has to be divested. **********Both companies have thousands of locations worldwide for transfers, but unlike with banks, which send the money to an account, the receiving party must pick up the money at the receiving outlets. Fees range as high as 10 percent of the total amount. **********Many of the Western Union and MoneyGram offices around the world are in banks or American Express offices. **********MoneyGram used to be owned by American Express and its office in Estonia, for example, is in an American Express affiliate. And Western Union has three offices in Indonesia at branches of Bank Internasional Indonesia. **********One way to find out which banks offer which services overseas is to contact the U.S. Embassy in a given country. In Moscow, for example, the embassy has a list detailing which banks in Russia offer wire-transfer services. **********In most places around the world, and no matter which operator is used, wire transfers are available the same day or within one or two days. There may be exceptions, such as in a remote region of China, where even with the new KeyBank-ChinaWire service a transfer can take as long as three days to arrive. **********If all this is still too low-tech for you, do not fret. Chase Manhattan and other banks are working on taking wire transfers to the next logical step: In the near future, wire transfers will be available via the Internet. **********For information about ChinaWire, call 1 206 684 6475, or in the United States, 800 862 4462.Information also is available at KeyBank's web site: www.keybank.com. **********To view the U.S. Embassy's list of banks in Russia that offer wire transfers, access its web site at www.iep.doc.gov/bisnis/cables/cable.html. **********Information about MoneyGram is available at the following Internet addresses:www.estravel.ee/#eng andwww.ftc.gov/opa/9509/fdfin.htm.

Shards of bone no longer protrude from the earth, but the church just off the plaza is still in ruins and stained with smoke, and munitions cartridges and bullet casings still litter the ground. **********To the side of the dusty main square, a \"Wall of Lamentations\" and a simple memorial, showing a man and woman holding the hands of two small children, explain what happened. \"They have not died,\" a plaque proclaims. \"They are with  us, with you, and with all mankind. El Mozote, December 11, 1981.\" **********In a burst of calculated destruction that day, soldiers from the American-trained and American-armed Atlacatl Battalion of the Salvadoran Armed Forces killed hundreds of unarmed peasants they suspected of being guerrilla sympathizers. The exact number, perhaps as many as a thousand people, can never  be known because animals consumed some bodies and relatives returned to bury others. **********El Salvador was immersed in civil war then, a conflict that became part of the larger cold war because of Cuban and Nicaraguan support of the guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front and American patronage for the Salvadoran military. Though fighting would continue for another decade, resulting in the deaths of 75,000 people, the massacre here in the mountains of  Morazan Province still stands as the single most horrifying episode in the conflict. **********But now the people of El Mozote, or rather the lucky few who happened to be away at market or visiting relatives elsewhere that day, are returning. **********Casting aside bitter memories of loss and lingering fears of their Government, they have begun building new houses of wood, wattle, mud or brick on the sites of their former homes, burned and razed by rampaging soldiers. \"We are people raised in the countryside,\" said Jose Socorro Chicas, 72, a beekeeper who lost 6 children and 17 grandchildren in the massacre. \"We can't adapt to life in the city. We had our lands here, which have always belonged to us. This is our place, and we always knew we had to come back.\" **********Not Rufina Amaya, though. The only known survivor of the massacre, she saw her husband, Domingo Claros, bound, blindfolded and shot before she managed to slip off into the bush, where she listened helplessly as soldiers bayoneted four of her children while her 9-year-old son, Cristino, screamed: \"Mama Rufina, help me! They're killing us!\" **********Today she lives a few miles south of here, in a settlement called Quebrachos, with a new husband and a 10-year-old daughter, eking out a meager living from the corn and bananas they grow. She still owns a house and a small plot of land  here, but rents them to others because she cannot bring herself to visit, much less move back. **********\"God saved me because He needed someone to tell the story of what happened,\"  she said, sifting through a pile of beans on the front porch of the wood cabin that is her new home. \"I wish He hadn't, though, because it is very painful to have to think of it all the time. There are so many things that I remember, and  I tell them, but I just cannot stand to be there.\" **********It is now thought that \"El Mozote may well have been the largest massacre in  modern Latin American history,\" as Mark Danner put it in his 1994 book \"The Massacre at El Mozote: A Parable of the Cold War\" (Vintage Books). But the immediate aftermath of the massacre found the Reagan Administration, echoing its allies in the Salvadoran military, repeatedly challenging and casting doubt on every aspect of the killing, from the number of dead to their political sympathies. **********In fact, the guerrillas considered El Mozote anything but a stronghold, in part because \"so many of the people who live there belong to Protestant evangelical sects\" that were notoriously anti-Communist, Joaquin Villalobos, a commander of the dominant rebel group in the area, said in an interview last year. \"That was not fertile ground for us.\" **********After formal exhumations began in 1992 and a United Nations-sponsored Truth Commission pieced together the sequence of events, Secretary of State Warren Christopher ordered an internal investigation. \"U.S. statements on the case were wrong,\" the State Department's final report on the matter, published in 1993, flatly stated. **********Now that a rebuilding effort is under way here, the United States is seeking  to help. The American Ambassador to El Salvador, Alan J. Flanigan, has donated more than $10,000 from his discretionary fund to aid in rebuilding the local elementary school, and United States Government money is also being used for road construction and in well-digging and latrine projects. **********\"Funds donated by the people and Government of the United States,\" proclaims  a shiny metal plaque on a well in the hamlet's ramshackle central square. On Feb. 12, Mr. Flanigan is scheduled to stop in El Mozote in what Embassy officials call a trip to monitor the progress of American-financed projects. **********Since May of last year, Peace Corps volunteers have also been working in the  Morazan area. \"I found an M-16 rifle up there not long ago and I've heard the stories, but I can't even imagine what it must have been like here before,\" one  of them, Kevin Mitchell, a 24-year-old from Oregon, said. **********Some people who live and work here regard this sudden infusion of American aid and support as a belated apology and a tacit admission of guilt on the part  of Washington, which gave billions of dollars in aid to the Salvadoran military  during the war. But in San Salvador, officials at the American Embassy say no, that they are focused on the future, not the past. **********\"The embassy believes that national reconstruction and reconciliation in El Salvador face their sternest tests in those regions of the country, like Morazan, which were the most conflictive during the war,\" said Chris Midura, an  embassy spokesman. \"The long-term success of the accords depends to a large extent on insuring that the benefits of peace,\" including American-financed development projects, \"reach the residents of these zones.\" **********Mindful of the suffering that occurred here, foreign religious and solidarity groups have also donated money and materials for reconstruction and resettlement. The amounts are not large, but they are more than the Salvadoran Government has offered, residents say. **********\"Neither the army nor the Government has helped us rebuild,\" said Maria Luisa Guevara, head of the local chapter of the Committee of Mothers, a Roman Catholic Church group. \"We have asked, but they have given us nothing.\" Her neighbor Mr. Chicas, the beekeeper, added, \"Not even a nickel or a sheet of plastic.\" **********After the United Nations documented the massacre and fixed the blame on the Salvadoran Armed Forces, returning residents put all that and other information  together in a formal request for a pension. Soldiers who fought in the civil war, including many who may have committed human rights abuses, get such a monthly payment, but after two years the people of El Mozote still do not have a response from their Government. **********\"They have never even come to ask our pardon,\" Rufina Amaya said. \"They have  never come to explain why they did what they did, or in any way ever accepted the responsibility for what happened here, and until they do, there cannot be true reconciliation or a just peace here.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/14/business/international-briefs-reed-elsevier-s-profit-surged-19-last-year.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Reed Elsevier's Profit Surged 19% Last Year", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Reed Elsevier's Profit Surged 19% Last Year", "body_text": " **********Reed Elsevier N.V.'s shift from print to electronic media helped to fuel a 19 percent profit gain last year, and the company says it wants to back that strategy with more than $1 billion in additional acquisitions. **********The British-Dutch publisher and information provider said its 1995 pretax profit was L723 million ($1.1 billion), excluding one-time items, up from L620 million in 1994.

Conrail has worked hard to modernize, but a visit to Port Elizabeth underscores that the railroad itself is only part of this Cinderella story. **********Day after day, Conrail freight trains bring hundreds of truck-size containers filled with products for export to a mammoth dock on Newark Bay here. Unloading is so rapid that some containers are on ships on their way out to the Atlantic within hours. And each day, a similar mountain of containers recently plucked by cranes from ships arriving from Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America, ride Conrail trains back into the American heartland, filled with clothing, beer, electronics, toys and other goods. **********Express Rail, as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey calls the transfer service, handles only a small part of the cargo here at the East Coast's busiest port. It also is just a sliver of Conrail's multi-billion-dollar operations. **********But Express Rail did not exist at all six years ago. Its rapid growth is a product of railroad deregulation, new technology and shifting patterns of world trade -- the same factors that have made Conrail an increasingly valuable piece of the nation's freight transportation system. **********The dollar value of Conrail's near monopoly on freight transport over tracks that run as far west as Chicago and as far south as Maryland is not settled. Conrail's preferred merger partner is CSX, the giant rail and shipping company based in Richmond that recently offered more than $8 billion in cash and stock. Norfolk Southern, which is both wooing and suing to win Conrail away from CSX, has offered $9 billion. **********Conrail, formally known as the Consolidated Rail Corporation, was created by the Government in a multibillion-dollar bailout of the bankrupt Penn Central and other Northeastern railroads two decades ago. The Chessie System merged with the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad to form CSX. **********The contest for Conrail comes on the heels of the Union Pacific Railroad's $5.4 billion marriage to the Southern Pacific, itself a response to the merger of the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe railroads in 1995. The deals are defended as necessary to increase efficiency and profits, but, as Express Rail shows, railroads have not relied on consolidation alone. **********''The railroads have snuck up on people,'' said J. Ganson Evans, a Conrail marketing executive who courts customers for Express Rail and other Conrail terminals near the port that also handle container traffic. ''People are surprised at what we are doing today.'' **********What Conrail and other lines are doing is slowing, and in some cases reversing, a decades-long loss of business to the trucking industry. While the public perception is that railroads are crumbling because passenger service is notoriously bad compared with other countries, freight shippers say the American rail network is the best and most efficient in the world. **********Railroads' share of freight traffic, measured by tonnage and distance carried, rose to 40.6 percent last year, from 36.4 percent in 1985, according to Mercer Management, a transportation consulting firm based in Lexington, Mass. **********The recovery has its roots in deregulation of the industry in 1980, four years after the Government began pouring billions into the dying Penn Central and five other lines to replace dilapidated track and rolling stock. Deregulation allowed railroads to drop costly branch lines that generated little traffic, and to quickly add new services to make better use of main lines like those Conrail uses to move goods from here to Chicago, Detroit and other inland hubs. It also freed them to rapidly change prices to meet competition from the far more flexible and reliable truckers. **********''The key is, unlike anywhere else in the world, you have the opportunity to have truly commercial railroads,'' said William Rennicke, a rail specialist at Mercer Management. ''Our productivity is 2 or 3 times greater than in Western Europe and 10 or 20 times that in other parts of the world.'' **********Express Rail is just one of many new services contributing to the freight railroads' slow but unmistakable renaissance. In the West, 110-car trains ferry a single valuable product, low-sulfur coal, from the Powder River basin of Wyoming to distant power plants. **********On the East Coast, CSX transports a million gallons of Tropicana orange juice from Bradenton, Fla., to Philadelphia three times a week on 65-car trains that it turns over to Conrail for a last leg to Kearny, N.J. **********Many services like Express Rail -- called intermodal because they use two or more modes of transportation -- exploit the huge cost advantage that railroads have over long distance trucking by carrying truck trailers that can be attached to cabs near their final destination and containers that can go on either ships or trucks. **********''Intermodal has been growing because railroads continue to bring their costs down and improve the reliability of their service,'' said Donald Schneider, president of Schneider National Inc. The Green Bay, Wis., trucking giant has seen its intermodal business with railroads grow 30 percent a year. **********Huge productivity gains have come from relatively straightforward improvements like raising road overpasses and enlarging tunnels enough to stack containers two high. As the improvements were completed, it became cheaper and faster to land goods pouring out of booming factories in Japan and Korea at West Coast ports and ship them across the country by rail than to ship them to the East Coast via the Panama Canal. **********Conrail spent $64 million on such improvements in Pennsylvania alone to create an eastbound container route south of its main line across New York. West Coast container services then could reach terminals around Harrisburg, the Port of Philadelphia, and, with a handoff to the Norfolk Southern in Hagerstown, Md., cities further south. **********The rail bridge from California grew at the expense of East Coast ports like the Port of New York and New Jersey. But now, with manufacturing moving to Southeast Asia, the same improvements to the rail network are making it attractive to ship containerized goods from there to New York via the Suez Canal and then into the Midwest by rail. **********The benefits of increased global trade have been enhanced by investments in a variety of new technologies. Conrail and others are buying a new generation of locomotives powerful enough to do the work of two of their predecessors. Computerized dispatch centers control traffic more efficiently; satellites are used to pinpoint and repair breakdowns more quickly. **********The railroads' economic revival cost 270,000 railroad employees their jobs from 1980 to 1995, about 60 percent of the total. Conrail's work force was cut to 23,500 from 96,000. **********On the other hand, the railroads' comeback has revived locomotive and rail car manufacturing, saved shippers billions of dollars a year, stimulated world trade and influenced many domestic activities in ways the average citizen might not realize, like allowing utilities to meet clean air regulations by switching to low-sulfur Western coal instead of installing expensive scrubbers. Rail revenue, meanwhile, rose to $32.28 billion last year, from $28.26 billion in 1980. Operating profits doubled to $2.86 billion. **********''The railroads, which were laid out a century ago to serve passengers, have finally found their niche serving commerce,'' said Robert Voltman, director of policy for the National Industrial Transportation League, a Washington-based trade group of manufacturers and other major shippers. ''They are now in a battle to expand that niche.'' **********The battle is tough because many customers are moving targets that are easier for truckers to hit. Railroads typically figure they are on schedule if they pick up and deliver within 24 hours of when they are expected, a big improvement from the days when the window was several days at least. But truckers generally show up within 15 minutes of the time they promise. That is a huge advantage in the just-in-time era, when manufacturers do not want materials until they are ready to process them, and retailers do not want products delivered before they are needed on the shelves. **********''We use rail shipping from plants to our own warehouses, but our customers are now specifying what time of day we have to deliver,'' said Thomas Weikart, director of global logistics for Owens Corning, which spends about $380 million a year shipping Fiberglas insulation and other goods. ''Intermodal is getting very reliable, but if I have to go 500 miles and it has to be there tomorrow, I still use trucks. I'll pay a 5 percent to 10 percent premium to get them.'' **********The biggest problem for the railroads may be overcoming their reputation for indifference, even arrogance, in dealing with many customers. Until deregulation, they paid little attention to selling themselves. **********Conrail, by virtue of its monopoly position, has generally received lower marks than most lines on that score, but those working with it say the situation has improved. Port Authority executives, for instance, say they had to lobby hard to convince Conrail that Express Rail would bring new business to both of them. But once Conrail made the commitment, it became a responsive partner, they say. **********Big customers with a choice of carriers naturally see the biggest improvements. Transportation executives at the Ford Motor Company say Norfolk Southern participated in designing a new vehicle distribution system that is expected to cut inventory costs. **********The railroad is setting up new yards where Ford will send vehicles from several factories, allowing trains to be filled and dispatched to dealers more quickly. And both Norfolk Southern and CSX have asked to be included in planning new methods for handling incoming components to Ford plants. **********''They recognize they have to be more than just movers of goods,'' said Wade Deal, director of supply chain management for Ford. ''Their share of our business could grow substantially.'' **********But many more customers say railroads are still run by people who care more about convenient operations than customers. And retailing experts agree. **********''I still haven't seen the rail industry come up with clever service ideas,'' said Robert Sabath, a retailing expert in Mercer Management's Chicago office. ''It's been their customers pushing them. They used to be one on a one-to-10 scale of customer service. Now they are a 3.'' **********Wall Street, although nervous about whether Norfolk Southern or CSX will end up overpaying for Conrail, has generally been pleased. Rising profits and the prospect of still more mergers as Conrail and its rivals jockey for leverage with customers have lifted rail stocks more than 12 percent in the last year. **********But with just four railroads controlling 95 percent of interstate rail traffic once Conrail is married off, customers and other participants in  the transportation system are increasingly anxious. Many fear price increases or service cuts. Even those anticipating improvements, like the Port of New York and New Jersey, worry that the railroads' efforts to be more competitive could shift business away from them, just as new shipping routes shifted cargo away from it before. **********''What seems to be a modest improvement in the price or service a railroad offers to a particular destination can have a huge impact on where cargo goes,'' said Joseph Curnyn, the facility supervisor at the Port Authority's New Jersey marine terminal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/16/business/at-t-may-cut-fewer-jobs-than-it-initially-estimated.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1996-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 501, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AT&T May Cut Fewer Jobs Than It Initially Estimated", "print_headline": "AT&T May Cut Fewer Jobs Than It Initially Estimated", "body_text": " **********Not three months after it stunned Main Street and delighted Wall Street by estimating that it would cut 40,000 jobs over two to three years, the AT&T Corporation is now predicting fewer reductions. **********AT&T has made no official statement about the smaller numbers.

But the equally important mission was to pick up money, possibly several tons of $5, $10 and $20 bills totaling as much as $20 million in proceeds from street corner drug sales in the United States that were to be brought back to Colombia. **********When the wheels of the old jet got mired in the desert sand, the mission was scuttled. The money, the crew and the cocaine disappeared. **********On April 17, police agents at Benito Juarez International Airport here opened 12 boxes containing new air conditioners bound for Bogota, Colombia. Stuffed inside the Arctic Air window units was $6.2 million in small American bills. **********On Oct. 11, a plane landed near a dam just south of Tepic, in Nayarit state.  Mexican soldiers grew suspicious when they saw the pilot and crew carrying pistols as they left the plane. An army patrol moved in and seized the pilot and the aircraft and six large suitcases filled with more than $12 million in American bills. **********These incidents were signs of a major new problem facing Latin American drug  lords: how to smuggle tons of dollars home, a task that is in some ways even more daunting than smuggling cocaine into the United States. For many years, the cartels relied on financial wizards and manipulation of the banking system to send much of their drug profits home electronically. **********But, American and Mexican drug officials say, since the United States tightened reporting requirements in the early 1990's and pressed legitimate banks to steer clear of money-laundering schemes, traffickers have had to rely more heavily on shipping money in bulk. **********So the drug traffickers are faced with the thorny challenge of physically repatriating their profits. Smuggling out mountains of bills from sales in the United States poses an extraordinary logistical problem. **********Besides overstuffing suitcases and overtaxing aging jets, the gangs get the money home by slipping the bills through tunnels under the border, exporting to  Colombia refrigerators and washing machines bought in the United States with drug proceeds, and exploiting small and mostly unregulated Mexican dollar exchange houses and even legitimate Mexican banks to launder the cash. **********Under Mexican law, the banks and exchange houses do not have to report large  transactions -- as they would in the United States -- and no one knows for certain what goes where. And money-laundering is not a criminal offense in Mexico, but a tax violation. **********Officials of both countries are worried that the flood of narcotics money may also have been used by drug lords like Juan Garcia Abrego, who was arrested by Mexican authorities last week and expelled to the United States, where he faces  drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges, to buy hotels, restaurants, transportation companies and airlines in Mexico. There are even suspicions, voiced by American officials, that laundered drug money may have found its way into the purchases of important Government businesses under the previous administration. **********Raul Salinas de Gortari, the older brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, is being investigated by the Swiss authorities on money-laundering allegations involving more than $100 million he has in secret Swiss accounts. **********The Swiss have so far been unable to prove the money came from drug traffickers or bribes from businessmen, but a report in Money Laundering Alert,  a monthly magazine published in Miami, said that Raul Salinas may be charged with money laundering in the United States. **********While millions of dollars are also laundered through off-shore banks in Panama and electronic transfer operations in other countries, the bulk shipments of money across the Rio Grande are powerful symbols of the growing strength of Mexican drug traffickers who, despite recent blows by the Mexican and American Governments, still maintain a firm hold on parts of Mexico. **********\"These organizations are now in a position where they have the money, resources and influence to affect not only the internal political stability in segments of the Mexican countryside but are increasingly responsible for the propagation of violence in their homeland,\" United States Drug Enforcement Agency officials wrote in a confidential document. **********The drug trade is essentially a cash-only business in which high value goods, produced by a few dominant suppliers, are sold in countless small enterprises spread out over a huge area. Laundering is necessary for the suppliers to return their profits home without being detected. **********The illicit drug trade amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars -- all in cash -- around the world. The small bills used in the illegal transactions weigh more than the equivalent amount of drugs. A kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, of cocaine  brings around $20,000 retail on the streets of New York. Based on an estimate that about 450 paper bills weigh a pound, drug traffickers have to figure out a  way to get around three pounds of $10 and $20 bills back home for every kilo of  cocaine they sell. **********Of course, it is easier to use banking conveniences like electronic transfers to move money around. But in the United States banks have strict reporting requirements that make it possible for government agents to trace the path of such money and bring charges against those involved. **********Ronald K. Noble, American Under Secretary of the Treasury for Enforcement, said that by making the money-laundering process complicated, the Government forces drug gangs to find other methods that leave them more open to discovery. **********\"The more intricate money laundering becomes, the more people are involved and the greater are the chances of somebody making a mistake or of our getting an informant,\" Mr. Noble said. **********Mexico does not have the same kind of reporting requirements as the United States. American officials say it is fairly easy, although risky, to conceal large amounts of illicit cash inside cars and tractor trailers, often packed inside legitimate merchandise, and get it across busy border crossing sites. **********Once inside Mexico, there are several ways the drug gangs send the money back home, laundered and untraced. One is through currency exchange firms. **********A 1991 change in Mexican law forced foreign exchange shops to increase their  capital or stop using the name \"casas de cambio,\" or exchange houses. About 47 big operations met the new requirements and are overseen by banking authorities. More than 2,000 others did not and simply dropped the term and call themselves money centers or exchange centers. They are no longer supervised by fiscal authorities and instead are treated like any other small business in Mexico. **********Jose Antonio Ramirez, director general of the Mexican Association of Casasmselves money centers or exchange centers. They are no longer supervised by fiscal authorities and instead are treated like any other small business in Mexico. **********Jose Antonio Ramirez, director general of the Mexican Association of Casas de Cambio, the regulated group, said it is common for gang members to show up at the unregulated money centers with suitcase stuffed with cash. The money centers either write money orders or transfer the cash to banks, which wire the money to Colombia. **********But that process carries dangers. \"One of the trends we're seeing is a reluctance on the part of gangs to wire transport their money because it can be  traced,\" said an American official familiar with the Mexican drug trade. Since 1993, Mexico has been freely exchanging financial informaiton with the United States that helps track the flow of money, although not as closely as law enforcement officials would like. **********In November 1994, the American Express Bank International, a subsidiary of American Express, agreed to pay a $7 million civil penalty and forfeit more than $25 million in deposits that were made by Juan Garcia Abrego, the Mexican drug lord now in custody in Houston. **********The current indictment presented against Mr. Garcia Abrego is filled with charges that gang members hid money in cars and trucks to get the \"data,\" as it  is referred to in intercepted conversations, across the border. In several cases the trail reached as far as New York City. **********On Feb. 2, 1989, an American named Bill Hoffman went to Queens to pick up a Chevrolet Suburban with New York license plates that was filled with an unknown  portion of $18 million Mr. Garcia Abrego's gang had warehoused. He drove to Brownsville, Tex., and left the Suburban there. It was then driven across the International Bridge into Matamoros, Mexico, the base of Mr. Garcia Abrego's operations. **********Two months later, the indictment says, Mr. Hoffman was again driving south from New York, this time in a 1986 Tioga camper loaded with \"documents,\" and \"receipts,\" which are believed to be code words for cash. He later allegedly traveled back and forth from Texas to New York several times in the recreational vehicle, bringing cocaine north and money south. **********Officials say that after money crosses the border, it is stored at a safe house until enough is accumulated to warrant a flight to South America. That is  what was supposed to take place in the Sonora Desert nearly a year ago. **********According to local police reports and information from American sources, Mexican agents in Sonora's capital, Hermosillo, received their first call just before midnight on March 11, 1994, that a Caravelle jet from Colombia had landed in a remote area of the desert called Campo San Rafael. **********\"But they gave us no coordinates and to get there we had to cross mountains and search through desert,\" said a Mexican official familiar with the case. The  agents arrived at 6 the next morning. **********By then they found the abandoned Caravelle, sunk to its axle in sand. Inside  the ragged interior the police said they found a small bit of cocaine in a briefcase, but nothing else. **********But it turned out that a special crime-fighting force of the Mexican Government had flown over the landing site at night, and with an infra-red camera, filmed the frantic activity on the ground. **********The Mexican authorities would not show the recording, but Mexican and American officials who have seen it said it shows a half dozen pickup trucks and even a tanker truck, probably filled with jet fuel, come up to the jet. The blurry images show several people involved in what the officials believe was the transfer of the cocaine off the jet. Then it shows the pilot trying to rock the  jet out of the sand, unsuccessfully. **********A day after the landing, the police found many of the vehicles. And a day after that they captured a 30-year-old Colombian, Mario Hernando Rendon Cuellar, who was arrested for taking part in the delivery. **********It was Mr. Rendon Cuellar who told the police that the jet had come in to pick up \"a few tons\" of money, and that the cocaine had been loaded at the last minute before leaving Colombia. **********It has been rumored that it was police agents who were filmed unloading the drugs from the disabled jet but both Mexican and American authorities insist that is not true. **********Mexico realizes it has created a haven for drug money laundering and may try  to change its laws to make it a crime instead of a tax violation. **********But although the Attorney General and Congressional leaders have talked about passing a tough new organized crime bill, so far they have not formally begun the debate. There is resistance from some Mexican business leaders who fear that reporting requirements for money exchanges of over $10,000, as proposed, would be a first step toward currency controls, which would limit their ability to move legitimate money. **********Based on their past experiences with the Government, they also are worried that the information they give to agents may somehow be used against them."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/11/business/capital-cities-closes-wire.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-07-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Capital Cities Closes Wire", "print_headline": "Capital Cities Closes Wire", "body_text": " **********Capital Cities/ABC Inc. is closing its United States-based financial news wire, Derivatives Monitor, effective Friday.

He wears a crown of pink feathers, and his entreaties mix with the roar of a nearby tractor on the edge of this boom town: ''Go find a good road; chase away the evil spirits,'' he calls out. **********For Mr. Goncalves, who runs the Kaiowa Indians' house of worship here, prayer is the only defense against an epidemic of suicides that have plagued his people during the last few years. **********''We have to dance very hard and pray,'' said Mr. Goncalves, 48. ''I feel as if I'm losing pieces of myself.'' **********During the last 10 years, some 200 Kaiowa are thought to have killed themselves in this southern region near the border with Paraguay, and anthropologists say they are now seeing suicides among other tribes. While the general rate of suicide among Brazilians is roughly 1 in 28,000, last year as many as 56 of the 28,000 Kaiowa in this region died in what are presumed to be suicides. **********For the Kaiowa, a subgroup of the Guarani Indians, the suicides seem to be tied to their estrangement from the land, on which their traditional life of fishing, farming and worship depended. A peaceful people who tend to withdraw from confrontation, the Kaiowa have, in the span of 75 years, suffered the kind of losses of land, people and culture that have characterized the Indian encounter with Europeans for 500 years. **********When Europeans arrived here, Brazil was home to an estimated five million Indians. At the start of this century, their number had fallen to one million. Now, there are 230,000. **********Since 1945, the Kaiowa have watched their land shrink from 25,000 square miles -- roughly the size of West Virginia -- to 172, and their language and their rituals disappear with the arrival of white colonists and the increase in the number of religious missionaries. In Bororo, which is near Dourados and the center of the surge in suicides, some 6,000 Kaiowa live on 10 acres. **********The wave of suicides has prompted other tribes to gather here, offering prayers and shares of their crops. Government agencies have promised food and seeds, but so far, the Indians here say, Government help has not reached them. **********Late last year, Justice Minister Nelson Jobim pledged to return nearly 4,000 acres to the Kaiowa. But signaling the explosiveness of the contest for land here, federal and military police protected Mr. Jobim as he announced the areas to be turned over. The 40 colonists whose land was earmarked have vowed not to leave; no land has been returned. **********Although the Government Indian protection agency is conducting a census that aims to return the Kaiowa to some of their historic lands, that goal has become more unlikely under a decree that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso signed in January. The decree allows non-Indians to challenge pending and future allocations of land to Indians. Since it was issued, there have been six challenges to Kaiowa lands here. **********The Kaiowa live on the margins of Dourados, an agribusiness center started in the 1940's with a land redistribution that gave each colonist family 75 acres to farm. Now, grain silos and neatly planted fields stretch for miles, while the Kaiowa go hungry, unable to eke out a living on less than an acre per person. **********As a result, the Kaiowa men leave for work in distant sugar cane fields and distilleries. The women, left behind, clean houses, sell trinkets, beg and sometimes turn to prostitution. The most common suicide tales begin with husbands who became alcoholics while away returning home and fighting with their wives. **********''Land is much more than simply a means of subsistence,'' wrote Alcida Ramos, in his book ''Indigenous Societies.'' ''It is the support for a social life that is directly linked to their system of belief and knowledge.'' **********With missionary churches springing up to replace the Kaiowa's religion, and schools teaching Portuguese instead of their native Tupi-Guarani, the suicides are a stark illustration of the Kaiowa's decline. **********''It would disintegrate any people,'' said Orlando Silvestri Zimmer, who runs the local Indigenist Missionary Council, a Roman Catholic organization that works in behalf of Indian rights. **********Mr. Zimmer complained that 28 religious groups, most of them evangelical Protestant, have flocked to the area in recent years to convert the Kaiowa. His own group, he said, does not try to convert Indians. **********Anastasio Moura, a Kaiowa who struggles to grow rice and a few crops to feed his family on a half acre, said his people felt spiritually and physically drained. ''There's nothing left to take away,'' he said. **********In an effort to build up commercial farming, the Brazilian authorities also imported the more assimilated Terena Indians from the north, who have traditionally dominated the Kaiowa, and have taken over some of the most fertile land. **********With a branch, Mrs. Moura traced a rectangle in the dirt to show the land where her parents once grew rice, manioc and potatoes. It was more than seven acres, she said. She then drew a smaller box in one corner denoting her mother's current property. After her father died, she said, the local leader and another Terena demanded three-quarters of the land. **********''They said if she didn't give it over, they would beat her up and burn her house,'' Mrs. Moura said. **********Many here complained that corruption and the power of people called captains were responsible for the loss of lands and the failure of Government aid to reach them. The captains, Indians who were historically appointed by the military as go-betweens with white society, are now elected, but their authority has subverted the influence of religious leaders and the traditions they represent. **********There are also signs that some suicides may mask murders. According to researchers at the State University of Mato Grosso do Sul, as many as six presumed suicides may have been murders, implicating local authorities in a drive to push Indians off the land. Authorities in Dourados deny the accusations. **********The Kaiowa do not themselves ascribe the suicides to specific actions by the Brazilian Government, although they do link it to living near white people. **********''They have bad thoughts,'' said Paulito Aquino, a religious chief who gave his age as 110, and who wore the traditional tambeta, a reedlike stick, through his chin. **********''They are in their houses, but they're thinking, 'Those Indians, they might as well die,' '' said Mr. Aquino."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/27/business/some-analysts-see-a-silver-lining-to-chiron-s-cloud.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-11-27", "snippet": "Outlook for investing in Chiron Corp discussed in light of big price drop spurred by failed clinical trial of firm's new genital herpes vaccine (M)", "word_count": 750, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Some analysts see a silver lining to Chiron's cloud.", "print_headline": "Some analysts see a silver lining to Chiron's cloud.", "body_text": " **********A DAY after the Chiron Corporation's stock fell 17 percent following a failed clinical trial of a new vaccine for genital herpes, some analysts said the event was not entirely negative. At yesterday's closing price of $18.875, up 75 cents, shares in Chiron, which many consider a core biotechnology holding, are now cheap enough to consider buying, they say. **********To be sure, the failure of the herpes vaccine, which came after nearly 15 years of research and $50 million in development costs, is a blow to Chiron. A successful herpes vaccine might have produced as much as 10 percent of Chiron's future revenues. **********But while some analysts accordingly lowered their ratings of Chiron shares Monday, others pointed out that Chiron remained the most diversified of all biotechnology companies. The failure of one product candidate, while more serious for Chiron than for a Merck or a Pfizer, is not a devastating blow because the company has so many other potential drugs and diagnostics. **********''The thing to remember about Chiron is that it is virtually a biotech mutual fund,'' said Michael Murphy, publisher of the California Technology Stock Letter. ''It's in so many different technologies, let alone drugs, that unless someone was so unrealistic as to expect them all to work, the price before yesterday should have assumed that probably two-thirds of them would fail.'' **********Mr. Murphy also noted that Chiron's share price gave it a market capitalization of just over $3 billion, compared with $16 billion for the Amgen  Corporation, which is currently the largest biotech company. ''I think that someday, because Chiron has so much in development, it will have a higher market cap than Amgen,'' he said. ''The idea that Chiron is worth just 20 percent of Amgen I find ludicrous.'' **********Other analysts note that Chiron's management team had repeatedly rescued the company from previous failures. ''They'll find something; they always do, and that's why investors stay in the stock,'' said Mark Simon, an analyst with Robertson Stephens & Company. ''I would look for them sometime in the next 18 to 24 months to pull the next rabbit out of a hat,'' he said. **********Edmund Debler, an analyst with Mehta & Isaly, said Chiron shares were more interesting after the clinical failure. ''We were not active in the stock and now we will be looking at it much more aggressively,'' he said. ''I would not be surprised if it drifted down to $16, where you would have to say that you want to be in Chiron for the long term.'' **********One lingering concern from the herpes trial is that the technology Chiron used in the herpes vaccine, which proved ineffective, is also used in a number of other vaccines under development at the company. In each case, a genetically engineered portion of the virus, known as an antigen, is combined with an immune-enhancing substance of fatty particles known as an adjuvant. ''It would not be an overstatement to say that these results could have a significant impact on all of their vaccine programs,'' Mr. Debler said. **********But Edward Penhoet, Chiron's president and co-founder, said he did not believe that the failure of the herpes vaccine should be read as a failure of the approach. ''In every case the adjuvant has stimulated a better immune response, so there's a lot of evidence that the adjuvant is useful,'' he said. ''We are disappointed, and frankly surprised, by these results, but we certainly don't believe it is a death knell for our vaccine program or anything like that.'' **********Without time to adequately review the data from the trial, Chiron scientists do not know why the vaccine failed, but Dr. Penhoet said he suspected it was due to some peculiarities of the herpes virus itself. Chiron will delay tests of a vaccine for CMV retinitis, a virus that causes blindness in AIDS patients, for up to six months while it reviews the data because that virus is similar to herpes. Trials of vaccines for hepatitis C and H.I.V., both of which use the adjuvant approach, will go forward unchanged. **********Chiron recently filed an application with the Food and Drug Administration for permission to market a genetically engineered pertussis vaccine, and has received a notification of approvability in Italy for an improved flu vaccine.

Britz, group executive vice president at the exchange. **********''We're very excited about it -- it's something that we have been discussing with the Big Board for some months,'' said Lou Dobbs, executive vice president of CNN and chief executive of CNNFN. ''Real-time, live data from the markets is critically important, and this gives our viewers better information.'' **********A number of cable channels carry the ticker, but on a 15-minute delayed basis, so trades that cross the tape at, say, 10 A.M. do not appear on the screen until 10:15 A.M.

''It's no accident we started with television,'' he said, noting its wide availability, which should offer investors easy access to such information. **********Up-to-the-minute quotes are now available only through quote machines from a number of vendors -- services too costly for most individual investors -- or from brokerage firms, some of which provide them through Internet listings. **********But, Mr. Britz said, Internet services that allow people access to real-time quotes require the user to have a personal computer and charge fees for providing this information. **********''Clearly this market is an information-driven market,'' Mr. Britz added.

Though most of the evidence was gathered from 1988 to 1992, the organization said the policy is probably continuing, and it called on China to open its orphanages to international inspection. **********\"We have to acknowledge that we can only take this investigation so far,\" said Robin Munro, the organization's Hong Kong director. **********Human Rights Watch based much of its report on the testimony, medical records and photographs taken out of the country by the Chinese physician, Zhang Shuyun, who fled China last year after an unsuccessful campaign to expose abuses at the  Shanghai Children's Welfare Institute. The information provided detailed medical histories and case studies on dozens of orphans who died from 1988 to 1992, showing that healthy infants admitted to the Shanghai institution often died of  severe malnutrition weeks or months later. **********\"There is compelling evidence that these astonishing death rates are the result of a deliberate policy to minimize China's population of abandoned children, many of whom have been born in violation of the country's family planning regulations and are sometimes physically or mentally handicapped,\" the  group said in a news release today. **********The records show inappropriate changes in medication, the failure to treat severe malnutrition at its onset and blatant medical neglect of life-threatening infections and other conditions, the doctor said. **********The doctor's testimony is buttressed by that of Ai Ming, who was taken to the Shanghai orphanage as an abandoned child and spent 20 years there before leaving China last year. In 1992, he secretly photographed the emaciated bodies of dead  or dying children who were allegedly chosen for \"summary resolution,\" or death,  by staff members seeking to minimize the orphan population. **********\"The fact is that the evidence is really shocking,\" said Mr. Munro, who collaborated with Dr. Zhang and Jeff Rigsby, a freelance journalist, in producing the report. **********Mr. Munro said that even though the organization already had statistics showing high orphan mortality in early 1995, it was unwilling to confront Chinese officials with the evidence until it issued the report today. **********\"Given that there has always been unremitting hostility in China's responses  to our organization, we didn't feel that they would engage us in any way,\" Mr. Munro said. \"So we decided to put out our version first knowing that they would respond.\" **********Human Rights Watch officials said political considerations played no role in  the timing of the report, although it will have an inescapable impact on the deliberations of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in March in Geneva.  The United States and European nations have unsuccessfully sought for the past six years to have the commission approve a resolution condemning China's human rights record. **********China would like the United States to drop the annual confrontation, but human rights organizations have been pressing the White House to mount another effort this year, especially in light of the continuing harsh treatment of dissidents. **********In recent years, thousands of American and European couples have gone to Shanghai, Beijing and other Chinese cities seeking to adopt abandoned Chinese infants from the same orphanages where the abuses are said to be occurring. **********According to officials of Adoptive Family of America in Minneapolis, the national clearing house for adoptive parents, the State Department issued 1,369  visas for Chinese children in 1990-94. The group estimates that an additional 1,000 children came over for adoption since then. **********The new allegations follow earlier reports of \"dying rooms\" in Chinese orphanages, where unwanted or handicapped orphans were left to die of malnutrition. The Communist Party leadership has vigorously denied these allegations in each instance and has said it has a commitment to \"nourish, treat and teach\" orphans. **********Today, China's State Council under Prime Minister Li Peng issued a statement  saying, \"The so-called accusations of 'torture and abuse of disabled children' by the Shanghai Welfare Institute are completely groundless.\" It said that after a \"careful and thorough\" investigation, \"the relevant department of the Shanghai municipal government denied\" the allegations. **********The State Council accused Human Rights Watch and the Chinese who collaborated in the investigation of instigating \"anger,\" \"hostility\" and \"political conspiracy\" toward China. **********Reached by telephone in London, where she is collaborating on a television documentary about her experiences in Shanghai, Dr. Zhang said she decided to leave China with her husband because she and some of her colleagues had \"exhausted all our efforts to report what we had discovered in the orphanage and get the problem corrected.\" **********\"I had no other alternative but to turn to the human rights organizations,\" she said, \"and now I want all the people in the world who believe that justice prevails to know about this.\" She said increased adoption of Chinese infants by  Western couples was saving only a \"small number of children from mistreatment and from being starved to death,\" adding, \"This alone cannot change the Communist Party's policies toward orphanages.\" **********Dr. Zhang's campaign to expose alleged abuses at the orphanage attracted significant support from members of the Shanghai People's Congress, a Communist  Party organization, along with several Chinese journalists and lawyers. They joined in pressing for a full investigation of conditions at the Shanghai institution, but their efforts failed in 1992 after party leaders in the city warned that a public airing of charges would open China to criticism from human  rights groups. **********One of the most vocal of the Shanghai party members who supported Dr. Zhang in 1992 was Hong Dalin, an economist at the Academy of Social Sciences in Shanghai. **********Reached by telephone today, Mr. Hong said he could not discuss the investgation because he was no longer a member of the Shanghai People's Congress. Dr. Zhang maintains that all of the local delegates who supported her  efforts were subsequently purged from jobs or party positions. **********\"I hope to call the attention of the whole society to stop the Chinese Government from persecuting the orphans and witnesses who told us what they saw  and because of that have lost their jobs or been persecuted in other ways,\" she  said. **********The report describes abuses in Shanghai in the 1980's, during the tenure of Communist Party officials who went on to become senior leaders in Beijing, including President Jiang Zemin, who served as Mayor and Communist Party secretary of Shanghai from 1982 to 1989. **********Zhu Rongji and Wu Bangguo, now deputy prime ministers under Li Peng, both served in top municipal posts in Shanghai as the investigation unfolded within the party. **********The Human Rights Watch report singles out Mr. Wu as chiefly responsible for quashing the investigation, overseeing a campaign of persecution and banning any mention of the accusations in Shanghai's state-run news media. Mr. Wu declined requests to comment. **********Huang Jiachun, the deputy director of the Shanghai orphanage, said in a telephone interview that Dr. Zhang's allegations and evidence were \"fabricated\"  and that the Shanghai Supervision Bureau, an investigative arm of the Communist  Party, had proved that the charges of abuse and neglect \"were wrong.\" Orphanage  officials have invited foreign journalists to visit the orphanage on Monday. **********Human Rights Watch said its investigation indicated a \"sinister\" effort by administrators to improve the outward appearance of the Shanghai orphanage since 1993, and alleged that many infant and handicapped orphans are now being transferred to a heavily guarded Shanghai orphanage and mental institution on an island in the Yangtze River. The group warned that continued abuse of orphans has been reported there. **********After spending \"nearly a year gathering and analyzing documentary, testimonial and photographic evidence on the treatment of orphans and abandoned  children in state institutions,\" Susan Osnos, the group's communications director, said in a statement accompanying the report, \"the material reveals a pattern of cruelty, abuse and malign neglect in child welfare work which now constitutes one of the country's gravest human rights problems.\" **********In June, when a British television network broadcast a documentary titled \"The Dying Rooms,\" the Chinese Embassy in London issued a statement saying, \"China has all along attached great importance to the healthy development of children, and is committed to the substantial protection of the rights of children, orphans in particular, by legislative, judicial and administrative means. **********\"The rights of children, including those of orphans, are protected by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Chinese laws prohibit the abuse  of orphans and anybody who violates the relevant laws will be brought to justice.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/world/world-news-briefs-burmese-refuse-to-extradite-drug-lord.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 191, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs;Burmese Refuse To Extradite Drug Lord", "print_headline": "World News Briefs;Burmese Refuse To Extradite Drug Lord", "body_text": " **********The Burmese Government has refused to extradite a reputed opium lord to the United States, where he is wanted on heroin trafficking charges. **********There is no question of extradition with any country,\" Foreign Minister Ohn  Gyaw said on Friday of Washington's request to hand over Khun Sa, who was indicted by a Federal grand jury in New York in December 1989 for drug dealing and who surrendered to Burmese Army forces last month. **********Mr. Ohn Gyaw's comments, at a ceremony to destroy confiscated drugs, were the first time a senior official for Myanmar, formerly Burma, publicly said the  Government had no plans to extradite Khun Sa. **********\"In 1990 we received a request from an embassy to have U Khun Sa extradited,\" he said. \"And we have called to the attention of that particular nation that there never existed any extradition treaty, and we have no intention whatsoever  of an extradition.\" **********Despite the absence of a treaty, Washington has sought the extradition of Khun Sa, who was indicted on 10 counts of importing or attempting to smuggle 3,500 pounds of heroin into New York from 1986 and 1988."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/17/business/l-help-for-social-security-009040.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 133, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Help for Social Security", "print_headline": "Help for Social Security", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********I was surprised that the listed solutions to Social Security's problems did not mention the most obvious and simplest way of keeping the system solvent longer: removing the provision that makes it the most regressive tax ever invented. **********The Federal Government currently takes 6.2 percent of the first $62,500 of earned income.

Mrs. Wazed greeted the victory today at a home in the Dhalmondi district in Dhaka, a few hundred yards from the house, now a memorial, where her father and more than a dozen other relatives died in a hail of automatic fire. **********For Mrs. Wazed the victory, which appeared to have left the Awami League only a few seats short of a majority in the 300-seat Parliament, marked the culmination of almost half a lifetime spent seeking restitution for what was lost when rebellious army officers gunned her family down. Years of exile in India, followed by a decade of struggle to rebuild the Awami League under hostile military governments, left deep scars on Mrs. Wazed, who often seemed driven by a burning zeal for revenge against her family's killers. **********But when she met reporters tonight to claim victory in the election, Mrs. Wazed struck a note of reconciliation that seemed likely to be widely welcomed across this nation of 120 million people, which has often been described as a country desperately in need of better fortune. In its brief history since the 1971 civil war, Bangladesh has been blighted by military coups and assassinations almost as much as it has been by its legacy of grinding poverty and of natural cataclysms, including cyclones and epic floods. **********\"We will heal the wounds, not create new ones, unite the nation, not divide it,\" Mrs. Wazed said. \"We will immediately initiate consultations with all the political forces in the country and begin a process of reconciliation.\" **********For the two countries that emerged from the 1971 war, Mrs. Wazed's victory completed an unusual political symmetry. The two politicians who more than any others drove Pakistan to dismemberment were Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the dominant political figure in what was West Pakistan, and Sheikh Mujibur, his counterpart  in East Pakistan. Both men were later killed, Mr. Bhutto in an execution ordered by the military Government that took power in Pakistan in 1977. Now Mr. Bhutto's daughter, Benazir, is Prime Minister of Pakistan, and Sheikh Mujibur's daughter  is set to become Prime Minister of Bangladesh. **********If Mrs. Wazed succeeds in reaching out to smaller parties for the few votes she lacks for a parliamentary majority to form a new Government, she seems unlikely to produce any new political shocks of the kind Bangladeshis have endured in the past. **********The policies laid out in the election by Mrs. Wazed and her main rival, Khaleda Zia, of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, were virtually identical on all important domestic and foreign issues, including continuation of Bangladesh's free-market economic reforms. **********But because the volatility of politics here has grown from personal enmities, it is far from certain Mrs. Wazed's victory will be accepted. **********As the results on the voting Wednesday were coming in, Mrs. Zia threatened to order her followers into the streets to contest the outcome. Aides to Mrs. Zia,  Prime Minister for the last five years , said she was planning to stage demonstrations against what they described as \"election rigging\" in favor of Mrs. Wazed's party. **********The losing party's assertions of unfairness contradicted at least a dozen election monitoring groups, including several from the United States and Europe, who nearly unanimously endorsed the fairness of the election. Mrs. Zia's party appeared to be positioning itself to pay Mrs. Wazed back in kind for more than two years of opposition street protests and general strikes that destabilized Mrs. Zia's Government and severely damaged what had been a highly successful program of free-enterprise economics reforms. **********Tonight, incomplete results announced by the election commission gave Mrs. Wazed's Awami League a firm count of 133 seats and a lead in 13 other seats, for a possible total of 146 of the 300 seats in the contest. Mrs. Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party won 104 seats and was leading in 10 others, for a possible total of 114 seats. The Jatiya Party, a group that is the personal political vehicle of the last military ruler, Gen. Hussein Muhammed Ershad, won 29 seats and was leading in 5 others, for a possible total of 34 seats. **********Three seats were won, or seemed likely to be won, by a Muslim fundamentalist  group, the Jamaat-i-Islami, which appeared to have been one of the election's big losers, down from 18 seats in the last Parliament, and the three remaining seats went to splinter groups. **********The blow to the Muslim fundamentalists was a major surprise, suggesting that  their efforts to foment opposition to successful social programs in rural areas  of this overwhelmingly Muslim country, including drives to spread literacy and birth-control programs among women, may have backfired in an election in which women voted in record numbers, as high as 80 percent of those eligible in some areas. **********The announcement of the results was complicated by the election commission's  decision to withhold formal proclamation of the winners in 29 parliamentary districts where there were reports of election malpractices or vote-counting problems. While the commission announced which parties were leading in each of the districts, no final outcome will be known until after a repeat round of voting the commission has ordered next Wednesday at some of the polling stations in 27 of the 29 districts. **********Thirty parliamentary seats that are reserved for women will be allocated between the parties in Parliament on a proportional basis. **********The likelihood of any significant change in the election's overall result was slim, since the malpractices cited by the election commission -- and the new voting it ordered -- affected only 123 of the 26,000 polling stations across the country. \"I'm very positive that the election has been fair, it has been transparent, and it has been impartial,\" said Abu Mohammed Hena, a retired senior government official who was called in only two months ago to direct, and  overhaul, an election commission appointed by Mrs. Zia that was widely regarded  as biased. **********But the pride that many felt at having conducted a relatively unflawed election -- and having shaken off, as many Bangladeshis saw it, a reputation for chronic political immaturity -- was mixed with a wariness at what Mrs. Zia's next move might be. With most Bangladeshis exhausted by the tumult of the last two years, and apparently satisfied that the election was fair, staging demonstrations may be more difficult than it was for Mrs. Wazed. **********But Mrs. Zia, 50, has potentially powerful weapons if she chooses to continue the enmity with Mrs. Wazed, not the least of which is that she is the widow of a former military ruler, Gen. Zia ur-Rahman, and has strong backing in the army. **********One option that seemed closed to Mrs. Zia was a coalition to block Mrs. Wazed. Although the balance of power in parliament will be held by the Jatiya Party of General Ershad, who is serving a prison term in Dhaka for corruption during his nine-year rule, Mrs. Zia has accused General Ershad of complicity in  the assassination of her husband, General Zia, in 1981. **********Aides to General Ershad appeared at a news conference tonight to say they would support whichever of the two main parties met their demand for General Ershad's release, but neither the Awami League nor the Bangladesh Nationalist Party seemed in any hurry to comply. **********Mrs. Wazed may yet face uneasy days as she maneuvers to consolidate a parliamentary majority. Her anxieties tonight seemed focused on the Awami League's old nemesis, the army. In her victory statement, she concluded with what sounded like an appeal against any inclination to stage another coup. **********The statement called for \"a smooth transfer of power in line with the will of the people,\" and said: \"At this critical juncture, those heading the different institutions of the Republic must assist this process in every way. There should be no attempt to thwart the electoral will of the people.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/24/business/company-reports-salomon-s-earnings-soared-in-first-quarter-rebound.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Truell", "pub_date": "1996-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 524, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY REPORTS;Salomon's Earnings Soared In First-Quarter Rebound", "print_headline": "COMPANY REPORTS;Salomon's Earnings Soared In First-Quarter Rebound", "body_text": " **********Salomon Inc., recovering from a difficult 1995, said yesterday that its first-quarter earnings more than tripled, to $276 million, from $81 million in the first quarter of last year, thanks to robust securities trading and investment banking revenues. **********Salomon, the parent of one of the largest United States securities firms, Salomon Brothers, and of Phibro, a commodity trading company, reported earnings  of $2.44 a share, far exceeding both analysts' expectations for about $1 a share, as well as the 59 cents a share it reported for last year's first quarter.

More than a million computer network users suffered interrupted or erratic Internet and on-line service connections last week because of a variety of planned and unplanned service shutdowns. **********Because of a single bad line in a computer program, Netcom On-Line Communications Inc. had to shut down its entire national system for 12 hours on Wednesday, affecting more than 400,000 Internet users, most of them businesses. **********The Microsoft Corporation shut down its entire network Sunday for as long as 10 hours as part of a long-scheduled upgrade of the system's backup power supply. But after US West, which was to install the system, said on Thursday that itwas not ready, Microsoft decided to use the scheduled shutdown to do additional system upgrades. The company will have to take its 1 million subscribers off line again in the fall. **********The electronic mail system of America Online, the largest on-line service with more than 6 million subscribers, was knocked out for an hour Wednesday afternoon when a planned system software upgrade backfired. **********Meanwhile, the AT&T Corporation, which entered the consumer Internet market earlier this year, announced that it would shut down its system for as long as 8 hours every week for maintenance, affecting more than 100,000 Internet customers. **********System failures and software bugs are hardly new for the Internet. But the scope of the problems and maintenance announcements last week surprised many observers, as well as the companies involved. **********\"Can you imagine the outcry if AT&T took down the phone system for 8 hours a  week?\" said Dennis Moore, vice president of marketing at the Oracle Corporation, a software data base company that provides services to banks, stock exchanges and other customers who do not like technical surprises. **********Part of the strain on the systems comes from the constant surge of new Internet and on-line service users, thought to be at least 10,000 a day in the United States alone. Part comes from the rapid pace of technological change in Internet hardware and software technologies. And part comes from the chaotic nature of the unregulated Internet itself. **********Unlike the telephone system, which has relatively few service providers and a technical infrastructure that has been tightly regulated for decades, the Internet has thousands of independent service providers, many of them in business only a few years. To compete, they change software and hardware frequently. Technical standards are in flux, whipsawed by the intense competition among companies like Microsoft, Netscape, Sun and Oracle. **********Whatever the causes, the conflict of rising consumer expectations and increasing system crashes are likely to cause a shift in the way Internet services are marketed. **********\"In the next year, competition between providers is going to be based more on reliability than on price,\" said Tom Evslin, an AT&T vice president who heads AT&T Worldnet Services. \"As users make the Internet a part of their daily lives  and businesses, it will be very important that it be available and reliable all  the time. Quality will be one of the key areas of the competition.\" **********Mr. Evslin said AT&T decided to announce the scheduled weekly shutdowns, which occur from 3 A.M. to 7 A.M. Eastern time on Tuesdays and Thursdays, as a way to insure reliable operations at all other times. He said the service does not always go down for the full eight hours, and he noted that as a result of the down time, the service has not had any unscheduled outages. **********AT&T's entry into the Internet service business rocked the industry. The telephone giant already has 90 million long-distance customers, and in promoting its Internet service, AT&T trumpeted its reputation of reliability in the phone  business. **********A spokeswoman for America Online said overall system reliability has improved significantly since 1994, when hordes of new users overwhelmed the service's network capacity, causing widespread shutdowns and slowdowns. The company also has periodic scheduled shutdowns for system maintenance. **********Although Mr. Moore asserted that Oracle's own internal network of 23,000 users was 100 percent reliable, others suggested that fail-safe Internet service for most consumers may not soon be ready. **********Even installing new technologies to provide improved reliability and backup capacity is a nightmare for global Internet providers like Microsoft, 40 percent of whose users are in Europe and Asia. Taking the system down after midnight in  Redmond, Wash., for example, will knock out users in London, Tokyo and Sydney. **********Sara Fitzgerald, a spokeswoman for the Interactive Services Association, whose members come from the telecommunications, on-line and Internet industries, said that rapid subscriber growth, technological upheaval, global network expansion and traditional storm-related summer power problems would likely continue to put stress on networks. **********\"When computers and software and hardware are involved, these these things can happen,\" Ms. Fitzgerald said. \"As the population of users grows to include people who are less technically oriented, there may be less understanding of the problems of keeping systems up. It will take time for everyone to learn more about what is reasonable and what is satisfactory.\" **********The programmer whose botched line of code caused hundreds of Netcom engineers to work all night tracing the bug is still employed. \"He feels bad enough already,\" said David Garrison, president of Netcom in Santa Clara, Calif. \"We are on the learning edge of this new technology, doing it on a scale never done  before.

But they have inconvenienced organizations that include the the Public Access Networks Corporation and the Internet Chess Club. **********And while the federally financed Computer Emergency Response Team at the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie-Mellon University believes the incidents are primarily the work of unsophisticated vandals who are passing around a recipe for this type of break-in, officials concede that there is no easy defense against the attack. **********The response team is preparing a warning that will be distributed over the Internet to government, university and corporate network administrators. **********The attacks, first reported on Sept. 12 by the operators of Public Access Networks in New York actually began about six weeks ago, according to Computer Emergency Response Team officials. The identities of the victims of these earlier attacks have not yet been released. **********By bombarding an Internet server with more than a hundred requests for service each second, each coming from a randomly generated false address, the attacker is able to shut out legitimate users. **********Computer Emergency Response Team officials said they were drafting an advisory that they planned to release by the end of the day today. The warning will detail the nature of the attack and its impact on the Internet community. **********''We have no solution now,'' said Larry Rogers, a senior member of the response team's technical staff.

''It's clear that antisocial individuals with a grudge and a PC can do tremendous damage.'' **********And Alexis Rosen, co-founder of Public Access Networks, said the number of sites attacked might be in the hundreds, based on reports from network administrators who fear being identified. Mr. Rosen said that his company had devised a shield against his particular attacker. But he said that his remedy would not necessarily work against a determined vandal using a more powerful computer. **********Internet sites reporting attacks include at least two chess server computers, which enable users to play chess electronically against remote opponents. **********Daniel Sleator, a professor of computer science at Carnegie-Mellon and an organizer of the Internet Chess Club, said that his organization's host computer had been attacked last week by the flooding program and that the attacks had continued on Monday. **********''The problems are not devastating but they are quite irritating,'' he said. ''I think this is sick, but I guess that is what these guys do.'' **********Mr. Sleator said the club had dealt with the problem by making other ports, or electronic doors, available to its members. **********He said the source of the attack had been traced back as far as Netcom On-Line Communications Services Inc., an Internet provider based in San Jose, Calif. But Netcom officials have had difficulty persuading another Internet service provider to help them trace the attacks further, Mr. Sleator said. **********Several people familiar with the investigation said that security officials were close to identifying at least some of the culprits who were  conducting the attacks. **********Recipes for conducting the attack, which has been known to Internet security experts for some time but never before seen deployed on a widespread basis, were recently published in two underground computer publications, 2600 and Phrack. **********Security officials are concerned because this type of attack exploits the basic design of the Internet itself. The software protocols, or routing instructions, on which the Internet is based were not designed to prevent this message flooding, and so the attacks are difficult to prevent or counteract. **********One partial solution is to configure each Internet service provider's routing computers so that they will not permit users to transmit messages that contain bogus addresses. But since there are now millions of computers connected to the Internet, it would be impossible to make certain that each Internet service provider adhered to this solution. **********Several makers of network server computers were working intently yesterday to develop mechanisms that might protect against the attack. One possibility is using cryptographic, or data scrambling, techniques to make certain that the computer sending a message is positively identified before the recipient computer attempts to process the message. But even if such a solution was perfected, the necessary software would have to be widely distributed before it could act as a widespread deterrent to the attacks. **********Another vexing problem is tracing the location of a malicious computer user who is transmitting false addresses over the Internet. The network was not constructed to make it easy to trace the true location of such a hidden attacker through the network."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/31/world/world-news-briefs-peru-tribunal-denies-us-woman-s-appeal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-01-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 163, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs;Peru Tribunal Denies U.S. Woman's Appeal", "print_headline": "World News Briefs;Peru Tribunal Denies U.S. Woman's Appeal", "body_text": " **********A Peruvian military tribunal today rejected the appeal by an American woman of her conviction and life sentence for helping to lead a Marxist guerrilla group, her local lawyer said. **********\"I received a communique from the Supreme Council of Military Justice saying  that Lori Berenson's sentence has been confirmed and her appeal rejected,\" said  the lawyer, Grimaldo Achahui. **********A secret military court on Jan. 11 convicted Ms. Berenson, 26, of Manhattan, on charges that she was a member of the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement in Peru. **********The decision angered her family and lawyers, who said she had not been given  a fair trial. **********Mr. Achahui said he was \"surprised\" and \"disappointed\" by the failure of the  appeal. **********\"They do not have a case in law,\" he said. \"They have failed completely to answer the points raised by the defense.\" **********Ms. Berenson has already begun her life sentence at the Yanamayo maximum security prison in the Andean city of Puno."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/10/world/returnees-complain-that-cuba-reneged.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Returnees Complain That Cuba Reneged", "print_headline": "Returnees Complain That Cuba Reneged", "body_text": " **********Ten months after 13 Cubans were forced to return to their country after trying to flee to the United States, they contend that neither the Cuban nor the American Government has lived up to an agreement that they would face no retribution when they returned. **********The Cuban Government, they complain, has from the day of their return carried out a campaign of reprisals, intimidation and harassment against them.

The delegation's contacts laid the foundation for the close ties that later developed between Rome and Washington. **********In 1947 Mr. Ortona was posted to the Italian Embassy in Washington when the Prime Minister, Alcide De Gasperi, made a visit to the United States that secured Italy's inclusion in the Marshall Plan and its membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which was established in 1949. **********In 1959 Mr. Ortona became Italy's delegate to the United Nations.

An additional 40,000 are listed as ''disappeared,'' thousands more have been raped, tortured or illegally detained, and more than one million have been forced into exile by the violence or displaced from their homes. **********Formally, the bill approved late today is not an amnesty at all, but a ''law of National Reconciliation'' that ''extinguishes criminal responsibility'' for offenses deemed to be political. That terminology appears to have been chosen because a 1994 accord between the two sides that was brokered by the United Nations prohibits the Guatemalan Government from ''promoting'' any measures to prevent the prosecution of human-rights violations. **********With members of the public not allowed into the gallery, the final debate was witnessed only by reporters and the 80 members of Guatemala's national assembly.

Their version also would have specifically prohibited immunity from prosecution not only for those who took part in such activities, but also for those who ordered them or covered them up, including senior military officers and guerrilla commanders. **********Though the Government's original draft bill did not mention genocide as an offense, human-rights groups did not see the addition of that term as a significant victory.

His government was overthrown in 1989, and one of its legacies was orphanages filled with unwanted and neglected children. **********Another legacy of those horrific years, for Romania's women, is abortion. Some 10,000 women are believed to have died from complications of illegal abortions, and many more were permanently maimed. **********Abortions were legalized as soon as Mr. Ceausescu was toppled, and  contraception is theoretically available through the state health system. **********But overwhelmingly, Romania remains what Western doctors call an ''abortion culture,'' with an abortion rate that remains the highest in Europe. It also has by far the highest rate of pregnancy-related mortality, the strongest indication that Romania continues to lag far behind the rest of Europe and Russia in providing reproductive health services for women. **********According to the United Nations Population Fund, Romania had 3.2 abortions for every live birth in 1990. By last year, the rate was 2.2 abortions per live birth. In 1995, the equivalent rate was 2.0 in Russia, 0.67 in the Czech Republic and Hungary and 0.2 in Germany. **********The reasons why Romanian women turn to abortion center on the reluctance of the Government to promote family-planning despite healthy doses of Western aid to help the country establish such services, Western and Romanian doctors say. Iulian Mincu, who was Minister of Health until recently and who had been a personal physician to Mr. Ceausescu, publicly stated his opposition to family planning. After a public outcry over poor conditions in the health system, Dr. Mincu was dismissed this summer by Mr. Ceausescu's successor, Ion Iliescu, in an attempt to clean up the Government's image before parliamentary and presidential elections that Mr. Iliescu lost anyway. **********The President-elect, Emil Constantinescu, made it clear during his campaign that he would make improved health services a priority, and family planning advocates said they were optimistic that the new Government would be more supportive of their efforts. **********Without guidance from the Government, many Romanian doctors have been more enthusiastic about the more lucrative work of performing abortions than about recommending birth control, said Daniela Draghica, one of the administrators of 12 pilot family-planning clinics in Romania opened in 1995 and financed by the United States Agency for International Development. **********The state pays for abortions, but as with almost all public health services women say they feel obliged to give the doctor a sizable extra payment, thus making abortions more financially rewarding. **********A 28-year-old woman who would give only a first name, Adina, was at the gynecological clinic at Giulesti Hospital in Bucharest. She said she had had six abortions. An abortion costs 3,000 lei, a little less than $1, at public hospitals, where the vast majority of Romanians get their health care. But she said she had paid an additional $7 as a ''gift'' to the doctor. **********On top of this, many doctors, repeating myths from the Ceausescu years, tell women exaggerated stories that oral contraceptives are deleterious to their health, Mrs. Draghica said. **********''Women had these myths about contraception,'' Mrs. Draghica said. ''The doctors had told them that pills were bad because they made women fat and gave them heart disease. It's a battle to get their confidence.'' **********Some women are beginning to look for other alternatives. Maria Staicu, 41, who lives in the city of Sibiu and has two children, said the pain and debasement she endured in 1991 when she had a legal abortion left her determined not to go through it again. **********''They did 20 women in a few minutes: 'Ready, go; ready, go,' '' she said, describing the atmosphere in the state hospital. In the last five years of the Ceausescu regime, she had managed to buy Hungarian-made oral contraceptives on the black market, she said. After her abortion in 1991, she was fitted with an I.U.D.. ''I would prefer anything else than an abortion,'' she said. **********Romania remains the only country in Eastern Europe not to manufacture any kind of contraceptive. Thus supplies, including condoms, must be imported and are too expensive for many women, who say they have trouble even getting food on the table in the chaotic Romanian economy. Birth control pills imported from Hungary, the Netherlands or Germany cost as much for a month's supply -- or in many cases up to two or three times as much -- as an abortion, even though Western aid helps subsidize some of the cost. **********The Western aid stems from publicity in 1990 about the plight of the unwanted Romanian children. Foreign assistance was sent to help care for the children, and for a longer-term solution, funds were offered to create family- planning services, including a $14 million World Bank loan and a $5 million grant from the United States Agency for International Development. **********In the last year, a little progress has been made, but not enough given the resources that have been made available, those who work in the program say. **********According to a report by Adriana Baban, a psychologist who counsels at one of the Romanian family-planning clinics funded by the A.I.D., and Dr. Henry P. David, director of the Transnational Family Research Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington, Romania had at least 445 deaths attributable to illegal abortion in 1989. By 1992, the number had been reduced to 120 and last year to 59. **********But despite these reductions of deaths from self-induced abortions, the pregnancy-related mortality rate remains startlingly high. The World Health Organization reported that in 1990, for every 100,000 live births in Romania, 84 women died in childbirth. By contrast, the rate in Poland was 19. Last year, the number in Romania was 48. In the United States last year, the rate was 8, according to the Population Reference Bureau."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/07/world/former-mexican-official-held-in-us-gains-partial-freedom.html": {"writer_name": "Anthony Depalma", "pub_date": "1996-03-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 574, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Former Mexican Official, Held in U.S., Gains Partial Freedom", "print_headline": "Former Mexican Official, Held in U.S., Gains Partial Freedom", "body_text": " **********Under heavy guard and intense secrecy, a former Mexican Deputy Attorney General who spent a year in American jails was whisked out of a New Jersey jail  to partial freedom today while the Governments of Mexico and the United States struggled to find a way to send him back to Mexico to stand trial. **********Mario Ruiz Massieu left the Union County, N.J., jail before dawn this morning wearing a bullet-proof vest and an electronic identification bracelet that will  tell officials his whereabouts.

But if the Thompsons do prevail, the case could establish a precedent that would force big changes in the way investment advisers do business, the lawyers say. **********The Thompsons contend that the Glenmede Trust Company of Philadelphia breached its fiduciary duty by keeping the family in the dark about Glenmede's role in a September 1990 deal involving stock of the Oryx Energy Company. The deal was a $1 billion purchase by Oryx of 18 million of its shares at $53.75 each from the Pew Charitable Trusts. Had the Thompsons known Glenmede's opinion of the stock's value and potential, the Thompsons maintain, they could have taken action to protect their own substantial holdings. **********Glenmede executives said they did inform the Thompsons about the transaction within 48 hours of its announcement. Not only that, they add, but they offered to negotiate the sale of the family's Oryx shares and were turned down because the family's leader, B. Ray Thompson Jr., did not want to pay capital gains taxes. **********Two years later, after Oryx shares had slumped by more than half and the Thompsons had sold  more than two million shares at an average price of $25, several family members and their charitable foundations sued Glenmede in Federal District Court here, contending a loss of $80 million resulting from a Glenmede ''conspiracy.'' The suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages. **********Glenmede executives counter that they were honor-bound to respect the confidentiality of their discussions with Pew officials and add that they were under no obligation to disclose to any client the strategy devised for any other customer. **********The trial opened last week. Besides the attention generated by the connections to the Pew Charitable Trusts -- the second-most-generous philanthropy in the nation after the Ford Foundation -- the investment community is watching closely because of the potential impact on the way it does business. **********All the parties involved have ties to the Sun Company, the marketer of Sunoco gasoline. The Pew Charitable Trusts were set up by the children of the founder of Sun, Joseph N. Pew; Glenmede was chartered in 1956 to administer the trusts and began accepting other clients in 1979, and the Thompson family became a client of Glenmede  after selling its coal mining company to Sun for Sun shares. The family is Sun's second-largest shareholder after the Pews. **********In the suit, the Thompsons say Glenmede had a fiduciary duty as their investment adviser to inform them about the planned $1 billion share purchases or, failing that, at least to recommend that they get outside advice on their Oryx stock -- in effect tipping them off that something was up. **********''The Thompsons' entire fortune was at stake and they relied on Glenmede to advise them and feel the advice was not given, and, accordingly, the loss resulted,'' said James Binns, the family's attorney. **********Mr. Binns said Glenmede set itself up to get stuck between a rock and a legal hard place by trying to serve the Pew Trusts as a nonprofit venture while also dealing with paying customers whose portfolios might be affected by the Pew Trusts' holdings. ''When Glenmede changed its policy to one of going into the market and seeking other clients, it placed itself in an irreconcilable position,'' he said. **********So why didn't the Thompsons take up Glenmede's offer to sell their holdings? First, Mr. Binns said, the share price plummeted on news of the huge Pew Trusts deal, falling to levels far below a fair market price. After two years spent trying to learn more about the circumstances of Oryx's stock purchase from the Pew Trusts and after attempts to resolve the dispute privately, the Thompsons say, they filed suit. **********Experts on securities law question whether the Thompsons, or any client, can demand the same treatment for all investors from a single advisory firm. Fred Lipman, a partner at Blank, Rome, Comisky & McCauley in Philadelphia, who specializes in securities law, could think of no legal grounds for sharing arguably privileged information about one client with another client. Indeed, it is customary for investment counselors to give preferential treatment to their biggest and best-paying customers. **********A victory in court by the Thompsons could establish a precedent that changes the nature of fiduciary relationships, lawyers say. It could lead to new contract language or, potentially, cause firms to create protective ''Chinese wall'' agreements specifying that not all clients will receive the same level of service, Mr. Lipman added. **********He said Glenmede lawyers might try to show that the Oryx-Pew deal was a ''special situation'' calling for unusual privacy to avoid accusations of insider trading or other conflicts. **********''If giving priority to larger investors is viewed as a breach of fiduciary duty, that would put companies in an impossible situation,'' Mr. Lipman said. ''If there's an equal right to treatment in trust services it could definitely affect the ability to favor the larger customer. The market operates in a matter of minutes, if not seconds, so notifying everyone simultaneously would be impossible.'' **********James L. Kermes, chief executive of Glenmede, said his firm acted in accordance with established legal practices in the Oryx purchase of the Pew Trusts' shares. Within days of its announcement, he said, ''We contacted all of our clients who owned Oryx shares and explained what happened and that if they wanted to sell their shares they could and we would help them. **********''Mr. Thompson indicated he did not want to sell because of the capital gain,'' Mr. Kermes said. However, ''Two years later, with the stock down from $54 to $25, he then initiates the suit saying we should have included him in that sale.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/12/business/new-york-festivals-names-5-winners.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Levere", "pub_date": "1996-06-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 219, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New York Festivals Names 5 Winners", "print_headline": "New York Festivals Names 5 Winners", "body_text": " **********The New York Festivals has named five grand Best of Show winners at the 38th annual international print and radio competition. **********In print, there were four winners: the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago, for the best consumer campaign, for Altoids Mints, which are marketed by a unit of the Philip Morris Companies; Euro RSCG Ball Partnership in Singapore, a unit of Euro RSCG, for the best newspaper advertising, for the Samaritans, a society dedicated to the prevention of suicide; Lewis Moberly in London, for the best design for a package, for Boots Childrens' Batteries, marketed by the Boots Company P.L.C., and Wunderman Cato Johnson in Eschborn, Germany, a unit of Young & Rubicam Inc., for the best direct mail, for Andersen Consulting. **********The Toronto office of Young & Rubicam won the award for the best radio campaign, for its ads for Covenant House.

For businesses, giving their employees NC's, instead of more powerful and versatile PC's, could supposedly save thousands of dollars each year in operating costs per machine. **********In contrast to that approach, Microsoft and Intel executives said today that their competing design would be closer to the original PC -- though one that would not use floppy disks and could not be modified by the user. The machines would cost only slightly less than conventional PC's, the companies said, but would reduce the administrative costs for corporate networks. The companies refer to this new approach as the Net PC. **********''Think about the Net PC as the next evolution of the PC platform,'' said Pat Gelsinger, a vice president and general manager for Intel. **********The new technology is backed by most of the leading makers of PC's that are based on Intel chips and run Microsoft's Windows operating system software: Compaq Computer, Dell Computer, Digital Equipment, Gateway 2000, Hewlett-Packard, Packard Bell, NEC and Texas Instruments. But I.B.M., the second-largest PC maker, did not announce its support today, opting instead to stick with the NC standard. **********Machines based on the new Net PC standard would consist of a Pentium processor, 16 megabytes of memory, a hard disk, a network connection and a slot for reading a smart card to enable various people to each have their own user profile for that specific machine, which would be stored on a network server computer and downloaded. The first of these computers is not expected to reach the market until next year. **********Computer industry analysts said that Intel and Microsoft had been slow in reacting to the emerging threat, but that the new Net PC standard proposed today had a good chance of claiming broad support among corporate buyers. **********''If they hadn't figured out how to enter this market they were in danger of losing a huge amount of market share,'' to network computers, said Amy Wohl, a computer industry consultant. **********Microsoft also announced today what it called a ''zero administration initiative'' for its Windows software. Microsoft executives said that they would offer a set of software enhancements that would allow greater centralization of the updating, software installation and administration of PC's on a corporate network. **********According to Paul Maritz, a Microsoft group vice president, the new software capabilities will be deployed in stages in a new version of Windows due out next year, as well as in a future version of Windows NT. **********Microsoft executives said that on Wednesday the company's chairman, William H.

in two to three years by contributing a female animal for each one they had initially received to cooperative animal banks.IFAD would then integrate the fresh livestock into the lending pool \u2014 a

money.Agencies like IFAD have had difficulty getting funds to those who need it in Bosnia because postwar conditions do not allow ordinary lending requirements to be met. **********The economy of Bosnia-Herzegovina is heavily dependent on agriculture, with a major emphasis on sheep and cattle.But war has decimated the population of meat and milk animals.The government estimates that country's livestock count has fallen by 70 percent. **********A study by an IFAD team that visited the area in central Bosnia chosen for the animal banking project said, \"Cow sheds and barns have been burned

Blinder has told the White House that he will leave as vice chairman  of the Federal Reserve when his term ends in two weeks, Fed officials said yesterday. **********Mr. Blinder, who was named to the Fed in June 1994, has been the chief voice  within the nation's central bank for lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy. His departure comes at a moment when the economy appears to be weakening. The Fed's control of short-term interest rates gives it powerful leverage to try to stem any such weakness, which could become an issue in this election year. **********The letter announcing Mr. Blinder's decision, sent to the White House yesterday, ended speculation that President Clinton might try to keep Mr. Blinder in place as the Administration's most influential appointee to the Federal Reserve. **********Mr. Blinder, a widely respected academic economist from Princeton University, was Mr. Clinton's first appointee to the Federal Reserve's seven-member board of governors. There was some talk at the time that Mr. Blinder, who served on the White House's Council of Economic Advisers in 1993 and early 1994, would eventually be the President's choice to replace Alan Greenspan as chairman. Mr.  Greenspan's current term ends in March. **********The Republican Congressional victory in 1994 put an end to White House hopes  that Mr. Blinder -- often regarded on Wall Street as too willing to tolerate some inflation to keep the economy growing -- could ever gain Senate approval to replace Mr. Greenspan. Recently, however, Administration officials had considered asking the Republican Senate to approve Mr. Blinder's reappointment as vice chairman as part of a package deal that would give Mr. Greenspan another term as chairman. **********Mr. Blinder is expected to announce his departure today. A White House spokeswoman would not comment, saying it was up to Mr. Blinder to make public any announcement that he is leaving the Fed at month's end. **********Wall Street, which traditionally prefers strong anti-inflationary policies from the Fed, is expected to be glad to see Mr. Blinder leave. \"The constituency for easy money -- low rates -- at the Fed has just lost one of its most outspoken champions,\" said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. **********In his letter, Mr. Blinder, who is 50, is said to have told Mr. Clinton that  he must return to Princeton at the end of this month, when his Federal Reserve term expires. By law, he could have remained as vice chairman until Mr. Clinton  appointed and the Senate approved a replacement. But by failing to return to Princeton now, he would risk losing his tenured position as an economics professor. **********Mr. Blinder often said that he intended to return to Princeton, from which he has been on leave for three years, all of it spent working in the Clinton Administration. For a while, though, he considered giving up teaching for a career in Washington, an alternative now discarded. **********His departure leaves two unfilled seats among the seven Fed governors. John P. LaWare, who had been named by President George Bush, resigned last year, and  Mr. Clinton's attempt to appoint Alicia H. Munnell, a Treasury official, as Mr.  LaWare's replacement met a storm of protest in Congress. The White House never formally submitted her name, sending Ms. Munnell instead to the Council of Economic Advisers. **********That was more than six months ago, and the White House has made no new attempt to fill the Fed vacancy. Now Mr. Clinton will have two positions to fill, though it is not clear whether he can win Senate confirmation this year for any new member in Mr. Blinder's mold. **********Within the next few weeks, Mr. Clinton is widely expected to announce the reappointment of Mr. Greenspan, who faces little opposition in Congress, to a third term as the Fed's chairman. **********In addition to Mr. Blinder, Mr. Clinton had also placed Janet L. Yellen, an economist on leave from the University of California at Berkeley, on the Fed board. But he has never been able to tilt the balance of power toward his appointees. **********If Ms. Munnell had become a Fed governor, three Democrats might have changed  the equation, leading to greater pressure for lower interest rates than Mr. Greenspan might have preferred. The remaining governors, including Mr. Greenspan, were appointed by Mr. Bush or President Ronald Reagan, and fell readily in line with the chairman's views of what should be done. **********Not that Mr. Blinder was so far apart from Mr. Greenspan. On basic issues, such as how rapidly the economy could expand or how much the unemployment rate could fall without creating shortages that would push up inflation, the two men  did not really differ that much. More than anything, when Mr. Blinder argued at  Fed policy meetings for lower rates, as he did late last year, or resisted rate  increases, as he did in the fall of 1994, he did so because he sometimes saw less danger of inflation than Mr. Greenspan and more risk of recession. **********Whatever the differences, they were not so great that Mr. Blinder ever went so far as to vote against Mr. Greenspan in the Fed's policymaking meetings. Such a dissent would have drawn headlines and roiled the bond market. **********The Fed last cut rates, by a quarter-point, on Dec. 19. Mr. Blinder's decision to leave means that he will not participate at the Fed's Jan. 30 and 31 policy-making meeting. But with inflation low and the economy showing some signs of weakening, bond traders are betting that the Fed, with or without Mr. Blinder, will lower interest rates another half-point or so in the coming months."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/27/business/international-briefs-dutch-printer-maker-buying-a-siemens-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Dutch Printer Maker Buying a Siemens Unit", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Dutch Printer Maker Buying a Siemens Unit", "body_text": " **********The Dutch printer and copier maker Oce-van der Grinten said yesterday that it had agreed to pay around 900 million guilders ($552 million) to take over the printing arm of the Siemens Nixdorf unit of Siemens A.G. of Germany.

Higher rates in  the United States would make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors, especially in relation to investments in Japan, where interest rates  have been kept extremely low in an effort to stimulate the long-stagnant economy. **********While the complaints from American executives have worried some currency traders, the executives' concerns have not carried a great deal of weight among  economic policy makers so far. Neither the American nor Japanese Government has  expressed public concern about the dollar's strength, and both have indeed suggested that they are relatively happy with current exchange rates. **********At their meeting in Lyons, France, last month, top officials of seven leading industrial nations said the rebound of the dollar in the preceding 15 months and the general direction of exchange rates were \"positive and promising.\" **********The dollar has also gained against other major currencies, including the German mark. The dollar was quoted at 1.5263 marks in late trading today, up slightly from 1.5261 marks. In April 1995, the dollar reached a low of 1.3675 marks. **********Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin and other Clinton Administration officials have repeatedly said that a strong dollar is good for the United States and that the currency's level should reflect economic fundamentals. **********At the moment, they said, the dollar's strength is a function of such factors as low inflation, a reduced budget deficit, steady growth, falling unemployment  and improved corporate efficiency. **********And Mr. Rubin's deputy, Lawrence H. Summers, said: \"We're concentrating on strong fundamentals that are ultimately important for competition and for markets. The American economy is very strong and doesn't need currency-induced adrenaline.\" **********In the mid-1980's, when the dollar was worth more than 200 yen, American manufacturers would have been thrilled with an exchange rate of 110. Moreover, American industry generally has cut costs and greatly improved efficiency in the last decade, allowing many companies to absorb currency fluctuations with less strain. **********A stronger dollar makes American products more expensive in terms of foreign  currencies, and allows foreign exporters to cut prices or benefit from higher profit margins in the United States. A strong dollar can benefit American manufacturers to some degree by pushing down prices for parts they purchase abroad. **********But in industries most subject to competition from Japan, including automobiles and other heavy equipment, there have been increasingly loud complaints in recent weeks that the dollar's rise may need to be checked. **********The latest and most explicit comment came today in Tokyo from Donald V. Fites, chairman and chief executive of Caterpillar Inc., the earth-moving equipment company, whose main competitor is Japanese. **********\"The recent dramatic weakness of the yen against the dollar is most worrisome and may demand attention from governments,\" said Mr. Fites, who is also chairman of the U.S.-Japan Business Council, at a business conference. \"The yen at 111 to the dollar has the potential to erase and reverse the recent beginning of improvement in our bilateral trade balance.\" **********American auto makers have also made clear that they are concerned. Robert J.  Eaton, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, brought up the dollar in a meeting  with White House aides last month. The Big Three are worried that the stronger dollar will give Japanese car companies greater ability to lower their prices. **********In a statement today, the National Association of Manufacturers warned that one result of an interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve would be to \"hurt U.S. sales overseas by raising the value of the dollar.\" **********Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman, said last month that an exchange rate of 110 yen to the dollar was reasonable, although he also suggested that this was near the high end of what the United States should consider acceptable. **********Other economists said that the current exchange rate struck a good balance between the needs of the American and Japanese economies, but that a further substantial rise could create economic and political pressure to force the dollar back down. **********\"At 110, it's the level of exchange rate at which Japanese industry is making money, but one that will not produce major deterioration in the current account,\" said David Hale of Zurich Kemper Investments. **********A decline last year by the dollar against the yen helped narrow the trade deficit with Japan somewhat. Economists said that at the current exchange rate,  the United States would probably not see any further currency-driven improvement in its trade balance after this year, but that the trade deficit should benefit  from strengthening economies of Japan and other major trading partners. **********\"I still think we're in pretty good shape and that we could see an even higher dollar and still get improved exports if the European and Japanese economies live up to their potential,\" said Joseph Liro, an economist at CIBC Wood Gundy. \"What we have going for us now is very clear cost competitiveness vis-a-vis Japanese and German producers.\" **********As a result, he said, American manufacturers can weather, and policy makers in Washington would tolerate, a rise in the dollar to perhaps 115 yen. **********\"If the Fed does start tightening and the dollar starts to appreciate to around 115 yen, we would start getting clear and unambiguous talk out of the Administration that that is unacceptable,\" Mr. Liro added."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/25/world/year-after-rabin-fell-israel-is-no-closer-to-unity.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Greenberg", "pub_date": "1996-10-25", "snippet": "Israelis observe first anniversary of Yitzhak Rabin's assassination according to Jewish lunar calender; they seem overwhelmed and troubled by deep division in their society exposed by slaying, which seems to have only deepened in past year; photo ...", "word_count": 889, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Year After Rabin Fell, Israel Is No Closer to Unity", "print_headline": "Year After Rabin Fell, Israel Is No Closer to Unity", "body_text": " **********At the spot where Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated last year, someone put up a homemade sign today, above the flowers and candles brought by crowds of Israelis who gathered to mark the Jewish calendar anniversary of the Prime Minister's death. **********''A year has passed and half the nation has already forgotten,'' the poster said.

''A year has passed since the murder of the Prime Minister, and we still have not learned to live with one another, to talk to one another.'' **********Uzi Baram, a Labor Party leader, said the confrontation was between two communities with vastly different outlooks. ''It's foolish to think that there is a solid majority facing a lunatic fringe,'' he said. ''There's a very large public that is hurting, facing a public that is not small, which has a different value system, and sees the murder differently. It is bowing its head today until the storm passes, but it exists and can still act.'' **********Nissan Rubin, a sociologist at Bar-Ilan University, a religious institution where Mr. Amir was a student, said significant numbers of religious Israelis actually saw the assassination as a kind of divine miracle that had saved them from Mr. Rabin's policies. **********Others simply avoided soul-searching, or went on the defensive in the face of attacks on the Orthodox community by secular Israelis enraged by the killing. ''This community was pushed into a corner, and when you're under attack it's difficult to admit your mistakes -- you close ranks,'' Professor Rubin said. **********Education Minister Zevulun Hammer, the leader of the National Religious Party, defended the religious community in a television program marking the assassination. ''I don't accept that the shots are always fired from one side,'' he said. ''A tremendous effort must be made to avoid putting a whole community into a corner and saying that the whole system is distorted. There is one person who failed. If you really want to bring about a change, there should be more tolerance, more unity in order to talk and reach understanding.'' **********Mr. Netanyahu sounded a similar chord today in an address to a memorial meeting of Parliament. ''Healing the rifts in the nation is vital for achieving real peace with our neighbors,'' he said. ''Peace begins at home.'' **********But Moran Mondry, a high school senior visiting the street memorial for Mr. Rabin, said she had seen precious little reconciliation, and that peace efforts were faltering. ''After the killing I was sure everything would be different, and that there would be more unity among people,'' she said. ''But they are still the same, they are continuing to behave violently, and there's still no peace. Everything is going backward, and what was built is being destroyed.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/29/business/the-limited-plans-a-big-buyback-of-stock.html": {"writer_name": "Stephanie Strom", "pub_date": "1996-01-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 612, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Limited Plans a Big Buyback of Stock", "print_headline": "The Limited Plans a Big Buyback of Stock", "body_text": " **********The Limited Inc., the specialty- store company that operates the Limited and  Lerners chains and has a controlling interest in the company that operates Victoria's Secret, yesterday announced a $1.62 billion stock buyback apparently  intended to lift the value of its shares, which have languished. **********The company said its board had approved a tender offer to repurchase as many  as 85 million shares, or 23.7 percent of the total shares outstanding, at $19 apiece. The offer is scheduled to start on Feb. 1 and end on March 6. **********The Limited shares closed on Friday at $16.50, up 50 cents, on the New York  Stock Exchange. **********Leslie H. Wexner, the Limited's president, chairman and chief executive as well as its largest shareholder, will not sell any shares in the buyback. Instead, he will have the option of selling to the company 18.75 million, or 27.4 percent, of his 68.5 million Limited shares at $18.75 apiece for three years starting in 1998. **********If he does not exercise that option, the company, which is based in Columbus, Ohio, will have the right to buy those shares from him at $25.07 apiece for six  months starting in July 2001. **********The constraints that the board placed on Mr. Wexner's ability to benefit from the stock repurchase program might have been intended to quell the concerns of some large investors. **********Limited said last summer that as part of a revamping intended to increase shareholder value, it would partly spin off some of its businesses and distribute the proceeds to shareholders as a special tax-free dividend of about  $5.50 a share. **********Several large mutual and pension funds that owned Limited stock objected to the dividend because its biggest beneficiary would have been Mr. Wexner, who, with his mother, Bella Wexner, own 23.6 percent of the shares outstanding and would have received $463.1 million in tax-free dividends. **********\"There was a sense in the investment community that he was in this just to enhance his own interests,\" said Jeffrey Edelman, a retail analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. **********After discussions with its shareholders, the company scrapped that plan in favor of the one announced yesterday. The company said the deal it had struck with Mr. Wexner to buy 18.75 million of his shares on his demand represented somewhat less than the number of shares he could have sold as part of the tender offer. If he opts to make the company buy those shares in two years, he will receive roughly $350 million; if the company opts to buy them from him in 2001,  he will receive about $470 million. **********Mr. Edelman estimated that the stock buyback would add as much as 40 cents to the Limited's earnings going forward. In part, the program will reduce the number of shares outstanding. But the company will also earn interest on the approximately $340 million that it will retain from the proceeds of the spinoffs. **********\"Theoretically, this is an immediate step-up in shareholder value of between  $4 and $6 a share,\" he said. **********In a statement, Mr. Wexner gave investors a preview of the company's 1995 results, which will be issued in late February. He said the company expected to  report that last year, excluding one-time gains from the spinoffs, it earned $305 million to $320 million, or 85 to 90 cents a share -- less than analysts have been estimating. **********He said that because of severe weather in the Northeast and Midwest in January and a holiday sales season \"which was clearly off-trend,\" the company would not make any projections for 1996. He did say, however, that the Limited's operating profits this year \"should be no less than 1995, with the potential to  show significant improvement.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/05/business/crh-of-ireland-to-buy-us-concrete-maker.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-09-05", "snippet": "CRH Group PLC, an Irish building-materials company, says it will buy Tilcon Inc, US crushed-stone and concrete business owned by BTR PLC, for $220 million in cash and assumption of $109 million in debt (S)", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CRH of Ireland to Buy U.S. Concrete Maker", "print_headline": "CRH of Ireland to Buy U.S. Concrete Maker", "body_text": " **********CRH Group P.L.C., an Irish building-materials company, said yesterday that it would buy Tilcon Inc., the United States crushed-stone and concrete business owned by BTR P.L.C., for $220 million in cash and the assumption of $109 million in debt.

Such an overhaul would effectively repeal the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law that essentially separated the banking and securities businesses. **********While the Clinton Administration supported a broad approach to lowering the barriers separating financial industries, the Treasury Department opposed Mr. Leach's bill, saying that it would roll back gains that banks had made in the courts to expand their powers. **********This latest effort to repeal Glass-Steagall foundered mainly because of hotly contested provisions involving banks' affiliation with insurers and their right to sell various kinds of insurance. **********The nation's half-million insurance agents had strongly opposed the bill, fearing that it would put them out of business. After fierce lobbying, an amendment was added that would limit banks' entry into some insurance areas. **********This afternoon, Mr. Leach threw in the towel after finding that the bill, first taken up last week, had been loaded with some 80 proposed amendments, mostly those of Democrats. But some Republicans had also said they could not support important elements of the bill and there seemed little interest on either side in antagonizing a sizable business constituency at a time of such electoral scrutiny. **********The Senate has not yet taken action on banking legislation this year and has little inclination to do so, a caucus of the House committee's Republicans learned last week just before Mr. Leach conducted the first markup session. At that session, only a handful of the amendments were considered. **********Glass-Steagall's demarcations have been gradually crumbling since the 1970's, a process that is expected to continue. But the frontal assault on it seems to have been weakened in the last year by a Supreme Court decision that gave banks the upper hand in their battle against the more numerous and politically powerful insurance brokers seeking to bar bank incursion into their businesses. **********Believing that they would continue to benefit from court decisions and action in state legislatures, the American Bankers Association voted to oppose Mr. Leach's bill. **********And smaller banks, represented by the Independent Bankers Association of America, joined insurers in opposing the measure. ''We and the insurance agents together have no use for the position that the largest commercial banks, securities firms and insurance firms should be allowed to own one another,'' Kenneth Guenther, head of the bank group, said. **********Under Representative Leach's plan, Glass-Steagall restraints would be maintained on banking-securities affiliations, as would the law's prohibitions of affiliations between banks and insurers. But he proposed to expand the financial-services activities of bank holding companies. **********Instead of being limited to operations ''closely related to banking,'' holding companies would be allowed to engage in activities considered by regulators to be ''financial in nature or incidental to such financial activities,'' a significantly broader area. **********Mr. Leach said he had written to Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, urging the Fed to increase the amount of securities underwriting that large banks would be allowed to handle. Such underwriting now may not exceed 10 percent of revenues and while Mr. Leach did not specify a higher figure, he is said to favor raising this limit to the 20 to 25 percent range. **********Some bankers said they found it interesting that Mr. Leach, who has complained when bank powers have been enlarged by the Comptroller of the Currency, should ask the Fed to do just that. **********When asked about this, David Runkel, a committee aide, explained that Mr. Leach had ''more faith'' in the central bank. **********The regulatory relief still proposed by Mr. Leach involves various disclosure and record-keeping rules but no longer includes such contentious provisions as an exemption for small banks from Community Reinvestment Act regulations or the requirement that banks calculate the annual percentage rate for a growing variety of financial products. **********''I am hopeful that as the market continues to lead toward further financial homogenization, not only will industrial consensus prove more readily obtainable but regulatory jealousies may slacken,'' Mr. Leach said in a statement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/31/world/us-brokers-peace-accord-in-the-aegean.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Engelberg", "pub_date": "1996-01-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 835, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Brokers Peace Accord In the Aegean", "print_headline": "U.S. Brokers Peace Accord In the Aegean", "body_text": " **********Responding to the entreaties of President Clinton and other senior American officials, Greece and Turkey late this evening pulled back from a military confrontation over a tiny, uninhabited island in the Aegean. **********A State Department official said that a \"mutually acceptable agreement\" under which the two countries withdrew their forces and stopped unfurling flags over the 1,000-square-yard rocky outcropping came shortly before midnight. **********The official said that both sides had agreed to return to \"the status quo ante\" under which neither Greece nor Turkey asserted sovereignty over the island. **********\"Greek and Turkish forces are withdrawing at this time,\" the official said, reading from a prepared statement. \"The United States will monitor the withdrawal.\" **********The announcement brought to an end one of the more peculiar chapters in NATO  history, a moment when two members of the alliance edged close to hostilities over an utterly unstrategic piece of land. **********It began as a typical Greek-Turkish dispute over territory, and was initially treated by the Clinton Administration as a minor imbroglio. Diplomatic notes were delivered by American officials in Ankara and Athens this week urging both  sides to reconsider their stands. **********But American officials became alarmed this morning when they saw intelligence reports that the two sides were headed toward a military confrontation. A contingent of 12 Greek commandos was holding the island, and had unfurled the blue and white Greek flag above it. The Turks had plans to overrun the Greeks. Both sides had warships and airplanes poised over the tiny island, which is four miles off the Turkish coast near the city of Bodrum. **********The reports set off alarm bells across Washington. President Clinton called the Prime Ministers of both countries and the Turkish President, Suleyman Demirel. American officials said all three leaders assured Mr. Clinton that they did not want to see hostilities erupt. **********Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Secretary of Defense William Perry, Gen. John Shalikaskvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Anthony  Lake, the national security adviser, all worked the phones to their Greek and Turkish counterparts, urging them to back down from the ultimatums they had been trading in recent days. **********The incident over the island came at a sensitive moment for both countries.. **********In Turkey, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller heads a caretaker Government and handed in her resignation last month after an Islamic party finished first in her country's elections, defying a secular tradition that has been a cornerstone of Turkish Government for seven decades. **********In Greece, the Government has drifted for months during the illness of Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou. This month, Mr. Papandreou was replaced by Costas Simitis, whose Government faces its first vote of confidence in the Greek Parliament this week. **********The disputed territory, called Imia by the Greeks and Karnak by the Turks, is home only to several dozen goats. **********Nonetheless, it became a flash point for tensions between the two longtime adversaries, with newspapers in both countries egging on their leaders. Over the weekend, several reporters from the Turkish daily Hurriyet rode a helicopter to  the rocks, took down the blue and white Greek flag and raised the red and white  Turkish flag. **********That prompted the Greeks to dispatch the small force of commandos and to raise their own flag again. **********The dispute arose last month when a Turkish ship ran aground on the island. According to various reports, the Turkish captain refused assistance from the Greeks. Soon, both sides were lodging protests and exchanging angry diplomatic notes. **********Sovereignty over the island has long been in question. The Turks insist that  the island is theirs; Greeks say that it was given them by the Italians in 1947. **********\"All of this is obviously a function of absentee civilian leaders,\" said one  senior official. \"You have a classic situation in which the military is disproportionately influential, and their inherent hostility toward each other just exploded.\" **********Ms. Ciller said on Monday in Ankara that her country was ready \"to take all necessary measures\" if the Greeks did not withdraw their troops from the island. Earlier, she said she would not permit the Greeks to create a \"fait accompli\" over the issue, and said that the issue could only be resolved through international negotiations. **********Mr. Simitis did little more to defuse tensions. \"We do not accept any question on our national sovereignty,\" he said recently. \"In defending this, we have the means and will make use of them without hesitation. Turkey should not kid itself.\" **********All of this was viewed as a tempest in a teapot by Washington, until the two  militaries began to spar with each other. **********A clash between Greece and Turkey could split NATO. The two countries have fought over control of the Aegean for millenia and nearly went to war over Cyprus in 1974. **********\"It sounds incredible that they could go to the brink of military action -- I don't want to say war -- over a little piece of land smaller than the State Department,\" said Richard C.

Edward Belcher at 8:15 A.M. on Jan. 26, 1841. **********Today Possession Point -- now Hollywood Road Park -- is well inland from Hong Kong's shrinking harbor. The coffin makers lounge on low stools, smoke from their loosely fingered cigarettes drifting in the pudding-thick humidity, as they wait for their next customers and watch the last faint moments of British rule unwind. **********One year from today, at midnight's stroke on June 30, 1997, the territory's  last colonial governor will sail from Hong Kong, relinquishing Britain's final Asian outpost and its 6.2 million people to one of the world's last remaining Communist governments. It is a moment that is riveted in people's minds and emotions, a date with a destiny many fear and others exult in. **********In Beijing, where an immense digital clock flicks glowing red seconds inexorably toward zero hour, Hong Kong's return to China will be a decisive righting of historical wrongs -- the return of a piece of the motherland sundered after Britain forced China to buy its opium. The \"yoke of colonialism,\" as Zhou Nan, China's senior official here, repeatedly puts it, is being shucked  off. **********Under that yoke, however, Hong Kong has become Asia's pre-eminent financial center, a city feverishly at work on the globe's largest civil engineering project -- involving a new airport, town, railroads, two immense bridges and two tunnels under Hong Kong's harbor. Hong Kong is the place where money is made with relish and spent with abandon, where a two-bedroom apartment can run $10,000 a month and tycoons tool around in limousines originally designed for the Japanese emperor. **********Yet even in this city of soaring financial prowess -- a place of robust debate and newly spread political wings -- pride at the ending of colonialism is stirred by a widening sense of apprehension about the future under a Communist sovereign. **********\"I'm very pessimistic about the near future,\" said Martin C. M. Lee, the leader of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, which won the largest number of seats in last year's legislative elections. \"They don't trust us, so they want to control us from Beijing.\" **********Indeed, after 14 years of preparing for China to retake Hong Kong, virtually  none of the major issues confronting the territory have been resolved, including most prominently who will lead the territory. A committee chosen by Beijing is nominally charged with settling these issues, but it meets only in secret, consults with carefully selected segments of Hong Kong's people behind closed doors and has banished dissenting voices from its proceedings. **********China has promised that it will leave Hong Kong unchanged and \"with a high degree of autonomy\" for 50 years. Yet in the past year, China has proceeded clumsily and mostly in secret as it lays its plans to resume sovereignty. **********What is clear is that Beijing has said it will abolish Hong Kong's elected legislature and replace it with handpicked lawmakers, scuttle its Bill of Rights ordinance and revive a slew of repressive laws. What is also clear is that the transition is well under way; China is already the largest investor here, with more than 1,100 mainland companies, from banks to trading houses, garment manufacturers to tour operators, doing business here. **********The Growing Signs Of China's Presence **********Already the pace of Hong Kong's absorption into China is quickening. At the Department of Government Supplies, Nigel Shipmen has taken surveys of Government buildings to determine how many of China's five-starred red flags will be needed on July 1, 1997, and how many of Hong Kong's new flag, featuring a five-petaled  bauhinia flower. **********Insignias for the police, fire department, immigration and prison officers are all being redesigned. **********Beyond the external flourishes however, China's presence and influence are already considerable here. Swire Pacific, one of the great British hongs, or trading houses, has been pressed to reduce its holdings in the airline run by Hong Kong to a minority share. The British telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless is expected to cave in to Chinese pressure and become a minority shareholder in the territory's local phone company. **********\"It is natural for China to want some control of the commanding heights of the economy -- aviation, electronics, telecommunications and maybe banking -- but I am not comfortable,\" said Miron Mushkat, the managing director of Lehman Brothers here, at an American Chamber of Commerce conference. \"It is not the Hong Kong way, and it is a form of nationalization.\" **********For years, companies that traditionally have done most of their business with the London-based Hongkong & Shanghai Bank have been shifting business to the Bank of China. \"It just makes sense,\" said the director of one company. \"These are the guys we have to deal with.\" **********But Hong Kongers themselves are not easily abandoning their sense of themselves as distinct from China's people, not merely because of social and political differences, but culturally and linguistically. **********A Sense of Identity Apart From China **********Last spring Eric K. W. Ma, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, sent his students to an exhibit on Hong Kong's history, telling them to return and write about who they felt they were. **********\"My purpose was to trigger them to see whether they are local Hong Kong people or are they Chinese,\" he said. \"Most of them were born in Hong Kong and most have very remote ideas about the Chinese.\" **********More often than not, Hong Kong's people see themselves not as Chinese, but as Hong Kongers -- with a way of life far removed from China's mix of avariciousness born of rapid economic growth and insularity born of political repression, and with an ease with the world around them that China's people do not share. **********In an effort to lend some statistical shape to Hong Kong's amorphous sense of identity, Timothy K. Y. Wong, of the Hong Kong Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies, conducted a poll. \"We found that Hong Kong people still maintain a strong indigenous identity, although this identity is declining somewhat over the years,\" he said. Indeed, 49 percent of those surveyed regard themselves as Hong Kongers, with only 36 percent seeing themselves as Chinese. **********One answer to the search for identity, among many, springs from the pages of  the essays Mr. Ma collected. A student who left China in 1981 described her transformation after the Tiananmen massacre of June 4, 1989, from a \"Hong Kong Chinese\" to a \"Chinese Hong Konger.\" **********\"The more I was influenced by Hong Kong's culture and ideas, the more I became a Hong Konger through and through,\" she wrote. **********Confidence, Yes, But Keep Passports **********One of the starker signs of the chasm between Beijing and Hong Kong is the refusal of Chinese officials here to speak Cantonese in public. Instead they insist on speaking Beijing-accented Mandarin, a language scarcely understood here. Yet there remains a vast range of intentions toward China's looming sovereignty. **********Six years ago, Chui Kei Kong returned to Hong Kong from Vancouver, British Columbia. \"You can't earn as much in Canada as here,\" said Mr. Chui, an electrical engineer. He had moved to Canada 10 years ago, but the allure of business opportunity pulled him back. His wife and daughter remain in Canada. **********\"I don't worry too much about 1997 because I'm a Canadian citizen,\" said Mr.  Chui, who now owns a factory over the border in Shenzhen. \"If the situation is very bad next year, I'll go back to Canada. Even though I can earn more in Hong  Kong, I'd rather stay in a peaceful and civilized place.\" **********Invariably, conversations these days swing toward contingency plans, and above all that means possession of a foreign passport. There are no precise data, but the Government estimates that 600,000 Hong Kongers hold such passports. In fact, more than half the members of Beijing's hand-picked Preparatory Committee, the body that China created to chart the transition from  British to Chinese rule, carry foreign passports. **********Yet many Hong Kongers are eager to live in a Hong Kong that is a rightful part of China. Chung Lee Wai, a 22-year-old university student who said he plans to work in community development, is harshly critical of China's political system yet equally fierce in his patriotism. **********\"The first step is for China to control Hong Kong,\" he said. \"We need to go back to China. Hong Kong went to Britain because of the Opium War. I don't believe in independence for Hong Kong. I'm staying.\" **********Chan Siu Hong is equally adamant. \"Of course things may become very harsh in  1997, but I would like to stay here to try my best to take advantage of the opportunities here,\" said the 26-year-old owner of a video production company. \"Why should I go abroad where I'll be looked down on by foreigners?\" **********Yet even some of the most ardent boosters for Chinese rule have hedged their  bets. Henry Cheng, one of the world's richest men and the managing director of the New World property conglomerate, is chairman of the Better Hong Kong Foundation, a pro-China business group that actively promotes the territory's prospects and regularly meets with China's senior leaders. **********Still, when asked recently what passport he held, he replied, \"a French passport as a matter of confidence.\" Quickly, though, he corrected himself. \"I mean as a matter of convenience.\" Little Understanding Of a Free Society **********Much of Hong Kong's anxiety stems not only from the opacity of the process leading to Chinese rule, but from the stream of comments from Chinese officials  that appear to threaten elements of Hong Kong's way of life, and the silence emanating from the territory's own leading citizens. Beijing's insistence on secrecy and conformity among the Hong Kongers it chooses to steer the territory  toward Chinese rule is regarded as particularly ominous. **********When Frederick Kin Kee Fung, a member of the Preparatory Committee, announced that he intended to vote against plans to abolish Hong Kong's legislature, he was aggressively lobbied by senior Chinese officials. On the day the committee voted to install a legislature picked by China, Mr. Fung cast the solitary negative vote. **********\"I wanted to let them understand, through words and actions, what is Hong Kong political culture,\" Mr. Fung said. \"At the Preparatory Committee they just  read out documents and said whoever supports it raise their hands. It's the Chinese way. I was told that if I voted no, I would be off the provisional legislature\" -- the council that China will impose on July 1, 1997. **********Mr. Fung did vote no, and he has been barred from participating in any discussions over the new legislature or the chief executive. **********Many Hong Kongers, including Mr. Fung, believe that Chinese officials fundamentally do not comprehend Hong Kong. **********Hong Kong's Governor, Christopher Patten, argues that much of the blame for Beijing's ignorance of and insensitivity toward Hong Kong is a consequence of the type of advice it has sought. \"I think that one of the tragedies of the last few years is this,\" Mr. Patten said in an interview. \"It's understandable that senior Chinese officials, given their backgrounds, find it difficult understanding the nature of a free society, what makes Hong Kong tick. **********\"They require a bit of assistance in learning about Hong Kong. **********\"They haven't always gotten the assistance they deserve from their appointed  advisers in Hong Kong, who have believed that they should go and tell Chinese officials what they think Chinese officials want to hear. Senior Chinese officials deserve honesty, and too often they've gotten shoe shining.\" **********In the meantime, Hong Kong waits and watches."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/30/world/3-muslims-in-bosnia-die-going-home.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 547, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "3 Muslims In Bosnia Die Going Home", "print_headline": "3 Muslims In Bosnia Die Going Home", "body_text": " **********Three Muslim refugees were killed today and dozens were wounded in several angry confrontations with mobs of Serbs.

And Fleet, with two multibillion-dollar acquisitions since December, said higher expenses had hurt its earnings. **********BankAmerica's second-quarter earnings rose 12 percent, as higher fees and lower costs offset sluggish profits from lending.

The bank's net income rose to $278 million, or $1.35 a share, from $226 million, or $1.14, in the 1995 quarter. Bank of New York stock rose 87.5 cents, to $49.875. **********Republic said second-quarter earnings beat expectations as higher revenue from loans and other investments offset lower fees. **********Net income rose more than ninefold, to $103.1 million, or $1.71 a share, from $11.1 million, or 2 cents, in last year's quarter. Last year's earnings, however, included a $78 million charge for a companywide restructuring to cut costs. **********Republic rose 75 cents, to $61.75. **********Wachovia said second-quarter earnings were $159.4 million, or 94 cents a share -- above expectations. **********While the figure was 2 percent lower than the net of $162.9 million, or 94 cents a share, the bank earned in last year's second quarter, it was 20.6 percent above its $132.2 million profit from operations in the 1995 period.

''I wanted to be a pro bowler,'' he said. **********It didn't happen. ''My father made me go to law school'' instead, Mr. Leventis recalled, and now he is a lawyer with a thriving practice in Columbia, S.C. **********But Mr. Leventis has found a way back to his childhood dream: He invests in bowlers. He has advanced $45,000 each to a number of the game's professionals, and in return he  gets a sense of participation in the game and a share of the prize money. **********And he has fun. After all, who could recline in the La-Z-Boy with a beer and root for a mutual fund? **********There are a few hundred to a few thousand ''sports investors'' like Mr. Leventis, mostly in bowling, golf and tennis. Such investments are extremely risky -- often returning nothing but losses -- but for the athletes themselves the deals make sense. **********''What's unique about sports like golf and tennis is that there are no salaries,'' said Adam Lenkin, a lawyer with the Jeff Fried Company, a Washington firm that represents athletes. And the expenses can be very heavy. Professional golfers need about $75,000 a year to travel and play in tournaments; bowlers require $30,000 to $45,000. Tennis players need about $70,000 for travel,  tournament costs and outlays for coaches. **********What are these deals like? A typical one is Mr. Leventis's arrangement with Don Moser of Murrieta, Calif., who has total career winnings of $348,000 and is ranked 39th among United States bowlers this year. Mr. Moser said, ''I get $1,100 a week over the 27 tournaments we bowl, and at the end of the year he gets his money back, and we split the rest of the prizes 50-50.'' **********Mr. Leventis also receives 20 percent of the ''incentive money'' that Mr. Moser wins. This money, paid to bowlers by companies for use of their bowling equipment and apparel in televised tournaments, is linked to the bowlers' finish in the competition. ''Columbia has a new ball called the Pulse, and if you used one of their balls and wore their shirt on TV and you won you got $10,000,'' Mr. Moser said, referring to Columbia 300 Inc., a San Antonio company. **********Sports sponsors take different routes to these recreational investments. In 1980, Mr. Leventis was approached as a potential sponsor by John Douglas (Guppy) Trup, a boyhood buddy and successful professional bowler. Carl Copansky, a jewelry dealer in California who is known there for his TV commercials, is still looking for his athlete. He has wanted to sponsor a tennis player  since earlier this year, when he noticed a talented young player on a neighboring court at a private club. Finding an athlete is difficult -- there are no clearinghouses -- so Mr. Copansky is still talking to coaches and tennis officials, trying to find someone who has a line on the next Andre Agassi. **********On rare occasions, the looking pays off in potfuls. Jeff Fried of the Fried Company assembled one such deal, a syndicate of 11 sponsors who invested a total of $500,000 in a young boxer named Riddick Bowe. The fighter, of course, went on to great heavyweight success and, in the process, quadrupled his sponsors' money. **********BUT losses, or low returns, are the usual name of the game. Mr. Leventis has lost as much as $90,000 in two different years, 1986 and 1988. His best return, in 1995, was about $65,000 on $725,000 -- a 9 percent payout. **********Indeed, the only reliable return for sports sponsors is a good time. Many enjoy savoring the chance, no matter how improbable,  that they will back a champion. From this perspective, sponsorship is just a very costly way to cheer for an athlete. **********Alvin Miller, a former vice president of Giant Food, a grocery chain, was delighted to get a big return on the investment of some of his retirement money in Riddick Bowe. But Mr. Miller, of Washington, D.C., also emphasizes the behind-the-scenes access and status that his investment bought. ''It is fun having your friends ask about it, especially the caddies at the club,'' he said. ''To them, I was The Man.'' **********And Mr. Leventis explained his sponsorship as ''my way of staying in touch with bowling.'' **********Some sponsorships even yield friendships,  like that of Sal Gaudiano and Todd Berranger, a golfer. ''If he doesn't make it in golf, he's got a job with me the rest of his life,'' said Mr. Gaudiano, an executive for a coal company in Middlesboro, Ky. The two became close when the golfer found he had cancer, which is now arrested. **********''I have a daughter whom I love very much,'' Mr. Gaudiano said, ''but Todd is like a son I never had.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/16/world/seoul-sinks-imaginary-foe-aka-tokyo-at-islet.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 501, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Seoul Sinks Imaginary Foe (aka Tokyo) at Islet", "print_headline": "Seoul Sinks Imaginary Foe (aka Tokyo) at Islet", "body_text": " **********In a warning to Tokyo, South Korean military forces today practiced repelling imaginary enemy vessels around disputed islets in the Sea of Japan. **********The islets are tiny clumps of rock peeking above the choppy seas about half-way between South Korea and Japan. Once inhabited only by birds, they are now occupied by a South Korean police unit. **********There are fishing grounds near the islets, and there is some talk that there may be minerals or petroleum in the area. But the main reason for the dispute is simply nationalism. **********The latest round of the dispute erupted earlier this month when Japan leaked  plans to declare a 200-mile exclusive economic zone, in accordance with the Law  of the Sea Treaty, that would encompass the islets. Seoul responded by announcing plans to build a pier on them, and Japan's subsequent protest to that set off a fury in South Korea. **********During a snowstorm this afternoon, four South Korean naval vessels, an anti-submarine helicopter and four fighter jets pounced on an imaginary foreign  ship.

He declined to condemn the exercise or say whether a protest would be issued, apparently reflecting the Japanese hope that the fuss will subside. **********Even though Japan still sends patrol boats around the islets to back up its claims of ownership, Tokyo has allowed South Korean troops to occupy them since  the 1950's and it has ruled out the use of force to reclaim them. **********While most Japanese would scarcely know where to begin to look for Takeshima  on a map, Tokto is well known to Koreans and has been the subject of a Korean song, (\"Tokto is our land!\") and of a popular book and movie -- in which a Japanese attempt to seize the islets leads to a war that Korea wins. **********While there is little danger of a military conflict over the islets, intelligence experts are more concerned about the risk of a clash over another set of tiny islands that also would fall under Japan's 200-mile exclusive zone.  These islands, called the Diaoyu islands in Chinese and the Senkaku islands in Japanese, are uninhabited but are claimed by Japan, China and Taiwan. **********Japan now patrols the seas around these islands, and some Japanese Government officials say Tokyo might use military force against any Chinese attempt to occupy them."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/02/business/company-briefs-047520.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 30, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING INC., Roseland, N.J., acquired Merrin Financial Inc. of New York, its second purchase in two weeks aimed at bolstering its financial  services.

Wagner at City Hall. He pleaded his country's cause before the United Nations, held office in the Captive European Nations Assembly and remained persona non grata in his homeland for more than 30 years until the end of Communist rule. **********Hungary's freely elected post-Communist Government remembered him in 1990, inviting him to the opening of Parliament, making him an honorary citizen of Budapest and decorating him for his contributions to democracy.

During the German occupation in 1944, he helped organize the resistance and was imprisoned. **********After the war, in 1945, he was elected Mayor of Budapest and a member of Parliament and, with Western aid, started to reconstruct the war-damaged capital. When the Communists began to stifle the other parties, he resigned his political posts and went to work as an engineer. **********The Communists, backed by Soviet power, took full charge in 1948 and, in a secret trial, sentenced him to life in prison as an opponent of the Government. He spent more than six years in prison until the uprising of 1956, when he was re-elected Mayor. The  rebel Government of Imre Nagy named him to a delegation that tried to negotiate with the Soviets. **********The aim was to secure Hungary's neutrality and withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, an effort aborted by the Soviet invasion of November 1956 that crushed the uprising. **********Mr. Kovago, secretary general of the Smallholders Party, fled and became a leader in various exile groups, a role in which he lectured widely and traveled abroad as a good-will ambassador. **********He wrote ''You Are All Alone'' (Praeger, 1959), his personal account of the Hungarian uprising.

Outside the bunker, a crude cardboard sign declared the address \"Sniper Street.\" **********It took Mr. Clinton two tries today to make it into Tuzla, the headquarters of the American forces, who will eventually number 20,000 of the 60,000 NATO peacekeepers. **********Early this morning, the C-17 military transport plane carrying Mr. Clinton, his aides and a bipartisan Congressional delegation was diverted because of fog  to the next stop on his itinerary -- an American staging base in Taszar, Hungary. Despite this delay of several hours, the President's entourage was upbeat. **********Mr. Clinton's aggressive diplomacy, which helped lead to a plan to end the four-year-old Balkan conflict, and his decision to send American troops on an unpopular mission to enforce that peace contrast with his earlier reputation for wavering on difficult foreign policy decisions. **********The deployment of troops to Bosnia and Herzegovina and success at keeping the peace could prove crucial in this election year. Mr. Clinton has acknowledged that if the mission brings substantial casualties, it could cost him re-election. **********But today his appearance among the troops in Tuzla and Taszar and at Aviano Air Base in Italy underscored his role as Commander in Chief and set him apart from his antagonists in the budget squabble. **********Senator Bob Dole, the leading contender for the Republican Presidential nomination, had wanted to visit the troops over Christmas. But he canceled his plans after Defense Secretary William J. Perry said commanders in Europe wanted  to avoid distractions as the troops arrived. **********Mr. Clinton has begun pointing to American efforts in Haiti, Northern Ireland, the Middle East and Bosnia as models of United States foreign policy in the post-cold-war world **********\"We have a profound interest in seeing the United States be the world's leading source of energy for peace and freedom and democracy,\" he told assembly-line workers at a truck plant in Nashville on Friday just before he set off for Bosnia. **********Mr. Clinton's trip was marked by heavy security. His precise itinerary was closely held, and Secret Service sharpshooters followed him in Tuzla, where he stayed inside the grounds of the airfield, seeing nothing of the war's effects on the town. A senior official in his entourage said the President's visit had \"more logistical, security and weather variables\" than he had ever encountered before. **********Mr. Clinton took off from Tuzla about two and a half hours after his arrival  as fog rolled in, advised by the Secret Service to leave before dark. **********At Taszar airfield in Hungary, the forward staging area for American troops moving by land through Croatia into Bosnia, the side of the tarmac was littered  with broken-down Soviet MIG fighter planes, a reminder of the cold war. **********\"Just six years ago, Hungary was still part of the Warsaw Pact, and now it's  home to the largest American military operation in Europe since World War II,\" the President told hundreds of men and women in combat fatigues, many with cameras, who crammed into a makeshift mess hall for his stop there this morning. **********Green tents lined an airfield that, like Tuzla, is such a sea of thick mud that Mr. Clinton described it in his radio address back home. \"In Tuzla, the headquarters for our troops in Bosnia, the weather report is pretty much the same every day: mud, mud and more mud,\" he said. **********The soldiers greeted Mr. Clinton with applause and repeated guttural shouts of \"Hoo-aa!\" pep-rally style. This was in marked contrast to the early days of his Presidency, when he was heckled at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial as someone  who had avoided the military draft and who was joked about by sailors while visiting the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt. **********Many of the nearly 7,000 troops in Taszar are heading on to Bosnia, and Mr. Clinton told them, \"I'd like to be able to report that when you get there, you will find deluxe accommodations.\" **********\"I'd like to be able to do that,\" he said, to swelling laughter. \"But even for a political leader, that's stretching the truth a little more than people dare.\" **********Despite the living conditions in Bosnia, some troops in Taszar expressed support for the mission and delight at seeing the President. **********\"It's great, great, real great for him to help us out,\" said Specialist Doris Splunge, 31, who sets out to Bosnia on Monday. Another 30-year-old soldier, who  would not give his name, said: \"I appreciate him coming here. Misery loves company.\" **********Mr. Clinton also fit in time for diplomacy. In Tuzla he assembled an unusual  delegation of religious and civic leaders of Bosnia, including Tarik Kupusovic,  the Muslim Mayor of Sarajevo, and Nedejlko Prstojevic, the Mayor of Ilidza, a Serbian suburb of Sarajevo. **********Mr. Clinton also met with President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia in Tuzla, before going to Zagreb for a brief stopover to meet with President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, then flying back to Washington. **********-------------------- **********Return to Washington **********WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 (By The New York Times) -- President Clinton returned to Washington just before midnight tonight from his 18-hour visit with American troops in Italy, Hungary and Bosnia. **********En route to Washington, Mr. Clinton stopped in Zagreb, where he was met at the airport by enthusiastic crowds of residents.

Hundreds of victims had sued. But statutes of limitations prevented thousands more from bringing claims. Mr. Dubin however had not come to lunch to pick a fight. Rather, dissatisfied with the way key plaintiffs' lawyers were handling the litigation, he was on a stealth mission to negotiate, for all those infected, a  settlement with the four companies without the knowledge of key plaintiffs' lawyers. **********I told him they were going to have to live with us as customers when all the high-powered litigators were gone,\" said Mr. Dubin, a 41-year-old former journalist from Goleta, Calif., recalling the lunchtime conversation with Mr. Bacich. \"If you buy a Pinto from Ford that blows up, you can tell Ford to go to  hell. But I don't have that luxury.\" **********In many cases of mass litigation, corporations are able to buy themselves settlements that enrich lawyers but leave the victims -- faceless names on the cover sheets of legal documents -- with a pittance. In the hemophilia litigation, some claimants jumped off the page to try to influence the outcome of an emotionally charged dispute. **********The result of their revolt was a legal free-for-all for plaintiffs, lawyers and companies alike. United by their disease, hemophiliacs were divided between  activists seeking to squeeze the maximum settlement out of the drug makers and others willing to accept less money so that the sickest among them, dying at the rate of one a day, could get some cash. Some actors included Mr. Dubin, president of the Committee of Ten Thousand, an activist group; Jonathan Wadleigh, the committee's founder; Robert Baldwin, who gained prominence as a counselor for hemophiliacs, and David Shrager, a plaintiffs' lawyer who guided the case until the activists challenged him. **********The defendants -- Baxter; Bayer A.G. of Germany; Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc., a  unit of Rhone-Poulenc S.A. of France, and the Alpha Therapeutic Corporation, a unit of the Green Cross Corporation of Japan -- were also roiled by confusion. Today they are operating in unison. But in the past they often ignored solidarity to protect their own interests, individually discussing settlements,  withdrawing them or joining together in various combinations. **********In the end, the Committee of Ten Thousand failed to negotiate a deal alone. But its leaders insist their initiative was not in vain. At the very least, they say, they galvanized victims to press for higher compensation. And, according to Baxter documents, they came close to a settlement that could have required Baxter to pay out more than it will under industry's offer last month of $100,000 for each claimant, up to a maximum of $640 million. Hemophiliacs are expected to be polled soon on their interest in the deal. **********But some like Mr. Baldwin contend that the activists may have scuttled earlier deals that could have gotten money quickly to those who desperately needed it. \"I've had mothers calling me saying that they'd be happy to get $30,000 for their son so they can buy him a new car before he dies,\" said Mr. Baldwin, whose brother, also a hemophiliac, died three years ago of AIDS. It is  estimated that more than 2,000 H.I.V.- infected hemophiliacs have died. **********Hemophiliacs, who suffer an inherited disorder in which the blood's clotting  ability is impaired and excessive bleeding results, occupy a unique chapter in the AIDS crisis. Their fatal infection was caused by the very clotting substances, known as Factor VIII and Factor IX, that they took to save their lives. And unlike many AIDS-afflicted homosexuals, most hemophiliacs kept a low  profile early on, fearful of exposing their conditions. **********By the early 1990's, however, activists discovered that Government regulators and industry officials had known since the early 1980's that clotting products posed an AIDS infection threat. The National Hemophilia Foundation, a research and lobbying group, also understated infection risks in the early 1980's, according to a 1995 report by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy  of Sciences. **********The disclosures led to the creation of activist groups like the Committee of  Ten Thousand. At annual meetings of the National Hemophilia Foundation in early  1990's, activists parked hearses outside hotels, wore death masks and threw fake blood on industry representatives. And even moderates like Mr. Baldwin began pressing producers of the clotting substances to settle claims before they reached the courtroom. **********In the fall of 1993, top executives of three companies -- Baxter, Rhone-Poulenc and Alpha Therapeutic -- met with leaders of the hemophilia community to outline the terms of a $125 million offer, said Mr. Baldwin, who attended the meeting. But he said that Mr. Wadleigh and Mr. Dubin appeared anxious and insisted that any decision be put off. \"I didn't know what was going on,\" said Mr. Baldwin, who lives in Bedford, Tex. **********He got his answer the next day: With Mr. Wadleigh as lead plaintiff, Mr. Shrager, the plaintiffs' lawyer, filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of American hemophiliacs. Mr. Shrager, who had previously negotiated a favorable settlement on behalf of Canadian hemophiliacs, then established a panel of claimants, led by Mr. Wadleigh, to advise him and other lawyers. **********In early 1995, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in  Chicago decertified the lawsuit, saying it might bankrupt the industry. Soon, the partnership between Mr. Wadleigh and Mr. Shrager unraveled in a struggle over the direction of the case. **********Activists like Mr. Wadleigh and Mr. Dubin favored appealing the Seventh Circuit decision to the Supreme Court, arguing it would protect the interests of all affected hemophiliacs, not just those who had already sued. But Mr. Shrager  wanted to shift gears and pursue the separate Federal proceeding that had consolidated hundreds of individual lawsuits that had been filed against the producers. **********The clotting producers had quietly settled many claims, but individual lawsuits had failed because most states shield blood products from traditional product-liability claims. Still, damaging documents were emerging contending that the companies had collected blood from high-risk donors like homosexuals and prisoners. Soon, informal settlement negotiations intensified. **********Meanwhile tensions between Mr. Wadleigh and others on the advisory committee  and Mr. Shrager had been growing. \"It was outrageous,\" Mr. Wadleigh said. \"He said he was representing the whole community and then he'd turn around and say that he represented the individual cases.\" Any talk of a settlement soon took a  back seat to strife within the plaintiffs' camp. **********Finally, upset by the decision of Mr. Shrager and his colleagues not to seek  an appeal, Mr. Wadleigh and his allies asked a Federal judge to replace the current cast of lawyers. The closed-door drama played out last June in the chambers of Federal District Judge John F. Grady in Chicago, according to sealed court records. Mr. Wadleigh and Mr. Dubin accused the lawyer of selling out hemophiliacs as a group to advance the cause of his clients. Mr. Shrager denied  the allegation and argued that it was important for the individual cases to go forward to keep up pressure on the companies to settle. **********Judge Grady backed Mr. Shrager, describing the revolt by the dissidents as akin to \"passengers coming up and asking to take over the controls of a DC-10,\"  according to court papers. But by that time, the activists, backed by two other  plaintiffs' lawyers, Thomas Mull and Charles Kozak, were pushing ahead on a separate course. **********In November, they found a new rallying cry when the companies they were suing announced a settlement for Japanese hemophiliacs that dwarfed the numbers being  discussed in this country: $420,000 for each victim, with $235,000 coming from industry and the rest from the Japanese government. **********The next month, Mr. Dubin and his lawyers began their secret talks with the companies. And by March, they came close to reaching a deal with Baxter that might have set the framework for a more lucrative deal than the one now on the table, according to company documents. **********The documents show that in late March, Baxter considered offering $50,000 to  any plaintiff who alleged H.I.V. infection from using a company product. Even though Baxter held only 20 percent of the market, the number of hemophiliacs who qualified for that plan might have been significantly higher because users could easily switch from one company's brand to another's. If 50 percent of 6,000 affected hemophiliacs or family members applied for the plan, a separate settlement would have cost the company $150 million, not including lawyers' fees. **********That compares with Baxter's one-fifth share of the current proposal for paying each participating hemophiliac $100,000 -- up to a cost to the company of $120 million, excluding legal fees. Mary Thomas, a Baxter spokeswoman, said the company, which favored an industrywide solution, had projected that the stillborn proposal would have cost it less than its current share of the industrywide offer. But she declined to disclose the basis for that estimate. **********Along with talks to settle claims by those with cases that have not been filed, talks were also apparently under way earlier this year to settle lawsuits. Bayer, the largest company involved in the litigation with 45 percent  of the market, pressed plaintiffs' lawyers involved in individual lawsuits to reach settlements quickly, according to a lawyer familiar with Bayer's negotiating stance. Margo Barnes, a Bayer spokeswoman, denied that the company had tried to push for settlement, adding that it had rejected entreaties from plaintiffs' lawyers. **********For now, Mr. Dubin, Mr. Shrager and Mr. Baldwin have shed their differences and are taking a united stand toward the industry's settlement proposal. But the solidarity could be threatened by potential frictions between the some 500 people who have filed individual lawsuits and the thousands who would only benefit from a mass settlement. Mr. Dubin exalts about the activists' role in exacting favorable terms for the hemophiliac community. \"This is the first time  that plaintiffs have taken a case into their own hands,\" he said. **********Mr. Shrager, though, says it was really hard-knuckled lawyering that brought  the companies around.  \"Corey has done a great job of applying pressure in recent months,\" he said. \"But giant companies don't offer to give away $640 million out of the kindness of their hearts.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/20/business/company-briefs-422720.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********ALASKA AIR GROUP INC.

Stock traders appear to believe that the Wells Fargo bid will win, because First Interstate shares closed yesterday at $138.875, up $3.325, far closer to the Wells Fargo price than to the First Bank bid. **********\"This means the First Bank deal is not going to happen,\" said David S. Berry, research director at Keefe Bruyette & Woods. \"Both they and Wells predicated their deals on massive cost takeouts and massive share repurchases. Now First Bank can't buy its stock for two years.\" **********Mr. Berry said he estimated that First Bank's share buyback plan accounted for one-third to half of the estimated benefit from the transaction. **********Richard A. Zona, First Bank's chief financial officer, said that its deal would still increase its earnings per share by 13 percent in 1987, a far greater gain than in most bank acquisitions. Moreover, he said, the bank will take the capital it would have used for share repurchases and make other investments that will increase the bank's returns. Nonetheless, he termed the ruling yesterday, \"a mistake by the S.E.C.\" Wells Fargo's plan to buy back stock is not affected by the S.E.C. ruling because it had chosen to use a different accounting treatment. Merger experts said that the $18.60-a-share gap between the value of the two bids and this accounting ruling increased the pressure on First Interstate's board to rethink the deal with First Bank, and possibly to find a way to sell itself to Wells Fargo instead. A First Interstate spokesman declined to comment. \"I don't know how they could go to their shareholders and ask them to vote for this at this point,\" one top merger negotiator said. First Bank is in a difficult spot because the more the market feels that Wells Fargo will win, the higher the Wells Fargo stock price goes. Some merger specialists expect that to regain momentum, First Bank will have to raise its bid significantly. Even First Bank advisers concede that the value of its bid needs to be within $10 of the Wells Fargo bid for it to be considered. Yet if it does raise its offer, First Bank runs the risk that the market will think it is  overpaying and its share price will fall, wiping out the value of its increased  offer. First Bank may gain some benefit from the four days of hearings on the two merger proposals that the Federal Reserve will hold next week. First Interstate  has arranged for many local community and business leaders to complain that if Wells Fargo buys it, there will be huge losses of jobs and banking competition.  Wells Fargo, however, has arranged the support of several organized community groups to praise its commitment to lending to minority and low-income borrowers. First Bank will also benefit ifthe Wells Fargo proposal gets bogged down on antitrust grounds because Wells Fargo has substantial overlap in California with First Interstate. The Justice Department has already approved First Interstate's combination with First Bank, which has no California operations. But Wells Fargo has said it will sell as many branches as needed for quick approval, and regulators appear to be trying to treat both deals on a similar schedule. Regardless of the outcome for First Interstate, the S.E.C. accounting decision could put a chill on some bank mergers. The issue relates to the accounting method used by First Bank and most banking deals, known as pooling of interests. That means that when two companies merge, their financial statements are combined. The S.E.C. prefers \"purchase accounting,\" which in theory forces the buyer to reckon with the value of its target. First Bank had argued that since it had a regular program of buying back its own stock in place before the First Interstate deal was announced, it should be permitted to continue the repurchases 90 days after the new deal closed. **********Where the company appears to have gone wrong, analysts said, is that when it  tried to sell its deal to investors, First Bank showed specific estimates of the benefit to its per-share earnings from an aggressive buyback program. This appears to have tied the stock purchases too closely to this transaction."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/15/business/market-place-for-netcom-its-fans-say-being-down-is-not-out.html": {"writer_name": "Laurie Flynn", "pub_date": "1996-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 645, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place;For Netcom, Its Fans Say Being Down Is Not Out", "print_headline": "Market Place;For Netcom, Its Fans Say Being Down Is Not Out", "body_text": " **********The fast-growing Internet business is often compared with the PC business a decade ago. And it is for just that reason that investors seem to be growing wary of the Internet and its wealth of too-good-to-be-true success stories. **********Consider Netcom On-Line Communication Services of San Jose, Calif., the nation's largest independent provider of Internet access, but which has yet to turn a profit. The company went public in December 1994 at $13 a share and by November of last year, the stock reached a high of $91.50 a share. The company's subscriber base has more than quadrupled, to 400,000 last week, and its revenues climbed to $52.4 million in 1995, up from $12.4 million the previous year. **********But when the market closed on Friday, the stock was trading back down at $27, up 50 cents, on Nasdaq. The market is reacting to recent announcements that bigger and better-known competitors, like AT&T, are revving up Internet access providers of their own. The day AT&T announced its intent to provide Internet access, Netcom shares fell $4.75 even though the news had been expected. Shares  of competitors like UUnet Technologies Inc. and Performance Systems International were also off. **********But even with the potentially formidable competition, many analysts feel it is still too early to nail the lid on Netcom's coffin. With the right kind of positioning, they say, independent access providers have plenty of opportunities. **********\"With the market growing 100 percent a year, it's too early to call the winners and the losers,\" said Kevin Moore, an Internet analyst at Alex. Brown &  Sons in Baltimore, who calls the Netcom sell-off \"totally unjustified.\" Despite the high-profile jostling for position, Mr. Moore said, \"It's not a foregone conclusion that the market leaders will get wiped out.\" **********Still, AT&T's arrival and the expectation that just about every phone company will begin offering Internet access has forced Netcom to make some big changes in its business model, starting with lowering its prices. To counter as closely  as possible AT&T's offer of a full year free to current long-distance customers, Netcom is offering the first month for only $5 and unlimited access for only $19.95 monthly after that. **********The Netcom strategy, scheduled to be announced tomorrow, includes a repackaging of its Internet service to appeal to those familiar with the Internet rather than to neophytes. The company has shifted its marketing campaign on line, hoping to lure already heavy Internet users away from other providers and on-line services. **********The company is also attempting to solve customer service problems, which have soured a lot of current subscribers. At the core of the company's strategy, its  executives say, is giving subscribers more content, and the ability to personalize Netcom sessions by giving subscribers a daily dose of headline news  on the subjects of their choice. And the company has signed licensing deals with Netscape Communications and Microsoft to give subscribers the browser of their choice, scrapping its long-held tactic of providing Netcom subscribers with Netcruiser alone. **********As for AT&T, Mr. Moore said there could be no certainty that it would succeed in Internet access; it has already shown a certain clumsiness in several high-technology markets, starting with its high-profile failure in the PC market after acquiring the NCR Corporation. **********But not everyone is as optimistic as Mr. Moore about Netcom's longer-term prospects. \"Our rating is at a hold,\" said Rakesh Sood, Internet analyst at Hambrecht & Quist. \"The landscape on the consumer side is extremely competitive. The opportunity for improving margins and profitability are bleak.\" Still, Mr. Rakesh expects Netcom to report markedly improved first-quarter revenues: $23.8  million, up from $19.7 million in the fourth quarter. **********But Mr. Rakesh points to the need for Netcom to continue investing in its network to stay competitive, particularly if it hopes to attract a more technically advanced subscriber. That investment, he said, could push Netcom's time line for profitability into 1998."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/18/business/soon-brooklyn-union-won-t-be-just-a-staid-utility-investment.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1996-09-18", "snippet": "Outlook for Keyspan Energy Corp, new holding company to be formed by Brooklyn Union Gas Co, discussed; formation would enable utility to make acquisitions abroad and much larger investments in nonutility businesses (M)", "word_count": 700, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soon Brooklyn Union won't be just a staid utility investment.", "print_headline": "Soon Brooklyn Union won't be just a staid utility investment.", "body_text": " **********SINCE it was founded a century ago, Brooklyn Union Gas has grown steadily as it focused on serving its 1.1 million customers in Brooklyn, Staten Island and Queens.

That's the name of Brooklyn Union's new holding company, which  the New York State Public Service Commission gave the company permission to form last week. **********The change is not merely cosmetic. If, as expected, stockholders approve the holding company at the annual meeting in February the utility will gain the freedom to make acquisitions in far-off lands and make much larger investments in businesses outside its field. **********Under the plan approved by the commission, the company could increase its investment in companies other than utilities from the current 15 percent to 50 percent of its net worth. **********Not that management plans to go wild with the new freedoms. Craig L. Matthews, the president and chief operating officer, said the goal was to have half of profits come from nonutility businesses within five years. **********The company has slowly been moving in that direction for years. It formed its Houston Exploration subsidiary in 1986 to find and produce natural gas. Houston Exploration's revenue has been soaring because of recent acquisitions. **********The company plans to build its war chest through a public offering of up to 35 percent of the subsidiary -- for about $13 to $15 a share -- to raise about $90 million. **********Brooklyn Union managers have for some time been longing to break out of the gas business,  which generates a good return but has few opportunities for expansion. **********Some growth might come from a plan to lower some service rates next year and then freeze them for five years. That could help persuade some larger customers like owners of apartment buildings and stores to switch from oil to gas. **********Management, however, has its eye on a much wider horizon. **********Vincent D.

''But the alternative is even greater risk by doing nothing. The world is changing.'' **********With its core gas business being opened to more competition, Mr. Catell said, the company needed to find new ways of making a profit by drawing on its expertise in such fields as building co-generation power plants. **********The utility already has a subsidiary called Gas Energy that builds co-generation electric power plants. For decades, Brooklyn Union has been building the plants, which are efficient and require relatively small investments. The plants are placed at sites like hospitals or factories, where the waste heat from the generation of electricity can be used while the electricity produced is sold to others. **********The company also wants to expand its gas marketing in pursuit of customers of other utilities as states open up the industry to competition. **********''It's an extension of things we have learned to do fairly well,'' Mr. Enright said. **********''High growth does entail some higher risk,'' he acknowledged. He added, however, that the company planned to stay close to businesses it knows well and would continue to build from its stable base as a regulated gas utility. **********James McAuliffe, an energy analyst for Bear, Stearns, said that with the increasing emphasis on unregulated businesses there would be more risk and more volatility in earnings. **********Thus an older investor who just seeks a steady dividend might want to take a second look. Mr. McAuliffe added, however, that there could also be greater returns than in the past and that Keyspan would still have the stability of the relatively  steady earnings of its gas utility."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/26/business/executive-changes-097730.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-01-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 160, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********ASHLAND OIL INC., Ashland, Ky., said John R.

R. Baron's clients were defrauded. In one instance, the New York brokerage firm refused to sell $1 million of Innovir Laboratories stock that New York University had received as a gift. The  university lost money when Innovir stock declined late last year, after A. R. Baron missed an opportunity to get out at a strong profit. **********Other clients lost money on what the S.E.C. described as illegal trades.

In August 1995, Mr. Barry instructed his broker at Baron to sell $450,000 of Time Warner bonds and remit the proceeds to him. Mr. Barry later learned that his broker used the money to buy 150,000 shares of Cypros Pharmaceuticals -- a stock Baron underwrote -- without his consent. **********In addition, the S.E.C. said, Mr. Barry could not get through to any Baron officials to complain about the purchases.

Wasserman, the former chairman of MCA, and Ray Stark, a longtime producer. **********''Mike isn't certain of the meaning of the word friendship,'' Mr. Stark said. **********Without his agent's role and power, Mr. Ovitz now finds himself in a position of courting old enemies in Hollywood to shore up his own image -- obsessively nurtured through the years -- and to protect Disney's interests with program suppliers like Dreamworks because, as Michael Wolf, a partner and head of the media department at Booz Allen & Hamilton, said, ''This is a small industry and to be an effective executive you need to have good relationships.'' **********Even critics acknowledge that it is far too early to make definitive judgments about a power broker who has made the leap from running a talent agency with an estimated $200 million in sales to serving as president of the world's 39th-largest publicly traded company, with 1996 sales of about $20 billion. **********Over the long term, Mr. Ovitz's performance will be crucial. Today, Disney is in solid financial health. Even after paying interest on debt related to its $19 billion purchase of Capital Cities/ABC, Disney will still have more than $2 billion to invest in new businesses. **********The total value of Disney's stock has risen 22 times since 1984 when Mr. Eisner took over. But that growth took place under stable management. Now, as Mr. Eisner tries to integrate ABC -- a network whose ratings have slumped severely -- his plans to continue the growth have been shadowed by turmoil. **********In recent years Mr. Eisner has suffered a serious heart attack; his No. 2,  Frank G. Wells, died in a helicopter crash; his chief financial officer, Steven Bollenbach, quit after 18 months, and Mr. Katzenberg, the longtime chairman of Disney Studios, left in a bitter fight and is in litigation over his severance package. **********''It is essential to the company that Mr. Ovitz succeeds because to go back and restructure the senior management, where there has already been so much change, would be debilitating,'' said Emanuel Gerard, a partner at Gerard Klauer Mattison, an investment firm. **********Mr. Ovitz's new role at Disney -- still not clearly defined -- is now centered on expanding Disney abroad, especially in China, where he has sought to make inroads for distributing the company's television, film and consumer products. It is a role far more limited than that of Mr. Wells, who was deeply immersed in every major labor negotiation, budgetary issue and personnel matters. **********Mr. Eisner -- in a move many saw as a mistake -- did not name Mr. Ovitz to Mr. Wells's old post of chief operating officer, denying him a power base and specific responsibilities. People close to Mr. Eisner said he did not see Mr. Ovitz as suited to the nuts and bolts demands of that position. But one top Hollywood lawyer said: ''I don't think either Eisner or Ovitz knew how tough the situation would be. Ovitz's position is very unorthodox. He's basically a troubleshooter. Eisner tells him what problems to solve.'' **********At the same time, a sense of mystery and elusiveness still surrounds Mr. Ovitz, providing an image he enjoys. Several top Sony executives as well as rival studio chiefs are amazed that despite his job at Disney, Mr. Ovitz has apparently advised Nobuyuki Idei, the president of the Sony Corporation, who is expected to appoint John Calley, a longtime producer and studio executive, to take over the troubled Sony studios. Many believe Mr. Ovitz may even be angling for the top job there. Mr. Ovitz has told friends that his dealings with Sony are related only to joint ventures with Disney. **********Mr. Eisner, in an interview, discounted any hint of dissatisfaction with Mr. Ovitz, although three people close to Disney said Mr. Eisner was not entirely pleased with Mr. Ovitz and had bluntly said so to close associates. Mr. Eisner denied this; Mr. Ovitz declined to comment. **********''From my point of view he is a talented, strong and effective executive,'' Mr. Eisner said. ''I have been at ABC, Paramount and Disney, and I am pretty good at taking the temperature from the inside. Performance is the key. In my opinion we are performing so spectacularly and it is under the management of Michael Eisner and Michael Ovitz.'' **********But so far, Mr. Ovitz has managed to irritate a number of important colleagues over and over. **********For example, at a dinner at Mr. Ovitz's home, a top Disney business executive with overseas experience began talking to a film producer whose movie was opening in Europe. The business executive offered to assist the producer. According to one source, the Disney executive received a call at 8 the next morning from Mr. Ovitz assailing him for talking to the producer. **********''I have those relationships, you don't,'' Mr. Ovitz said. **********The executive angrily replied, ''It's good for our business.'' He added, ''Don't invite me to your house anymore because if you have interesting people I will talk to them.'' Mr. Ovitz has said he did not recall the incident. **********Seeming Unwillingness To Learn the Business **********Mr. Ovitz has also angered some because of his seeming unwillingness to learn how Disney's complex businesses work. A former senior executive at Disney recalled that Mr. Eisner had grown so uneasy about Mr. Ovitz's lack of knowledge that at one point he suggested the former agent meet regularly with Mr. Bollenbach, then Disney's highly respected chief financial officer. **********Mr. Ovitz and Mr. Bollenbach planned to hold a weekly meeting on Monday at 2 P.M. But each Monday, the executive said, Mr. Ovitz canceled the meeting at the last minute, reportedly angering Mr. Bollenbach. Mr. Ovitz has told friends that such criticism is unfair and that he met frequently with Mr. Bollenbach and other top executives at Disney. **********In his early months at Disney, Mr. Ovitz reportedly also antagonized Dennis Hightower, then chairman of Walt Disney Television and Telecommunications. Disney insiders believe that Mr. Ovitz's style may have contributed to both Mr. Bollenbach's and Mr. Hightower's departures from  the company this year. Both declined to comment. **********One senior Disney executive said Mr. Ovitz avoided and appeared to snub the managers, a sharp contrast to Mr. Wells, who knew executives at every level. Mr. Ovitz's aides said that his travels, two weeks out of every month, have limited his meetings at Disney's Burbank headquarters. **********Mr. Bollenbach, who is now chairman of the Hilton Corporation, when asked recently if Mr. Eisner would replace Mr. Ovitz, replied: ''Michael thinks he can fix everything. He thinks he can make Ovitz work out.'' **********Gordon Crawford, senior vice president of the Capital Research Group, whose fund owns about 3 percent of Disney, dismissed the speculation about Mr. Ovitz as ''Hollywood stuff.'' He said, ''People never have a nice word to say about anybody.'' **********Mr. Crawford said of Mr. Ovitz:  ''He has been very perceptive over the years about the growing importance of vertical integration. He has handled advertising, mergers and acquisitions. He understood the importance of the foreign markets.'' **********By all accounts, though, Mr. Ovitz sought to move too rapidly -- and has had to back off -- at both the studio and the network. **********Murky Episode With NBC **********One reason was a murky and, for Disney, embarrassing episode in which NBC executives accused Mr. Ovitz of making innuendoes of sexual harassment to free a former NBC executive, Jamie Tarses, from her contract at NBC so that ABC could hire her. The turmoil resulted in John F. Welch Jr., the chairman of NBC's parent company, General Electric, writing an angry letter to Mr. Eisner. (Mr. Ovitz denies that he fanned the rumors, and Ms. Tarses has said she never made accusations of sexual harassment.) **********Robert A. Iger, president of Capital Cities/ABC, was described by people at ABC as treading carefully with Mr. Ovitz. ''There is no sense of overt hostility,'' one senior ABC executive said. But the executive said Mr. Iger had what Mr. Ovitz wanted: a specific area of responsibility. ''I feel sorry for him,'' the executive said. ''How do you step in and earn a role for yourself? How do you make yourself valuable?'' Mr. Ovitz has acknowledged to friends that since Ms. Tarses has moved in, he has scaled back his involvement. **********(In fact, some Disney insiders believe that the reserved and well liked Mr. Iger, who has developed a rapport with Mr. Eisner, may one day himself ascend to the presidency.) **********Mr. Ovitz has also appeared to back off from direct involvement in the movie business after making deals with two former clients, Sean Connery and Martin Scorsese, to set up offices at Disney. Although Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, was reportedly less than comfortable about Mr. Ovitz's involvement, the two men have developed a relatively easy rapport. **********Mr. Ovitz has also been second- guessed elsewhere. For example, he was recently asked to approve a marketing plan for Disney's theme parks. But several days later, Mr. Eisner called the marketing executives back into his own office to re-review the plan and approve it himself. Mr. Ovitz has said privately that the move was not a slap against him but that their schedules necessitated two meetings. **********Even Spielberg Is Put Off **********Last year Mr. Ovitz even stirred the anger of Steven Spielberg, one of his top clients as an agent, as well as Edgar Bronfman Jr., the president of Seagram. Mr. Bronfman had offered Mr. Ovitz the job of running MCA, but the deal fell apart over Mr. Ovitz's demand for more money. Mr. Bronfman then struck a deal to distribute films by Dreamworks, partly owned by Mr. Spielberg, that allowed Mr. Spielberg to keep his animation division. **********After the deal was made, Mr. Ovitz called Mr. Bronfman and bluntly questioned the wisdom of giving up animation, Mr. Bronfman recalled. It was especially surprising because Mr. Ovitz had served as Mr. Spielberg's agent. Then Mr. Ovitz turned around and called Mr. Geffen and told him that he had congratulated Mr. Bronfman on the deal. When Mr. Spielberg, Mr. Geffen and Mr. Bronfman compared notes, all were angered at what they viewed as Mr. Ovitz's efforts to create suspicions about the arrangement. **********In continuing his effort to smooth relationships, Mr. Ovitz also met recently with Don Ohlmeyer, president of NBC, West Coast, who had been so furious at Mr. Ovitz over the sexual harassment issue and Ms. Tarses that he was quoted in Time as calling the Disney president ''the Antichrist.'' **********The meeting was held in Mr. Ohlmeyer's home and was not as testy as the luncheon with Mr. Geffen. But Mr. Ohlmeyer turned down Mr. Ovitz's request for a follow-up lunch at a restaurant. One person close to Mr. Ohlmeyer said he did not want to be seen with Mr. Ovitz or play any role in the Disney president's effort to revive his image."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/04/business/company-news-joint-venture-for-malaysian-petrochemical-complex.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;JOINT VENTURE FOR MALAYSIAN PETROCHEMICAL COMPLEX", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;JOINT VENTURE FOR MALAYSIAN PETROCHEMICAL COMPLEX", "body_text": " **********The Union Carbide Corporation of Danbury, Conn., and Petronas, Malaysia's state-owned oil company, said yesterday that they would form a joint venture to  build a Malaysian petrochemical complex to supply Southeast Asia, the world's fastest-growing market for petrochemicals.

Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi, ousting the Hutu former President, another chapter in the unceasing ethnic conflict here. Janine was one of hundreds of fashionably dressed young Tutsi strolling the beach in Bujumbura, Burundi's capital, drinking beer and flirting. **********The beach stretches from a yacht club patronized mostly by whites to the cranes of an active port, and two things about the scene stood out. First, no one had even a toe in the water, from which, despite the urban setting, hippos come out at night to feed.

Hutu parties easily won the presidency. But Tutsi soldiers, angry at being governed by a Hutu, assaulted the presidential palace four months later and killed President Melchior Ndadaye. The weak Hutu-Tutsi coalition Governments that followed were finally ended by Major Buyoya's coup on Thursday. The Tutsi-dominated army appointed him as President. **********Another member of the crowd said that no Hutu were joining the Cabinet Major  Buyoya is trying to form because that would lend legitimacy to \"the putsch,\" as  the Hutu parties refer to the takeover. **********Asked about that later at a news conference with foreign reporters, Major Buyoya said: \"That's not true. Bujumbura is a city of rumors. Don't listen to them.\" **********A senior diplomat here commented later: \"Oh, he'll find some, sure. But if they're from his own party, they don't count.

President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania avoided a more detailed response, however, saying in a statement that the issue would be addressed on Wednesday at a summit meeting of African countries in Arusha, Tanzania.

But it also raises questions about whether the fund management kept shareholders' best interests in mind and whether too much emphasis has been placed on short-term returns and big names, both of which can mean big money. **********Funds changing hands can suffer from a combination of problems: a loss of money as shareholders follow the old manager and high transaction costs as the replacement decides to reposition the portfolio. The route can be even bumpier when, as with Govett, the departing manager adheres to a quirky stock-picking style that's not likely to be duplicated. **********Mr. Van Wagoner, 40, is a gutsy manager who frenetically trades rapidly growing companies. Under his tutelage, Govett Smaller Companies had an average annualized return of 51.08 percent for the three years ended 1995, according to  Morningstar. Its return last year, of 69 percent, put it in second place among all small-company funds tracked by Morningstar. Because of differences in the way returns are calculated, it was first in the rankings produced by Lipper Analytical Services, Summit, N.J. **********Mr. Van Wagoner achieved that impressive performance in large measure by buying and flipping high-risk technology stocks that are thinly traded. **********As might be expected when a prominent manager departs, many investors redeemed their shares when Mr. Van Wagoner left at year-end. The fund shrank, because of redemptions and market losses, to $421 million in assets at the end of January from $519 million a month earlier. **********Jeffrey M. Bernstein, who had been an assistant portfolio manager on the small- and mid-cap team at Bankers Trust, found himself in an awkward position as Govett's new manager. Many of the portfolio's investments were thinly traded, and he needed to sell some of them to cash out fleeing shareholders and  to settle trades. **********\"To sell holdings in an orderly fashion while rapidly deploying cash, the fund was forced to carry a higher-than-ordinary cash balance,\" Mr. Bernstein said. The fund's cash level reached 13 percent in mid-January -- just when the technology sector was recovering from a nasty decline earlier that month. **********In effect, Mr. Bernstein was hurt coming and going. Heavy on technology stocks, he was forced to sell in a declining market. And when the market rebounded, he was out of the technology stocks. \"I really wanted to buy, but I had to sell,\" he said. \"It was brutal and painful to watch.\" **********Transaction costs hurt the fund even more. Mr. Bernstein reshuffled the fund's holdings, reducing the technology stake to 37 percent from 70 percent before he took over. Health care and biotech stocks, which accounted for just 4  or 5 percent of the fund when he stepped in, rose to 47 percent. **********\"In hindsight, I should have held onto the networking stocks, which bounced back,\" Mr. Bernstein said. \"But I didn't want to get so far into the hole so early and ruin the prospects for the fund for the entire year.\" **********Sitting in the catbird seat was Mr. Van Wagoner. His new fund was mostly cash when the tech stocks began their decline in early January. As a result, he picked up many of his favorites at rock-bottom prices. So Van Wagoner Emerging Growth was able to show double-digit returns for the month while its peers barely broke even. **********Mr. Bernstein, who joined Mr. Van Wagoner at the end of November to begin the transition, said that Mr. Van Wagoner pushed hard in December in a quest for a top year-end ranking. Michael J. Mayer, chairman of Berkley Capital Management,  adviser to the fund, said that Mr. Van Wagoner started December not in the lead  position but did a great job of pulling ahead of his competitors by making a big bet on technology stocks. **********To score big gains, the fund could not afford to leave a lot of money in cash. By the time Mr. Van Wagoner left, the fund had 8 percent of its assets in  cash. He considered that sufficient and said he would have liked to have been fully invested but could not -- given the situation. **********Still, the fund bled $39 million in the first three weeks of January, nearly  draining the $42 million cushion at the first of the year. The 8 percent cash reserve had to be replenished and reinforced, Mr. Bernstein said. \"It looks like enough, but you can't let it drop to zero, especially when redemptions are  increasing,\" he said. **********Mr. Mayer did not find fault with either manager. Mr. Van Wagoner made all the right moves until the end of the year, Mr. Mayer said, and \"the tech downturn caught everyone by surprise.\" **********AS the biggest fund companies have learned, giving shareholders plenty of time to get used to a transition can help. The fund can use that time to reassure shareholders, and at the least, money may leave gradually rather than suddenly. Vanguard, for example, announced that Mr. Neff's co-manager would replace him one full year before it actually happened. **********Probably the closest thing to the Govett turmoil in recent days was the sudden departure last summer of John Wallace from Oppenheimer Main Street Income and Growth. Like Mr. Van Wagoner, Mr. Wallace is a quirky manager who sets his own course. **********His current fund, Robertson Stephens Growth and Income, has gained almost 20  percent since its July 12 inception, beating its group by four percentage points, according to Morningstar. In the period, the Oppenheimer fund rose just 15.9 percent, about average. **********Given the changes at Govett, what's a shareholder to do now? Mr. Phillips of  Morningstar recommends switching to Mr. Van Wagoner's new fund. **********\"The new fund is smaller and better suited for Garrett Van Wagoner's aggressive style,\" Mr. Phillips said. \"Then there's the incentive of his name on the fund and the fact that he's a known quantity.\" **********Mr. Van Wagoner's fund is sold without a sales charge, while the Govett fund  carries an upfront charge of 4.95 percent. Along with Emerging Growth, which he  said had $20 million in assets and is thus too small to appear in most fund listings, Mr. Van Wagoner manages two other funds from his new office in San Francisco (800 228-2121): Microcap with $6 million and Midcap with $5 million. **********For now, at least, his old fund and his new emerging growth fund have some striking similarities. Mr. Van Wagoner has 45 percent in health care, while Mr.  Bernstein has 47 percent in health care and biotech. Mr. Van Wagoner said he was 25 percent in technology, while his successor is 37 percent in technology. **********\"I'm confident about the health care bet,\" Mr. Bernstein said. \"The thing now is to get some zip back in the fund. I'm working hard to not be so sensitive to  how the fund does every day because the markets are so unsettled and you have to position yourself for the year.\" **********The fund has stabilized since mid-January in terms of outflows, Mr. Bernstein added. **********Would the fund's adviser do anything differently if it had it to do over again? No, Mr. Mayer said. \"Jeff was fully apprised of the portfolio by the time Garrett left,\" he said. \"It should have been enough time to transition the portfolio.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/20/business/sony-mulls-a-public-sale-of-entertainment-assets.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Weinraub", "pub_date": "1996-11-20", "snippet": "Sony Corp president Nobuyuki Idei, at news briefing on newly completed overhaul of troubled Sony Pictures Entertainment, confirms retaining CS First Boston to advise firm on future strategy, including possible public offering of entertainment asse...", "word_count": 784, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sony Mulls a Public Sale of Entertainment Assets", "print_headline": "Sony Mulls a Public Sale of Entertainment Assets", "body_text": " **********The Sony Corporation's president, Nobuyuki Idei, said today that a newly completed overhaul of its troubled entertainment division  could eventually lead to a public stock sale in the unit. **********Responding to a question at a news briefing here, Mr. Idei said that the company had no plans to sell Sony Pictures Entertainment, the unit which includes the Columbia and Tristar studios, but that it would consider a public offering of Sony's entertainment assets, including its music division. **********''I don't deny our intention to make the company public, but I can't tell you when it will be,'' Mr. Idei said. Sony Pictures Entertainment ''is and will be a very important part of our business,'' he added. **********Mr. Idei, 58, who took over Sony 18 months ago, and whose background was in the company's consumer-products marketing, made his comments in a conference room across the street from Sony Studios in Culver City in West Los Angeles. Mr. Idei, who smiled periodically but was generally stern and somewhat terse, brushed aside questions about the profligate spending by the company's American executives that has marked Sony's troubled voyage into Hollywood. **********He said his decision earlier this year to appoint John Calley, a respected film studio executive, to run Sony's entertainment division was the prime example of what he had learned from the company's sour experience in Hollywood. ''I have learned a lot,'' Mr. Idei said. ''I've picked John Calley.'' **********Mr. Idei confirmed a report in Daily Variety today that Sony had retained the investment bank CS First Boston as an adviser on future strategy. But he strongly denied any intention to sell any Sony divisions and said that the bank had been retained to strengthen Sony's assets before any public offering. **********''To enhance our business we need to have advice from outsiders,'' Mr. Idei said. ''Sony is a $50 billion company. It's natural to have a relationship with investment banks.'' **********Mr. Idei was flanked by his new team at the studio: Mr. Calley, 66, who was named president and chief operating officer of Sony Pictures Entertainment; Masayuki  Nozoe, 47, a Sony marketing and electronics expert and the first Japanese executive Sony has placed in a top position inside the studio; Jeff Sagansky, a former television executive who was an executive vice president at Sony's United States operations and is now co-president at the entertainment division, and Bob Wynne, executive vice president of Sony Pictures Entertainment, who oversees legal affairs. **********Mr. Calley, the former president of United Artists and a top executive at Warner Brothers in the 1970's, said that the entertainment division's problems had been exaggerated and that other studios were also mismanaged. **********''If you scan every major studio in our town there'll be anecdotal material to curl your hair,'' he said. ''The perceptual negativity of this place was misplaced. There are elements to this studio that are fantastic.'' **********But then, in a tacit acknowledgment that Sony's studios were in a mess, he said, ''I really want to get it up and running in a way that management will feel comfortable.'' **********Sony's journey into the movie business has left a trail of financial wreckage for the Japanese electronics giant. Since 1989, when it purchased Columbia Studios and later Tristar, Sony has spent at least $7 billion, perhaps $8 billion, on its Hollywood studio operations. Two years ago Sony absorbed a staggering $3.2 billion write-off because of its failures in Hollywood. Many of Sony's top executives in the United States -- including Michael P. Schulhof, the head of Sony's American operations -- have since been ousted but with huge severance packages of as much as $15 million to $20 million. **********Sony officials acknowledge that the company went wrong from the outset with its choice of managers -- a pair of high-flying producers, Jon Peters and Peter Guber, who were chosen to run the company on the advice of Walter Yetnikoff, a music executive just out of drug and alcohol rehabilitation. The Peters-Guber team not only spent lavishly on overhead -- which ran $50 million to $75 million more than any other competitor -- but also hired friends such as Mark Canton, a former Warner Brothers executive, to oversee the studio; ousted top officials, and developed a weak slate of films that included some big-budget disasters. Mr. Guber himself walked off with a rich production deal at the studio. **********Certainly Columbia and Tristar have had some successes, including ''A League of Their Own,'' ''Sleepless in Seattle,'' ''Groundhog Day,'' ''Sense and Sensibility,'' ''Philadelphia'' and ''Jumanji.'' Notably, virtually all the top executives who nurtured these films have either been dismissed or quit. The company's high-profile disasters include ''Last Action Hero,'' ''I'll Do Anything,'' ''Mary Reilly,'' ''Geronimo,'' ''Money Train'' and, most recently, ''The Fan,'' ''The Cable Guy'' and ''Multiplicity.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/14/business/games-wooing-an-internet-audience.html": {"writer_name": "Kris Goodfellow", "pub_date": "1996-10-14", "snippet": "On-line games are offered by a number of companies, including Crossover Technologies, Interactive Imaginations, Sega, Maxis, Total Entertainment and Mpath Interactive; they struggle to meet players' expectations while contending with the restricti...", "word_count": 259, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Games Wooing an Internet Audience", "print_headline": "Games Wooing an Internet Audience", "body_text": " **********No one has as yet made a profit marrying multiplayer games to Prince Internet or built a business model with which to make money happily ever after. **********''There is no evidence of any single model working,'' said Steven L.

He had to choose the New York or Connecticut office, and he chose Greenwich. **********Two years later, though, the partners voted to dissolve the Greenwich office. ''I went from having to make a choice to not being wanted by either office,'' Mr. Skalka said. To top it off, his wife, Susan, had recently stopped working as a marketing representative at I.B.M. to care for their infant twin daughters. **********After polishing his resume, he began a job search, but one question kept popping up: How much business -- or, as lawyers put it, ''portable billings'' -- could he bring with him? **********Mr. Skalka's reply: ''Not much.'' **********His predicament has become common in the last decade or so. Law firms once assigned the same salaries to partners at the same level, but they eliminated this lockstep compensation in the late 1970's, intending to spur new business, shed deadwood, respond to client pressures on fees and increase revenues. **********But this new order widened the gap between partners who generated much business and those who drew little, and this in turn made firms less stable. Partners with significant business became the equivalent of free agents in sports. Switching firms, once rare, became commonplace, and departments and offices sometimes moved en masse. **********''The legal marketplace became a frictionless plane with few bonds holding anybody, anywhere,'' said Joel F. Henning, a consultant at Hildebrandt Inc. in Somerville, N.J. **********Mr. Skalka was not among those who could switch easily. Though he billed a healthy 1,900 to 2,000 hours a year and was responsible for several high-profile bankruptcy cases, he worked mostly for other partners or for clients that had a long relationship with the firm. Thus he received no credit for originating business and had little possibility of taking clients with him. **********''Anybody my age and 10 years out probably was more involved in carrying someone else's bags and developing their legal rather than business-getting skills,'' Mr. Skalka, who is 36, said. ''Most firms I interviewed weren't willing to take a chance with someone who had the potential to develop business. They wanted to see numbers.'' **********After a four-month search, the New Haven firm of Neubert, Pepe & Monteith offered him a job. ''Although a large firm might have viewed his contacts as insignificant, we didn't,'' said Greg Pepe of the three-year-old, three-partner firm. ''They dovetailed nicely with our transactions and litigation practices. Doug estimated he might generate $350,000, but did $500,000.'' **********As many partners change firms, client loyalty often shifts to individual lawyers. When Bruce Meckler left Pope & John Ltd. in Chicago to form Bates Meckler Bulger & Tilson in February 1994, he took along clients like Tri-City Brokerage Inc., a commercial wholesale insurer in San Francisco. **********''Our relationship with Pope & John primarily was Bruce,'' said Dan Real, a Tri-City executive vice president. ''We had confidence in him. We also had spent time educating him and his lawyers about our practices, which isn't easy to transfer.'' **********Because of this kind of loyalty, firms have sought partners from other firms, or ''lateral'' partners, who could bring immediate business and keep their other lawyers busy, particularly as legal work slowed in the late 1980's with the recession, the real estate crash and companies taking work in-house. ''Many firms considered lateral partners the white knights who would save them,'' said David Maister, a consultant in Boston. **********Today, lawyers with significant billings are more desirable than ever. The New York firm of Morrison Cohen Singer & Weinstein eagerly hired Larry Rodman to obtain $750,000 to $1 million in securities and real estate work that he offered after practicing at Teitlebaum, Hiller, Rodman, Paden & Hibsher, also in New York. **********The same climate has, with few exceptions, made switching tougher for partners without business. And the billings threshold that is needed to change firms is soaring. ''The price of admission has gone up,'' said Tom Clay, a consultant at Altman, Weil & Pensa in Newtown Square, Pa. **********While many firms and recruiters are reluctant to cite figures, $500,000 to $750,000 in portable billings for a midsize firm (50 to 100 lawyers) and $1 million to $1.5 million for a larger firm are in the ball park, said Laura Hagen, a recruiter at the Chicago office of Major, Hagen & Africa, a legal search firm. **********The billings are linked to a lawyer's desired income. For example, if the lawyer's target income is $500,000 or more, the partner will have to have a couple of million dollars in billings, said Lynn Mestel, a New York recruiter. **********Still, a single magic number will not provide an automatic open-sesame. Firms are putting newly hired lawyers under more intense scrutiny, after being burned by some firm-switchers' overly optimistic assessments and by the high cost to service certain clients. **********''Many partners don't deliberately misrepresent what they have, but often it's based on prior years and they can't know what will follow,'' said Marty Fay Africa, a recruiter with Major, Hagen & Africa's San Francisco office. **********Many firms are structuring new partners' earnings based on incentives akin to deals for sports stars. ''We may set a lower base and if the person brings in the business, they get a bonus,'' said Lee Miller, managing partner of Chicago's Rudnick & Wolfe. **********All this is causing ripples at law firms, prompting partners to guard their clients or share work only with associates. **********''At my former firm, there were some jealous partners who didn't want you to phone their clients when you worked on a matter,'' said Mike Mueller, who switched to Much Shelist Freed Denenberg Ament Bell & Rubenstein in Chicago from the larger firm of Keck, Mahin & Cate. ''There were also ones who, when you achieved a good result, they made the congratulatory call.'' At the associate level, getting business has become another factor in whether a person becomes a partner. **********So what happens to law partners without clients? ''They can stay where they are and hope they get work from colleagues, though their situation is precarious because of younger lawyers who bill at lower rates,'' Ms. Hagen said. **********''Or, they may have to alter their goals,'' said John Challenger of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm. ''We can place people, but it may not be at a comparable job.'' **********Some are lucky, as one securities partner, Mike Gamsky, was when he was hired by Much Shelist a year ago. Though he wasn't thinking of leaving his firm, Chapman & Cutler in Chicago, Mr. Gamsky listened when a headhunter called. ''It was a rare chance to move without business because the firm had the work,'' he said. **********Mr. Henning offers this caveat to managing partners: ''He who lives by the sword dies by the sword. The partner who will come to your firm for an extra $25,000 will leave your firm for another $25,000 to $30,000.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/20/business/company-news-american-enterprises-seeks-yale-international.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-07-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;AMERICAN ENTERPRISES SEEKS YALE INTERNATIONAL", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;AMERICAN ENTERPRISES SEEKS YALE INTERNATIONAL", "body_text": " **********American Enterprises L.L.C. began a cash tender offer yesterday for the remaining 80 percent of Yale International Inc., formerly known as Spreckels Industries, for $79.2 million.

Instead, the 72-year-old retired general is preparing for an election, confident that five million Muslim Kashmiris under Indian rule will vote eagerly for the first elected administration since New Delhi assumed direct control of the state's affairs in 1990. **********The election is to be held over four days beginning on Sept. 7, with results in early October. **********''I have been telling you for a long time that I came here to establish peace and democracy, and I think I am now on the verge of accomplishing it,'' Mr. Rao said in an interview. **********In the Governor's mansion, a former maharajah's palace far removed from the crowded Srinagar markets and remote villages where the guerrillas strike, it is possible, for a moment, to believe that peace might not be so far off in Kashmir, where at least 30,000 people have been killed in a conflict that began six years ago. **********In addition to the killing, the war has further embittered relations between India and Pakistan, and prompted fears of a new war between the two countries, this time with the added danger that both nations have the the ability to build nuclear weapons. **********Since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947, Kashmir has been divided, with India holding about 55 percent of the old state of Kashmir, Pakistan about 30 percent, and China, after its war with India in 1962, the rest. **********Both India and Pakistan claim sovereignty over all of Kashmir, dismissing the claims of many Kashmiris, including some of the most powerful guerrilla groups, that their distinct history entitles them to independence. **********While India hopes that the election will blunt the guerrillas' appeal, there are many here who say New Delhi is chasing an illusion. **********In this view, advanced by the guerrilla leaders, the election is a ploy to install a government of ''loyal'' Muslims pliable to New Delhi's will. Because the political parties that represent the divided guerrilla movement are boycotting the election, critics say the voting, especially if it is rigged like many past elections here, may be the prelude to a stepped-up conflict. **********''We've had elections before, and the Kashmir problem was never addressed, never resolved,'' said Abdul Gani Lone, a leader of the All-Party Hurriyat Conference, an umbrella group that includes most of the guerrilla factions. ''We are interested, deeply interested, in a permanent settlement of the dispute in Jammu and Kashmir, but an election under these circumstances will not help.'' **********Still, some factors appear to be working in New Delhi's favor. Among them is a shift in American policy that has been interpreted in India as a signal that Washington now accepts that the Indian-ruled part of Kashmir is, in effect, irrevocably part of India. For years, Washington has been ambivalent, calling Kashmir a disputed territory and calling for a settlement between India and Pakistan that is acceptable to the people of Kashmir. **********A signal of Washington's approach came in a speech this summer by the American Ambassador to India, Frank G. Wisner. Addressing Pakistani military officers, he urged Pakistan to accept the Kashmir vote as ''an alternative to the conflict'' and added the sentence that heartened Indian officials. **********''No effort to end the conflict in the state will succeed until all concerned acknowledge that, after nearly 50 years, there are certain fundamental realities that will not be changed,'' Mr. Wisner said. **********New Delhi has shown flexibility of its own. The new Government of Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda has promised to grant ''maximum autonomy'' to Jammu and Kashmir in negotiations with the new state government. **********The formula has been left vague, but to Kashmiris it implies a return to at least a measure of the autonomy promised by India's leaders in the early 1950's, then progressively eroded until Kashmiri discontent erupted into guerrilla warfare in 1989. **********In his Pakistan speech, Mr. Wisner warned that the voting must be free of intimidation by Indian troops if it is to have any meaning. With 500,000  troops and policemen making Srinagar and other towns look as though they are under military occupation, and guerrilla groups once again threatening to kill candidates and prevent voting, this may not be easy. Already, about 20 people linked to the pro-India parties taking part in the election have been killed. **********Attention has been focused on the man expected to win the election, Farooq Abdullah, who was the state's Chief Minister until his government was dismissed in 1990. Mr. Abdullah and his National Conference party were widely discredited by allegations of corruption and election-rigging in the past, but the turnout at Mr. Abdullah's rallies has suggested that widespread exhaustion with the war among ordinary Kashmiris may be translating into a willingness to give Mr. Abdullah, who is his 60's, a second chance. **********Demoralization among the guerrillas could also weigh in India's favor. Mr. Rao, the Governor, cited Indian intelligence estimates suggesting that there may be no more than 2,000 active guerrillas, and in any case no more than than 10,000. **********Even at the higher figure, he said, the guerrilla operations were down ''50 percent'' since 1992, when Mr. Rao took office and mounted a military crackdown.

J. Waldman, it was like winning the lottery: whisked away from Manhattan to spend Labor Day weekend tooling around the United States  Virgin Islands to brainstorm, ever so lightly, a tourism ad campaign. **********The sun was high, the hilltop trade winds gentle, their island guide colorful. Mr. Godwin, a copywriter at Lowe & Partners, an agency of the Interpublic Group of Companies, and Mr. Waldman, an art director at Lowe, developed the basic campaign on the first day of their trip last year. **********Two weeks later, a hurricane struck. **********Hurricane Marilyn, by far the most destructive storm in a record hurricane season, smashed through an already battered Caribbean. Winds of more than 100 miles an hour killed nine in the Virgin Islands and damaged or destroyed more than 90 percent of the buildings on St. Thomas, the hardest hit of the three islands. The $12 million advertising campaign, set to begin at Thanksgiving, was canceled. **********Then, all of a sudden, it was on again. Lowe, best known for its Diet Coke television commercial featuring the hard-body construction worker, introduced the results of its on-again-off-again Virgin Islands campaign yesterday. **********Roy L. Schneider, a surgeon who was elected governor of the Virgin Islands the year before, had campaigned on a platform of change and decided a new approach was essential to replace the old American paradise campaign from another agency. **********Tourism accounts for 70 percent of the islands' $1.2 billion economy and keeping the old campaign would not do, especially now that worried tourists thought the Virgin Islands had been blown off the map. **********No matter that the ads would start appearing the second week of January, long after Puerto Rico and Jamaica had started advertising and well into the December-to-March tourist season. Lowe & Partners would just have to scramble. **********The campaign's slogan is: \"The U.S. Virgin Islands. They're your islands.\" It is designed to distinguish the territory's American heritage from that of other  Caribbean resorts like Jamaica, with its British heritage, and Martinique, with  its French heritage. **********Virgin Islanders use American dollars, as do Puerto Ricans. But unlike Puerto Rico, which is a commonwealth with a more independent government, St. John, St.  Thomas and St. Croix are administered by the United States Secretary of the Interior. Also, unlike in Puerto Rico, the principal language is English, a fact that Lowe highlights in its campaign. **********What is more, a fact that is not directly mentioned in the campaign, the ads  are designed to show that the Virgin Islands have recovered. Many of the hotels  and most of the main airport have been repaired. All of the scenes in the broadcast and print campaign were taken after Hurricane Marilyn. **********All four commercials show an elegant white-bearded black man sitting in a straight-back chair near the beach. A goat is at his feet. In one, a steel guitar can be heard in the background as the Jelly Boys sing, \"Never Find a Lover Like Me.\" A man, wearing a white hat, white shirt and white pants, and his goat turn toward the camera and he says: \"You know we've been thinking. Our Virgin Islands are just like all the other Caribbean islands. With some minor exceptions. **********\"You won't need passports,\" he continues, in a lilting Caribbean accent, \"language dictionaries, foreign currency and you won't go crazy talking to non-English-speaking operators. Hey, you can even rent videos. So come to think  of it, we're nothing like those other islands.\" **********The camera pans to the goat with a television remote control in its mouth. \"Hey,\" says the man, \"gimme back that remote.\" **********Mr. Godwin and Mr. Waldman got the idea for a storyteller-guide from the example of their island guide on St. John, who also told them a fable of the islands as three brothers, which is also incorporated into the campaign. **********\"You can't just laundry-list a place's virtues,\" said Mr. Godwin, the copywriter, \"but you can tell them through a character, who is a little eccentric to help make him memorable.\" When, on the way down from a hilltop on St. John's, Mr. Godwin and Mr. Waldman's vehicle was blocked by a herd of stubborn goats, they got the quirk they were looking for. \"We made his best friend a goat,\" said Mr. Waldman, the art director. **********They found Olric Carrington, who plays the storyteller, after auditions of many actors in New York, Los Angeles, Miami and the Virgin Islands. A native, Mr. Carrington is a 71-year-old retired postmaster, amateur actor and, after profiles of him appeared in the local news media, the islands' version of Brad Pitt. **********Of course, advertising can't cure everything in Hurricane Marilyn's wake. Of  the Virgin Islands' two million tourists, about 1.2 million come from cruise ships on grand tours of the Caribbean. Most, if not all, of those passengers are back. **********But the number of other visitors may be down as much as 30 percent. And only  50 percent of St. Thomas's 4,800 rooms are back in commission. Still, the Virgin Islands may have another powerful draw: rooms that usually go for $150 to $500 in the winter are going for half off at many hotels."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/19/business/international-briefs-pearson-s-pretax-profit-increases-by-23.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 59, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Pearson's Pretax Profit Increases by 23%", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Pearson's Pretax Profit Increases by 23%", "body_text": " **********The British media company Pearson P.L.C. reported yesterday that its pretax profit rose 23 percent in 1995, helped by a gain from the sale of its stake in the satellite television broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting Group P.L.C.

The freeze, which the S.E.C. says is likely to go into effect today, will also apply to the proprietors of an electronic newsletter called SGA Goldstar, which was distributed over the Internet and through stock quotation services. **********Judge Gladys Kessler of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia also agreed to impose a temporary restraining order, said Erich T. Schwartz, a lawyer for the commission. A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 21; in the meantime, the commission is continuing to investigate Systems of Excellence, which  says it makes equipment for video tele-conferencing. **********The S.E.C. complains, among other things, that SGA's owners touted Systems of Excellence in return for secret, illegal shares in the company, which they dumped once the stock price skyrocketed in late May and early June. (It topped $4.75 on June 10, up from about 25 cents at the beginning of the year; now it is back below 50 cents a share.) **********Regulators have long suspected that the Internet, with its electronic linkage of computers, serves as a cheap and easy vehicle for stock promoters to reach unwary investors. But until now, the S.E.C.'s cases have involved the sale of unregistered securities, like investments in eel farms, not the manipulation of a listed stock. **********A spokesman for Systems of Excellence, Cynthia Gamer, said the company had no comment on the legal proceedings. The company's chairman, Charles O. Huttoe, could not be reached for comment; the newsletter writers, Theodore R. Melcher Jr. and Shannon B. Terry, did not return a telephone call to their office in Tennessee. **********Like an infamous stock fraud earlier this year -- involving a company called Comparator Systems -- Systems of Excellence had developed a devoted following among Internet users who posted thousands of messages about it on investing bulletin boards. **********Many of these messages cited SGA Goldstar's frequent reports on the stock, which were, as the S.E.C. complaint says, ''highly promotional, strongly urging accumulation of the stock, discouraging sales and even discouraging investors from independently verifying SGA's information.'' For example, on May 29, SGA wrote that its unnamed source ''informed us of a rumored Federal Government order so large which we do not even want to rumor the size of the order.'' **********SGA continued to tout the stock even after the S.E.C. halted trading on Oct. 7, citing concerns about the adequacy of the company's disclosures and questions about the possible sale of unregistered stock. **********What the newsletter did not disclose is that in January, according to S.E.C., Mr. Melcher had agreed to promote the stock in exchange for 300,000 shares of stock, 200,000 of which went to him personally and 100,000 to Mr. Terry through corporations they own. In June, each man received 50,000 shares of stock, the complaint says. The newsletter does print a disclaimer noting that ''personnel associated with SGA may own shares in the companies mentioned herein or may act as consultants thereto.'' **********Those shares were not registered, but were issued improperly by Mr. Huttoe, who also had millions of unregistered shares issued to accounts controlled by his wife, mother and niece, the complaint said. He was also promoting the stock himself by issuing misleading news releases, including one on May 28 that reported a $3.4 million order that did not exist. **********Meanwhile, Mr. Huttoe, Mr. Terry and Mr. Melcher were selling their shares, according to the S.E.C., which says Mr. Huttoe alone made almost $10 million from the scheme. Once the S.E.C. began investigating in September, Mr. Huttoe engaged in an elaborate effort to cover up the fraud by filing false documents with the commission, the S.E.C. says. **********As news of the S.E.C. action spread yesterday, Internet investors posted messages cursing Mr. Huttoe and SGA, considering hiring their own lawyer, and joking mournfully about writing a book about the SEXI saga. **********''The only problem with the book,'' one contributor wrote, ''is people reading it would think to themselves, 'what were the investors thinking?'

''Yet, the Fed may lose patience. Upcoming data from the National Association of Purchasing Management and the employment report will be crucial for the Fed,'' in deciding whether to tighten monetary policy in September, she continued, ''especially prices, vendor deliveries and wages.'' **********Yesterday's report raised fears that recent strong statistics coupled with an expected sharp rise in August payrolls could lead to another bout of selling for fear of a rate increase. **********Astrid Adolfson, an economist at MCM MoneyWatch in New York, noted that there was aggressive selling before the durables report, and said she had heard rumors of a leak. ''Over all,'' Ms. Adolfson said, ''the feeling was that durable goods cemented the view that July might have been an aberration. But now I think we have already seen weak retail sales bounce back, and housing is moderate. Now the durable goods numbers tell us that there is strength across the board.'' **********She also pointed to overseas markets getting stronger, suggesting that exports will soon add to growth. ''Jobless claims numbers continue to be low and are still at 1989 prerecession levels, showing good jobs growth,'' she added.

But it is a technology company far different from its parent. **********Some AT&T shareholders are wary of owning a technology stock and some, either by choice or by policy, avoid stocks outside the major indexes. ''The obvious concern is that there is a huge overhang of shareholders who may wish to eliminate or reduce their holdings,'' said Walter T. McCormick, a portfolio manager at Keystone Investments, who owns Lucent and considers its long-term outlook positive. **********In April, AT&T sold 122 million shares, or 18 percent, of Lucent in an initial public offering, the biggest such offering ever. About 525 million more shares will be distributed on Sept. 30 to AT&T shareholders, who will get one Lucent share for about every three shares of AT&T. On Friday, trading began in temporary shares representing those Lucent shares that are about to be issued. **********To the 3.3 million people who own AT&T stock, questions remain not only about whether Lucent can trim its bloated cost structure and remain competitive but also about whether Lucent is a good fit for their personal portfolios. As with all investment matters, it depends in part on the investor's financial goals and tax situation. **********One important factor for investors is that Lucent's stock will probably be more volatile than AT&T's. The sales cycle for telephone equipment means that more than 80 percent of Lucent's income comes in the last quarter of each year. The uneven income stream will simply be accentuated by the company's trend toward bigger and fewer contracts. So investors uncomfortable with volatility or who expect to need the proceeds soon from these shares may be tempted to bail out. **********Retirees and others investing mainly for income may consider Lucent's small payout a letdown, too. AT&T's dividend yield is about 2.4 percent, compared with an expected 0.76 percent for Lucent. AT&T says it intends to maintain its quarterly cash divided of 33 cents a share, while the new Lucent shares will pay 7.5 cents a share. **********A deterrent to selling for some people, though, will be the tax consequences. True, the Internal Revenue Service has determined that AT&T shareholders will not owe income tax just for receiving Lucent shares. But if they sell, they may realize big capital gains. After all, some people have owned AT&T stock since long before its divestiture of the Baby Bells in the early 1980's. **********The amount of the capital gain will be determined by the price of AT&T and Lucent shares on Sept. 30. Based on Friday's prices, about 77 percent of capital gains will be assessed to the AT&T shares, with the remaining 33 percent to Lucent. **********In the meantime, there are four shares trading on the Big Board: the regular AT&T and Lucent shares and two temporary stocks, one representing the Lucent shares about to be issued and another representing the AT&T shares minus their Lucent component. Assigned the ticker symbols LU WI (Lucent when issued) and T WD (AT&T when delivered), the temporary shares will stop trading with the close of the market on Sept. 30. Regular AT&T shares are now trading with coupons that are redeemable for Lucent shares on Oct. 3. **********Even though AT&T shareholders can sell Lucent shares now, it might be a mistake to rush to market. Prices might be depressed for several weeks by one-time selling. Professional investors are particularly concerned about whether Lucent will be included in the major stock indexes. Because AT&T is part of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock and the Dow Jones industrial indexes, funds that track these indexes will need to shed Lucent shares if the indexes don't add Lucent to their list. Standard & Poor's declined to comment on its plans. **********As the Dow Jones industrial average soared to a new high on Friday, Lucent's stock fell 50 cents, to $39.125; AT&T's stock gained 37.5 cents, to $55.25. **********Stock analysts expect declines in Lucent's price to be temporary. ''We are nervous about the fact that equipment company shares are not really what the AT&T shareholder base is used to,'' said Trent May, a co-manager of the Invesco Growth fund. ''But any weakness will be near term, while the shares get into the hands of people who want to own them.'' **********If Mr. May is right, investors who want to sell will benefit by waiting for the share price to bounce back. By the same token, aggressive investors might seize on a price downturn as a buying opportunity. If temporary selling pushes Lucent's stock, which went public at $27 a share earlier this year, below $35, it would be a good buy, said Lawrence Eakin, a technology investment analyst with Federated Investors, which holds Lucent in its Federated Capital Appreciation fund. **********Many stock analysts expect Lucent to outperform AT&T over the next few years. They point to rapid growth in the market for telephone equipment and systems. **********Deregulation in the United States means that phone companies of all types will increase their capital spending to compete in one another's markets. ''The deregulation of telecommunications has created a kind of free-for-all,'' said Mr. McCormick of Keystone. ''All the regional Bells can offer long distance, and AT&T might be able to offer local competitive service. Cable companies at some point may be offering telephony.'' **********United States demand for wireless equipment is growing rapidly, too, and Lucent has 40 percent of that market, about the same share as Ericsson. **********Furthermore, foreign markets will continue to open up, and many of them will need more capacity and new switching systems to handle more data. **********All told, Mr. McCormick expects the market for telecommunications equipment to grow more than 10 percent annually for several years. Even though much of the new business will go to Ericsson and Northern Telecom, Mr. McCormick says, Lucent will remain competitive. He expects Lucent's earnings to grow 15 percent a year. **********Like other financial analysts who track the company, Mr. McCormick says that much of Lucent's success depends on an ambitious cost-cutting plan. About 16,000 jobs will be gone by the end of this year -- part of the 23,000 jobs the company says it will cut by the end of 1998. That total represents about 17 percent of its 131,000 employees at the end of last year. **********Overhead now eats up about 25.5 percent of sales, compared with an industry average of 17 percent. If the company could reduce costs to that level, earnings per share would rise by 33 percent a year over the next three years, J. P. Morgan estimates. **********Even J. P. Morgan considers such cost cuts unrealistic. More likely, it says, is that Lucent will lower its costs to 22.5 percent of sales, raising earnings by 15 percent a year. **********As time-consuming as it may be to get caught up on a new stock, AT&T investors might as well get used to it. By the end of the year, AT&T will spin off another unit, NCR."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/13/business/dividend-meetings-044920.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-05-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 101, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "print_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "body_text": " **********Following is a partial list of dividend meetings this week: **********MONDAY **********FPL Group Inc **********Gabelli Eqty TR Inc **********Synovus Finl Corp **********TUESDAY **********Albany Intl Corp New **********Dial Corp **********Enserch Corp **********General Housewares Corp **********Hannaford Bros Co **********Int Paper Co **********Kerr-McGee Corp **********Minnesota Mng & Mfg Co **********Noram Energy Corp **********Trans-Atlantic Hldgs Inc **********WEDNESDAY **********Barnett Bks Inc **********Cardinal Health Inc **********First Amer Bk Corp **********First Data Corp **********Fla.

After earning degrees from Radcliffe College and Oxford, she endured first house arrest, then imprisonment  and exile, before the popular movement she led helped end a military dictatorship. In 1988, she won the country's first general election in more than a decade. **********But her first experience as Pakistan's leader was an embittering one, ending  abruptly after 20 months when holdovers from the military Government dismissed her for what they said was incompetence and corruption. After another period in  the political wilderness, harassed and prosecuted by a civilian Government close to the old military rulers, she won another election in October 1993 and set out to make sure, this time, that she remained in power. **********For Pakistan, the result has been far from the liberal traditions that Ms. Bhutto, who is 42, was exposed to in her student years abroad. **********A range of critics, including many who supported her in the past, say Ms. Bhutto's tenure this time has been marked by some of the same intolerance for opposition, the same disregard for law and civil liberties, and the same rampant corruption that contributed to the downfall of Ms. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. He was ousted as Prime Minister in 1977, and later hanged, in the coup that brought Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq to power. **********Among other things, the Bhutto Government over the last nine months has staged a bloody crackdown on armed rivals who have conducted what has amounted to a civil war in Karachi, the country's biggest city, in which the police have  been accused of killing hundreds of opponents. In addition, critics say, Ms. Bhutto has directed a campaign of harassment against judges, reporters and officials who have angered her, ordering transfers and demotions where she could, as well as using the country's tax and criminal laws to persecute political rivals. **********Ms. Bhutto declined to be interviewed for this article, saying through her aides that her schedule was overloaded. But her supporters, and even some of her critics, say the clue to her attitudes is contained in her remark about \"sloppy  liberals.\" What she meant, they say, was that tough and intolerant government may be unavoidable in this country, where a common Muslim faith and a shared distrust of India seem not enough to bind the 130 million people together. **********Her Record Accomplishments Vs. Liabilities **********In recent years, Pakistan has become increasingly lawless and violent in the  face of ethnic divisions, one of the world's fastest-growing populations, a deepening gulf between a wealthy minority and tens of millions who subsist on the equivalent of a dollar or less a day, and a powerful Muslim fundamentalist movement. On top of all this, the country is awash with narcotics and guns in the wake of the war in Afghanistan. **********Many of the strains have come together in Karachi, where thousands were killed in street warfare before the police crackdown began last year and the economy, accounting for 70 percent of Pakistan's tax revenues, was repeatedly paralyzed. **********Sympathizers also say there are more personal reasons why Ms. Bhutto has acted intemperately, beginning with the fact that she is still deeply wounded by the execution in 1979 of her father, condemned by a martial law court for his alleged complicity in the killing of a political rival, and unwilling to forgive anybody connected with the hanging, especially in the Pakistan Muslim League, which supported GeneralZia. **********Beyond this, these people say, is the fact that the Pakistani leader is a woman, the first to head the government of a Muslim country, and operates in a culture where women have traditionally been repressed. **********\"She's ruling in a jungle, and it's not easy,\" said Asma Jahangir, a lawyer who is chairman of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body  that has criticized alleged human rights abuses by the Bhutto Government. **********Other Pakistanis say criticism of Ms. Bhutto overlooks her accomplishments, among them the fact that she almost single-handedly kept alive hopes for democracy under General Zia, and now has helped keep Pakistan a parliamentary democracy -- however flawed -- for nearly eight years. Supporters point out that this is the longest single period of democratic rule in the country's history. **********\"Say what you will about the details, Benazir in Pakistan is synonomous with  democracy,\" one of Ms. Bhutto's aides said. **********Another achievement that many Pakistanis acknowledge is the country's turn away from a socialist economic system toward a market economy. Continuing reforms set in train when Nawaz Sharif was Prime Minister, Ms. Bhutto has sold off state-owned banks, power plants and industrial enterprises, and worked tirelessly to attract foreign investment. **********But with public opinion polls showing less than 20 percent support for the Bhutto Government, a more common view is that Ms. Bhutto herself is emblematic of the forces that have brought Pakistan to a low ebb. **********On the national holiday on Saturday celebrating the 1940 convention of the Muslim League that first voted for the establishment of Pakistan, many newspapers published special sections that were a mixture of nostalgia for the idealistic country that many Muslims of the 1940's hoped Pakistan might be and bitter lament for what it has become. **********Several newspapers questioned whether Pakistan can survive without a radical  change in the attitudes of the dominant political class -- Ms. Bhutto and the governing People's Party first of all, but also her rivals in the Muslim League. **********\"Before what little is left of Pakistan disappears, we the people must disassociate ourselves from the looters and forget party labels, for whether it  is the P.P.P. or the P.M.L., they are the same leopard with different spots,\" a  commentary in The News, a Lahore newspaper, said, referring to the People's Party and the Muslim League. **********Her Critics Is U.S. Backing The Wrong Horse? **********Some of the harshest criticism for the Pakistani leader has come from those who backed her return to power in 1993. **********Among these were many of the country's most powerful editors, who have almost all now turned against Ms. Bhutto. Many editors have been shocked by her use of  government powers to set newsprint prices, levy discretional taxes and punish newspapers and magazines that oppose the Government. Reporters for a government-owned news agency and for the state television network have been dismissed or transferred, and replaced by Bhutto supporters. **********Before she died this month of a brain seizure, one of the country's best-known editors, Razia Bhatti, offered a stiff warning to the Pakistani leader in one of the last editorials she wrote in Newsline, a Karachi-based newsmagazine. \"A clean government doesn't fear a free press,\" Ms. Bhatti wrote.  \"Ms. Bhutto would do well to remember that her years out of power will far outnumber her years in power. Tomorrow, or many tomorrows hence, she may feel the need for a free press again.\" **********Some of the criticism has been directed at the United States, which downgraded relations with Pakistan in 1990, cutting off military and economic aid and banning arms sales because of Pakistan's covert nuclear weapons program. But American criticism eased up after a coalition led by the People's Party narrowly beat a coalition led by the Muslim League in the 1993 election. Relieved that the Muslim League had not returned to power, the Clinton Administration has hailed Ms. Bhutto as a champion of democracy and secularism in the Muslim world. **********Despite fresh reports that Pakistan has continued its nuclear weapons program, buying equipment from China last year that it needed to process fissionable material, the Administration recently decided to permit delivery of  $368 million worth of military hardware that Pakistan had previously paid for. Ms. Bhutto, in turn, has told Pakistani audiences that the American arms package amounts to a vote of confidence in her Government. **********But many critics say Washington is backing the wrong horse, or at least for the wrong reasons. Among these is the former Pakistan cricket captain Imran Khan, who has said he may form his own political party on a platform promising a crackdown on corruption and law-breaking. In an interview, Mr. Khan said backing the Bhutto Government in the hope that it would hold off Muslim fundamentalism here was ill-conceived. **********\"It is the most naive perception, because the only reason that Islamic fundamentalism will ever gain ground in this country is corruption and injustice, and that's exactly what the Bhutto Government is all about,\" Mr. Khan said. **********Perhaps because he is so popular, outstripping Ms. Bhutto in public support in straw polls conducted by popular magazines, Mr. Khan has been a special object of Ms. Bhutto's ire. Recently, for instance, Bhutto loyalists in the state-owned Pakistan International Airways saw to it that a special airline calendar commemorating the 1992 world champion cricket team included photos of every team member except Mr. Khan. **********Critics say vindictiveness toward political opponents, a deeply ingrained tradition here, has exceeded even what Mr. Sharif had attempted as Prime Minister. The Bhutto Government has initiated more than 150 prosecutions -- including charges for treason, corruption, tax evasion and embezzlement -- against Mr. Sharif, now the main opposition leader as head of the Muslim League. **********As Prime Minister between Ms. Bhutto's first and second terms, Mr. Sharif used similar tactics against her, and laid corruption charges that kept Ms. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, in prison for two-and-a-half years. **********In addition to answering the multiple prosecutions brought against him by the Government, industrial companies owned by Mr. Sharif and his family have been ordered to repay government-owned banks the equivalent of more than $200 million in loans. Judged in default, some of the companies have been forced to shut down. The state-owned television network, which gives extensive coverage to Ms.  Bhutto's activities almost every night, has made Mr. Sharif a virtual nonperson. **********Some opposition figures have been punished still more harshly. Before the Government moved to have him released last week, Sheik Rashid, a Muslim League member of Parliament who had shocked even his own party with his vituperative and often vulgar attacks on Ms. Bhutto, served 18 months of a seven-year jail term imposed after a police search ordered by the Government uncovered an unlicensed assault rifle in his home, hardly an unusual possession here. **********Mr. Sharif, interviewed in the opposition leader's office in the National Assembly in Islamabad, said Ms. Bhutto's actions against her political opponents showed the hypocrisy with which she presented herself on more than 50 overseas trips she has made since returning to power. \"She has presented herself as a campaigner for human rights, for democracy, and for the cause of the downtrodden,\" he said. \"But she has two standards, one to present to the outside world, and one to present here.\" **********Some of Ms. Bhutto's supporters say her intolerance has grown under the influence of Mr. Zardari, her husband. A land-owning businessman with a love for polo and flashy cars, Mr. Zardari, who holds a parliamentary seat for the governing party, has combined business and politics in ways that have caused Ms. Bhutto's critics to accuse him of widespread corruption. He has denied the charges vehemently, and noted that all of the corruption charges laid against him by Mr. Sharif's Government were dismissed. **********Her Prospects Even Some Backers Are Disenchanted **********Some of Ms. Bhutto's critics say that her intolerance of opposition has encouraged violence by her supporters against her rivals, and that even if she knew nothing of the attacks in advance, she has done nothing to stop them. Last  week, People's Party supporters in Ms. Bhutto's home province of Sind attacked Mr. Sharif's car with wooden staves and rocks, smashing the windshield. The student wing of the People's Party has been at war with its Muslim League counterpart on college campuses across the country, with several incidents in which students and faculty members have been killed. **********But perhaps the starkest incident of its kind occurred in November when the police ransacked the home in the southern city of Hyderabad of Pervaiz Shah, a son-in-law of Pakistan's Chief Justice, Sajjad Ali Shah. A few days later, the younger Mr. Shah was dismissed without warning from his government job. At about the same time, his brother was also dismissed from his job with Pakistan International Airlines. **********The moves followed the opening of a Supreme Court hearing on a challenge to the Bhutto Government's attempts to influence court rulings by transferring and  demoting judges. **********This week, the Supreme Court, led by Mr. Shah, who was previously considered  a Bhutto supporter, stunned the Government by ordering changes in the way that judges are appointed and transferred that legal analysts said would sharply curb political manipulation. **********The move came amid signs that another Bhutto supporter, Farooq Leghari, who is Pakistan's President, is cautiously distancing himself from Ms. Bhutto. In January, Mr. Leghari chose Gen. Jehangir Karamat, then the country's second-highest-ranking general, to become the new army Chief of Staff, in preference to a junior general said to have been preferred by Ms. Bhutto. **********Some Pakistanis have seen these instances of resistance as a sign that she may have gone too far even for key members of her own camp. Some newspaper commentators have even speculated that Mr. Leghari could use a Zia-era provision of the Constitution to sack Ms. Bhutto, just as she was dismissed by another President in 1990. **********But most bets are that Ms. Bhutto will serve out her term until the next election, due in 1998 -- if only because, at least for now, she remains slightly less unpopular among Pakistanis than the man who would be likely to succeed her  if she was dismissed, Mr. Sharif."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/19/business/company-briefs-096920.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Company Briefs", "print_headline": "Company Briefs", "body_text": " **********UNITED ASSET MANAGEMENT CORP., a provider of investment management services, announced plans to acquire Clay Finlay Inc. of New York, a global equity investment firm with more than $6 billion in assets.

Davis says that every school paper he ever wrote, from second grade on, was about the weather. If it snowed at night while he was growing up just west of here in suburban Des Plaines, he stayed awake to collect hourly accumulation data. **********No wonder Mr. Davis, now 34 and head of the meteorology department at Smith Barney Inc. here, is loving 1996. **********With corn, soybean and wheat reserves so low that a poor harvest would send prices rocketing, Smith Barney's grain futures brokers and their clients have been hungry for advice on any weather that could affect crops. And with energy markets moving toward deregulation, utilities and speculators are buying, selling and swapping power on a scale unimaginable a few years ago -- and placing multimillion-dollar bets on how weather could affect demand for gas, heating oil and electricity. **********''The sensitivity to our work is unbelievable, and that makes it fun,'' Mr. Davis said on a recent morning, shortly after settling down in front of his computer at 5:30. **********Smith Barney, a unit of Travelers Group Inc., is the last major brokerage house to have its own weather department, but not because the importance of forecasters like Mr. Davis has diminished. Instead, a private weather industry with revenue approaching $200 million a year has grown up as brokerage firms join farmers, airlines, truckers, banks and dozens of other industries demanding more detailed, frequent and accurate forecasts than the National Weather Service provides. **********Companies like Accuweather Inc. of State College, Pa.; the Weatherservices Corporation of Lexington, Mass., and Weather Data Inc. of Wichita, Kan., are growing at double-digit rates. **********''The Government maintains the data collection infrastructure like it maintains highways, but about 85 percent of the weather information that reaches the public is now provided by the private sector,'' said Jeffrey Smith, executive director of the Commercial Weather Services Association, the industry's nine-year-old trade group in Washington. **********Nearly 40 percent of the industry's revenue comes from broadcasters and newspapers; Accuweather, the largest company, serves more than 700. **********Beyond the media, farmers with large operations want to know what to expect in each field over the span of a few hours to send machinery where it can do the most work. Ski resorts must know when they can efficiently make snow. Big banks rely on forecasts to decide how to transfer checks through the clearing system. **********''A regional bank like Banc One will want to know if Columbus is going to be socked in by fog, so it can drive checks to Cleveland or Cincinnati and still get them out that night,'' said Michael Leavitt, president of Weatherservices. ''They might pay a $25,000 retainer for information for all major airports for a year, but they could recoup that in a single night if they avoid losing the float on the funds they are collecting.'' **********New market niches pop up, too. Micro Forecasts Inc. of Portland, Ore., uses pagers to send forecasts for popular beaches to wind surfers. ''We can give a wind surfer enough information to reliably plan his weekend for $1 a shot,'' said the founder and president, Larry Hambrick. **********The markets served by Mr. Davis of Smith Barney, though, are among the most intense, since unexpected good weather can be nearly as disruptive as a brutal storm. **********On Feb. 23, 1994, for example, Mr. Davis forecast that no Arctic air would sweep into the United States in the next 10 days. Sandra Wilder, who manages Smith Barney's natural gas desk in Houston, recalled the reaction: a 4 percent tumble in the April natural gas futures contract. **********The contract fell 3 percent more over the next few days as Mr. Davis's prediction of milder-than-expected weather was borne out and seconded by others. **********Energy clients are now waiting anxiously for Mr. Davis's long-range forecast for this winter. Last October, after scrutinizing water temperatures in the Pacific and historic weather patterns, he told them to expect a colder-than-normal winter. The National Weather Service -- and most private companies, basing their work on its predictions -- were calling for relatively mild weather. **********''You don't see him just going along with the masses,'' said Mike Steffes, vice president for risk management at the natural gas division of Valero Energy, a San Antonio-based refiner and distributor. Valero, he said, made millions after buying call options last fall in anticipation that a cold winter would make gas prices soar by spring. **********In addition to long-range reports, Mr. Davis issues weekly updates for the grain, energy and other markets and a series of daily reports for brokers and clients. He speaks at company-sponsored investment meetings. And his reports are often faxed to investors and market researchers outside the Smith Barney network. **********''He is the single best forecaster in the business,'' said Richard Loewy, president of Agresources, a Chicago grain research firm that subscribes to Weatherservices' reports but also makes sure it keeps up with Mr. Davis's forecasts. **********Mr. Davis's day begins with what he calls ''weatherobics'': he pulls page after page of number-laden computer maps off a printer that has generated them overnight and steps on and off his chair to reach hooks from which he hangs them on the wall. Then he begins to check the differing European and National Weather Service outlooks to form his own view. **********The Government outlooks are generated from computer programs that give varying weights to winds, barometric pressure, temperatures and other factors. One arcane factor that Mr. Davis tracks, but few others bother to chart, is the wavelike patterns, over months, in air pressures at specific latitudes that help track changes in the jet stream. **********This summer, Mr. Davis said, the patterns pointed to a high probability for the heavy rains that struck northern Illinois, causing flooding in many Chicago suburbs, although the 17 inches that fell in some areas exceeded even his expectations. **********Just as important as what the maps say at the moment is how they evolved over the last 24 hours as new satellite and ground data were fed into the projections. A forecaster will not get much credit for projecting a significant chance of showers on a Tuesday morning, if several hours later he misses an opportunity to warn that they have become highly likely or all but certain. **********''Like any other weatherman, he says what the maps say and they are always changing,'' said Steven Freed, head of research at ADM Investor Services, the brokerage subsidiary of Archer Daniels Midland. As a competitor of Smith Barney, ADM has no direct access to Mr. Davis's reports, but Mr. Freed conceded that both brokers and clients routinely ask what has been heard about his views. **********Mr. Davis's command post is an open cubicle at the edge of a large floor of brokers' desks in a skyscraper across the street from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Brokers begin calling or dropping by as early as 6:40 A.M., and he enthusiastically walks them through his expectations, explaining where the Government models diverge from each other or from his own views. **********''Real meteorology is mathematics,'' Mr. Davis said. ''Half the challenge is to talk about it in terms those with no background can understand.'' **********To make sure they understand, some companies subscribe to multiple weather services. Utilicorp United, a utility based in Kansas City, Mo., has worked with three private services. It also downloads historic National Weather Service data from the Internet to an in-house computer system designed to revise projections in light of what happened under similar conditions in the past. **********The utility's energy traders also get faxed projections and calls from brokers at Smith Barney and other firms, in essence giving them access to the wisdom of Mr. Davis and all of the outside weather firms used by Smith Barney's competitors. **********''It helps because we now monitor the whole country,'' said Keith Stamm, vice president for energy trading. ''We used to only worry about weather in Missouri and Kansas, but now, through our nonregulated Aquila Power Marketing group, we are buying and selling everywhere and not just for our own needs.'' **********The explosion in energy trading, as much as any other single factor, is making life steadily more hectic for Mr. Davis. By 9 on a recent morning, he was talking to Smith Barney's London energy group on one line while holding a second telephone receiver on which a Memphis-based broker and his client, an Arkansas cotton producer, waited to ask if enough wet weather was on the way to slow the local harvest. **********A third line rang unanswered, because Mr. Davis's assistant, Basilio Lopez Jr., had momentarily stepped away. **********In a month, Mr. Davis said later, he would be even busier. ''Right now is the transition time,'' he said. ''It's a bit peaceful because it's to the point where we don't see any frost arriving early enough to do major damage to the grains. We are putting them to bed, and just starting to look forward to the winter energy markets.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/13/business/people.html": {"writer_name": "David Barboza", "pub_date": "1996-11-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 87, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "People", "body_text": " **********Jim Helberg was named senior vice president and media director at G2, a division of Grey Advertising, Huntington Beach, Calif., succeeding Gail Bindi, who left. **********He was previously senior vice president and executive media director at Rogge, Effler & Partners, Los Angeles. **********Kate Kelly Smith was named to the long-vacant position of advertising director at House Beautiful magazine, New York, a publication of the Hearst Corporation. **********She had been the home furnishings director at Architectural Digest, New York, which is published by the Conde Nast Publications unit of Advance Publications."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/19/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-2-units-expanding-at-interpublic.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 170, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;2 Units Expanding At Interpublic", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;2 Units Expanding At Interpublic", "body_text": " **********Two units of the Interpublic Group of Companies are expanding. **********One unit, the Lowe Group, has acquired for undisclosed terms what it called a substantial minority stake in Roche Macaulay & Partners in Toronto and merged that agency with Lowe SMS in Toronto.

Shift a big chunk of the system's trust fund to common stocks, which have enjoyed four times the return of Treasury bonds since the 1920's. **********This proposal, championed by Robert M. Ball, a former Social Security commissioner, is being offered as an alternative to the supposedly more radical departures, namely privatization. And when the Social Security advisory panel delivers it -- probably after the Presidential election -- Mr. Ball's idea is likely to get a cordial reception from politicians loath to raise payroll taxes or make the deep cuts in benefits. **********But investing in stocks is a radical idea, too, suggests Lawrence White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business and consultant to the Investment Company Institute, a trade association for the investment industry. At best, it constitutes socially redeeming sleight of hand that shifts risk to future taxpayers and pensioners. At worst, it is an invitation to meddle in the world's most efficient capital market. ''This would push Social Security deep into unexplored territory of public finance,'' Mr. White said. **********Social Security revenue not needed to cover current pension checks goes into a trust fund credited with interest at Treasury bond rates. But as every sophisticated investor knows, equities have proved to be a much better deal than bonds over the long haul. The real return to common stocks over the last 70 years has exceeded 7 percent, while Treasury bonds have averaged less than 2 percent. **********So why should baby boomers be deprived of the gain? Why, indeed: Mr. Ball, along with four other members of the 13-member advisory panel proposes to shovel $800 billion of the roughly $2 trillion trust fund surplus projected between 2000 and 2015 into stocks. Quadrupling the estimated return on this portion of the surplus would relieve the pressure to cut benefits or raise taxes to keep Social Security going. **********But Joseph Quinn, an economist at Boston College, wonders whether changes in economic behavior would mirror the accounting shuffle. The point of reform, he suggests, is either to increase national savings to pay for the boomers' retirement or to cut their claims on future national income. And forcing the Treasury to find other buyers for $800 billion in bonds to finance Government deficits would be self-defeating since no one would be induced to save more or consume less. **********On the other hand, if Congress cut the deficit when trust fund surpluses were unavailable to paper it over, national savings probably would rise. Were Congress so moved, though, it would not need Mr. Ball to pull up its fiscal socks. **********Not so fast. If an extra $800 billion went into private investments with four times the return of Treasuries, wouldn't the economy grow more rapidly and add to the nation's capacity to cover the cost of the boomers' retirement? **********No one is quite sure where the historical ''equity premium'' -- the extra return on common stock that apparently reflects much more than the amount needed to compensate investors for added risk -- comes from, suggests Stephen Zeldes, an economist at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business. ''If we could be sure that the premium would be sustained -- a big if -- there would be no need to use Social Security's funding problems to justify the switch,'' he said. It would pay simply to sell more Government bonds and invest the proceeds in the stock market. **********Mr. White raises a different issue. Presumably the Government would be a passive investor, buying stocks the way index mutual funds do. But would Uncle Sam limit purchases to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index when thousands of other stocks beckoned? Would it stop at traded stocks, when millions of small businesses need capital? And what about social considerations? Would Washington invest in tobacco, or in companies that run sweatshops in Guatemala? ''Passive investing is tougher than its sounds,'' Mr. White said. **********One need not look far to understand the origins of the Ball plan. Like many Americans -- probably a majority -- Mr. Ball wants to keep a 60-year-old system on its tried-and-true path, using collective resources to provide funds for generous public pensions for all. From this perspective, circuitous means of replenishing the trust fund are justified if the public will not stand for straightforward ones like tax increases. **********But simply assuming the higher returns of stocks save the day raises the political ante. If Americans don't save more as a consequence or if economic growth does not exceed soberer expectations, the cuts needed to fix Social Security a decade or two down the road will be far greater than they are today. In short, what Americans choose not to know now could hurt later on."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/25/business/company-news-washington-water-power-unit-adds-marketing-concern.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-05-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 81, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;WASHINGTON WATER POWER UNIT ADDS MARKETING CONCERN", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;WASHINGTON WATER POWER UNIT ADDS MARKETING CONCERN", "body_text": " **********The Washington Water Power Company said yesterday that its Pentzer Corporation unit, the corporate investment arm, had acquired F.

Such signs of a slowing economy are taken as indicators that inflation will be weak. The long bonds did not, however, follow the usual script yesterday as the Clinton Administration said that the job market might actually have improved last month but that the numbers failed to show that because the data were skewed by the Northeast blizzard and the partial shutdown of the Government. **********Given the vagaries of the weather, the long end of the government securities  market seemed to place more emphasis on other factors, like higher commodity prices, that might suggest a rise in inflation and on the looming supply of new  debt issues coming to market in the next week. **********The 30-year bond dropped 110/32 , to 10922/32 for a yield of 6.16 percent, up from 6.07 percent on Thursday. The two-year note held steady at 4.90 percent. **********The Treasury will be selling about $84.9 billion in new debt securities next  week, with $44.5 billion of that representing the Government's quarterly refunding, much of it in long maturities. **********Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said, \"For some market participants, the weak employment report today may have been skewed by a number of factors including the blizzard on the East Coast, the strike in New York and the temporary Government shutdown.\" He was referring to the strike by building maintenance workers in New York City. **********He also noted as reasons for some of the market's fears, the high daily reading of commodity prices, the stronger-than-expected numbers in a Columbia University inflation index and the surge in hourly earnings. **********\"Although many market participants reasoned that the loss of many jobs at the low end of the wage structure during the month may have overly boosted the average hourly earnings numbers,\" Mr. Chan said, \"others were not as quick to discount the previous month's strength, which could not be blamed on the same factor.\" **********\"In a market which has thrived on the expectation of future Fed easings, most market players quickly realized that if inflation were to accelerate, then bonds would decline,\" he said. **********Hamilton Davis, a vice president of government trading at Everen Securities Inc. in Chicago, attributed a good part of the higher bond yields to the coming  refunding, particularly given the large amount of longer maturities involved. He also said that all the weakness in the January payroll data could not be explained away by weather conditions. **********\"So you have a technical condition where buyers are more comfortable buying shorter maturities believing that the Fed is on their side,\" Mr. Davis said. \"Consequently dealers of Treasury securities view the refunding as an opportunity to make money on a setup trade.\" **********Mr. Davis described the weakness in bonds as dealers' positioning themselves  to buy the longer maturities next week at yields that would give them the potential for price improvement after the auctions were over. **********In when-issued trading, the three-year note to be auctioned on Tuesday was offered at a price to yield 5.02 percent.

Water and electricity come regularly now. **********When Biljana Jandric, a staff librarian, wants a cup of coffee, she no longer has to sneak off to the morgue, where powerful disinfectants burned better than most things for boiling a pot of water. **********''Peace for us is very nice,'' said Dr. Ismet Gavrankapetanovic, an orthopedic surgeon who for three years more or less lived inside the hospital, performing hundreds of amputations among thousands of operations as he and a small, overworked staff of doctors tended to nearly all of the people -- well over 50,000 -- wounded in the Bosnian Serbs' siege of Sarajevo. **********But the war has never really left Kosevo. And, as is true around Bosnia in almost every corner of life, peace has brought its own problems. **********In the children's ward that he oversees, Dr. Gavrankapetanovic tended to a bruised and groaning boy about 5 years old, his head stitched in several places, an arm and a leg in bandages. **********''He needs some rest,'' the doctor said. ''But he must not fall asleep.'' Another boy, Maid Bucman, 7, leaning on a pair of crutches, looked on. **********The first boy, the doctor said, was hit by a car -- something that is more and more common these days as Sarajevans career through the streets, unused to driving after nearly four years of leaving their cars in storage. And the second boy's left foot was blown off in Mostar by an anti-personnel mine. **********Mine wounds are the most common serious injuries seen at the hospital since the fighting and shelling stopped late last year. **********''In the future, I'm afraid we will have more of this,'' Dr. Gavrankapetanovic said. **********Perhaps no single place in Bosnia witnessed more of the war's horror than Kosevo Hospital, a huge complex of boxy buildings on a hill in north Sarajevo that sat in clear sight of Bosnian Serb shelling positions. **********The numbers alone are staggering. Dr. Fuad Sisic, a chief surgeon here, published a grimly illustrated book this year on the art of war medicine. **********In it, he compiled the statistics for the first three years. In 1992, for example, the hospital treated 22,549 people wounded. That works out to 1,879 people a month, 62 people a day. The worst day that year was June 8, when 332 people came in wounded. **********The numbers do not show that surgeons often worked by flashlight on floors that stayed streaked with blood because no one wanted to spend the precious commodity of water to clean it. **********Dr. Mufid Lazovic, the deputy director of the trauma ward, said one day in particular stood out. In 1992, eight people were killed and many more were wounded in a mortar attack in the old town of Sarajevo. He operated on several little girls, all terribly mangled. It turned out that he knew them all. **********''All of them were my neighbors,'' Dr. Lazovic said, speaking at first with detachment but then with rising emotion. ''I didn't recognize them. After the surgery the parents arrived and asked about their children -- then I realized who they were.'' **********Dr. Gavrankapetanovic, a big and buoyant man who is only 33, poked his head out a window and pointed out a huge hole in the building's concrete side where a Serbian shell had hit. **********''Look, that was where it hit first,'' he said. Then he opened the door to Room 123 to show the hole where the shell blasted through on its way down the corridor, wounding three people but luckily killing no one. **********But around the hospital there are slow signs of recovery. Just last week, workers installed equipment to insure a constant supply of water to all the buildings, which is still not the case around Sarajevo. **********One morgue worker remembered that on his first day of work, June 12, 1992, there were 250 bodies stacked inside, with refrigeration space for only 10. In the last week, only 13 bodies arrived to be stored there -- all people who died of natural causes. **********Ms. Jandric, the librarian, reported that she now weighs 140 pounds, up from 100 pounds at the worst time of the war. **********''We are fat now,'' she said, ''but during the war we were very thin.'' **********Doctors and nurses are finally being paid, which was not the case during much of the war. And, just as Kosevo had to shift abruptly from being a regular hospital to a war ward, it is now faces the issue of how to return, as long as peace lasts, back to a regular hospital. **********''There are a lot of changes,'' Dr. Lazovic said. ''There is not as much tension as it used to be. So we are looking at different kinds of problems. How do we organize ourselves? What kind of salaries should we have? **********''We are going from socialism to capitalism, from war to peace.'' **********The doctor stood up to go on a quick round through the ward. He stopped to talk to Ostoja Obradovic, 42, a former soldier who first came to the trauma unit in November 1994 when he lost much of a leg to a mine. But what was left of his leg began hurting again, and he required more treatment. **********Another patient, Ripet Hairic, 38, never received proper care when his hip was shattered two years ago after a grenade hit the car he was driving. Now he lay waiting for a reconstructive operation, with several pins in his side. **********The doctor stopped to talk to a woman, who is 67 but looked a decade or more older. He said her screams at night were waking up other patients. She is a Muslim refugee from Srebrenica, where perhaps 5,000 Muslims were massacred by Bosnian Serbs. And she was dreaming about her five sons, whom she never heard from, the doctor said. **********Dr. Lazovic said the war, and all the sorrows that echoed through Kosevo's halls, had worked a change on him and his colleagues. **********''You can see what in life really counts,'' he said. ''Material things are not so important. You learn how to be happy.'' **********Dr. Gavrankapetanovic said he was pleased that Sarajevo was not so cut off anymore, even if he had no success yet in finding doctors outside Bosnia to send him new medical books, which he has not been able to read for four years. ''We now have a connection with the outside world,'' he said. ''You can get in a car and go to the country. You can go to the coast.'' **********''But it's not like before the war,'' he added. ''We are old. We know so much. We still remember the things that happened here. It's lucky we have a brain so we can forget some things.'' **********A woman called Dr. Gavrankapetanovic into the hallway and gave him a small fold of bills. It was his salary, still a novel enough idea that he smiled broadly. ''Yes, yes,'' he said, sliding the money into his chest pocket. ''The coast.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/27/world/peres-and-his-foe-do-verbal-battle-in-sole-tv-debate.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1996-05-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1241, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PERES AND HIS FOE DO VERBAL BATTLE IN SOLE TV DEBATE", "print_headline": "PERES AND HIS FOE DO VERBAL BATTLE IN SOLE TV DEBATE", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Benjamin Netanyahu squared off today for their first and only direct showdown of the Israeli election campaign, a televised debate in which Mr. Peres pitted his experience, decorum and vision against his challenger's youth, television skills and aggressiveness. **********\"I have no doubt in the path we are leading,\" Mr. Peres declared in a voice that rarely veered from a low and measured drone. He stared evenly at the moderator and invoked his long record in government, the legacy of his assassinated predecessor, Yitzhak Rabin, and the hope of a comprehensive Middle  East peace. **********The way of Mr. Peres brought neither peace to Israel nor real security,\" Mr. Netanyahu fired back with a stern glance at his opponent. \"It brings us fear.\" His gestures underscored his central theme that the Labor Government had  sacrificed the safety of Israelis in a misguided search for peace. **********After 30 minutes of this, the general sense among commentators was that Mr. Netanyahu, the Likud Party leader, had confirmed his vastly superior on-camera skills but that Mr. Peres had come off as more substantive. **********But there was no immediate indication whether either candidate had made much  of a dent in the crucial cluster of undecided votes with 60 hours to go before the polling booths open on Wednesday. Takers of opinion polls said the race was  still too close to call. **********The televised debate was more a joint news conference, with the moderator, Dan Margalit, posing questions to the candidates by turns. **********In the tightly controlled campaign, it was the only time Mr. Peres and Mr. Netanyahu were seen together. Aside from this debate, Israeli rules bar the candidates from being seen on television or heard on radio for the last 21 days  of the campaign. **********Although similar debates were held in previous elections, this is the first time that Israelis are voting separately for Prime Minister and for Parliament.  As a result, it is the first race in which Israelis have focused sharply on individuals, and the debate was heavily touted as a chance for voters to take the real measure of the contenders. **********For the first time in the campaign, Mr. Margalit, a respected political commentator, challenged each candidate on his personal weak spot -- Mr. Peres, 72, on his age, and Mr. Netanyahu on an admitted extramarital affair and his three marriages. Both sides had largely refrained from personal attacks in the campaign. **********Mr. Peres came back with one of his few touches of humor: \"If you had to elect a male model and not a Prime Minister, then the age would be an issue. I feel great. My ability to work is excellent. I know a lot of people who are young, but their thoughts are very old.\" **********Mr. Netanyahu replied to Mr. Margalit's question as he did to nearly every other one, turning it against Mr. Peres: \"Concerning this matter that you bring  up now, I expressed a lot of sorrow. It hurt me. It hurt my wife. It hurt my family. It was a mistake. But the mistake that Mr. Peres made, that he is making now, that he made in the last four years, hurts the whole people of Israel. People here live in fear.\" **********Mr. Margalit also raised a question about whether Mr. Netanyahu's application to change his name to Ben Nitay while he was living in the United States in the  1970's meant that he thought of staying there. Mr. Netanyahu still holds American as well as Israeli citizenship. **********\"Not for a single moment,\" Mr. Netanyahu declared. \"I come from a Jewish, Zionist family, with roots here for 100 years.\" Then came the invariable attack  on Mr. Peres: \"It is not enough, Mr. Peres, to pose with children. You have to insure their security.\" **********That was Mr. Netanyahu's tactic throughout the debate. When asked what he would do about Jewish settlements in the West Bank, or about civil rights, or about the economy, he virtually disregarded the questions and instead attacked Mr. Peres and his Government's peace agreements with the Palestinians. **********He described an Israel living in fear as a direct result of his opponent's policies. \"Our children are afraid to get on a bus,\" he said. \"Many of you who are watching us now are getting up in the morning and ask themselves whether the next attack will happen today. Mr. Peres, you brought our security situation to  a nadir.\" **********Demonstrating careful preparation, Mr. Netanyahu twice talked of moving forward \"with the help of God\" -- an obvious nod to the critical Orthodox vote -- and he avoided mentioning the revered Mr. Rabin, who was assassinated in November, focusing all of his attacks on Mr. Peres and the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat. **********But Mr. Peres rarely took note of Mr. Netanyahu. At the end, when each candidate got his only chance to ask the other a direct question, Mr. Peres dismissively said, \"I have no question for Mr. Netanyahu.\" He then went on to ask one anyway, disguised as a \"request.\" **********His approach was to emphasize his experience and the agreements reached with  Arab countries. He spoke of suddenly having to continue Mr. Rabin's work. **********\"Rabin was murdered in front of my eyes,\" Mr. Peres said. \"Otherwise it would have been he who would be sitting here in my place. The messenger was murdered,  but not the message.\" **********Commentators and political scientists who watched the debate generally agreed that Mr. Netanyahu had the better delivery but Mr. Peres had the better message. **********\"If the question was who would get the role of Othello, there is no doubt Netanyahu would win,\" said Shimon Schiffer, a commentator with the daily Yediot  Ahronot. \"But the Israeli voter asks himself who do I believe, who do I trust more, and I think Shimon Peres came out as the more serious candidate with a real background.\" **********But at this stage, the real question is whether Mr. Netanyahu swayed enough undecided voters to overcome a deficit of several points in the opinion polls. Hanoch Smith, who has conducted polls in the last several elections, said two-thirds of the undecided voters had voted for the Likud last time, and only one-third for Labor, so if Mr. Netanyahu could prevail on wavering Likud supporters to return to his fold, he would narrow the gap considerably. **********Though Israel has no previous experience with direct elections, Mr. Smith said, the power of the debate is sure to be \"enormous.\" **********Mr. Schiffer said Mr. Netanyahu had made a credible appeal to the waverers. \"If the assumption is that the floating voters are leaning to the right and asking questions about personal security,\" he said, \"they probably heard some good answers from Netanyahu. He was very firm. He promised to continue the peace process with more caution.\" **********But several others said they felt that Mr. Netanyahu had failed to overcome his major handicap in the campaign: the sense that he had neither the experience nor the plan to provide the security he promised. **********\"He's running a campaign of intimidation, and not projecting an alternate visition,\" said David Makovsky, a political reporter for the Jerusalem Post. \"With Peres, you know what he's going to do. With Bibi\" -- Mr. Netanyahu's nickname -- \"you still don't know.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/17/world/world-news-briefs-us-warns-americans-living-in-saudi-arabia.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-05-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 139, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs;U.S. Warns Americans Living in Saudi Arabia", "print_headline": "World News Briefs;U.S. Warns Americans Living in Saudi Arabia", "body_text": " **********The State Department, concerned about the threat of another attack on American institutions in Saudi Arabia, issued a warning today to Americans throughout the kingdom. **********The statement, issued here and in Riyadh, said the American Embassy there has received an anonymous telephone call threatening retaliation if four Saudis charged in a bombing six months ago are punished. **********The attack, at a United States-run military institution in Riyadh, killed five Americans and two Indians.

Albright, the American representative, said this week. ''This is a big deal, electing a Secretary General of the United Nations. It can't be made in the closing hours of December.'' **********The Administration, which says Mr. Boutros-Ghali has been ineffective in reforming the United Nations, has threatened to use the American veto to block him from a second five-year term. His current term ends on Dec. 31. **********Ms. Albright, on the defensive against the widespread belief among diplomats that the Administration's campaign against Mr. Boutros-Ghali arose from the politics of the Presidential race, said the decision ''was made in the most responsible way.'' **********The American determination to replace the Secretary General was leaked to the press by Secretary of State Warren Christopher in June without first notifying other United Nations delegations. This, plus subsequent efforts by the Administration to belittle Mr. Boutros-Ghali's achievements and its warning to United Nations staff members not to use their positions to campaign for his re-election, have generated new sympathy for the Secretary General. **********The uncooperative attitude of European and other nations here also reflects unease in many capitals toward American efforts to impede commercial relations that foreign companies and citizens have with other countries -- particularly Cuba, Iran and Libya. President Clinton has signed laws that threaten to punish foreigners for trade and investment with Cuba because of its shooting down of unarmed civilian planes in February and with Iran and Libya because the United States considers them sponsors of terrorism. **********At the United Nations, delegations have not responded to American calls to help find a replacement for Mr. Boutros-Ghali, who has received formal if tepid support from African and Arab nations and from China. French diplomats say President Jacques Chirac has also been supportive. Indeed, many here ask if the United States can find a better candidate than Mr. Boutros-Ghali, an Egyptian diplomat who has presided over the largest staff and budget cuts in United Nations history. **********Ms. Albright said countries that ''insist on supporting Boutros-Ghali, rather than working to find a candidate who is somebody who will have the general confidence not only of the United States but others,'' should understand that the American decision is irrevocable. **********''One of the reasons we made the decision when we did was to allow other candidates to come forward,'' she said. ''I think that it is a little bit irresponsible not to be more active for other Council members in terms of trying to figure out how the process ought to work.'' **********Although the Secretary General and Ms. Albright have exchanged barbed comments on policy issues, they worked together reasonably well, United Nations officials say. Officials and diplomats are puzzled by the harsh language about the Secretary General that has emanated from the State Department in recent months. The United Nations spokesman's office has produced copies of effusive toasts Mr. Clinton made to Mr. Boutros-Ghali at the United Nations' 50th anniversary lunch last fall and at times before. **********''The President is in favor of a strong United Nations,'' Ms. Albright said. ''He has personal respect for Boutros-Ghali, something that he indicated at the 50th anniversary toast. After all, Boutros-Ghali was the host of the party, and the President is a very well brought-up and highly polite person. I do not think I would read too much into a toast.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/13/business/worldbusiness/IHT-static-rises-at-hk-telecom.html": {"writer_name": "Kevin Murphy", "pub_date": "1996-06-13", "snippet": "The post-colonial future is suddenly looking rocky for Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd. as concerns about Hong Kong's transition to Chinese rule next year and industry deregulation worldwide combine to cloud its prospects..On Wednesday, as its st...", "word_count": 2471, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Static Rises at HK Telecom", "print_headline": "Static Rises at HK Telecom", "body_text": " **********The post-colonial future is suddenly looking rocky for Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd. as concerns about Hong Kong's transition to Chinese rule next year and industry deregulation worldwide combine to cloud its prospects. **********On Wednesday, as its stock finished at a low for 1996, the company said it would seek compensation from the local government if it had to surrender any of the monopoly rights it had been granted on international telephone services until 2006. **********But until the company confirmed late Tuesday that talks on those rights were under way, few people knew that the terms regulating a business that contributed more than half of its 29.4 billion Hong Kong dollars ($3.8 billion) in sales last year were up for review **********The news followed the sale on Monday by one of its major shareholders, CITIC Pacific Ltd. a company controlled by China's governing State Council, of a 2 percent stake in the company for 3 billion Hong Kong dollars to an unidentified buyer. **********Although CITIC Pacific, an offshoot of an investment holding company owned by China's State Council, retains an 8 percent stake in Hong Kong Telecom, the sale \u2014 at a 6 percent discount to the stock's previous closing price \u2014 increased concerns that the company's roster of shareholders faces continued change in the months ahead. **********CITIC Pacific's stake in Hong Kong Telecom has long been viewed as the telecommunications concern's \"insurance policy\" against interference by Chinese officials uncomfortable with a British company dominating the local telephone market. **********On Tuesday, Hong Kong Telecom's share price fell nearly 3 percent as investors weighed CITIC Pacific's decision to reduce its stake in a business 57.5 percent owned by Britain's Cable & Wireless PLC.

The credibility of the Conservative Government, which is  shaky already, has been undermined by the way it has handled the issue. **********First, the Government created a panic with its sudden announcement on March 20 about a possible connection between mad cow disease and the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob. Then it incited angry confusion five days later when its scientists concluded that the risk from eating beef was minute. **********\"They've been twisting everything,\" said Joe Akonea, a janitor at Victoria Station, summing up the sentiment of a number of people interviewed today. **********Sophie Craven, a bank teller, said:\"They can't seem to get their story straight, can they? I won't eat beef again for a long time, if ever again.\" **********The beef scare has disrupted life for many here, but not everyone.

The European Union ordered a ban on all exports of British beef, but the Government of Prime Minister John Major has called the ban unjustified and questioned whether the European Union was legally able to ban exports to nonmember countries, points Mr. Major promised to bring up at a weekend meeting of European leaders in Turin, Italy. **********Norman Lamont, a Tory Member of Parliament who opposes further British integration into Europe, urged Mr. Major to take no further steps until the European Union rescinds its ban on British beef. Meanwhile, the Government is weighing proposals to kill older cattle in Britain in an effort to restore consumer confidence and prod the European Union to lift the export ban. **********Whatever its political and economic ramifications, the beef scare has not been without its humor.

The coalition said it would leave most of the Finance Ministry intact and create an independent financial inspection and supervisory commission. **********Still, the program is the first step politicians have dared to take to chip away at the immensely influential ministry. The coalition moved against the wishes of the ministry, which is resisting any loss of control, and today's proposal could ultimately turn into a significant step. **********The ministry has attracted worldwide criticism for its handling of a string of financial crises during the last few years. It has been managing a banking industry bogged down by more than $400 billion in bad debt, and it has been plagued by a string of failures at financial institutions. **********''Government administration of financial matters requires a transformation of policy into one that follows the ground rules of the international market,'' a critical editorial said today in Asahi Shimbun, a leading national daily. **********What critics have called the ministry's negligence in inspection and surveillance activities has contributed, they say, to the ballooning debt that burdens the banks and the economy today. **********The success of the new supervisory commission hinges on how it is instituted, specifically on what kind of employees are hired and whether it will have its own budget. If it is staffed by former Finance Ministry officials, for instance, the new agency's independence and effectiveness is likely to be hampered. **********Another crucial factor is whether the commission will operate under greater public scrutiny. **********''One important role that the new commission should play is the collection of information and the publicity of it,'' said Akiyoshi Horiuchi, an economics professor at the University of Tokyo.

It should also have authority to demand changes and reform wherever appropriate.'' **********In addition to its call for a separate investigative agency, today's plan sought the merging of the banking and securities departments and part of the international finance bureau. **********Last week, the ministry itself offered to combine the securities and banking units with some international responsibilities. The ministry's plan, which was stiffly received by many Japanese, also offered to split off some inspection functions into a new bureau, though under the control of the ministry. **********The ministry is sure to oppose the politicians' proposal, which is also sure to play a role in the campaigns for coming parliamentary elections, which are expected to be held Oct. 20. **********The Liberal Democratic Party, which heads the governing coalition, said today that the new commission's responsibilities would have to be hammered out through the political process. **********One indication of the commission's authority could be the current status of Japan's Fair Trade Commission, the antimonopoly watchdog.

Mr. Hayashi is one of seven fugitives the police have been seeking for more than a year, in a vast but vain  effort to resolve the dozens of criminal cases in which the group is accused. **********The guru of the cult, Shoko Asahara, was captured a year ago and is on trial, charged with organizing the nerve-gas attack on the Tokyo subway system and other killings and kidnappings. The police seem to have wrapped up much of their investigation connected to Mr. Asahara, and now they are going all out to  find Mr. Hayashi and the six other fugitives. **********An especially intensive monthlong campaign to find them has just ended, apparently without the discovery of any clues. So far this year, the police have handed out hundreds of thousands of posters and handbills with the faces of the  fugitives -- sometimes showing them as they would appear with beards or glasses  or even dressed as women. **********In one prefecture, 60,000 cigarette lighters with the faces of the fugitives  were handed out. The police also searched vacant houses and cabins, hotels and rental villas, and even rental cars, while 400 police officers combed a mountain range near Tokyo on the chance that they might find Mr. Hayashi and his confederates camping out. **********The police decline to discuss the reason for the intensity of the manhunt. But the whispers among Government officials are that Mr. Hayashi is being sought not just for his suspected role in the poison-gas attack but also for possible involvement in one of the most mysterious episodes of last year: the shooting of the national police chief, Takaji Kunimatsu, as he left his home to go to work. **********Mr. Kunimatsu, who was shot by a gunman described as unusually tall -- as is  Mr. Hayashi -- nearly died in the attack, and he is still said to be in poor health, so much so that he may step down before long. Japan's police lost great  face by being unable to make any arrests in the case. **********The police have kept mum on the investigation, but Government officials say that dozens of police officers are working on the investigation and that it is focused on locating Mr. Hayashi. The assumption has been that he is in Japan, but investigators are also tracking down reports that he may have escaped to Thailand or Myanmar on a false passport. **********Mr. Hayashi is also charged with releasing sarin nerve gas in a subway car in March 1995 as it stopped in the Akihabara subway station in Tokyo. The train rolled on, and eight people died in and around that particular subway car before it could be evacuated. **********The overall death toll from the subway attack rose to 12 this month after a man died without ever having regained consciousness. Thousands of people were injured in the subway attack, and a few remain in serious condition. **********As the trials of Mr. Asahara and other officials of the group have progressed, prosecutors have painted a portrait of the cult as brutal to insiders as well as to outsiders. **********One follower, Toshio Tomita, was accused by the cult of being a spy and of putting mustard gas in the group's water supply. **********Prosecutors say Mr. Asahara ordered that Mr. Tomita, 27, be tortured until he confessed.

It was greeted with applause in the Italian Parliament and, across the Tiber, by a discreet note of ''satisfaction'' from the Vatican. The Mayor of Palermo, Sicily even offered Mr. O'Dell honorary citizenship. **********For opponents of the death penalty here, the Court's decision was interpreted as a moral victory, if only a temporary one. A few even claimed the victory for the Italian Government and Pope John Paul II -- a tandem that in this case had operated in perfect synchronization with a flurry of letters, messages and telegrams seeking clemency on behalf of Mr. O'Dell, now 54, who was convicted in 1986 of the rape and murder of Helen Schartner the preceding year. **********But with 3,050 people on the death rows of American prisons, 52 of them in Virginia, and 41 prisoners executed in the United States this year, the nagging question is how Mr. O'Dell's case was singled out for Italy's emotional embrace. In fact, another prisoner was executed in Virginia on Monday with hardly any mention in the Italian press. **********''We are also asking ourselves this question,'' said Alberto Flores d'Arcais, foreign editor at the daily La Repubblica. He attributed his own newspaper's spate of banner headlines on the O'Dell appeal to the national importance the case was given by the Parliament, Prime Minister Romano Prodi and, above all, the Pope. **********The O'Dell case was something of an overnight sensation here, according to Patrizia Spadacini, a press officer for Amnesty International's Rome office. Two weeks ago, she said, she could not get the Italian press interested. **********''I literally watched it grow,'' she said. ''Usually we don't have such a coalition -- citizens, parliamentarians, on the right and the left, the Pope and then the media. The media, that was the key.'' **********In a reported telephone interview with a correspondent for La Repubblica, Mr. O'Dell was quoted on Wednesday as saying that if he wins his freedom, he would like to come live here. ''Grazie, Italy, thank you,'' he was quoted as saying. **********But Mr. O'Dell's case is a complex one and there are no assurances that he will be freed or ultimately escape the death penalty. **********Most agree that the campaign on Mr. O'Dell's behalf, which began in the United States a year ago when he put his case on a Web site on the Internet, was able to mobilize the strong sentiments opposing the death penalty that run from Italy's far-left to a powerful network linked to the Roman Catholic Church. **********There was broad acceptance here of Mr. O'Dell's claim that DNA tests conducted three years after his conviction provided new evidence that warranted a new trial at least, and could prove his innocence. The issue of the victim, and her rape and death, have not come up in the Italian campaign. **********For the Vatican, which has intervened three times this year in death penalty cases in the United States, a key factor in the O'Dell case was a legal restriction in Virginia that bars the admission of new evidence 21 days after a conviction. **********Even before the Pope issued his own personal appeals for clemency -- one sent to Gov. George Allen of Virginia and the other to President Clinton, the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano had criticized the American court system for its overly ''legalistic'' approach to such a morally-charged case. **********With Amnesty International and a group opposing the death penalty,  Hands Off Cain, already involved, the case was soon adopted by several small parties in the Italian Parliament. But as media interest grew following the Pope's appeal, the O'Dell affair became a national passion. On Tuesday, the day before the scheduled execution, Prime Minister Prodi appealed to Governor Allen to stop it, citing the ''great emotion among the public in my country.'' **********But the case has also stirred some uncomfortable questions, particluarly for opponents of the death penalty who worry that the complicated legal details of Mr. O'Dell's case have overwhelmed the larger issue of capital punishment itself. **********''This is the hypocritical paradox that must be disproved,'' wrote Gianni Riotta in Corriere della Sera on Wednesday. ''Everyone, even professional executioners, are against the death penalty for innocent people. That is obvious. One must have the courage to say: We are against executions even when the condemned is guilty.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/08/world/world-news-briefs-right-winger-concedes-defeat-in-ecuador.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-07-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs;Right-Winger Concedes Defeat in Ecuador", "print_headline": "World News Briefs;Right-Winger Concedes Defeat in Ecuador", "body_text": " **********The rightist Christian Democratic candidate, Jaime Nebot, conceded defeat tonight in Ecuador's runoff presidential election to a populist, Abdala Bucaram. **********Mr, Bucaram, of the center-left Roldosista Party, struck a sympathetic chord  with the nation's poor. **********We will be a constructive opposition to the new government,\" Mr. Nebot told followers in Guayaquil. **********The Opcion 96 group conducting exit polling projected Bucaram was ahead with  54.1 percent against 45.9 percent for Mr. Nebot. **********The Telered group projected that Mr. Bucaram, who twice before failed in presidential attempts, had 54 percent of the votes against 46 percent for his free-market rival. **********Official results were expected in several days."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/01/world/arafat-warns-arab-uprising-could-return-if-peace-stalls.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1996-09-01", "snippet": "Yasir Arafat warns that Palestinians might have to revert to violence if peace with Israel breaks down; tells residents of refugee camp in Nablus that Prime Min Benjamin Netanyahu's foot-dragging on peace talks requires them to be 'ready and prepa...", "word_count": 467, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arafat Warns Arab Uprising Could Return If Peace Stalls", "print_headline": "Arafat Warns Arab Uprising Could Return If Peace Stalls", "body_text": " **********Cranking up the pressure on the Israeli Government, Yasir Arafat warned today that Palestinians might have to revert to violence if the peace with Israel broke down. **********In meetings in Nablus on Friday evening and again today, Mr. Arafat invoked the ''intifada,'' the Palestinian uprising waged largely by stone-throwing youths in Gaza and the West Bank for seven years before peace was made in 1993. **********''One of our options is to return to the intifada,'' Mr. Arafat told high school students on the first day of school.

But in fact it is bigger  stocks that are providing a lot of the action in the Nasdaq stock market. **********Yesterday, for the ninth trading day in a row, the Nasdaq composite index set a record closing high. With yesterday's rise of 2.38 points, to 1,190.58, the index is up 6.2 percent in those nine sessions, a much better performance than either that of the Standard & Poor's 500 or the Dow Jones industrial average. [Page D8.] **********This run is still a long way from setting a record for records. The peak string was 19 consecutive new high closes in 1979, but it is the longest in more than four years and has brought attention to the fact that many Nasdaq stocks have taken off since beginning the year with surprising weakness. **********The move reflects an improved economic outlook and better earnings for many smaller stocks. But it also reflects a surge of investment in riskier mutual funds, which have tended to put cash into some of the largest companies in the Nasdaq market. As a result, it is the big Nasdaq names, many of them involved in technology, that have paced the market. **********The latest surge in small-cap stocks began in mid-January. The Nasdaq composite index is up 20 percent since Jan. 15, vastly outperforming the Standard & Poor's 500 index of large stocks, which is up 9 percent. **********In fact, small stocks are not doing nearly as well as that would seem to indicate.  The Russell 2,000, an index of really small stocks -- ones not in the top 1,000 in market capitalization -- is up 15 percent since Jan. 15. That is good, but not nearly as exciting as the Nasdaq figure. **********About 40 percent of the rise in the Nasdaq composite -- an index that includes more than 6,000 issues -- was caused by the movement of the 100 largest Nasdaq stocks. The Nasdaq 100 is up 25 percent in the period. And a full quarter of the rise in the Nasdaq composite can be traced to just eight large stocks: Microsoft, Intel, Cisco Systems, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Worldcom, U.S. Robotics and America Online. **********Why are the big little stocks rising so much faster than the littler stocks while the really big stocks do less well? One answer lies in the strength of the dollar, which has scared some investors regarding big international companies. The fear is that the stronger dollar will make them less competitive. **********And Claudia Mott, the head of small-cap research for Prudential Securities, says that in part because the United States economy is now growing faster than many other economies, earnings of small-cap companies as a group are growing faster than those of larger companies for the first time in a couple of years. **********But a bigger part of the answer would seem to lie where it has for much of the 1990's: in the decisions made by millions of mutual fund investors. And as a group, those investors are showing a willingness to take on more risk. **********As interest rates have risen this year, the effect has been to scare some investors away from bond funds but not away from mutual funds. Some conservative investors who once put money in bond funds are now investing in conservative stock funds. Meanwhile, some who were once conservative stock investors have moved to aggressive-growth funds. **********Such funds, the riskiest of diversified stock funds, took in $15.6 billion from investors in the first quarter, and the pace in April seems to have been greater. Not only was the quarter's performance a record -- up almost 25 percent from the previous peak, set in the third quarter of last year -- but it also amounted to more than 8 percent of assets in aggressive-growth funds, a very high figure by historical standards. **********Adding to the upward pressure on stock prices, the managers of such funds grew cautious late last year and early this year; by Jan. 31 they had $18.5 billion in cash, a relatively high 9.3 percent of total assets. Two months later, they had spent $3.5 billion of that hoard, with cash down to a relatively low 7 percent of assets. The combination of big cash inflows plus the need to put previously unspent cash to work had a big impact. **********That has also had the effect of sharply pushing up prices of computer technology stocks, which had sagged late last year after a period of stunning performance. Since Jan. 15, Microsoft is up 37 percent, Intel 26 percent and Cisco 54 percent. Some others have done much better. America Online has leaped 95 percent; U.S. Robotics, a maker of computer modems, is up 122 percent. **********How long can this last? Many on Wall Street think it will continue for most of this year. They say that valuations of smaller stocks are not excessive, at least when compared with large-cap stocks, and add that they see no signs that the money will stop flowing in. **********But there is one historic ratio that may suggest caution. That is the ratio of the Nasdaq composite to the Standard & Poor's 500. Back in the summer of 1983, the peak of small-stock popularity, and another time when technology stocks were soaring, Nasdaq became extremely popular, with the index 1.93 times  as high as the S.& P. By the fall of 1990, the reverse had occurred. Tech stocks were hated, and large stocks had zoomed in value, relative to smaller ones. The  ratio fell to 1.08. **********Now, the ratio is back to 1.82. The Nasdaq composite has recovered about 85 percent of the ground it lost, on a relative basis, from 1983 through 1990. That suggests the party is well past the halfway point."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/15/business/international-briefs-barings-bondholders-to-sue-ex-chairman.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Barings Bondholders To Sue Ex-Chairman", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Barings Bondholders To Sue Ex-Chairman", "body_text": " **********Bondholders of the former Barings P.L.C. voted yesterday to sue Peter Baring, the former chairman, along with other officials and advisers.

To help such readers, the October issues of three personal-finance magazines -- Money, Worth and Mutual Funds -- have articles examining the stances of Bob Dole and President Clinton on the economy. **********The package in Money is by far the most comprehensive and rewarding. It includes an ''In Your Interest'' column by Frank Lalli, the magazine's managing editor, in which he compares the candidates' economic rhetoric with reality. **********Mr. Lalli offers some interesting conclusions: *********** The details of Mr. Dole's tax plan aren't quite as sweet as his ''I'm going to cut your taxes by 15 percent and balance the budget'' promise. *********** The President's contention that ''our targeted tax cuts are paid for'' is based on assumptions that may not pan out. *********** The line-item veto will give the next President far less power than most people have been led to believe. *********** It was Mr. Dole, not the President, who  championed (in 1982) the biggest tax increase, when adjusted for inflation, in United States history. *********** Mr. Clinton's assertion that ''we saved Medicare'' when the Republicans tried to destroy it doesn't jibe with a projection that the program's trust fund will become insolvent in 2001. **********The main article -- ''The Candidates and Your Wallet,'' by Ann Reilly Dowd, a Washington correspondent for the magazine -- includes an interview with Mr. Clinton in which some of his most interesting comments are about the need for changes in Social Security. **********Mr. Dole and Ross Perot, the candidate of the Reform Party, declined to be interviewed. **********The package, which is buttressed by the results of a Money poll, covers just about every pocketbook issue on the table and is an excellent primer for anyone trying to get beyond daily sound bites and headlines. **********The article in Worth is laudable, but not as comprehensive as those in Money. It is based on questions that the magazine submitted to Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton. **********The article winds up with a telling point, however: ''As the election picks up steam, remember this: Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's policies will have more impact on the economy, and thus on voters' pocketbooks, than a President of either party.'' **********The contribution by Mutual Funds simply presents the contrasting opinions of two fund managers. **********A WARNING SIGN? A thoughtful, and troubling, article by Jim Rogers, a finance professor at Columbia University, in Worth examines some signs that foreign investors may be pulling back from financing America's national debt by buying its Treasury bonds, notes and bills. **********The ramifications of this could be shattering for the economy, Mr. Rogers writes. He advises American investors to keep some assets out of the country, in a safe currency like German marks or Swiss francs, as an insurance policy. **********THINK SMALL The October issue of Kiplinger's Personal Finance recommends buying stocks in seven small companies whose profits are growing at least 20 percent a year and which haven't been ''discovered'' by the market. The seven dwarfs are: Avondale Industries, a shipbuilder; Consolidated Products, a restaurant chain; Friedman's, a jewelry retailer; Horizon Mental Health Management, which provides mental health services in general acute-care hospitals; Lumisys, a medical-equipment company; Nobel Education Dynamics, a for-profit operator of schools, and SEI, a financial-services concern. **********To minimize risk, it is recommended that all seven be bought as a package. **********TAKE CREDIT Smart Money's October issue examines the frustrating problem of inaccurate credit reports. Devin Leonard's ''Garbage In. Garbage Out.'' describes the workings of TRW, Equifax and Trans Union -- the Big Three in the credit-reporting business -- as well as what causes mistakes and what a consumer can do about them. **********The problem appears to be widespread. The author says that of the 2.5 million people who request copies of their credit reports each year from Trans Union, 50 percent have questions or disputes about their credit histories. TRW says it handles 360,000 complaints a month. **********YOUR POCKETBOOK Kiplinger's has a good rundown of 34 World Wide Web sites that can help consumers manage their finances, from investing to buying a car to selling a house. The magazine also recommends that it might be time to look at investing in Eastern Europe, with a list of some mutual funds that do just that. **********And in case you didn't already know it, Kiplinger's points out that the nation's banks are on a rampage of imposing fees and surcharges. Last year, the banks raked in $16 billion from such charges. **********BITS AND PIECES Worth and Kiplinger's both examine the merits of P.I.M., or personal information manager, computer programs; Smart Money gives some excellent pointers on buying an Oriental rug; Kiplinger's presents its ''stinky fish'' awards to nine mutual fund flops, and Andrew Tobias beats up on Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate and Presidential candidate, in a cover article in Worth."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/17/world/world-news-briefs-peruvian-court-upholds-american-s-life-sentence.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 197, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs;Peruvian Court Upholds American's Life Sentence", "print_headline": "World News Briefs;Peruvian Court Upholds American's Life Sentence", "body_text": " **********The Peruvian military's highest court has upheld the sentence of life in prison without parole for an American woman convicted of aiding leftist guerrillas. **********The rejection of the appeal for the woman, Lori Berenson, by the military's Supreme Council came on Friday.

As any host-researcher knows, there is an odd gap between the time the table is cleared of the main course and when coffee and dessert are served. A few years ago, I noticed a set of wooden blocks on a shelf and set them on the dining table so guests could play with them to pass away this time. **********Of course, I had no idea that this little gesture would point to a basic issue in information processing. **********What I have discovered is that people fall into two categories. Not herb tea  or decaf cappuccino drinkers, but rather tower builders and maze makers. In other words, the ones who build the blocks up and up as opposed to those who build them out and out. **********I assumed at first that this was a gender issue -- men up, women out.  But that is not what the research shows. Age is not a factor, either. In fact, it has become clear frm a combination of careful observation and careless chitchat that the difference between the two groups is cognitive. **********Tower builders are linear thinkers. They process the world systematically, sequentially. I call them lineasts. They build their monuments the same way they assemble their world view, step by step. They consider each piece carefully, adjust each new placement and try to beat gravity by the sheer force  of their logic and precision. **********Their goal seems to be to create a kind of unassailable coherence, a structure both familiar and impressive -- something we can all identify with. The risk, of course, is great.  One false move, one misplaced assertion, can bring it all tumbling down. **********Maze makers are different. Let's call them optophiles because they love options, choices, parallel lines of reasoning. They tend to create dynamic patterns that may be confusing, but also draw you in by their complexity. Maze makers work differently, too. They build by constant adjustment and re-evaluation, moving and shifting. **********Maze makers are not looking for simplicity. On the contrary, their goal seems to be to create a rich interaction of forms. There is a big risk here, too, because even though it won't come tumbling down at once, their work can easily dissipate into chaos. **********After-dinner whimsy, or an insight into the human mind? I know what you're thinking. But it happens that the distinction shown by my research reflects a current conflict in the area of communication design: whether to present information in linear or interactive formats. **********LINEAR structures of information -- like novels, movies, essays, plays -- are designed so that the material unfolds a tidbit at a time. Step by step. That's their strength. Nothing can compare to the dramatic impact of a tale well told. **********In writing a novel, for example, I do something like tower building -- placing each event, each telltale moment, in a carefully constructed sequence to achieve a clear, impressive whole. In fact, to help this process, I often create plot lines, story lists, outlines and other word towers to make sure the project is coming together coherently. **********Reading a novel, or experiencing any other linear format, is a lot like climbing the tower. There is a certain neat determinism to the experience, the feeling of moving forward in one direction. Lineasts love that. **********But interactive design is more democratic. Selection buttons, hot spots, hypertext links. The information comes only through your choices as you navigate the maze of possibilities. Optophiles adore these choices and feel no anxiety about surfing a sea of data, picking and choosing nuggets. **********As an interactive designer, I work with flow charts, branching trees and other mazelike structures in shaping new software titles. Rather than control each step of your experience, I try to set out a pattern of possibilities, any one of which, if I am successful, will reward your efforts. **********What drives lineasts crazy about this is how easily they can lose track of where they are, where they were or where they are going. But it is just this freedom of choice that appeals to optophiles. **********My hunch is that most of us are a combination of the two types, and that these are tendencies rather than alternatives. And since certain kinds of information lend themselves to one form or the other, I am certain that there will always be both -- novels as well as home pages, for example. **********Linear storytelling will always be a powerful way to convey drama, giving the designer a framework in which to build a coherent sequence and manipulate you through it. An interactive \"Hamlet\" cannot work as well as the original because  Shakespeare already picked the best path. **********Research, however, must proceed interactively. To track down specific information, there have to be ways to navigate efficiently through vast amounts  of data. Imagine trying to look something up in a linear encyclopedia in which,  instead of the interactive device of alphabetized key words, you had to read every entry from the beginning until you reached the one you wanted. **********Knowing that each approach is distinct but equally useful, I have tried suggesting to my lineastic guests that they experiment with building out, and to the optophiles that they try building up. All are willing to do it but, it seems to me, always with a slight sense of distress, as if they were combing their hair the wrong way. **********If you want to replicate this experiment, a word of warning: Do it before dessert, not after. Before, you get the two neat groups. But after, there is only one category. Folks don't want to build anything; they just want to wrap it up and head home."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/17/business/international-briefs-unichem-raises-bid-for-lloyds-chemists.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 82, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Unichem Raises Bid For Lloyds Chemists", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Unichem Raises Bid For Lloyds Chemists", "body_text": " **********Unichem P.L.C. raised its offer yesterday for the drugstore chain Lloyds Chemists P.L.C., topping a rival bid by Gehe A.G., a German drug wholesaler, by  5.6 percent.

Some of the principal issues affecting the inheritance of estates \u2014 particularly those of expatriates or married couples of different nationalities \u2014 include: **********- **********Recognition of the will. A will made in one country may not be valid under a second country's legal system. **********- **********The consequences of forced heirship. In the absence of a will, the relevant legal system will substitute its standard code to divide up assets among relatives. This can create problems if the \"wrong\" \u2014 i.e., the legal system which the expatriate does not consider home \u2014 applies. Children may be automatically preferred to wives and vice versa. The situation may become more perplexing still if there are children from more than one marriage. **********- **********Domicile and residency. These are key concepts in determining which tax laws apply. In general, you have to be physically present in a country to be resident there, yet you may be \"domiciled\" for tax purposes elsewhere. Sometimes domicile can be implied after an extended period of residence. **********- **********Tax treaties. The existence of a treaty between an expatriate's home and host country will change all tax planning considerations. **********\"The top rate of U.S. income tax is 39.6 percent, whereas the top rate of estate tax is 55 percent,\" says Mr. Anderson. \"It's remarkable how little planning gets done on estate tax when you compare those rates.\" **********Dominic Adams, a tax partner at U.K. attorneys S.J. Berwin & Co. in London, argues that the best time to plan is before an individual leaves one domicile for another. Using offshore companies and trusts, he says, it is possible to avoid unwanted complications of residency and domicile. **********Aside from establishing appropriate legal vehicles before taking up residence in another country, there are other basic principles of tax planning. These include: **********- **********Review the overall effectiveness of a will before leaving home. Seek professional advice as to its potential effectiveness. **********- **********Seek advice before purchasing real estate.

We are prepared to face  its challenges and aftermath, as long as the other party agrees on this course.\" **********The unmistakable target of his remarks and of the gathering itself was Benjamin Netanyahu, whose election as Israel's Prime Minister three weeks ago galvanized a divided Arab world into today's show of collective will. **********Mr. Mubarak was careful to avoid any hint of a threat, and as the Arab leaders closed the doors to their meeting to continue what will be two days of private talks, Egyptian officials said they were taking pains to insure that the unusual gathering not end on a bellicose note. **********But in what is expected to be a preview of the leaders' final communique, the Egyptian President issued a clear challenge to Israeli policy guidelines that have suggested that Mr. Netanyahu's Government will be unwilling to withdraw completely from the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli  war, or to permit the Palestinians to establish an independent state. **********\"If any party allows itself to choose what to negotiate or what not, then this means that the other parties have the same right, which thus reverts the peace process to the zero point -- or, rather, totally destroys it,\" Mr. Mubarak said. **********Today's gathering brought together leaders who have long been at odds, including President Hafez al-Assad of Syria and King Hussein of Jordan, and the  session recorded by television cameras today presented at least a facade of Arab solidarity not seen since the Persian Gulf war of 1991. **********Among the 22 members of the Arab League, only Iraq -- still ostracized for its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 -- was absent. Those gathered at a single table,  in business suits and traditional Arab attire, included figures as diverse as Crown Prince Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah of Kuwait and the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, who flew to Cairo in a Libyan Airlines jet in open defiance  of a United Nations ban on flights to and from Libya. **********In an earlier reunion, Mr. Mubarak even embraced President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan, whom he has blamed for an assassination attempt against him  last June. And with Mr. Mubarak as a broker, Mr. Assad and King Hussein met privately for the first time in two years in a session that included an open airing of divisive issues including Jordan's accusations about Syrian support for terrorism. **********But today's dynamics were anything but straightforward, with the participants facing pressure from Syria and Lebanon, who want Arabs to rethink their ties with Israel; from Israel and the United States, who have warned that too tough an Arab stand could prove counterproductive, and from their own rivalries. **********Prime Minister Netanyahu, who was sworn in this week, told the Israeli Parliament that peace talks between Israel and its neighbors should proceed without preconditions. His Foreign Minister, David Levy, said he would not rule  out territorial compromise on the Golan Heights in exchange for peace with Syria. **********But the policy guidelines issued by Mr. Netanyahu's Government have suggested that he will stick to campaign promises ruling out the return of the Golan Heights and the establishment of a Palestinian state -- stands that mark a sharp break from the policy of his predecessor, Shimon Peres, and which have been received by the Arabs with varying degrees of apprehension and fury. **********Trying to steer away from any appearance of confrontation or panic, Egyptian  officials have emphasized that their efforts to bridge Arab divides and convene  a full-scale summit meeting began before Mr. Netanyahu's election. Mr. Mubarak said today that the most urgent issue before Arabs was the need to close ranks. **********Yet that sense of urgency has undeniably been felt with new force since the Israeli election on May 29, a potential watershed to which Mr. Mubarak appeared  to be referring when he said, \"At this present moment, we feel that we are at a  fate-determining stage.\" **********On Egyptian television today, 30-year-old film clips and patriotic music revived memories of President Gamal Abdel Nasser and his aspirations to pan-Arab unity. But in the rallying that began today, the main beneficiaries were intended to be Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and President Assad of Syria, which along with Lebanon appears most likely to be isolated by the policies of the new Israeli Government. **********In his remarks, President Mubarak set a tone likely to be echoed throughout the two-day session by making repeated mention of the 1991 Middle East peace conference in Madrid and its principles of land for peace and Palestinian self-determination. **********President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia, the current President of the Arab League, was the other leader to speak in the open session.

He described the remarks by Mr. Levy as \"more reassuring\" than some earlier \"dangerous indications.\" **********But Egypt, which made its own peace with Israel 17 years ago, heard calls behind closed doors this afternoon from Syria and Lebanon for a more forceful stand than Mr. Mubarak took today, officials said.

Come on, now: can one mere mortal truly make the difference in a vast, sprawling creature like the American economy? But that question is beside the point: in politics, it's appearances that count, and a recent poll shows that people give the President a lot of credit. Some 72 percent feel economically secure (yes, you could argue that that leaves an awful lot of insecurity), and 55 percent approve of the way Mr. Clinton is handling the economy. That approval, by the way, has shot up from 46 percent two weeks ago, suggesting that the Democrats' little gathering had an impact. And if Bob Dole thinks he'll get votes by tapping into economic anxiety, he may be barking up the wrong tax cut. **********UNEMPLOYMENT **********Young and Old at Work **********That poll was followed by a bit of good economic news: the August unemployment rate dropped to a seven-year low of 5.1 percent, from 5.4 percent in July. And there were strong gains for those often left on the fringes: people under 25 and over 54. Oddly, though, the stock market didn't act in its usually perverse way. The Dow industrials did drop 49 points the day before the jobs data came out, ostensibly because of worries that a strong report would mean higher interest rates, which would hurt stocks. But when the job numbers hit on Friday, the market took it in stride, with the Dow tktktkt tktktktting. Go figure. **********ECONOMIC POLICY **********Inflation Takes a Holiday **********Forget about whether children on welfare will go hungry, or whether anyone will ever see the tax cuts that politicians keep promising. No, here's the burning economic issue: Should policy makers go through hoops to hammer inflation, now a nice nonthreatening 3 percent or so, down closer to zero? A minor academic quibble, you say? Well, top Federal Reserve officials and economic policy makers from around the globe felt they had to trek to Jackson Hole, Wyo., a week ago to discuss it. (Of course, most people would discuss anything if they got to do it at a snazzy mountain resort.) Alan Greenspan's conclusion: ''Price stability is within reach.'' But critics say zero inflation would have a cost: higher unemployment, because employers, unable to effectively cut wages by keeping them steady, will cut people instead. A high price that would be for inflation-free perfection. **********MEGA-STORES **********Home Sweet Office **********Remember when ''offices'' were in big, ugly buildings, while ''homes'' featured easy chairs and refrigerators? Of course not. Today it is a pitiable home indeed that doesn't have three computers, two phone lines, a color printer, a fax, a copier and cabinets stocked with office supplies. No wonder, then, that stores like Staples and Office Depot -- gleefully feeding what has become a $185 billion market -- have grown like crazy. But not fast enough for them, apparently: last week, Staples agreed to buy Office Depot in a $3.4 billion stock swap. The merger will create a giant that's twice the size of its nearest rival, with more than 1,100 superstores nationwide. The company had better hope people don't get fed up with it all and convert those home offices back to dens. **********AND MORE MEGA-STORES **********Now It's Bookstore City **********It's never quite made sense. New York, the nation's biggest city, had the smallest bookstores -- storefront nooks jammed to the pressed-tin ceilings, musty basement literary lairs. But no matter, much of that is being wiped away by those book mini-cities that some people insist on calling ''stores.'' Barnes & Noble, of course, has already barreled around town with its vast superstores (dropping along the way, the slogan: ''If you paid full price, you didn't get it at . . .'' slogan; now that many of its rivals have succumbed, you may well pay full price). But suddenly it has someone its own size to pick on. Borders just opened a 38,000-square-foot store in lower Manhattan. (Complete with cappuccino? Of course.) But are people reading those books? Or are they all surfing the you-know-what? **********PUBLISHING **********Sorry: Politics, Not Sex **********And what books sell? Simple, says Harold Evans, head of Random House. ''If we didn't publish books by people who had illicit sex, we would be out of business.'' The illicit sex of the week, of course, involved Dick Morris, if the tabloids had it right, and Mr. Evans is now paying Mr. Morris $2.5 million to tell his tale. Here's the odd thing, though: Mr. Morris won't be writing about illicit sex (not his, anyway), just about being a political guru -- though the whiff of intrigue certainly didn't hurt. He already had a deal with Random House, you see (which the White House isn't at all happy about), but last week, cashing in on his new infamy, he shopped the book around before landing back at Random House -- for more money. **********BANKING **********Farewell, Chemical **********Chase gave last week, and Chase took away. Actually, it was a year ago that Chase Manhattan announced that it was merging with Chemical, a move that would take away 100 branches in the New York area. But appearances count for a lot, and it was not until last weekend that the Chemical signs actually came down, officially killing off yet another New York institution. But perhaps out of guilt, perhaps because it's saving so much with those new economies of scale, Chase gave $750,000 to Carnegie Hall to support a recital series -- ''the largest corporate sponsorship for programs'' ever, a Carnegie Hall official said. On Chase's new balance sheet, though, do numbers under $1 million even register? **********IRAQ **********Is It Principle, or Oil? **********High moral principles are routinely cited when we try to batter Saddam Hussein into submission (though of course it's other, less exalted Iraqis we're battering), but some less idealistic souls say that in the long run it's really just about oil. It's got to keep flowing, after all, so we can maneuver our mighty sport utility vehicles through those rocky, wild suburban malls. In the short run, though, oil prices and oil-company shares soared as soon as we struck -- since the attack killed any chance for 700,000 barrels a day to start flowing out of Iraq. **********AWAKENINGS **********Beyond Chicken Noodle **********Campbell Soup. That's a sleepy company if ever there was one. Chicken noodle. cream of tomato. Yawn, yawn, yawn. Last week, though, Campbell announced to the world that it was snapping to attention and reinventing itself -- to go to ''a new level,'' as its president put it. What's it all about? Among other things, a huge $2.5 billion stock buyback and more spending on advertising. And no self-respecting overhaul would be complete these days without job cuts: Campbell will dismiss 650 workers, including 11 percent of its headquarters staff. So was this just a lot of noise? Investors certainly didn't think so, with the stock leaping to a record the day of the announcement and rising even further the next."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/22/business/international-briefs-saab-may-still-bid-for-parts-of-fokker.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Saab May Still Bid For Parts of Fokker", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Saab May Still Bid For Parts of Fokker", "body_text": " **********The Saab Aircraft division of Saab, which is owned by Investor A.B. and the General Motors Corporation, said yesterday that it was still interested in the bankrupt Dutch plane maker Fokker B.V. and was weighing a possible bid for parts of the company. \"We are still interested, and we are working actively on our stance on a possible bid for parts of Fokker,\" a Saab spokesman, Anders Annerfalk, said. **********It is not known when potential buyers must bid for Fokker or parts of it. \"If there are more interested parties who want a prolonged period, that might happen,\" Mr. Annerfalk said. \"But that is pure speculation and also the reason why we are working intensively at the moment.\"   (Reuters)"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/29/business/company-briefs-081710.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-05-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********DATAPOINT CORP.

And he wants the S.E.C. to have the power to approve  who is chosen for the board. **********The move comes at a time when corporate financial executives have been putting pressure on the foundation to reform the F.A.S.B. in ways that would increase the power of business to block unwanted accounting standards. **********In a talk prepared for delivery last night to the Economic Club of Chicago,  Mr. Levitt disclosed his initiative and seemed to come out against the effort to increase corporate power in the process, saying that he was trying \"to strengthen and safeguard the independence of financial accounting standard-setting.\" **********The Financial Accounting Foundation is charged with raising the money to support the F.A.S.B. and the Government Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting rules for government agencies, and with naming the members of those boards. And it has the authority to change the way those boards are structured. **********Currently, the foundation has 14 trustees, all but one chosen by such various constituency groups as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Executives Institute and the Securities Industry Association. The  sole public member, chosen by the other trustees, is Kathryn D. Wriston, a director of various organizations and the wife of Walter B. Wriston, the retired chairman of Citicorp. **********In a letter to J. Michael Cook, the foundation's president and the chairman of Deloitte & Touche, a large accounting firm, Mr. Levitt said he thought a majority of the trustees should \"consist of individuals with strong public service backgrounds, who are able to represent the public interest, free of conflict.\" **********The F.A.S.B. has come under increasing fire over the years from corporations, which have won a series of concessions but have continued to grumble. The board  can now approve standards only by a super-majority vote -- five of its seven members, two of whom come from companies. Using political influence, including a vote of the Senate, the companies forced the board to back down when it tried to force them to report as an expense the value of stock options given to executives and other employees. **********When that happened, Mr. Levitt had little to say. But in the wake of an effort by some members of the Financial Executives Institute to force wholesale changes, he appears to have decided to step in and fight. **********In his letter to Mr. Cook, Mr. Levitt complained that the F.A.S.B. \"is not being adequately reinforced by its parent organization and, thus, its public interest objectives are at risk.\" **********Mr. Cook, in an interview late yesterday, said the trustees would address the issues raised by Mr. Levitt at their meeting on Tuesday, and would act quickly.  He added that he hoped decisions on changing the F.A.S.B. would be made within a few months, but it is clear that Mr. Levitt wants those decisions to be made by  a reconstituted board. **********Just who those people are will be crucial. And finding people who are both disinterested and well informed will be a challenge. **********In a telephone interview last night, Kenneth Johnson, the controller of Motorola and one of the executives who has been pushing for changes at the F.A.S.B., said he had not seen Mr. Levitt's letter and could not comment on it.  But he added that the F.A.S.B. had to be changed. \"They are so enamored with theoretical accounting purity that they are unable to look at the practical effects of what they are trying to do,\" he said. **********Mr. Cook said he wanted to make changes that would enable the board to win \"higher approval ratings,\" although he added that any standard-setter would anger some people, and he said changes clearly were needed to make the board more productive. **********But the risk is that in winning approval from the corporate executives who are now the angriest, the eventual loser could be the investors who depend on financial statements. \"If standards are drawn, or even seen to be drawn, to favor corporate interests over those of investors, faith in our markets will erode,\" Mr. Levitt said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/05/world/a-hard-line-in-mideast-gets-harder.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas Jehl", "pub_date": "1996-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 753, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Hard Line In Mideast Gets Harder", "print_headline": "A Hard Line In Mideast Gets Harder", "body_text": " **********When the luncheon conversation at Syria's Presidential palace turned to the subject of Mikhail S.

Since Israel suspended the latest round of peace talks between the two countries after it was hit with a wave of suicide bombings, that solid front has taken on an even harder edge. **********\"If anything, people have been clamming up,\" a Damascus-based diplomat said in describing Syrians who not long ago had begun to express hope that peace with Israel might be just around the corner. **********On Tuesday, President Assad warned that the path to an accord had \"narrowed to a large extent.\" With Israel's attention fixed on the national elections to be held at the end of May, no one here expects the American-brokered peace talks to resume at least until early summer. **********Only groups and individuals even more critical of Israel and the United States than the Government have felt free to vary from that official line, including representatives of some of the militant Palestinian organizations. **********One group, led by Ahmad Jibril, has even used a powerful radio station that broadcasts from Syria to taunt Israelis in the aftermath of the recent bombings, which were carried out by the militant Palestinian group Hamas. \"Every Zionist settler has to choose between two fates: to leave to where he came from, or become pieces of stale meat thrown on the sidewalks of Palestine,\" a broadcast said in late February. \"He is free to choose.\" **********Mr. Jibril's group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, General Command, is one of 10 organizations, including Hamas and Islamic Holy War, whose presence here is cited by the State Department as reason for listing  Syria as a sponsor of terrorism.

Popular merchandise from China, like footwear -- $6.1 billion worth was imported last year -- was omitted. **********Textiles and garments were also chosen, United States officials said, because most of those factories are in southern China, where compact disk pirates operate, as if taxing one group would somehow increase pressure on the other. **********A number of exporters of textiles and garments and electrical goods will obviously be hurt, and some possibly put out of business by the new tariffs. Economists in the Chinese Government have even warned that 500,000 textile industry jobs could be lost, though no one really knows. **********Of course, trade sanctions can also create unintended results. Winston Lord,  Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, complained that Japanese and European companies were taking advantage of an anti-American mood in Beijing to win contracts that might go to American companies. Such cases are  actually quite rare, though United States and Chinese officials often have their own political reasons for talking about them. **********Yet here on the coast of southern China, in a city of three million where hundreds of garment factories have sprung up in old wheat fields, the consensus  among many Chinese business leaders is that the threatened sanctions would have  a minimal overall impact. **********Some businessmen go further, saying that United States trade policy is arrogant and muddled, if Washington thinks it can hurt China's economy without damaging the benefits it derives from the $60 billion trade relationship between the two nations. **********\"Trade goes in two directions,\" said Chen Qingsheng, chairman of Lianyi Touring Goods, which shipped $1.5 million of sporting goods, or one-fourth of its total sales, to the United States last year. \"These sanctions only stop a small part. It's not like they're revoking most-favored-nation status,\" referring to the preferential trade relationship that China now enjoys with the  United States. **********To Mr. Chen, and perhaps to anyone as far outside the Beltway as China, the rationale behind the Clinton Administration's trade action looks a bit murky. **********Most-favored-nation status, originally designed to encourage Communist governments to allow freer emigration, is likely to be renewed for China -- a country that still restricts travel overseas -- principally because a significant jump in tariffs would be unacceptable to American businesses and consumers used to buying competitively priced garments, footwear, toys and electrical goods from China. **********Yet at the same time, lesser trade sanctions are being threatened because of  China's widespread piracy of intellectual property rights, an area the Chinese Government says it is actively working to control, if only with mixed results so far. **********\"I don't really understand the American Government,\" said Mr. Chen, whose conversation was continually interrupted by calls on the two telephones on his office desk and the mobile phone in his lap. \"This approach doesn't make any sense. China and America need each other in the long run.\" **********Despite his own reliance on exports to the United States, Mr. Chen said he was not worried because he expected a resolution to emerge from the Beijing trade talks. **********Like many Chinese businessmen, he sees the negotiations over piracy as little more than a colorful charade, following the same script as in previous years, with accusations and counteraccusations by officials on each side who finally smile and shake hands when a last-minute agreement is struck. **********Pressed about how he would cope with sanctions, Mr. Chen said that he would go through a few months of adjustment, shifting some production to nonsanctioned items and channeling merchandise to other foreign countries. **********Many American companies with operations in China have objected to the threat  of sanctions, worried about damage to the overall business climate. More specific concerns are voiced by American importers who already have contracts to buy items on the sanction list, like buyers for large department store chains. Such companies have paid for orders months in advance and will have to pay the new duties if sanctions are enacted. **********\"Nobody expects these sanctions to be long term, so we are carrying the new cost, while Chinese exporters aren't affected at all,\" said Jeffrey J. Macho, managing director in North Asia for Sears, Roebuck & Company, which buys millions of dollars of garments in China. \"It's the reverse of what's intended.\" **********Some American importers have already stopped orders for Chinese goods, United States officials have said, for fear that shipments in early June could be hit with new duties when they arrive in an American port after June 17, if there is  no accord by then. **********Other American companies would feel the blow of the $2 billion in retaliatory sanctions -- mainly on food products -- that China threatened after the United States trade representative's office formally published its list in Washington on May 15. The Chinese Government also warned that going ahead with sanctions would limit the access of American companies to China's market. **********Although no exporter will say so publicly, one solution to higher American tariffs is to ship sanctioned items through a third country. Chinese garment makers who have contended for years with American quotas have already learned how to send almost completed trousers to Hong Kong or Latin America or even Mongolia, for example, where they get a final button or zipper stitched on before being shipped off to the United States. In that way, China is not listed  as the country of export. **********Here in Wenzhou, for decades an impoverished area, there is a self-reliance that makes for a robust economy. Ma Jinlong, vice director of the Wenzhou Economic Reseach Center, said that Wenzhou's annual growth rate averaged 27.1 percent over the last four years. The city has attracted nearly 800,000 laborers from the surrounding countryside during its tremendous expansion. **********\"With that kind of growth, sanctions would not be much of a shock here,\" said Mr. Ma, sipping tea in a noisy downtown restuarant. \"A few sectors will be affected, though even they will find other markets. But it seems like there are  a lot of American consumers enjoying Chinese-made goods. They lose, too, if sanctions come.\" **********As for businessmen, they seem more eager to talk about investments than sanctions. \"Do you know any American investors who would like to come to Wenzhou?\" asked Chen Min, the general manager of the Jindingzhen Clothing Company, a $30-million-a-year manufacturer, who wants to expand rapidly so he can open stores in every major Chinese city. \"We need extra capital.\" **********Mr. Chen says he has no reservations about cooperating with American businesses. \"I like Americans,\" Mr. Chen said. \"They have lots of money.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/26/business/media-business-advertising-for-more-than-quarter-advertisers-it-ll-be-super-bowl.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-01-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 973, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;For more than a quarter of the advertisers, it'll be Super Bowl I.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;For more than a quarter of the advertisers, it'll be Super Bowl I.", "body_text": " **********THE Dallas Cowboys have played in the Super Bowl before.

Even the halftime show sponsor, Oscar Mayer, is a Super Bowl newcomer. **********Those advertisers will join Super Bowl mainstays that are making return appearances like the Cowboys and Steelers. Among them are the Anheuser-Busch Companies, the McDonald's Corporation, Nike Inc. and the Frito-Lay and Pepsi-Cola units of Pepsico Inc. **********Tyro or veteran, the more than two dozen advertisers that will run spots nationally during the game are spending an average of $1.2 million for the fifty-eight 30-second units of commercial time. That's a record for any television broadcast, easily surpassing one set last year when each 30-second Super Bowl commercial cost about $1 million. **********Why would a marketer sign up for the Super Bowl just when the price reaches a historic high of $40,000 a second? It's not unlike someone watching the Dow Jones industrial average set a record Wednesday, then rushing out to buy his or  her first shares of stock. **********Executives acknowledge how expensive a Super Bowl spot is and that several first-time advertisers in Super Bowl XXIX won't be back. But they assert there are compelling business reasons to finally advertise, from the game's status as  an unofficial national midwinter holiday to the demographic desirability of the  large viewing audience. **********\"We knew right up front it was pricey,\" said Bob Starr, national communications manager for the Yamaha Motor Corporation USA in Cypress, Calif.,  which will run a 30-second commercial by the Saatchi & Saatchi Pacific unit of Cordiant P.L.C. in Torrance, Calif. **********\"But we also knew we had to make the investment,\" he added, because Yamaha was seeking \"a very broad-reach, impactful\" way to introduce the Royal Star, its entry into the so-called supercruiser segment of the motorcycle market, and \"nothing is more broad reach and impactful.\" **********Karen Sophiea, vice president for marketing at Kinko's in Ventura, Calif., said it required a \"deep swallow\" to \"step up to the Super Bowl.\" **********\"When I first talked about it,\" she said, recalling a presentation to other Kinko's executives, \"they looked at me and laughed. **********\"But then the chairman said, 'I'm glad to see you be so bold and audacious,'  \" she added. \"It's the prestigious platform we need.\" So Kinko's will run a commercial by Hal Riney & Partners/Heartland in Chicago that will introduce \"The new way to office\" as the Kinko's theme. **********\"It's a big chunk of change,\" said William Lange, vice president for marketing at Mail Boxes Etc. in San Diego. His company's spot, created by Kenneth C. Smith Advertising in San Diego, will devour about 8 percent of its annual advertising budget of $15 million. **********\"But it seemed like an opportunity we couldn't pass up,\" Mr. Lange said, because of the serendipity of Oscar Mayer's sponsorship of the halftime show: by coincidence, Oscar Mayer is the focus of the Mail Boxes Etc. commercial. Chad Gretzema, a driver of an Oscar Mayer Wienermobile, describes how Mail Boxes Etc. serves as his \"office on the road.\" **********Bob Eckert, president of Oscar Mayer Foods in Madison, Wis., a unit of the Philip Morris Companies, said the company's sponsorship of the halftime show grew out of a 13-year relationship with the National Football League. But until  now, he added, Oscar Mayer's efforts had primarily centered on \"a lot of local promotions during the football season.\" **********\"We've seen our business grow as a result of what we've done with the N.F.L.,\" Mr. Eckert said. \"So we think it's time to take the next step.\" **********Eyebrows rose when another first-timer, Mastercard, announced its plans because rival Visa International is an N.F.L. sponsor and Mastercard is not. **********But \"this is not about an ambushing opportunity,\" said Joan Bogin, vice president for advertising for the United States region at Mastercard in Purchase, N.Y. \"Rather, it reflects a new strategy to heighten our brand awareness, and nothing says you're here like the Super Bowl does.\" Mastercard will run two spots by the Ammirati & Puris/Lintas unit of the Interpublic Group  of Companies in New York; Visa will also run two commercials, which were created by the BBDO New York unit of the Omnicom Group. **********One Super Bowl advertiser, the United States unit of the Nissan Motor Company, is not a first-timer but will return for the first time since 1990, running a \"teaser\" spot promoting the new Pathfinder sport-utility vehicle. **********\"Upward of 60 percent of our target audience of adults 25 to 54 will be watching,\" said Pam Keehn, Nissan account director at the TBWA Chiat/ Day unit of Omnicom in Venice, Calif. \"It's our best opportunity to reach them in one fell swoop.\" **********While some first-time advertisers from Super Bowl XXIX will return Sunday, like the National Pork Producers Council, others will not. **********\"We'll be back as we grow bigger and stronger and our pockets become deeper,\" said Michael B. Moore, vice president for marketing at No Fear Inc., the sports  apparel marketer in Carlsbad, Calif. \"But this year we've made a strategic decision to allocate dollars to other media that give us a better bang for the buck.\" **********One pitfall to being a first-time advertiser is that longtime sponsors can reserve commercial time during the first half. The conventional wisdom decrees second-half slots less desirable because several recent Super Bowls have been routs. **********\"I don't think that's true,\" said Martin F.

Almost half the large customers in Britain, for example, have switched suppliers since they were given this choice five years ago. **********In this country, it is not surprising that Federal regulation has accommodated these market forces by providing wholesale customers like municipalities with access to the transmission system. And pilot experiments, allowing consumers to choose their electricity suppliers, much as they do their  long-distance telephone companies, are under way. Soon all customers in California will have the option, and Massachusetts and New York are likely to follow suit. Federal legislation introduced this month would provide for customer choice nationally. **********The results of all this will be the end of the electric utility industry as we know it. In its place, three distinct, but linked, businesses are emerging: power generation, wires and energy services. **********Power generation will be a highly competitive commodity business. Power producers -- utilities as well as independents -- will be fighting it out in regional markets defined primarily by constraints in the transmission network. Price transparency, aided by the proliferation of spot markets and futures contracts like those recently initiated by the New York Mercantile Exchange, will stimulate even more competition. **********The transition will be painful for many of today's generators. Costs that customers will no longer cover for expensive plants and contracts -- \"stranded costs\" in industry jargon -- could require the eventual write-off of about $135  billion, about equal to the equity of American utilities. **********Successful generators will have low costs and will be astute in playing regional power markets. Many of today's players won't cut it, and a huge consolidation of generating plants by efficient producers is inevitable. **********THE wires business -- the transmission and distribution of electricity -- will remain regulated but will be operated by utilities or third parties, with access to the wires open to all. **********Operators of distribution wires will seek regulation that encourages efficiency. Regulators are expected to go along, provided that the savings are shared with customers. Some competitors will seek economies of scale by consolidating assets and activities with neighboring electric and other utilities, including providers of natural gas, water and possibly telephone and  cable service. The recent merger of the Texas Utilities Company, a power company, with the Enserch Corporation, a gas utility, and the acquisition of a British water company by its local electric distributor are early moves toward \"wires and pipes\" companies. **********The energy services business, which involves the packaging of different types of energy and other services, is just getting started. The leading edge of this  business is the marketing of power -- generated by low-cost providers and moved  for a fee across the wires of intervening utilities -- to wholesale customers. Since it was first allowed in 1992, more than 200 companies have entered this business. The early leaders have been natural-gas marketers and financial traders who have had a decade to perfect their game. But the big contest is still ahead. **********Consider, for instance, the service businesses born of telecommunications deregulation. Cellular phones, paging, conference calling and a host of other services now account for about 25 percent of telecommunications revenue. Several companies are looking for the energy equivalent of these services by offering packaged natural gas, electricity and related services to grocery, fast-food and hotel chains; residential customers are next. **********What will the electric power industry look like in about a decade? There will probably be a small number of national-scale generators -- perhaps a dozen or so --, supplemented by regional and niche players. Many of today's electric utilities will be little more than regulated wires companies, but some will have grown by acquiring neighboring wires and other operations. Many companies -- maybe banks, retailers or other service companies -- will offer electricity, usually bundled with other products and services. **********Although electric mergers have become more frequent, the industry's future probably holds more horizontal than vertical consolidation. Companies that aspire to be regional or national generators will seek only generating assets, not the forever-regulated wires attached to today's integrated utilities. Others will shun the competitive generation business but may be interested in acquiring distribution assets to consolidate wires-only or wires-and-pipes businesses. **********Tough choices are ahead. Investors, who have seen electric utilities underperform the market in recent years, have the difficult task of picking winners. Policy makers must sort through the competing interests to balance demands for lower rates with the need to establish rules for effective long-term competition. Perhaps the toughest decisions are faced by the utilities as they try to remake themselves. Customers should benefit from lower prices and more options, but how much they do so will depend on how astute their choices are."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/27/world/among-arabs-dashed-hope-brought-resentment-to-a-boil.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Greenberg", "pub_date": "1996-09-27", "snippet": "Arabs in Bethlehem, who nine months ago celebrated withdrawal of Israeli soldiers, now speak bitterly in their rock-strewn battleground of dashed hopes for peace and anger that erupted into deadly fighting; photos; Palestinians point to work and t...", "word_count": 696, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Among Arabs, Dashed Hope Brought Resentment to a Boil", "print_headline": "Among Arabs, Dashed Hope Brought Resentment to a Boil", "body_text": " **********Just nine months ago, this city was swept up in joyous celebration as Israeli occupation forces withdrew days before Christmas, handing over the traditional birthplace of Jesus to Palestinian rule. **********But as their town became a rock-strewn battleground today, Palestinians here spoke bitterly of their dashed hopes for peace and the frustrations that have welled up to produce one of the deadliest days of fighting in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********Like the Palestinian uprising that broke out in 1987 against a backdrop of grinding economic hardship and political stagnation, the current unrest is rooted in unrealized expectations, raised in this case by the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. **********The anger here and across the self-rule territories did not seem to be directed today at Yasir Arafat, the onetime guerrilla who led Palestinians to the 1993 peace agreement and is now president of the Palestinian Authority. **********Instead, people here said, it was aimed at the remaining bonds of Israeli occupation. **********Work and travel restrictions, economic blockades and a new Israeli Government that has failed to carry out significant parts of the accords have left many Palestinians wondering whether there was anything to be gained by the pact they made. **********Israel's opening of an entrance to an archeological tunnel this week near Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem's Old City, Palestinians asserted, was only a final provocation that turned long-simmering resentment into rage. **********In Bethlehem today, people slipped back into old patterns of confrontation and hopelessness, fighting in the streets with Israeli soldiers and making grim predictions of a new uprising in which Palestinians would show Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel that he could no longer ignore their needs. **********''We're going backwards,'' said a man as screaming ambulances ferried wounded from the front line of fighting between hundreds of stone-throwing youths and Israeli soldiers. **********Clouds of tear gas and bursts of rubber bullets filled the air near an Israeli-controlled enclave at Rachel's Tomb, the traditional burial place of a wife of the biblical patriarch Jacob. **********Palestinian police officers and Israeli soldiers fired at one another as similar gun battles raged all across the Palestinian self-rule zones, filling hospitals with dead and wounded. **********''The Palestinian problem is in the freezer, and only God has the key,'' said an elderly man, in a typical show of despair. **********A teacher, Yahya Yahya, described the increasing disappointment in the months since Mr. Netanyahu took office. ''After the peace accord we had hoped for a change,'' he said, ''but we see that in the last three months things are getting worse and we are losing what we achieved. **********''They are expanding settlements, confiscating more land, building bypass roads for settlers that isolate Palestinian cities, and they haven't withdrawn from Hebron. The pressure on people was stronger than they could bear.'' **********But perhaps the most powerful strain has been economic. Israeli border closings imposed after suicide bombings in Israel have added to already high unemployment, barring many young Palestinians from reaching jobs. **********''People are feeling squeezed because they can't find work and can't earn a living,'' said Ibrahim Atallah as he watched waves of youths surge toward the Israeli soldiers. **********Nidal Juneidi, visiting from Hebron, asserted that there had been little improvement in daily life since the accords, and that border closings keeping Muslim worshipers from Jerusalem were particularly painful. **********''We had big hopes for peace, prosperity, our own country, our own nationality and freedom,'' he said. ''We've seen nothing of it. If we can't even reach Jerusalem, what kind of peace are they talking about?'' **********''People just want to live, nothing else,'' Mr. Juneidi continued. ''They want peace, a country of their own and work. If they lose hope, no one can guess what is going to happen. These are demonstrations for the peace accords. We want them to be kept.'' **********Nabil Kukali, who runs a Palestinian public opinion research center in the neighboring town of Beit Sahour, said he had recently found increasing resistance among Palestinians to pursuing peace talks as long as Mr. Netanyahu and his Government failed to meet Israeli commitments under the self-rule agreements. **********''They cannot take us back to the past,'' Mr. Kukali said. ''They should look to the future. We don't need an uprising anymore.

Twice, she contended, the company tried to replace her with a man. **********So in June 1994, after five years at the New York subsidiary, she filed a discrimination complaint with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Five months later, she was dismissed from her job. **********Some employee-rights lawyers say discrimination cases against foreign subsidiaries are increasingly common as foreign companies continue to set up operations in the United States and as Federal oversight over discrimination wanes. **********And in many discrimination cases, the companies have invoked bilateral treaties that they say protect them from civil rights complaints when they bring an executive from overseas to fill a key position instead of promoting an American employee. **********Just last month, the American subsidiary of the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation was accused by the E.E.O.C. of allowing sexual harassment at its auto plant in Illinois. And on Monday, Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals company, announced that it had suspended the president and chief executive of it United States operations because of employee accusations of sexual harassment at the company. **********Lewis M. Steel, a civil rights lawyer in Manhattan who is handling Ms. Goodman's case, says companies become emboldened \"each time the E.E.O.C. shrinks its budget -- which keeps happening.\" **********Mr. Steel said he knew of about 50 such discrimination complaints over the last three years. He said he was handling about 10 cases that involve Japanese subsidiaries, and four that involve units of French, German or Spanish companies. **********Ellen Vargyas, a lawyer for the E.E.O.C., said her agency did not track how many discrimination cases involved foreign companies. **********\"Frankly, we hear enough about discrimination from American companies,\" she said. She noted that the agency handled about 100,000 discrimination complaints  a year. \"We're just trying to keep our heads above water.\" She said the agency had not had a significant budget increase since 1979. **********Complaints against foreign companies do not always concern sex discrimination. Two years ago, the E.E.O.C. district office in New York helped settle an age discrimination case involving a man who had worked for the American unit of a Hong Kong bank and a national-origin case concerning an employee of a bank based in Venezuela. **********Ms. Goodman's accusations against Tokai have been supported by four men who used to work for the bank in the United States. The men have signed affidavits that have been submitted to the E.E.O.C. The affidavits described situations in  which American employees, but no Japanese employees, lost their jobs when business departments were downsized or eliminated. The affidavits also contended that American traders were dismissed when they suffered trading losses, while Japanese traders would simply be given other assignments. **********Tokai Bank says Ms. Goodman's accusations are without merit. \"And we're fully cooperating with the E.E.O.C. in this investigation,\" said Carolyn Chave, a senior vice president and human resources manager for the bank. About the perks  that Ms. Goodman felt she was being denied, Ms. Chave said, \"Every global company makes allowances for home staff employees who are on short-term assignments overseas to compensate them for the burden of being away from home.\" **********A United States Supreme Court ruling in 1982 specifically warned subsidiaries of foreign companies against violating the civil rights of American employees. Before the ruling, such subsidiaries argued that they were exempt from American  civil rights law because of friendship treaties that gave them and United States companies the right to assign key personnel abroad. The United States has such treaties with most of its trading partners. **********In the 1982 case, which involved Americans working for Sumitomo Shoji America, a subsidiary of the Japanese trading company, the Supreme Court ruled that the treaty did not exempt foreign subsidiaries from civil rights laws, although the court implied that subsidiaries might still have the right to bring over top-tier managers who were vital to the company's operations without violating those laws. **********Two appellate courts have since ruled that American subsidiaries of foreign companies can be protected by the friendship treaties when a parent company, rather than a subsidiary, asserts its treaty rights to send managers to the United States. **********Peter van Schaick, an employee rights lawyer in Glen Ridge, N.J., said he had noticed that foreign companies were regularly invoking the friendship treaty. **********\"I've had more than a half-dozen cases prevented from going to court because  of the friendship treaty,\" he said. \"It's become a license to discriminate.\" **********Amy Chen, a Chinese-American who works for the United States subsidiary of the Nomura Trading Company, filed a complaint against the company with the E.E.O.C. in November 1994, accusing Nomura of discrimination on the basis of sex and national origin. **********Ms. Chen said that Nomura hired her as a traffic coordinator for its chemicals and machinery department in 1991, but that she was unofficially made an assistant manager in September 1994 when the company needed her skills during a business trip. Ms. Chen said that both before and after the trip, she helped the company's president pursue new business in the United States and abroad. But she said she never received a salary increase or the benefits to which she was entitled as an assistant manager. **********Ms. Chen sent a letter in October 1994 to the president of Nomura's American  unit. In his response, he said management positions at Nomura's subsidiary were filled on a temporary, rotating basis by Japanese employees from the parent company. **********By the following spring, after she had filed her complaint with the E.E.O.C., Ms. Chen said she had been stripped of her managerial duties. She said that many of those duties were then assigned to a younger Japanese man whom she was expected to train, and that she was given secretarial tasks like typing invoices. She said she was also told that if she wanted to stay with the company, she could apply to become the Japanese man's assistant. **********The promotion \"was a paper tiger deal,\" Ms. Chen said. **********Nomura did not respond to requests for comment last week. **********Mr. Steel, who is Ms. Chen's lawyer, said her experiences were typical of what American employees faced. \"These companies are arguing that, despite the Sumitomo decision, they can bring in their own employees at any level,\" he said. \"They're also arguing that they can define what constitutes a management job.\" **********He added: \"It's difficult for the private bar to comes to terms with the problem because these companies are large and show resistance.

Berlow, a font designer, created Belucian, a curvaceous, low-hanging typeface that sashays across the page just as the husky-voiced ice queen herself might traverse a movie set. **********Mr. Berlow, who is also the president of the Font Bureau Inc. in Boston, is part of a new generation of designers of typefaces, or fonts, that has emerged since the birth of the Apple Macintosh and desktop publishing in 1984. **********But the digital technology that made designing type simpler has made the profession more difficult. More designers mean more competition and lower prices. And the technology that makes type easier to design has also made it easier to steal. **********There are about 500 designers worldwide these days who ponder the curves of an ''S'' or try to create a more beautiful or shocking letter ''B,'' and half of those are in the United States, according to Frank Romano, a professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology and a historian of type design. That compares with about 20 in the days of metal type, which lasted through the 1960's, and about 50 during the subsequent reign of phototype. **********The profession was exclusive because designing type was both expensive and time consuming. Only a handful of foundries owned the machines needed to produce new fonts in metal type or phototype. Today, anyone armed with a personal computer and software like Fontographer or Ikarus can design fonts. **********''The secret is out,'' said Edward Benguiat (pronounced ben-GAT), one of the giants in typeface design who has created more than 600 fonts. ''Type has been liberated.'' **********The great emancipator, of course, is digital technology. From the 15th- century days of Johann Gutenberg, who is credited with inventing movable type, to the time of William Caslon of Britain in the 18th century through the lifetime of the American Frederic W. Goudy early this century, it took years to develop a font, Mr. Romano said. **********Nowadays, with the right software, it can take just 45 seconds to produce a font, Mr. Berlow said. **********Today more than 100 small foundries and independent designers are moving into territory once occupied by a few large companies, like Monotype Typography Inc. and the Linotype-Hell Company. **********In addition to Monotype and Linotype, large companies with more than a thousand fonts to their credit include Adobe Systems Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.; the Agfa EPS Division of the Bayer Group of Germany and the International Typeface Corporation of New York. But also elbowing their way into the market are smaller font houses like Emigre Inc. in Sacramento, Calif., and Garagefonts in Del Mar, Calif. People in the industry estimate that 50,000 to 60,000 fonts are now in use. **********Some of the older companies have adjusted. Some have not. Monotype, founded in 1897 as a hot-metal type company, began to focus on the computer font market in 1990, said Steve Kuhlman, vice president for sales and marketing. But the American Type Founders Company in Elizabeth, N.J., once the largest type foundry in this country, went out of business in 1993. **********Many designers say that the boom in the font trade does not improve the product. For some, the painstaking design process has not changed much since the days of Gutenberg. **********For example, it took Mr. Berlow three months to research, conceptualize and refine all the characters of Belucian, which, intended for headlines, had to be easy to read but was also obliged to whisper subliminal messages of va-va-voom. **********''It's like a harmonica,'' said the 70-year-old Mr. Benguiat, whose clients have included the AT&T Corporation and the Barcelona Olympics. ''You can blow on it and make a lot of noise, but it won't be anything. You can't just give a person a computer and have that person design a typeface.'' **********A good typeface, Mr. Benguiat said, ''has a rhythm -- it flows.'' **********In essence, the new technology has made good designers better, but having an expensive Macintosh filled with software does not make someone a designer. **********Erfert Norton, author of ''The Macintosh Font Book'' sees a divergence in the popular font styles. There are grunge fonts and bizarre designs with illegible letters, but at the same time, there is a revival of fonts that ''hit a classical chord.'' Caslon, named after the 18th-century designer, remains a favorite. **********The typeface business, after all, is a fashion business. The hottest fonts right now are ''retro,'' Mr. Benguiat said, ''like platform shoes.'' **********While the number of people who design fonts seriously is believed to be in the hundreds, thousands dabble in the craft. **********Todd Dever, who works in video production in Long Beach, Calif., began designing fonts last year, when he could not find the typeface he wanted to produce a music video for Mike Keneally, a former guitar player for Frank Zappa. So Mr. Dever created Freak, a jittery, nervous alphabet full of curlicues. Then he made Smash, a ''grunge font'' inspired by the Seattle music scene that looked dirty and scratched up. **********After designing a few more fonts in his spare time, Mr. Dever put them up for sale, $5 for each complete alphabet, at his World Wide Web site, Cool Fonts Online. **********With competition like that, font prices have been in a free fall. **********At the high end of the market, a typeface that is commissioned -- usually for newspapers, advertising or corporate logos -- can still fetch tens of thousands of dollars. But the rest of the industry has suffered a meltdown in profit margins. **********Royalties, the one-time fees collected every time a font is sold, are the essence of the business. For commercial customers, licensing fees increase proportionally with the company's use of the font. A licensee can require a fee each time a font is sold, as Monotype did when it licensed its Times New Roman font to the Microsoft Corporation for use in its word processing software. **********Decades ago, a single font cost hundreds of dollars. Today, many fancy fonts from professional designers sell for less than $50. And hundreds can be downloaded, at no charge, from the Internet. **********To survive, foundries and independent designers have been banding together to market their ware. **********International Type Founders Inc., founded by Steve Jackaman, is a distribution network that represents 30 small font companies and independent designers in a CD-ROM catalogue of nearly 4,000 fonts. For $75, buyers get 25 fonts free and then can pay fees to ''unlock'' additional ones. **********There are also distributors that offer fonts in megapacks of thousands for $19.95, much to the dismay of some designers, who belittle the quality of bargain typefaces. **********''It's a hard business,'' said Mr. Jackaman, echoing the view of many in the profession. ''There's no one getting rich in our business. Most people in type designing do other things,'' like graphic design. **********Another serious issue is piracy. In the United States, fonts are protected by intellectual property laws; the computer code for a font can be copyrighted and the name trademarked. But the design -- the dimensions and contours of characters and the spacing between letters -- cannot be copyrighted. Pirates have sometimes copied the software, changed a few lines of code then renamed and resold the typeface. **********Almost everyone in the industry, from giants like Adobe to casual designers like Mr. Dever, has been victimized by font thieves. ''It's the single biggest threat to the type business,'' said Brian Heuckroth, senior product marketing manager for typefaces for Adobe. **********Last year, Adobe, Emigre and three other co-plaintiff font companies settled a lawsuit against SWFTE International Ltd., a font distributor, for copyright infringement, Mr. Heuckroth said. **********Mr. Dever, too, has found his own fonts in unexpected places. Not long ago, he was surfing the Internet when he stumbled across a grungy and banged-up alphabet that looked awfully familiar. **********''Hey, there's Smash,'' he said. **********Someone had posted the font on the Internet to be freely downloaded by anyone. But he has no plans to sue anyone. ''I'm not into arm-twisting,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/15/business/company-briefs-855910.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-08-15", "snippet": "Imperial Credit Industries agrees to acquire as much as 49 percent of Dabney-Resnick Inc as part of strategic alliance beween the two; Sector Communications Inc acquires 80 percent stake in HIS Technologies AG, Zurich, a software maker, for $10 mi...", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********IMPERIAL CREDIT INDUSTRIES, Torrance, Calif., a financial services company, agreed to acquire as much as 49 percent of Dabney-Resnick Inc. of Beverly Hills, Calif., as part of a strategic alliance between the two. **********SECTOR COMMUNICATIONS INC., McLean, Va., which owns an international long-distance telephone service, acquired an 80 percent stake in HIS Technologies A.G., Zurich, a software maker, for $10 million in cash and stock. **********DYNCORP INC., Reston, Va., received a five-year subcontract with an estimated value of $565 million from Fluor Daniel, owned by the Fluor Corporation, to provide services at a former Department of Energy nuclear weapons plant."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/15/business/king-world-said-to-be-in-talks-over-acquisition-by-new-world.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1996-06-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 834, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "King World Said to Be in Talks Over Acquisition by New World", "print_headline": "King World Said to Be in Talks Over Acquisition by New World", "body_text": " **********Like a long-running soap opera, the question of the future ownership of King  World Productions continued yesterday with reports that it was discussing a sale to New World Communications for $1.5 billion. **********One person familiar with the talks confirmed there had been some but was leery of predicting a deal between New World, which owns television stations and produces programs, and King World, which distributes \"The Oprah Winfrey Show,\" \"Wheel of Fortune\" and \"Jeopardy.\" **********Variety, the entertainment trade newspaper, first reported yesterday that Ronald O.

King  World stock closed up 25 cents at $39.875 and New World shares were unchanged at $16. **********Behind Wall Street's skepticism is the question of whether Mr. Perelman really wants to build New World or whether he is simply trying to provoke the News Corporation, which owns 20 percent of New World, into acquiring the balance. Some experts believe that Mr. Perelman is trying to press Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, to agree to a deal before New World makes an acquisition that makes it too big and diversified to fit easily into the News Corporation. **********According to one person with knowledge of the talks, Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Perelman have been in discussions for several months, but Mr. Perelman wants more for New World than the News Corporation is willing to spend. Mr. Murdoch reportedly struck a deal to pay $25 a share for New World, but the deal was apparently derailed when Mr. Perelman decided he wanted $28 a share and Mr. Murdoch balked. **********This person noted that New World had not been enormously successful in programming and that this helped explain why Mr. Perelman was willing to sell the company. That impression was strengthened when the company recently sold two television stations to NBC for $425 million. **********There is already one tie between New World and the News Corporation. New World's 10 television stations are affiliates of the Fox Network, which the News Corporation owns. **********But an alliance with King World would help counter New World's programming problems by giving it a stream of successful shows. Mr. Perelman has moved to develop the company's programming. He hired Brandon Tartikoff, who helped rebuild NBC, to create programming, and New World spent $30 million to acquire the producer Steven J. Cannell's company. But New World has yet to make a splash with new series. **********At King World, the concern is that the company is not vertically integrated because it owns programs but no television stations that can guarantee that the shows will get on the air. Though that is a bigger problem for companies when they start new shows, even the future of longtime hits like \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" could become an issue as larger companies consolidate. **********King World's shows are carried on ABC stations. In the wake of the Walt Disney Company's purchase of ABC, the question is whether Disney will ultimately bump outsiders off the air to put its own shows on its stations. **********Jessica Reif, who follows King World for Merrill Lynch, said that a merger with New World would assure that there would be a solid outlet for King World's  shows. She added that it would also strengthen New World's balance sheet, because that company could look to King World, which has plenty of cash, to help pay off its roughly $500 million in debt. **********But King World's founders, Roger and Michael King, have been trying to sell the company for several years and were reportedly close to a $1.8 billion sale to Turner Broadcasting System last year. Those talks were said to have broken off in part because the Turner board believed that the price was too high. **********Previously, there had been reports that King World would be sold to a number  of companies, including MCA Inc., the parent company of Universal Pictures and Universal Television. But the company has been on the market for several years,  and in that period it has failed to generate new hits, raising the question of its growth potential. As a result, analysts said it was unlikely to command much of a premium in any deal. **********While King World has been profitable recently, New World has been losing money. **********For its fiscal second quarter, which ended on Feb. 29, King World reported net income of $35.2 million, up from $29.9 million a year earlier. Revenue rose  to $176.8 million from $143.7 million. **********For its fiscal first quarter, which ended on March 31, New World reported a loss of $14.5 million, almost twice the loss of $7.5 million in the comparable period a year earlier. Revenue rose to $161.8 million from $114.8 million. **********In the current talks, First Boston is said to be representing New World, while Wasserstein Perella is the banker for King World. Bankers at both firms did not not return telephone calls yesterday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/27/business/linked-to-apple-but-trying-to-branch-out.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Brush", "pub_date": "1996-10-27", "snippet": "Outlook for investing in firms that make software and peripherals used in troubled Apple Computer's products discussed; table; graph (M)", "word_count": 948, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Linked to Apple but Trying to Branch Out", "print_headline": "Linked to Apple but Trying to Branch Out", "body_text": " **********WHILE scores of analysts mull over the fate of troubled Apple Computer, some investors are taking a look instead at companies that are related to Apple. They want to see if those enterprises are as endangered as Wall Street may think. **********Of course, as Apple's troubles have grown, many companies that make software and other peripherals used in Apple's Macintosh computers have seen their sales plummet. And Apple's problems, including product recalls and delays, are clearly huge. Revenue for the quarter ended Sept. 30, for instance, was off 23 percent from the comparable period a year earlier. **********Yet, even though all these companies could be further hurt if Apple's efforts to improve turn sour, some  have much brighter prospects than others. Some of them have strong, resourceful managers. Some may have stock prices that are too low. And some are succeeding at something that all of them are trying: to diversify into non-Apple products, like ones geared to Microsoft's Windows computer system. **********For investors willing to take a chance -- and their numbers may have grown with Apple's recent $25 million profit, the first after a string of losing quarters -- these companies may hold promise. **********Many Apple-linked companies  make software for computer graphics and editorial work, two fields in which Apple has long been strong.  Three of these enterprises -- Adobe Systems, Macromedia and Metatools -- not only have strong reputations for superior software, but also have made good progress at developing  non-Apple products. **********''All three of these companies have been really dependent on Macintosh,'' Christopher Galvin, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist, said. ''But each has come out with major products for the Windows platform.'' **********And because of Apple's troubles, the stock prices of two of them, Adobe and Macromedia, are hovering around their 52-week lows and look attractively cheap, some analysts say. The stock of Adobe, which makes the Postscript computer language, is trading at 19 times estimated earnings for its current fiscal year, while Macromedia's multiple is 23. Both figures are much lower than those of many other high-tech concerns. **********Adobe's stock has fallen for reasons other than Apple's woes, like the loss of a big contract with Hewlett-Packard. But Gerard Hallaren, a portfolio manager at Invesco's Strategic Technology fund, says he believes Adobe is overcoming these difficulties. Also, the company is now  releasing new versions of Photoshop, Pagemaker and other popular programs. Sales typically slow at such times, as customers hold off buying in anticipation of the new software. **********Many customers, however, are wondering these days whether to stay with Apple systems or to convert to Windows. Analysts say this uncertainty -- Macromedia is similarly affected -- may hurt sales at both of these software companies for an unknown time. **********''The transition period may be more protracted than we think,'' Mr. Galvin said. **********NEVERTHELESS, many analysts remain bullish. ''The world has not moved away from these products,'' Mr. Galvin said. In the long term, he added, ''both Adobe and Macromedia are well positioned.'' **********Metatools presents a closer question for the investor. Although it has done a good job of diversifying -- only 30 percent of revenues come from Apple-related products -- its  stock is not cheap, trading at 57 times estimated earnings. **********And in contrast to Adobe and Macromedia, Metatools' new products, like a line of Internet games, are largely untested in the market. **********Like Metatools, Micro Warehouse, a mail-order computer seller, has been diversifying well. But while its Windows-based products are selling briskly, the declines in Apple-linked sales are sharp. Indeed, the company's stock dropped 25 percent in June, after it warned that its earnings would be below expectations. **********The decline, however, may have created a bargain. Micro Warehouse shares are trading at 16 times estimated earnings. According to Dale Dutile, an analyst with Massachusetts Financial Services, ''Mail-order catalogue companies that have computer exposure have multiples three times as high.'' **********Mr. Dutile also notes that Micro Warehouse focuses on the high end of  Apple products, where margins are greater. And he and others agree with John Force, lead manager of the PBHG Technology and Communications fund, that the company is ''extraordinarily well-managed.'' But these advantages may mean little if Micro Warehouse cannot perform its  basic task: continuing to grow non-Apple revenues. **********AT first glance, Insignia Solutions, which makes software  that allows Windows-based programs to run on Apple computers, seems to be distancing itself from Apple nicely. In the quarter ended Sept. 30, its Apple-related revenue dropped to just 23 percent of  overall revenue. The low percentage, however, mostly reflects markedly lower income from Apple-based  products. **********And while the company is getting some growing sales from a new  product, that product is geared to work with Windows NT, Microsoft's latest operating system for offices. Such reliance can be risky. **********''Insignia is a value play,'' said Alan Lowenstein, an assistant portfolio manager for the John Hancock  Global Technology fund, which holds stock in Insignia. ''But you also buy it because you believe in Windows NT.'' **********One company that is still tightly tethered to Apple is Global Village  Communications, a maker of modems and communications software. **********Global Village has distanced itself a bit from Apple with Focal Point, a Windows product that merges E-mail, voice mail and faxes in one desktop application. More such products are in the pipeline, analysts say. **********But 80 to 85 percent of the company's sales are Apple-linked. And its stock price shows it, having fallen 61 percent since mid-1995. Without more diversification -- and Global Village is in a competitive sector -- the company may be hit hard if Apple fails to improve. **********Of course, the true Apple fan has no doubt that Apple will thrive. And in that case, all these companies, diversified or not, should shine."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/29/business/company-news-micron-plans-to-weigh-spinoffs-of-two-units.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;MICRON PLANS TO WEIGH SPINOFFS OF TWO UNITS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;MICRON PLANS TO WEIGH SPINOFFS OF TWO UNITS", "body_text": " **********Micron Technology Inc. said yesterday that it would consider spinning off its communications and flat-panel-display units as separately traded companies.

MCI and British Telecom hope that such a merger  will allow them to compete more effectively against larger rivals like AT&T and  Sprint, which are also expanding their international data traffic capacity in the hope of winning larger shares of a global Internet market. **********MCI also said it would announce today an alliance with the Intel Corporation that involves Intel's Internet products. Both companies declined to provide details yesterday. **********MCI and British Telecom will together spend about $100 million this year to establish at least eight new regional Internet hubs in the United States, Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan and Australia, said Gerald H. Taylor, president of MCI. **********Eventually, 20 of these \"super hubs\" will be installed around the world, Mr.  Taylor said, reducing the heavy load on the more established network infrastructure in the United States, through which most international Internet traffic is routed. **********Mr. Taylor said he expected the new high-speed services to appeal primarily to multinational businesses as an alternative to more expensive, private data networks. Using high-speed data lines, each capable of transporting more than 45 million bits of information -- or a copy of Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\" -- a second between countries, the two companies hope to foster the growth of multimedia communications services among businesses, including electronic commerce, voice mail, electronic mail, document sharing, facsimile services and  World Wide Web publishing. **********The joint venture's so-called backbone connections between some of the new Internet hubs in the United States will be even faster, carrying 155 million bits a second, he said. **********The newly expanded and beefed-up networks will be operated by the joint venture that MCI and British Telecom formed three years ago called Concert. While it will handle global customer service and billing for the network, Concert will also try to sell the new network capacity to Internet service providers who would in turn resell the capacity to businesses and individuals. **********Vinton Cerf, the chief Internet strategist for MCI, said Concert would offer  both standard and premium Internet services to its customers, allowing Internet service providers to offer higher-priced services to businesses that demand peak performance at all times. When international Internet traffic is heavy and standard performance slows down -- an increasingly common phenomenon as millions of new users pile onto the network -- Concert's computers will route the premium customer's traffic to a separate, less-crowded network. **********\"It's like first-class service on an airline,\" Mr. Cerf said. \"There's the same square footage, but there are fewer passengers and better food.\" **********MCI and British Telecom said yesterday that the NTT Data Corporation, a company that is 60 percent owned by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, had signed on as the newest international customer of Concert. Growth of the Japanese Internet market is expected to outpace that of the United States over the next year, analysts said. **********Mr. Cerf of MCI said that although the initial expansion of the Concert network would be in Europe, Japan and the United States, eventually it would extend to Canada, Mexico, South America and elsewhere. **********\"In the long run, there is a tremendous demand for transoceanic Internet capacity,\" Mr. Cerf said. \"Demand from customers is as ambitious and aggressive internationally as it is on the domestic front. The numbers are not as big in absolute terms, but they'll get there.\" **********Ullas Naik, vice president and Internet analyst at First Albany Technology Research in Boston, said the Concert expansion would help spur the growth of the Internet overseas, but that it was too soon to know if the expansion would help  MCI in its quest to increase its share of the market in the United States. **********\"I don't see from a competitive standpoint how it changes the landscape,\" Mr. Naik said. \"However, the international front is still very much uncharted territory, so this will certainly have some impact.\" **********British Telecom owns 20 percent of MCI. Mr. Taylor of MCI said British Telecom had no plans to increase its stake in MCI as a result of the deal disclosed yesterday. **********Both British Telecom and MCI left no doubt, however, of the importance they place on the joint venture. **********\"We are anticipating that at the turn of the century and into the next millennium, the totality of Internet traffic for us could be surpassing voice traffic, if you look at the current rates of growth,\" said Rupert Gavin, British Telecom's director of multimedia services. \"Certainly we at BT consider this to  be extremely substantial for our future.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/06/business/international-business-trade-surplus-shrinks-in-japan.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Trade Surplus Shrinks in Japan", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Trade Surplus Shrinks in Japan", "body_text": " **********Japan's merchandise trade surplus for the first 20 days of February shrank 80.9 percent from the comparable period in 1995, to $1.232 billion, the Finance  Ministry said today. **********Economists said the sharp contraction was largely a result of the jump in exports last February, after the Kobe earthquake blocked exports in January. **********The exaggerated decline in the surplus will probably also appear in the figures for all of February, to be released in about 10 days, said Tetsuro Sawano, an economist at Nikko Research Center. **********Exports during the 20-day period fell 11.3 percent, to $20.599 billion, while imports rose 15.6 percent, to $19.367 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/26/world/harold-trobe-is-dead-at-82-helped-resettle-war-refugees.html": {"writer_name": "Wolfgang Saxon", "pub_date": "1996-06-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 517, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Obituary; Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Harold Trobe Is Dead at 82; Helped Resettle War Refugees", "print_headline": "Harold Trobe Is Dead at 82; Helped Resettle War Refugees", "body_text": " **********Harold Trobe, a key figure in efforts to rescue and resettle hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees from war-ravaged Europe, died on Monday at his home in Gainesville, Fla., where he had retired in 1980.

They were the largest group  of prisoners from the war known to remain in captivity so long after the peace accords. But the question of why the release came so late brought so many conflicting answers that the truth was lost. **********The captivity that ended today in the slowly warming Balkan spring began last July in the panic that followed the fall of the United Nations \"safe area\" of Zepa to the Bosnian Serbs. The people there knew about the massacres of the men  of Srebrenica, another designated safe area that was overrun two weeks earlier. **********So to avoid the Bosnian Serb forces to their west, about 800 of the men and boys of Zepa fled east. They crossed the Drina River to Yugoslavia, where they were split between two detention camps. **********An official with the International Committee of the Red Cross in Yugoslavia said, \"We did not forget about them, but there was a war going on and everything is complicated in a war.\" **********The complications were such that for two months all 800 men were in camps where conditions were \"horrible and shameful,\" one Red Cross worker said. Many of the men said today that they had tried to return to Bosnia but that United Nations officials had refused their requests. **********Their case was the responsibility of the Belgrade office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The head of that office, Margaret O'Keeffe, said today that the initial intention was to get other countries to take the men because most were afraid to go home. **********She said that because they had fled Bosnia, they would be seen as traitors if they returned. \"Because of their anxiety, the possibility of going to Bosnia did not arise,\" she said. **********But those returning to Bosnia today disputed that. \"We had defended our homes, and had to go to Yugoslavia to save our lives,\" said Nadjed Cesko. \"Why should we be afraid?\" **********Ismet Sehic recalled, \"The U.N. said: 'Don't even mention Bosnia. There's no  way to get you to Bosnia.' \" **********In September the first men were released to other countries. The United States and other countries eventually took more than 500. But this was complicated too, a refugee official said, because the countries would often promise to take some men, then be slow to actually accept them. **********\"We worked and worked to get them a place to go, but you know how these diplomatic things are easily sidetracked,\" the official said. **********In December, the Dayton agreement was signed and the war stopped. Subsequently, prisoners were slowly being released by all sides. Hundreds of the men who had gone to other countries had left there and returned to Bosnia, but the men released today were still prisoners. **********Their families, driven out of Zepa, had become refugees within their own country. Relief agencies tracked the families to their new addresses, and prisoners like Mr. Rizvic were reunited with their families in houses that had never been their homes. **********\"Ask the Serbs why the men were not freed,\" said Amir Hadziomeragic, the Bosnian Minister for Relations with the United Nations. \"They kept them to pressure us, to get us to give them something in return.\" **********He also suggested that the United Nations efforts had been slowed by fighting between refugee officials in Belgrade and Sarajevo. **********A United Nations refugee official based in Sarajevo said the Bosnian Government had moved unreasonably slowly. \"They didn't even send a real delegation to Yugoslavia until last month,\"he said. **********After the Bosnian Government passed an amnesty law three months ago, United Nations officials considered it safe for the men to return. **********But, Mrs. O'Keeffe said, it was difficult to find a way to get them home. The officials decided not to move the men by air because they considered the Sarajevo airport dangerous, though it is used daily by NATO planes. **********They tried to get permission to take the men by bus via Croatia, but Croatia  refused. Then Hungary would not give them visas. **********Each request took time, Mrs. O'Keeffe said. \"The Serbs were not delaying things,\" she said. But getting the men home \"was a process of many long steps.\" **********Finally, after three months, the United Nations just sent buses to the camp and brought the men straight to Bosnia, about a four-hour drive. **********There were two further complications. First, the Yugoslav police kept 13 of the men, saying that after eight months the authorities needed additional time to investigate them in connection with war crimes. **********Then, just before the men were to transfer from Yugoslav to Bosnian buses that would take them to their new homes, they came across a new bridge they could not cross.

Toward the end of 1995, it said, \"almost all public dissent against the central authorities was silenced.\" **********In its overview, the report implicitly challenged the Clinton Administration's strategy, supported by many business interests, of strengthening economic ties with China regardless of Beijing's human rights record. **********\"The experience of China in the past few years demonstrates that while economic growth, trade and social mobility create an improved standard of living, they cannot by themselves bring about greater respect for human rights in the absence of a willingness by political authorities to abide by the fundamental international norms,\" the report said. **********Senior officials were concerned about the release of this sensitive report, delayed because of the Government shutdown over the budget, as they try to improve a difficult relationship with Beijing. In recent months the United States has accused China of violating agreements on the spread of nuclear and missile weapons, of trying to intimidate Taiwanese voters who are electing a President on March 23 and of breaking its pledge to crack down on the flagrant pirating of American music, videos and computer software. **********A senior Chinese Foreign Ministry official, Liu Huaqiu, is now in Washington  for talks with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, and other officials charged with finding a consistent policy toward China. **********Despite the strong language in today's report, human rights advocates remain  critical of Administration policy. Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch Asia, said: \"Overall it is an accurate, hard-hitting report,  and probably more critical than last year.\" **********\"But it underlines the glaring disparity between the Administration's analysis and its policy,\" he added, calling the overall approach too soft on China. **********Although the United States will co-sponsor the human rights resolution in Geneva, Mr. Jendrzejczyk said, the Chinese are pushing Washington not to lobby hard for the resolution, which could lead to its easy defeat when a vote comes in late April. Even John Shattuck, the Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor who is in charge of compiling these reports, said today the American vote in Geneva would depend on Chinese behavior at the time. **********While saying little that American officials have not regularly discussed, these annual human rights reports carry the weight of an American political judgment that many countries, especially in Asia, reject as hypocritical. **********In the report Russia was criticized for abuses of human rights in its effort  to put down an armed revolt in Chechnya. **********The Administration said abuses had decreased in Turkey and in Israel, where the redeployment of most Israeli troops from large areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip had reduced the incidents of abuse. In Turkey, however, the improvement came against \"a continuing pattern\" of abuses, including restrictions on expression, torture and excessive use of force against the Kurdish population in the battle against terrorism. Similarly, Egypt was criticized for excessive force, including torture and extrajudicial killings, in its campaign against Islamic militants. **********There were \"familiar patterns of abuse\" in countries like Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Colombia, Indonesia and countries in crisis, like North Korea and the Sudan, the department said. **********Over the last 20 years, Mr. Christopher said, the reports also \"tell a vivid  story of how much the world has changed.\" **********Latin America, he noted, had greatly improved, with a strong movement toward  democratization throughout the hemisphere. But displaying how the reports are used for current political purposes, Mr. Christopher sharply criticized Cuba for stifling dissent and shooting down civilian airplanes. He also touched on other  countries that he called \"rogue states that possess the greatest threat to America's security -- states like Iran, Iraq and Libya -- that are among the greatest violators of human rights.\" And he mentioned Nigeria and Burma as abusers of human rights as well as protectors of the drug trade. **********As the State Department focused today on human rights, Mr. Lake, the national security adviser, gave a speech at George Washington University about America's security challenges in a post-cold war world. **********While listing the promotion and defense of democracy, \"which enhances our security and the spread of our values,\" Mr. Lake spent little of his speech discussing human rights. Instead, following the new tone of a Clinton Administration encouraged by its relatively successful use of the American military in Haiti and Bosnia, Mr. Lake concentrated on \"the use of force\" and \"the example of our power,\" in addition to \"the power of our example.\" **********\"Until human nature changes,\" Mr. Lake said, \"power and force will remain at  the heart of international relations.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/13/business/executive-changes-016110.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-06-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 128, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********COMPUTERVISION CORP., Bedford, Mass., named Kathleen A.

Green Jr., chairman and chief executive of Utilicorp, said last night. **********Under the terms of the amended proposal, Utilicorp's shareholders would receive one share in the merged company for every share they currently own, rather than the 1.096 shares they would have received under the original offer. **********In essence, that increases the value of the offer for Kansas City Power shareholders by reducing the number of total shares outstanding. Kansas City Power shareholders would receive one share of the new company for every share they currently hold, unchanged from the original offer, but their stake in the new company would increase by 9 percent, compared with the orginal offer. At yesterday's closing price of Utilicorp shares, the amended offer is worth $27.25 a share. **********The revised offer is an effort to roughly match the value that Western Resources has proposed to offer Kansas City Power's shareholders. **********Utilicorp has been locked in a bitter battle with Western Resources, which made a competing bid for Kansas City Power in April that many analysts and shareholders regard as the better offer -- even though it has technically not yet been made. **********Utilicorp's revised proposal also makes use of a complex structure called a reverse triangular merger that effectively circumvents the need for the approval of two-thirds of Kansas City Power's shareholders. That requirement, part of the company's bylaws, presented a high hurdle to the merger because, typically, 10 to 20 percent of shareholders do not vote in corporate elections. **********\"We think they had at least a plurality of the votes and probably a majority, but two-thirds was going to be impossible,\" a person involved in the proposed deal said. **********The dividend of the combined company would be $1.85 a year, the same as the original offer. **********Western Resources, which has proposed a stock-for-stock transaction valued by some analysts at $28 a share, has promised a $2.01 dividend. **********Pam Levetzow, a spokeswoman for Kansas City Power, said the annual meeting would go ahead as planned. \"We have a number of other matters to discuss,\" she said. **********Utilicorp will also hold its annual meeting tomorrow. **********Shareholder votes on the proposed Utilicorp-Kansas City Power merger will be  postponed until the summer, although the companies said the regulatory approval  process would stay on track. **********Western Resources still requires approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, its board and its shareholders before it can make a formal offer to  Kansas City Power shareholders. **********Utilicorp has hinted that its rival bidder may be more interested in derailing a deal that would put it at a competitive disadvantage than in actually consummating a combination. **********Indeed, there is no love lost between Kansas City Power and Western Resources, which was formed in 1992 as a means of blocking a hostile takeover of Kansas Gas and Electric by none other than Kansas City Power. Kansas Gas and Electric merged with Kansas Power and Light and became Western Resources as a way of fending off Kansas City Power's advances. **********Western Resources said again yesterday that it expected to complete the approval process and make a formal bid for Kansas City Power in June. **********Last week, Institutional Shareholder Services, an independent investor advisory firm, recommended that Kansas City Power shareholders vote against a merger with Utilicorp, saying that Western Resources' proposed bid was better.

Its detractors see it as the latest way of trying to fool investors that the weak really is the strong. **********But, love it or hate it, style analysis is flavor of the month in today's mutual fund industry. **********Style analysis is another way of describing the investment process or style by which a fund manager aims to match or exceed the relevant benchmark. Instead of using a fund's portfolio to determine the manager's investment approach, style analysts use actual performance results. **********Barra, a California-based investment technology company, provides a quantitative style-analysis service to consultants, advisers and private investors. Using fund data supplied by Micropal, the London-based fund research group, Barra compares a fund's month-by-month returns over the past three years with the returns of 15 standard asset classes or indexes, from Treasury bills to large-company value stocks to small-company growth stocks. It then produces an asset allocation table based on how the portfolio acted over this time period. **********A fund manager's success within a particular investment style is alsomeasured by comparing the fund's performance with the results that could have been achieved by a passive investment strategy using the same style. Fund managers are allocated a specialist investment benchmark andare assessed according to how well, or how badly, they did against that indicator. **********Style analysis is formidably complex. But the basic premise presupposes a manager's personal style of investing as the principal factor determining performance. **********The only interest to investors, of course, is whether or not this latest \"technique\" is a gimmick or a realistic means of improving investment returns. **********William Sharpe, a professor of finance at Stanford University, has been credited with developing the technique for determining a fund's style empirically. Mr. Sharpe maintains that the description of a fund manager's style in a typical investment prospectus is opaque and of limited value to investors, and that style analysis provides more detailed and consistent information about a manager's investment approach and performance. **********\"Investment labels cover a multitude of sins,\" \" Mr. Sharpe says.\"One can find several funds described as aggressive growth that act in a completely different manner from one another. Some might not even act like growth funds at all. One can also find funds with different stated styles that act in the same, or a similar manner. Style analysis will enable investors to spot these inconsistencies.\" **********As well as characterizing the style of a manager, style analysis is sold on the strength of its ability to measure performance. **********\"One of the problems with measuring performance is that growth funds will look good in some years and bad in other years,\" Mr. Sharpe said. \"The investor may want to know which manager picks above-average growth stocks or above-average value stocks. **********\"Style analysis will provide each manager with a relevant benchmark to their specific style,\" he said.\"Investors can compare funds of a similar style on the strength of their performance against the benchmark.\" **********Richard Bernstein, director of quantitative analysis at Merrill Lynch in New York, is a firm believer in the benefits of style analysis, which he says Merrill Lynch has been using since the late 1980s. **********\"Style analysis can provide investors with a critical insight into what actually drives the market,\" he said.\"This insight can help investors predict, with some degree of certainty, how afund will perform in the future.\" **********Not everyone in the industry likes style analysis, however. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services Inc. in New York, wonders what all the fuss is about. He argues that style analysis is a very simplistic and one-dimensional way of looking at the investment process. **********\"Style analysts are making judgments about a fund manager's style without understanding the actual contents of a portfolio and the manager's reasons for choosing these investments,\" Mr. Lipper said.\"It is like employing someone on the basis of their height and shoe size. These figures say absolutely nothing about the individual's skill. Style analysis is another example of statisticians attempting to use science to explain an art form.\" **********Anne McMeehan, managing director of Framlington, a fund management group in London, agrees with Mr. Lipper that style analysis is probably too simplistic a technique to rely on exclusively.But she believes it is useful for understanding how a fund management group aims to add value. **********Ms. McMeehan maintains that while it is important to have a disciplined approach to investing, managers need also to be able to respond to changing market conditions and not be beholden to a particular label. **********Mr. Sharpe acknowledges that style analysis has its limitations. \"Itwill not help investors pick next year's winning fund. Nor will it enable investors predict whether growth or value is going to do best in the next 24 months. Style analysis may even be misleading in situations where a fund manager abruptly changes investment style,\" he said. **********But then style analysis is not intended to be a cure-all. At best, it can provide information about how funds and their managers behave and how funds perform relative to their specialist benchmarks. At worst, it is a number-crunching exercise that leaves the vast majority of investors nonplussed and none the wiser."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/27/business/uaw-said-to-prefer-talks-with-gm-and-ford-first-chrysler-later.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1996-08-27", "snippet": "United Automobile Workers union is leaning toward negotiating with new national labor contract first at General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co, and leaving Chrysler Corp for later (L)", "word_count": 755, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.A.W.

Yokich, the U.A.W.'s president, could change his mind, the current consensus at the union is that negotiations should proceed simultaneously with Ford and G.M., people familiar with the union's decision-making said. The three-year labor contracts between the U.A.W. and each of the Big Three auto makers expire at midnight on Sept. 14. **********Although Mr. Yokich and Richard Shoemaker, the U.A.W.'s vice president for G.M. issues, are delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, both men stayed here today to hammer out strategy, people close to the union said. Another delegate, Ernest Lofton, the U.A.W.'s vice president for Ford issues, abruptly flew back here from Chicago this afternoon to join them. **********But a fourth delegate, Jack Laskowski, the vice president and head of Chrysler issues, remained in Chicago, a sign that Chrysler is unlikely to be included in the U.A.W.'s first round of negotiations. **********Chrysler had expressed strong interest last spring in going first, and many industry analysts expected it to do so. The U.A.W. has traditionally confronted the most prosperous company first, on the theory that it would be the most willing to settle to prevent a strike disrupting its production. In the United States auto industry, Chrysler has the highest profit margins for each of its vehicles. **********But the U.A.W.'s leaders began having second thoughts this summer, worrying that if Chrysler made generous concessions, G.M. might refuse to sign the same deal. The most pressing issues for the U.A.W. are at G.M., which is trying to buy more parts from outside suppliers and which accounts for half the U.A.W.'s employment in the industry. **********Mr. Yokich said last Thursday that it was important for the domestic auto makers to pay like wages and benefits, although he pointedly did not say that the rest of each auto maker's labor contract had to have identical language. **********All three auto makers have said they would have liked to go first so as to negotiate contracts that suit their needs. But the talks this summer have gone slowly, with all the auto makers taking a hard line. **********The developing consensus at the U.A.W. in favor of including Ford in the first round of negotiations reflects Mr. Yokich's close friendship with top Ford executives and Ford's tradition of coming up with innovative solutions to complex labor problems, people close to the union said. U.A.W. and Ford officials said on June 10, at the opening of labor talks, that the next national labor contract might last for longer than the traditional three years. **********If the U.A.W. pursues talks with G.M. and Ford simultaneously, it would be unusual, but it would have precedents. The union negotiated with G.M. and Chrysler in 1990, and with G.M. and Ford in 1970. **********In both cases, the U.A.W. ended up narrowing its focus to G.M. in the final days before its national contracts expired. The 1990 negotiations ended peacefully, while the talks in 1970 produced a two-month-long national strike at G.M. that contributed to a nationwide recession that year. G.M. is the nation's biggest company in terms of sales and employees. **********If the U.A.W. chooses G.M. and Ford, it will put the Canadian Auto Workers, a separate union, in a difficult position. Basil E. Hargrove, the Canadian union's president, who is known as Buzz, said in an interview earlier this summer that he would start negotiations with a different company than the one the U.A.W. was negotiating with. If both unions negotiated with the same auto maker at the same time, the smaller Canadian union might be ignored. **********If the U.A.W. chooses Ford and G.M., that would appear to leave Mr. Hargrove with only Chrysler, with which the Canadian union has few quarrels. Chrysler is the only auto maker not to have backed tough new labor laws being drafted by Ontario's provincial government. **********In a telephone interview this afternoon, Mr. Hargrove refused to discuss the U.A.W.'s decision-making. But he acknowledged a reluctance to confront Chrysler first. **********''There is some hesitancy on my part because of the relationship with Chrysler, because they have been very good on the issues here,'' Mr. Hargrove said. **********He added that he planned to choose his negotiating target on Wednesday morning in any case. ''The companies are waiting now for us to identify a target,'' Mr. Hargrove said. ''People have really staked out their ground as far as the issues.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/26/world/strike-by-french-truck-drivers-slows-commerce-to-snail-s-pace.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1996-11-26", "snippet": "French truck drivers striking for higher pay and right to early retirement at full pay blockade highways, ports and airports; Prime Min Alain Juppe appeals to new Government-appointed mediator to resolve dispute, which could mushroom into national...", "word_count": 482, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Strike by French Truck Drivers Slows Commerce to Snail's Pace", "print_headline": "Strike by French Truck Drivers Slows Commerce to Snail's Pace", "body_text": " **********French truck drivers striking for higher pay and the right to early retirement at full pay blockaded highways, ports and airports all around the country today as a dispute with private employers went into its second week. **********After a week of blockades around oil refineries in southern France, gasoline supplies were running out in Bordeaux, the most heavily affected city. Prime Minister Alain Juppe, who is also Mayor of Bordeaux, appealed to a new Government-appointed mediator to get the two sides to find a solution quickly after an all-night negotiating session failed to produce results. **********''The Government has done everything to get these talks under way,''  Mr. Juppe said.

The main highway to Spain was blocked in both directions north of Bordeaux; north of Paris, trucks blocked all but one lane into Charles de Gaulle Airport. **********Along the English Channel, truck drivers kept all but private passenger cars from using ferries, adding to transportation woes caused by the fire that put the Channel Tunnel substantially out of operation a week ago. Some of the 1,000 British truck drivers caught up in the dispute have asked French union leaders to let them go back to England. **********Store shelves in Paris began emptying after drivers cut off much of the wholesale market south of the capital.

It was the battle of the cliches last week on Wall Street: \"What goes up must come down\" vs. \"You can't miss with stocks.\" The \"can't miss\" theory got a resounding vote on word that we keep pouring staggering sums into mutual funds.  Watch the superlatives pile up: the first quarter's $80 billion take shattered the previous record, with the $72 billion that went into stock funds exceeding the total for 1995's first seven months. Still, come down the market did, relentlessly -- with no big next-day bouncebacks, like soothing hot chocolate, to make it all better. What's happening? \"Inflation!\" cried the doomsayers, while optimists pointed, yet again, at the aging-baby-boomer savings juggernaut. Irresistible force, meet immovable object. **********SUBSISTENCE A 'Living Wage,' Locally It's called the \"minimum\" wage -- a name that's more appropriate by the day. Inflation so eroded this base wage in the 80's that even if the Clinton team manages to cajole it up to $5.15 an hour from $4.25, it'll buy less than it did  in the 70's. But now this battle has gone local, to cities like Baltimore, and has a new name, the \"living wage\" movement. Baltimore now demands that companies with city contracts pay at least $6.10 -- it goes to $6.60 in July -- and more than 30 other cities are also looking for ways to do at the local level what Congress has not seen fit to do nationwide. Baltimore's rule affects few workers, though, so living-wage advocates are calling for broader local action. **********THE TOBACCO WARS Smoking Documents? The Great Tobacco Wars are marked by a lot of facts, a lot of haze. Here's a fact: the F.B.I. just got some documents. After that, the haze descends. Some lawyers say they are Philip Morris documents, the executive who'd squirreled them away begs to differ, and Philip Morris calls their release a \"bizarre stunt.\" If they're the real thing, they just might provide a -- pardon the expression -- smoking gun on one smoldering issue: whether tobacco companies manipulated nicotine levels. A lawyer said one note read: \"determine minimum nicotine drop to keep normal smokers hooked.\" It was, he said, dated Feb. 1, 1965 -- soon after the landmark Surgeon General's report, as Philip Morris was trying to design low-tar cigarettes. **********On other fronts, a Mayo Clinic study suggested that when alcoholics smoke, it's  the cigarettes that are more likely to kill them. Marlboro will be named to the  Marketing Hall of Fame, the first tobacco product to get that honor. And R.J. Reynolds is gambling on a nearly smokeless cigarette. **********FOLLOW THE FORTUNE Duke, Father and Daughter Speaking of tobacco, James Buchanan Duke and his daughter are both in the news.  The daughter you know all about: Doris Duke, whose $1.2 billion estate has been  a battleground since her death in 1993. Last week came a tentative settlement in which Bernard Lafferty, the butler-come-lately who'd been living in her mansions and jetting about in her plane, would get millions but no longer rule the roost. And her father, \"Buck\" Duke? Well, he's the one who made that fortune, as the turn-of-the-century founder of American Tobacco, the colossus that dominated the industry until the trust-busters got at it in 1911. His rough-and-tumble story is told in detail in \"Ashes to Ashes,\" by Richard Kluger, a history of the tobacco wars just out from Alfred A. Knopf. **********THE AGE OF PLASTIC Farewell, Loose Change? Watch out. They're trying to make our lives easier again. Who's \"they\"? Well, this time it's Citibank, Chase, Mastercard and Visa, which last week offered to  let the world try cash that's been computer-imbedded in a plastic card. Just swipe it through some machine, you're $1.78 poorer, and the store is $1.78 richer. Why? Faster sales, more sales to those not endowed with exact change, fewer bank tellers -- the list goes on. But think of small rituals lost: the math lessons for schoolchildren in figuring change, the triumph of pointing out  that you've been shortchanged, the moral dilemma -- keep it, or give it back? -- when you get too much. And as one citizen, echoing the lament of the plastic-carrying masses, put it, \"Why do I need another card?\" **********ROARING FOR DOLLARS Numbers, Hollywood Style The numbers boggle the mind -- but it is Hollywood, after all. When Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney in 1994, it seems, he expected 2 percent of the profits from all those money machines like \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"The Lion King.\" Hollywood heavyweights normally work these things out in whispers, but there is  apparently such bad blood between Mr. Katzenberg and Michael Eisner, Disney's boss, that they couldn't. So Mr. Katzenberg sued last week, saying those profits now exceed $12.5 billion -- which puts his 2 percent at, yes, $250 million. A lion's ransom indeed. **********DEVELOPER PLUS Building for Real People A socially conscious real estate developer. Hmmm. Sounds like an oxymoron. But then there's James W. Rouse, who died last week at 81. He \"did more to revitalize American cities than anyone this century,\" said Donna Shalala, Health and Human Services Secretary. How? For one thing, he created Columbia, Md., a city designed to carve some order out of the chaos of postwar sprawl. And he invented the idea of inner-city \"festival marketplaces\" by creating Boston's Faneuil Hall, which counts South Street Seaport among its numerous offspring. But he was proudest of his late-in-life efforts to offer affordable housing, with his Enterprise Foundation building more than 40,000 units. Through it all,  he had one passion: he watched people walk, talk and shop; he wanted real people to live in places he built. What a quaint idea. **********FUEL EFFICIENCY Some Guzzle, Some Don't The fuel-efficiency news was all over the map last week. At one extreme, the Energy Department said it expected gasoline demand to set records this summer. One culprit is Americans' bizarre infatuation with gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles. (Do ads picture them in odd, wild places because they're searching desperately for gas stations?). Another is higher speed limits (because faster driving erodes efficiency). At the far side of the map, Honda introduced a new electric vehicle, to appear in California in the spring of '97 -- the first to use nickel-metal hydride batteries. It says this advanced technology greatly improves range, though the Honda EV still goes just 125 miles on a charge. The price, a big sticking point as electrics yearn for actual buyers, was not disclosed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/09/world/pro-chechen-hijacker-of-turkish-jet-surrenders-in-germany.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 444, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pro-Chechen Hijacker of Turkish Jet Surrenders in Germany", "print_headline": "Pro-Chechen Hijacker of Turkish Jet Surrenders in Germany", "body_text": " **********A pro-Chechen gunman hijacked a Turkish Cypriot airliner to Munich late Friday, but released the 109 hostages early today.

He never planned on leaving. But in 1992, as war broke out, he and his Serbian friends said they were pushed to chose sides. **********Some Bosnian Serbs took up arms and sowed terror in their own city. Others just left, overcome by worry that they might become victims of Muslims. They now have a wasteland to ponder. **********Shaking his head at his dismal prospects, Mr. Bebarovic recalled the day he slipped away across the bridge into Grbavica. **********\"I had gone down to the coffee bar, 20 feet from my home,\" he said clenching  his jaw. \"But when I asked for a brandy, the waiter told me he had none. I tried to get a beer, then a coffee. He had none for Serbs. After that I stayed awake all night, worried that they would come for me. Finally, by the morning, I had crossed to the other side and lost everything.\" **********Mr. Jovic and Mr. Bebarovic are now trying to rekindle their connections in the city, hoping that old friends will guide them back into the lives they once  had. But their return is fraught with difficulties. The Bosnian Government has yet to offer amnesty to its former enemies. It also keeps records on all Serbs who left Sarajevo and has put together lists of complaints against those who might have committed crimes. **********The war has left old friendships tattered and vague, more things of suspicion than cherished memories. And there is plenty of hate to go around. **********Mr. Jovic's friend, 31-year-old Mevludin Kaljanac, now sits in the Dayton Cafe, covered with scars and hobbling to the cash register on an artificial leg, a replacement for the leg he lost in a battle for a hill near Sarajevo. Tapping  his prosthetic limb under the dim fluorescent light, Mr. Kaljanac said he was once a soccer player and judo expert, sports he played with Mr. Jovic as a boy.  But now, he said, people who left the city and then fired on its people are no longer welcome. **********\"I am not the President, so I can't decide who comes into the city,\" he said. \"He can come if he wants. But I think it's better if he just stays away.\" **********Where Mr. Jovic grew up, less than a mile from his post on the bridge, houses sit largely vacant due to shells and sniping from Grbavica, and his neighbors while away hours talking about close calls and the young dead. They recall Mr. Jovic as a good youth who one day abandoned them. They wonder if over the years  he fired some of those deadly shots into their midst or committed crimes in Grbavica. If he didn't, they know his compatriots did. **********\"I have lost a lot in this war,\" Mr. Kaljanac said. \"Look at me, I don't even have my leg. Sinisa was my best friend but I can't remember the good friendship  anymore. All things are different now.\" **********-------------------- **********Windows for Sarajevo **********GENEVA, Feb. 2 (Reuters) -- The United Nations refugee agency announced plans today to replace many of the window panes of Sarajevo and said it was increasingly hopeful that thousands of Serbs would choose to remain in their homes in the city. **********A spokesman for the group said it would replace about 70 percent of the windows smashed in more than three years of shelling and sniper fire. **********The agency will also be buying large amounts of concrete, timber and roofing  tiles to help displaced people elsewhere in Bosnia reclaim and repair their homes. **********The cost of the operation is put at $5 million, part of a $30 million emergency shelter program that the agency will present to donor governments in the coming days. **********When possible, the materials will be bought in Bosnia itself to help kick-start local industries, but the agency said the glass for Sarajevo will have to come from abroad. **********The vast majority of windows in Sarajevo have been replaced by plastic sheeting during 43 months of war. **********A spokesman for the agency, Ron Redmond, said the group welcomed the opening  to unrestricted foot traffic opened on Thursday of Sarajevo's Brotherhood and Unity Bridge, linking central Sarajevo with the Serb-held suburb of Grbavica. The bridge was a hotly contested passage during the war. **********The United Nations estimates that 12,000 Serbs have already packed up and left Sarajevo suburbs, which are due to come under the control of the Muslim-led Government by mid-March."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/31/business/memtec-of-australia-to-buy-gelman-sciences.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-08-31", "snippet": "Memtec Ltd, Australian filtration company, says that it agreed to buy Gelman Sciences Inc of Ann Arbor, Mich, for about $270 million in stock (S)", "word_count": 117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MEMTEC OF AUSTRALIA TO BUY GELMAN SCIENCES", "print_headline": "MEMTEC OF AUSTRALIA TO BUY GELMAN SCIENCES", "body_text": " **********Memtec Ltd., an Australian filtration company, said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Gelman Sciences Inc. for about $270 million in stock.

Kades, a lawyer who supervised the drafting of Japan's postwar Constitution, died on Tuesday in a hospital in Greenfield, Mass. He was 90 and had lived in Heath, Mass., since his retirement from law practice in New York in 1976. **********In a long and varied career, Mr. Kades, a native of Newburgh, N.Y., who graduated from Cornell and received his law degree from Harvard, tackled many complex problems. **********As a Government lawyer in Washington during the New Deal in the 1930's he worked as a counsel for the Public Works Administration, the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service. In private practice in New York in the 1950's, 60's and 70's, he specialized in tax, bond, banking, corporate and estate matters; became a senior partner of the firm of Hawkins, Delafield and Wood, and advised  Gov. Hugh L. Carey on the creation and operation of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the agency that supervised New York City's recovery from financial  crisis. **********Yet none of the cases he worked on and none of the deals he made had the impact of one whirlwind, a 10-day effort in February 1946 when Mr. Kades supervised the transformation of Japan from a monarchy into a modern democracy with full guarantees of equality. **********Under pressure from the occupying Allies, the Japanese Government had begun the process of revising the Meiji Constitution of 1881 late in 1945, but when details of the drafting committee's work leaked out on Feb. 1, 1946, and were seen to be no more than a light reworking of the old Constitution, there was an  immediate outcry. **********Although an American directive allowed him to order reforms \"only as a last resort,\" with the first postwar general election just two months away and with an 11-nation commission due to take over the issue of a constitution, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Allied Commander, intervened. **********He ordered his own 24-member Government Section staff to draft a constitution, and on Feb. 4, his aide, Brig. Gen. Courtney Whitney, convened a meeting and declared: \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a historic occasion. I now  proclaim you a constitutional assembly.\" **********Lieut. Col. Charles Kades, who had been in Japan since a week before Japan's  formal surrender the previous summer after taking part in the invasion of France in 1944 and serving on the War Department's General Staff, was put in charge of  the steering committee and told to produce a constitution by Feb. 12. **********Colonel Kades, a gentle leader who resolved a myriad of debates, worked night and day to accomplish his mission. **********The resulting document effectively stripped the Emperor of authority, established an elected government and guaranteed a range of civil rights, including full equality for women. **********On March 4, Colonel Kades presided over the negotiations with Japanese authorities that led to the adoption of the American draft, including the famous renunciation of war that Colonel Kades had composed himself from General MacArthur's notes. **********The Constitution took effect on May 3, 1947, and proved so popular and so effective in laying the groundwork for Japan's postwar re-emergence as an economic power that Mr. Kades, who was decorated by the Army for his work, also  became a lionized figure in Japan. **********Mr. Kades is survived by his third wife, Phyllis; a daughter from a previous  marriage, Caroline Foster-Bunch of Avalon, Australia; three stepchilren, Jewelle Bickford and William C.

The report, along with other data released today, suggested that an expected slowing of activity was eluding policy makers, rekindling financial markets' fears of higher interest rates. **********Growth in total output of goods and services for the April-June period was calculated at at an annual rate of 4.8, six-tenths of a percentage point above the estimate published at the beginning of the month and the strongest since the spring of 1994. Moreover, the upward revision showed less production going into inventories and more of it to meet demand. **********In a second report, the Government said sales of new single-family homes surged 7.8 percent in July, the most robust showing since February. This advance came despite mortgage rates that remain above 8 percent and, like the output figures, also surprised analysts, most of whom had expected a small decline in home sales. **********''The economy still has a good deal of momentum,'' said Brian M. Jones, an economist at Salomon Brothers. **********The unexpected strength rattled the bond market. Bond prices tumbled on revived fears that the Federal Reserve would not be able to avoid a decision to tighten monetary policy to prevent a flare-up of inflation. The next scheduled meeting of the Fed's main policy body is Sept. 24; minutes of its July meeting published last Friday showed it had decided to lean in the direction of raising short-term rates. **********The slump in prices drove up the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a benchmark for mortgages and other consumer and corporate interest rates -- to 7.03 percent, from 6.98 percent on Wednesday. Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions. **********Stocks followed bond prices lowers on fears that higher rates would raise borrowing costs and cut into profits. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 64.73 points, or 1.13 percent, to 5,647.65, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 8.85 points, or nearly eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,145.03. **********A third report, covering last week, showed today that first-time claims for unemployment insurance edged up 4,000, to a total of 331,000. This continued a recent pattern of job-market strength but closely matched expectations. Some analysts are predicting that the Labor Department's monthly gleaning of labor-market data, to be published Sept. 6, will show that the nation's unemployment fell in August to 5.2 percent, which would be the lowest in more than six years. **********The Clinton Administration, facing a Presidential challenge from Bob Dole, who has centered his campaign on calls for faster economic growth, was quick to hail the surprising, though not unusually large, upward revision in gross domestic product. **********Joseph E. Stiglitz, the President's chief economic adviser, declared the G.D.P. report ''strengthens our view that the United States economy is achieving the kind of strong economic growth that can raise America's living standards.'' He added that the downward revision of inventories combined with upward revisions for final sales and business investment in plant and equipment ''provide additional signs that the prospects for further strong economic growth in the future are excellent.'' **********By this he was pointing out that when shelves and warehouses are thinly stocked -- and much of the second-quarter increase was concentrated in motor vehicles -- demand is quickly transmitted to new production. **********The biggest single factor in the revision was international trade, which was less of a drag because import growth was lower than initially assumed. **********But the slowing of imports, as Merrill Lynch analysts noted today, is not a sign of economic strength. Nor is inventory buildup, however moderate. And the second-quarter growth rate also benefited, by about a percentage point, from the way the Government chose to account for last winter's partial shutdown of the Government, for which its workers were paid. **********For these and other reasons analysts seemed to be sticking today with forecasts for marked slowing in the third quarter, with Merrill Lynch holding to a 2 to 2 1/2 percent rate of increase. This is in line with assessments, including the Federal Reserve's, that the economy can grow that much without accelerating inflation. **********Still, after a string of figures pointing to a cooling off, perhaps partly because the Olympic Games kept many shoppers at home, some of the most recent figures cast doubt on this hope. One was last week's report of very strong orders for long-lived factory goods in July. Another was today's report from the Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development that builders sold single-family homes at an annual rate of 783,000 last month, up from 726,000 in June. **********''The housing market is stubbornly strong,'' said Alan D. Levenson, an economist at UBS Securities in New York. He nevertheless predicted that the economy would throttle down to a 2 percent pace in the current quarter and that the Fed would not need to move rates higher. **********The rise in home sales included sizable gains in all four regions of the country other than the Northeast, where activity remained at the best level of the year while showing no further rise. **********At month's end, builders had 365,000 unsold houses, 2,000 more than in June but only a 5.8-month  supply at the latest selling rate instead of 6.1 months. **********Sales have now surpassed 700,000 for seven consecutive months, the first time this has happened in 10 years, said Ed Yardeni, economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/C. J. Lawrence. Sales for April, May and June, however, were revised downward by a combined 70,000, the report also showed. **********The median sales price of new houses sold last month was $143,000, up from $140,000 in June and up from $131,000 in July 1995. **********The G.D.P. report disclosed that inflation, as gauged by the price index for gross domestic purchases, ran at a 2.1 percent pace in the spring quarter, one-tenth of a point higher than previously estimated. **********Corporate profits, estimated by the department for the first time, slackened during the quarter. Profits from current production advanced 1.3 percent following a 5.4 percent first-quarter increase, while current-production cash flow rose 1.1 percent, compared with a 2.5 percent advance in the winter quarter."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/15/business/meldrum-resigns-revco-account.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Levere", "pub_date": "1996-08-15", "snippet": "Meldrum & Fewsmith Communications resigns Revco Drug Stores advertising account after eight and half years; account, with billings estimated at $8 million to $10 million, has been placed in review (Advertising column) (S)", "word_count": 138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Meldrum Resigns Revco Account", "print_headline": "Meldrum Resigns Revco Account", "body_text": " **********Meldrum & Fewsmith Communications in Cleveland said yesterday that it had resigned the Revco Drug Stores account after eight and a half years.

Yeltsin's promise to root out corruption if re-elected, the retired general who heads Parliament's defense committee has accused some of Russia's highest-ranking generals of enriching themselves from the military budget. **********The charges, which have become the talk of Moscow, have rocked the military establishment. **********They are also shaping, and perhaps are being shaped by, the struggle to succeed the ousted Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, who has himself been implicated in the scandal. **********\"While soldiers are on a hunger ration, while officers wait to get a flat for more than 10 years and get no salaries for months, those close to the Defense Minister are literally living it up,\" said Lev Rokhlin, the defense committee chairman. **********Corruption is hardly a new phenomenon within the top ranks of the military. There have been persistent reports of opulent dachas, secret bank accounts and the sale of weapons for private gain, even as Russia's military budget has shrunk and its conscript army has been deprived of basic provisions. **********The problem of corruption, as well as the considerable risks in uncovering it, were brought into stark relief two years ago when Dmitri Kholodov, a 27-year-old reporter for the daily Moskovsky Komsomolets, was blown up by a booby-trapped suitcase. **********Mr. Kholodov had been investigating graft when Russian troops were stationed  in East Germany and asserted that two Mercedes sedans were purchased for General Grachev by selling army equipment. **********The newspaper took to calling the Defense Minister \"Pasha Mercedes.\" Nevertheless, during his years as Defense Minister, General Grachev and many of  his top aides were immune from serious legal challenges. **********But now that Mr. Yeltsin has dismissed General Grachev and appointed Aleksander I. Lebed, a retired general, as his national security adviser, General Grachev has suddenly become more vulnerable. **********The allegations are coming from Mr. Rokhlin, a political ally of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and also a retired general, who is well regarded within the Russian military. **********Mr. Rokhlin charged on Friday that General Grachev, his key aides and other high-ranking officers are \"mired in corruption.\" **********No sooner were the charges made than Parliament voted 301 to 0 to demand a legal investigation. **********The charges have also created a sensation in the Russian mass media, which originally disclosed some of the most damning allegations. **********Tonight, the independent television network NTV broadcast a report in which a camera crew and investigators from the prosecutor's office descended on a dacha  settlement. The broadcast showed army trucks carrying concrete and soldiers building the dachas, which the network said were for high-ranking officers from  the Strategic Rocket Forces and the Air Defense Forces. **********Mr. Rokhlin's report was far more specific. **********In a litany of charges was the accusation that Gen. Konstantin Kobets, a chief military inspector who is among the candidates to replace General Grachev, was part of a plot in which the military gave away a Government building to a construction company in exchange for officers' apartments that were never delivered. **********Mr. Rokhlin asserted that General Kobets's son was involved in the company, and charged that the general also urged the transfer of $12 million worth of aircraft engines to the company. **********At a news conference today, General Kobets denied that his son had any connection to the company and said that Mr. Rokhlin's charges were a politically motivated attempt to influence the selection of the new Defense Minister. **********But much of General Kobets's account of the tangled transactions appeared to  raise as many questions as they answered. **********In another charge, Mr. Rokhlin asserted that Col. Gen. Dmitri Kharchenko, whose daughter is married to General Grachev's son, pocketed the interest from a $5 million bank deposit of government funds. **********In the new Russia, many ousted officials tend to retain their privileges and  perks. But the allegations raise the possibility that former ranking officials may be prosecuted. **********And since corruption is believed to be widespread within the military and the Government, many are asking how far the anti-corruption drive will go. **********In Russia's conspiracy-minded capital, the timing of Mr. Rokhlin's report produced no shortage of speculation. **********General Grachev, who has protested his innocence, insisted that Mr. Rokhlin was nothing more than a stalking horse for Mr. Lebed. **********\"There is a simple reason for this,\" General Grachev told the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta. \"Lebed's supporters worked on him.\" **********Mr. Rokhlin has denied that he working on Mr. Lebed's behalf.

Mountain Dew says it is well on the way to a goal of enlisting 500,000 participants in a six-month promotion that will offer discounts and prizes from partners like Frito-Lay, Sony Music and Universal Studios. **********Children's advocates and advertising critics, however, are mounting protests  against the promotions. **********\"Technology is unleashing new creativity on the part of marketers who will stop at nothing to reach children,\" said Kathryn Montgomery, president of the Center for Media Education in Washington, a watchdog group that focuses on children. \"You may as well just wire them up to the advertiser so they can get a stream of ads.\" **********Mountain Dew, though, is very happy about what it views as a revolutionary way to track and measure consumer habits. \"This is the ultimate in one-on-one marketing,\" said Jon Harris, a spokesman for Pepsi in Somers, N.Y. \"No one has used this technology before. It's definitely a breakthrough.\" **********Indeed, Mountain Dew -- which has used spots about sky-surfing and bungee-jumping to appeal to consumers ages 12 to 24 -- contends the campaign fits its subversive brand personality. **********\"We need to communicate with them in a way that fits their life style,\" said  Janine Bousquette, vice president for marketing at Pepsi. \"Beepers are the mainstream communications tool of the 90's.

Get the Beeper . . .

Focus groups and quantitative testing confirmed the promotion's effectiveness in reaching the elusive youth market, he added. **********Which is exactly what critics fear. \"This is interactive child manipulation with access to reach the child wherever the child is,\" said Peggy Charren, founder of Action for Children's Television, an advocacy group. \"It's really sort of horrifying.\" **********Others, like Ms. Montgomery, say that soliciting information from youths through the Internet and pagers also raises privacy questions. **********\"We are calling for some rules about how you market to kids in the on-line world,\" she said. \"I don't think parents realize what's happening. It's an example of how the promise of cyberspace is being eclipsed by other interactive  devices.\" **********But Mountain Dew argues that its program is misunderstood. Mr. Burwick says youthful consumers are being instructed on \"proper beeper etiquette,\" and that no one will be paged during school hours. **********In fact, Mountain Dew discourages students from bringing pagers to school. **********Mountain Dew also says that research indicates that parents support the program because they can stay in touch with their children. **********\"We're not using the beepers as an intrusive device to advertise to consumers,\" Mr. Burwick said. \"We're allowing them to enter a world with a brand that fits their life style.\" **********Some critics also note that beepers are used by drug dealers. **********And Ms. Charren is gloomy about the future of interactive advertising. \"Pretty soon,\" she said, \"Milky Way bars are going to talk to you and say, 'Eat  me.' \""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/05/world/guatemalan-foes-renounce-use-of-arms-ending-35-year-war.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-12-05", "snippet": "Guatemalan Government and rebel leaders formally renounce use of arms, ending armed conflict that claimed more than 100,000 lives over 35 years (M)", "word_count": 550, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Guatemalan Foes Renounce Use of Arms, Ending 35-Year War", "print_headline": "Guatemalan Foes Renounce Use of Arms, Ending 35-Year War", "body_text": " **********The Guatemalan Government and rebel leaders formally renounced the use of arms today, ending an armed conflict that has claimed more than 100,000 lives over 35 years. **********In the ceremonial hall where the Guatemalan Mayan activist Rigoberta Menchu received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992, a top Guatemalan general and other members of the Government's peace commission joined leftist guerrilla leaders in signing a ''definitive cease-fire'' agreement. **********It was the first and most symbolically powerful of three pacts that the former combatants are scheduled to approve this month before signing an  overarching peace accord in Guatemala City on Dec. 29. **********The peace effort was shaken in the  fall when members of a guerrilla group admitted kidnapping and then  releasing the elderly wife of a cement magnate.

At times, they seem to be competing for inclusion on that master list, \"Useless WWW Pages\" (http://www.primus.com/ staff/paulp/useless.html), a brilliant anthology of Web  postings that Wired magazine has admiringly proclaimed a \"waste of electrons.\" It includes an all-purpose, useless, generic home page (www.math.grin.edu/ hamilton/generic.html) that seems suspiciously familiar, along with a home page  posted by God Himself (www.netstore.de/god) that suggests: \"To get a feeling of  eternity, just load a page from the World Wide Web.\" Steve Berlin, an editor of  the Useless Web site and a surfer for the search service Yahoo!, even has a relatively useless page himself: \"I often get asked,\" he writes, \" 'What is the  most useless Web site you know of?'

Only now, she says, \"they get to actually be in the revolution.\" **********These home pages are also, of course, all advertisements for the self, proclamations projected into the chaos of the net, confessions of idiosyncrasies, oddities, anything that supports the writer's claims for a homestead in electronic space. \"mememe\" is part of the URL, or electronic address, of one such home page. **********The image of the frontier has attached itself to the Internet and these pages seem to flourish the way personalities do on a frontier, portraying all sorts of ornate and eccentric quirks, unusual abilities and annoying habits. Anything is  possible; all is permitted, and everybody wants attention. Each page is an attempt to be part of the revolution while also insisting on the author's individuality. The authors fight the tide while they join in it; they mix iconoclasm with camaraderie. **********So in the best home pages, there is an air of complaint, a slightly bitter tone of a pioneer who has had it with urban life and wants to join the crowds on line. The writer John Buskin has captured the attitude in \"The Intergalactic Complaint Department\" for Prodigy (http://www.antares.prodigy.com/igroups). One  home page by Troels Eklund Andersen, a Danish student at Aalborg University, takes on the mainstream computer establishment in a bitterly mocking series of links, in \"The Official Anti-Microsoft Page\" (http:// www.hum.auc.dk/trekan/antims/ Anti-MShomepage.html). **********But it sometimes seems that the greatest number of home pages are created by  those citizens of cyberspace who, by age and disposition, feel as if they were caught between rebellion and community, demanding attention while trying to belong; their college rank -- sophomores -- even suggests an appropriate adjective for many of these pages. **********Some, like Chris Gouge, at Rice University, may even lay claim to a certain distinction. In a series of scientific experiments, chronicled on his home pages (http://www.rice.edu/gouge), he analyzed the physical attributes of Twinkies, subjecting them to electrical current, rapid oxidation and free fall, and meticulously describing the results.

The three-woman group based in Atlanta -- its music is a blend of rhythm and blues and hip-hop -- has  two \"multi-platinum\" albums and half a dozen top singles. So the music industry  was somewhat taken aback last year when the three women all filed for bankruptcy court protection, telling whoever would listen that they were \"broke.\" **********Their manager, Pebbitone Inc., and their record label, LaFace Records, do not believe it. Both have protested in court that the women are simply misusing Federal bankruptcy law to pressure them into renegotiating TLC's contract and to shortchange the people who helped create their glittering success. LaFace is a unit of Bertelsmann. **********Wherever the truth lies -- and barring a last-minute settlement, the court will ultimately decide that -- the TLC case has mesmerized the record industry.  Smaller independent labels fear that their hottest stars will see \"going broke\"  as a quick and efficient way to break their contracts. And partisans of young artists see a new way to give artists leverage at the bargaining table and redress what they feel is an imbalance of economic power in the industry. **********Whether by accident or design, bankruptcy filings recently have gone hand in  hand with contract renegotiations. In the last 18 months, at least two other hot groups have filed for bankruptcy amid bitter contract disputes and quickly emerged with better deals. But neither drew the attention that the TLC case has, perhaps because of the sheer scale of the group's success: Its first album, \"Ooooooohhh ... on the TLC tip,\" which came out in 1992, sold nearly three million copies and its second, \"Crazysexycool,\" has sold five million so far. **********\"The record industry is concerned about this case, because it has serious implications,\" said Dennis Hall, a bankruptcy lawyer in Atlanta who represents one large creditor in the case. If TLC gets a new deal, \"then anybody else who has a bad contract and hits it big might want to do the same thing,\" Mr. Hall said. **********David G. Bisbee, the lawyer for the singers, insisted that his clients filed  for bankruptcy solely because \"they cannot pay their bills,\" in part because their contract gives them so small a share of the rewards of their success. **********TLC's contract with Pebbitone gives the group 7 percent of the revenues from  the sale of the first 500,000 copies of the debut and second albums. That increases to 8 percent on sales over a million copies -- a \"platinum\" seller. Even if the group stays hot long enough to justify an eighth album -- a rarity in the genre -- the members' percentage increases to just 9.5 percent on sales of more than a million copies. The royalty range in the industry varies from TLC's rate at the low end to up to 13 percent at the high end. **********Mr. Bisbee agreed that record labels are alarmed about the case: \"I think their concern is that their stable of stars is going to hear about it, read about it, think about it and say, 'I may not be TLC, but I'm doing a whole lot better than they thought I would.' They are concerned about an onslaught of similar filings.' \" **********That certainly worries Bill Stephney, chairman of Stepsun Records, an independent label in New York. \"You literally can invest all your time, sweat equity and finances into an act or an artist,\" he said, \"only to find that they  can pretty much go on their own and declare bankruptcy to discharge their contract. Then, these contracts basically will have all the weight of a roll of  paper towels.\" **********But Michael Lehman, a Livingston, N.J., lawyer who has represented dozens of  entertainment figures in bankruptcy cases, countered that the record industry has an easy option for avoiding the pitfalls posed by the case: \"Offer the artists fairer contracts.\" **********The Math Apportioning The Costs **********Although giants dominate the record distribution channels, young start-up artists are more likely to be discovered by smaller independent labels, like Stepsun, LaFace Records and Cold Chillin' Records. And while big items like distribution costs are often shared with a larger partner -- LaFace has several  deals with Bertelsmann's Arista label -- much of what these small labels spend to nurture a new artist is money down the drain: most new artists do not take off, or they fizzle out after one or two modestly successful albums. **********To balance the financial risks they take in cultivating new artists, the recording labels fashion \"new kid\" contracts that are heavily lopsided in the company's favor -- too lopsided, in the view of the artists' lawyers. Among other things, the labels have the unilateral right to drop an artist at any time, but the artist has no freedom to walk away from a contract. **********At the height of his career in 1992, the pop star George Michael began an unsuccessful battle to persuade British courts to release him from his eight-album contract with Sony. But not until last year, months after the courts rejected his request, did he end his relationship with Sony after the Dreamworks SKG studio and Virgin Records bought out his contract for more than $40 million. **********For most artists, things do not turn out so well. The standard contract, for  example, allows the label to cancel the deal unilaterally at any time, but ties  the performer for the duration. And that can be a long time. TLC's contract with Pebbitone requires the group to make eight albums. Since albums are rarely produced more frequently than once every one to two years, the group could be tied to the contract for as long as 16 years. **********Even an artist whose first album \"goes gold\" -- that is, sells 500,000 copies -- can wind up working for as little as $12 an hour, said Wendy Day of the Rap Coalition, a Brooklyn-based organization that educates rap-music performers about industry basics. **********The arithmetic is simple and sobering for aspiring stars: The average wholesale price of compact disks and cassettes is about $8 a unit. Thus, an artist with a 12 percent royalty rate, which is typical, gets about 96 cents a unit, or $480,000 on a \"gold\" record. From that, the record label recoups a portion of its advances to the artist for recording costs, music video production, tour support, independent promotional efforts, limousine services and so forth -- often as much as $170,000. **********Half of the remaining $310,000 will go into a \"reserve\" account to cover any  unsold units that are returned by the stores. Thus, an artist's initial income from a gold record can be as little as $105,000, which may have to be shared among several group members. **********Still, record labels get few arguments from unknown artists, who are often young, unsophisticated and unwilling to look too closely at the fine print when  stardom beckons. If they hit the big time, however, industry insiders say it is  industry practice to revise the original terms to give the stars a better deal.  But that renegotiation process can often degenerate into creative and financial  disputes that drag on for months. **********It is at this stage that several solidly successful recording groups have found that the route to a fresh start is one that big American corporations have used for years to get out of contracts that were a burden on their operations: a Federal bankruptcy filing. **********The Law Can You Win By Losing? **********Section 365 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code allows the court to free debtors from burdensome or onerous contracts that impair their ability to make a fresh financial start, if the court deems it fair to do so. Thus, the LTV Corporation  was able to revise its pension obligations and The Daily News in New York was able to win new terms from its unions through the bankruptcy process. **********But to seek that escape hatch, a debtor must be insolvent under the terms of  the law, since the courts can toss out bankruptcy filings that are made for the  sole purpose of breaking a contract. **********Profile Records argued that was exactly the goal of three members of the rap  group RUN-DMC, who filed for bankruptcy in August 1993. But the performers insisted they were broke and asked the court to cancel their Profile contract. Within months, the group stepped out of court with a better contract. **********Similarly, by last spring, the five members of Silk, a rhythm and blues group, had been haggling for months with their label, Keia Records. On March 14, Silk's members filed for bankruptcy in Atlanta, and immediately asked to be freed of their Keia contract. On Oct. 11, the court approved a settlement that gave the group a new, more advantageous contract with Elektra Entertainment Group, a unit of Time Warner. **********And right now, Stepsun Records is in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Brooklyn, protesting a filing by Tarsha N. Jones, who performs on the Stepsun label under  the name missjones. That case is being negotiated, lawyers said, but Stepsun, too, has contended that the filing was made solely to force a better contract, a charge Ms. Jones denies. **********Why not just challenge bad contracts in civil court, where most business disputes are thrashed out? According to Mr. Lehman, who worked on both the Stepsun case and the RUN-DMC case, the bankruptcy courts are much faster than the civil courts. And while stars like Whitney Houston and Janet Jackson have shone brightly for a decade or more, for many other pop music stars fame has a short half-life. \"In civil court, you could be sitting there for three to four years waiting for your contract dispute to go forward, and meanwhile your career would be over,\" Mr. Lehman said. **********The Group Who's Who In TLC **********The three young singers at the center of this controversy are Tionne Watkins, known as T-Boz, who has a deep, gritty voice and tomboy demeanor; the volatile Ms. Lopes, whose nickname is Left-Eye, who used to sport a colorful wrapped condom in lieu of the left lens of her eyeglasses; and Rozonda Thomas, called Chilli, who projects a sultry grace. **********None of the three women returned telephone calls over the last two weeks seeking comment on recent events and on their rise to stardom. All three are from modest backgrounds, according to Contemporary Musicians, a record industry publication that profiled the stars last November. Ms. Lopes, 24, a self-taught musician, was raised in Philadelphia but moved to Atlanta at age 17. Ms. Watkins, 25, gravitated to Atlanta from Des Moines, and worked in beauty salons before turning to music. And Ms. Thomas, 24, is from Atlanta and studied  for a fashion industry career before shifting into hip-hop, the magazine reported. **********There had been an earlier version of the act without Ms. Thomas. Its current  incarnation, however, took shape in early 1991, when the trio signed with Pebbitone Inc., owned by Perri M. Reid, a recording artist in her own right, under the name Pebbles. At the time, Ms. Reid was married to Antonio (L. A.) Reid, a co-owner of LaFace Records, which signed TLC for its first albums. (The  Reids have since separated.) **********Their success was immediate. Their first album sold nearly three million copies with three major hits: \"Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg,\" \"What About Your Friends,\"  and \"Baby, Baby, Baby,\" all of which reached platinum status. After that, they popped up everywhere -- in a cameo for the film \"House Party 3,\" on the soundtrack for the Janet Jackson film \"Poetic Justice\" and on tours with the likes of MC Hammer and Bobby Brown. **********The group's second album, \"Crazysexycool,\" in 1994, was even hotter. Enthusiasm from radio stations and MTV produced a groundswell of sales that pushed the album to the No. 2 spot on Billboard's music chart for all of 1995. Four cuts from the album, including \"Waterfall,\" won spots on Billboard's Top 100 singles. **********Adding to the attention the group attracted was the volcanic personal life of Ms. Lopes, whose turbulent relationship with the professional football player Andre Rison hit the headlines in June 1994, when Mr. Rison's palatial home outside Atlanta burned to the ground. **********Clayton Farnham, a lawyer for Lloyd's of London, which carried the insurance  policy on the house, said that Ms. Lopes started the fire when she gathered Mr.  Rison's athletic shoe collection together and set it ablaze. Toxic fumes, he said, hampered the efforts to save the house. **********Ms. Lopes later pleaded guilty to one count of first-degree arson, and has been sued by Lloyd's. Ms. Lopes has denied that she intended to destroy the house and is disputing Lloyd's efforts to recover $1.3 million from her. **********Despite their obvious success, the women of TLC have spent money more like yuppies than like stars. They shopped at Rich's and the Limited, ordered jewelry from Zale's and bought Jeeps and BMW's, according to the list of debts each included with their personal bankruptcy filings. **********But when they filed for bankruptcy protection in July, each woman listed debts far in excess of her assets. Ms. Lopes's largest debt was the $1.3 million being sought by Lloyd's, which the insurer insists cannot be erased through a bankruptcy filing. Aside from that, the largest debts were owed to Pebbitone and LaFace Records -- both of which deny that they are owed any money at all. **********Mr. Bisbee, the lawyer for Ms. Watkins, Ms. Lopes and Ms. Thomas, insisted that his clients met the legal test for seeking bankruptcy protection. \"Sure we  all have the ability to deliberately incur more debt than we are able to repay,\" he said. \"But simply because an artist files should not lead to an automatic inference that that's what they did. That certainly is not what occurred in this instance.\" **********But Pebbitone and LaFace Records insist that the women have exaggerated their debts and understated their assets so that they can use the bankruptcy process to break their contract. **********Kenneth L. Kraus, a Nashville entertainment lawyer on the legal team opposing the bankruptcy, said the trio is facing at worst \"a cash-flow problem.\" At least $2.2 million in royalties is \"in the system\" on its way to the group, he said. \"We offered to give them substantial advances against that payment and they declined that; we offered to renegotiate and they refused that,\" he continued. \"I think they wanted to be bankrupt because they think they can get out of their contract on the basis of bankruptcy.\" **********Mr. Bisbee acknowledged that there is some dispute about some of his clients' debts, but he insisted their filing is valid. He added, \"I know the record company would like to paint the picture that 'nobody pressured anybody,' but that isn't what the facts will show.\" **********The Future What's Fair, And Who Pays? **********Federal Bankruptcy Judge Stacey W. Cotton ordered a trial, to start next Monday, to sort out who owes what to whom, but also urged the parties to bring in a professional mediator to seek a settlement. That mediation conference, scheduled for this past weekend, was called off because of an ice storm in the Southeast, and rescheduled for this Saturday. **********But the larger issue the TLC case raises for the recording industry will not  be settled, even if the case itself is. Indeed, a speedy settlement that produced a new, more generous contract for TLC would simply prove the point that bankruptcy court can be an attractive venue for hot stars who want a speedy route to a better contract. **********Mr. Lehman, the New Jersey lawyer who has handled dozens of bankruptcies for  entertainment figures, said in a recent interview that he thought the record industry was now \"fully aware of the fact that the future bankruptcies may be not the failed debut artists but their hottest and biggest stars.\" **********But the way to avoid that outcome, added Mr. Bisbee, was to be sure that a hot star shared in the record company's success. \"It is just a matter of being fair to the artist,\" he said. \"Record companies have to keep in mind that, without artists, they don't have anything.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/27/business/micron-delays-chip-factory.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 161, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Micron Delays Chip Factory", "print_headline": "Micron Delays Chip Factory", "body_text": " **********Micron Technology Inc. said late today that it would delay completion of a $2.5 billion computer chip factory in Lehi, Utah, until market conditions improve. **********The company said it would finish exterior work on the plant but delay equipping it for production.

In military trials, defendants are normally not allowed to cross-examine witnesses, challenge evidence or call witnesses in their defense. Most of the judges in the trials are senior military officers who lack training in the law. **********Thousands of Peruvians have been detained under the system, which allows the  police to arrest anyone they suspect of terrorism, and hundreds of people have been judged and sentenced to life imprisonment. In 1994, the military courts had a 97 percent conviction rate, according to Peruvian nongovernmental and human rights organizations. Human rights groups have documented hundreds of cases of detainees who were later found to be not guilty on appeal, and the case of Ms. Berenson has brought international attention to the military trials of civilians here. **********\"The military courts of Peru violate every principle of due process of the law and are not concerned with truth or justice and are an instrument of oppression,\" said Ramsey Clark, Attorney General in the Johnson Administration,  who has been retained by Ms. Berenson's family to represent her. \"They convict whomever they choose to convict.\" **********In October, leaders of Peru's Catholic and evangelical churches said at least 700 people had been jailed on false charges of terrorism and began holding public prayer meetings to show solidarity with those detained. **********In a recent interview, Peru's Justice Minister, Fernando Vega Santa Gadea acknowledged that there were \"problems\" with his Government's system of \"faceless\" judges but said it was \"a necessity in the fight against terrorism.\" **********More than 30,000 people have been killed since the Shining Path guerrilla movement and other rebel groups took up arms in 1980, but while the violence has sharply declined after the capture of top guerrilla leaders, the Government still sees the groups as a significant threat. **********Mr. Vega said the Government was seeking congressional approval for a judicial commission that would expedite appeals for people who have been convicted of terrorism but whose cases appear to be unfairly adjudicated.

Normal church gave me nothing, just boring and long divine services.'' **********Quentin Schultze, author of a monthly newsletter called the Internet for Christians and a professor of communications at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich., said that while the better-known evangelical churches tended to stick to more familiar technologies like television, smaller groups found their way onto the Internet first and in greater numbers. **********''The small and conservative evangelical groups -- let's call them fundamentalists -- are often seen as backward technologically and culturally, but when you look closely, you see that they're the leaders on the Web,'' Professor Schultze said. **********And Mark Kellner, author of ''God on the Internet'' (IDG Books, 1996), a profile of the religious groups that have gone on line, agreed that although the mainstream denominations were bountiful on line, the greater aggressiveness of the smaller evangelical groups continued a trend in American religion. **********''The smaller evangelical groups were the first to get on line,'' Mr. Kellner said. '' But they have to be more aggressive than large denominations like Episcopalians and Methodists, which already have large numbers.'' **********Mr. Finnan has evangelized on the Internet for more than 16 months, but Trinity Broadcasting Network, a large television evangelical conglomerate based in Dallas, opened its Web site only seven months ago. Like Mr. Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network, Trinity's site focuses more on providing supplements to television -- program listings, requests for donations and catalogues of gift items -- than on evangelizing. **********''Their sites have been designed to cultivate existing audiences,'' Professor Schultze said. **********The director of new media for Mr.  Robertson's network, Thom Dennis, said it had 157 people assigned to its television productions and ''probably has 4 or 5 people devoted to our Internet project.'' The site, he added, ''will evolve into being another presentation for 'The 700 Club,' '' Mr. Robertson's television program. **********On the other hand, visitors to an Internet upstart, Gospel Communications Network in Muskegon, Mich., can browse through topics ranging from Our Daily Bread to the Bible Gateway. Among the headings on its home page are ''weariness'' and ''loneliness,'' which draw visitors into a conversation with a minister devoted to counseling and, ultimately, converting. **********''We are taking our message right into where people are in their everyday lives, but it's at their convenience,'' Gospel Communications's director of marketing, Duane Smith, said. ''You can interact with us in the office; you don't have to turn on a Sunday morning program every week.'' **********The religious experience on line, according to some congregants who prefer a keyboard and monitor to microphones and mass gatherings, replicates the confidentiality of the Catholic confessional while eschewing its authoritarian air. Anonymity, above all else, seems to be at the core of the Internet's appeal. **********Among the Gospel Communications Network faithful is Anne Walters of San Mateo, Calif., a 25-year-old pharmacology assistant who discovered it while browsing. **********''One day at the biotech company where I work, I found G.C.N. on the net,'' she said. ''Every morning I read the daily devotionals. G.C.N. provides guidance on a daily basis, not just on Sundays.'' **********Observers like Professor Schultze and Mr. Kellner say such conversions are plentiful on line. **********''The Internet is strangely personal,'' Professor Schultze said. ''Interaction is much quicker and seemingly more spontaneous than with radio or TV. This is ripe for evangelism.'' **********Other observers, however, are concerned that the technology providing such a personal touch can also be used to put the touch on a vast and unsuspecting audience. **********Ole Anthony, the director of the Trinity Foundation, a watchdog group in Dallas that in 1991 exposed financial abuses that led to the downfall of Robert Tilton's ministry, said he was keeping his eye on several sites, noting that the Internet ''opens up very disturbing opportunities for money-hungry churches.'' **********One difference between television and the Internet that reassures experts is the room for freelance, self-appointed policemen on the Internet. Just as any pastor can put up a home page, any skeptic can post one calling into question the pastor's claims. **********Kenneth Smith, a lawyer in Golden, Colo., has set up a home page that monitors the home page of Bob Larson Ministries. Mr. Smith's page lists Mr. Larson's financial statements obtained from court records and even gives the mailing address for Mr. Larson's $1.25 million mansion in Vail Valley, Colo., as well as a glossy photo of it and directions to it. **********Mr. Larson did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment on Mr. Smith's home page and Mr. Larson's ministries. **********Professor Schultze said such policing was healthy, and he predicted that such digital democracy would  have sizable effects on American religion. **********''With so much room for dissidents and splinter groups within large mainstream denominations,'' he said, ''people with similar concerns and desires for rebuilding communities are reorganizing themselves religiously. **********''One of the things people accuse Web users of is that they don't 'have a life,' '' Professor Schultze added. ''In fact, these people do have very deep-seated spiritual needs.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/14/business/company-news-archer-daniels-in-joint-venture-with-rhone-poulenc.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;ARCHER-DANIELS IN JOINT VENTURE WITH RHONE-POULENC", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;ARCHER-DANIELS IN JOINT VENTURE WITH RHONE-POULENC", "body_text": " **********The Archer-Daniels-Midland Company said yesterday that it would form a joint  venture with Rhone-Poulenc S.A.'s animal nutrition unit to market pre-mixes for  animal feed.

He was 75. **********The cause was a heart attack, his son said. **********Mr. Bokassa's sometimes brutal 14-year rule, including two years as his country's self-proclaimed Emperor, ended in 1979 when French paratroopers overthrew his Government while Mr. Bokassa was on an official trip to Libya. **********France justified its intervention in the Central African Republic by citing stories of Mr. Bokassa's supposed cannibalism of imprisoned schoolchildren. In 1986, Mr. Bokassa, who was living in exile in the Ivory Coast, returned home to face charges against him that included murder and treason. **********The allegations of cannibalism were never proven, but the onetime President for Life and Emperor was sentenced to death for assassinations, concealing corpses and embezzlement. He served seven years in prison before he was finally pardoned by a successor, Andre Kolingba, in an attempt at national reconciliation. **********From the coup in 1965 that brought him to power until his overthrow, imprisonment and last years back home in the Central African capital, the story of Mr. Bokassa, a distinguished veteran of the French war in Indochina, closely mirrored the ups and downs of France's deep involvement in the politics of its former African colonies. **********As commander of the army and Defense Minister, Mr. Bokassa, then a colonel, was plucked by France to overthrow the Central African Republic's first President, his cousin David Dacko, when Mr. Dacko began establishing close ties with China. Mr. Bokassa's legendary devotion to France and fierce anti-Communism made him the perfect candidate in Paris's view to replace Mr. Dacko. **********Within days of taking power, Mr. Bokassa broke off relations with Beijing, expelling a large delegation of Chinese advisers. At the same time, showing the lust for titles and power that would lead him 12 years later to proclaim himself Emperor, Mr. Bokassa took on the titles of President, Prime Minister, Commander in Chief of the army and leader of the sole political party. **********Even as his behavior grew increasingly erratic, Mr. Bokassa maintained warm relations with France for several years. Valery Giscard d'Estaing, then the French President, was a frequent visitor to the Central African Republic, where he and Mr. Bokassa enjoyed big-game hunting together. **********Paris congratulated Mr. Bokassa when he decided that his republic should be known as an empire, and the French Government helped finance some of the estimated $30 million cost of Mr. Bokassa's lavish coronation in 1977, which was consciously patterned after Napoleon's coronation. **********But eventually, a combination of increasingly frequent bids for independence in foreign affairs by Mr. Bokassa and a growing opposition to the Emperor's extravagance at home led France to conclude that he must go. **********In September 1979, in one of the first actions of its type in Africa in which foreign troops were used to overthrow a leader in power, 700 French paratroopers took control of Bangui while Mr. Bokassa was in Libya. **********Citing the growing repressiveness of his rule, and the reports of cannibalism, France installed Mr. Dacko, whom it had prompted Mr. Bokassa to overthrow 14 years earlier, as President. **********The charges of cannibalism got their start in an article published in Paris-Match magazine that included photographs purporting to show a refrigerator in which the Central African leader kept the bodies of schoolchildren who had been arrested and beaten to death. They had protested having to wear uniforms made from a cloth sold by a business run by the Emperor's wife. **********The Government's violent crackdown on student demonstrations shocked public opinion at home and in France, and ultimately led to Mr. Bokassa's overthrow by French troops. But when he was tried years later on treason and murder counts, Mr. Bokassa was acquitted of all charges related to the killing. **********Mr. Bokassa remained serene throughout a long interview at his home this year, except when asked about the cannibalism story, which he angrily insisted had been planted in the French press by a photographer who was close to President Giscard d'Estaing. **********''That was not my refrigerator,'' he said of the appliance that appeared in the Paris-Match photos. ''What they showed was the freezer from the morgue, which you can see for yourself. It is still there.'' **********Though Paris had successfully removed a leader who had proven himself a nuisance with minimal opposition from other African countries, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing's closeness with Mr. Bokassa would come back to haunt him. **********From exile in the Ivory Coast, where he settled after France refused to allow him entry, an embittered Mr. Bokassa began writing about his long and deep ties with the French. The autobiographical writings, published under the title ''My Truth,'' included details of gifts of diamonds that Mr. Bokassa is said to have frequently made to Mr. Giscard d'Estaing. **********Although the book was banned in France, the disclosures are widely believed to have helped doom Mr. Giscard d'Estaing's 1981 re-election bid against his Socialist rival, Francois Mitterrand. **********After returning home to face the charges against him, and serving time in prison, Mr. Bokassa continued to harbor bitter feelings against France, which he said he had served for more than 20 years but which still refused to open its doors to him. **********Mr. Bokassa was applauded by many Central Africans for condemning France when it intervened yet again in the Central African Republic this May to put down an army mutiny . **********''Every time we have a problem, the French have to come and meddle,'' he said at the time. ''Finally, you have to ask yourself, are we independent, or are we not?'' **********Jean-Bedel Bokassa was born on Feb. 22, 1921, at Boubangui, Central African Republic. One of 12 children, he was born to a family of local chiefs that was prominent in Lobaye Province. **********When he was 6, his father, Mindogon Mgboundoulou, was slain at the local prefect's office in a dispute that the future leader later insisted centered on an argument with French administrators in favor of greater rights for native Central Africans. His mother, Marie Yokowo, committed suicide soon afterward. **********Mr. Bokassa was educated in Roman Catholic missionary schools in Bangui and Brazzaville and initially planned to study for the priesthood. But when World War II began in 1939, he joined the French Army as a private. **********In 1940, the young soldier took part in the campaign at Brazzaville that led to the capture of the Vichy governor for the region and the establishment of the Free French Government there. **********Ten years later, Mr. Bokassa, by then a company sergeant, fought with valor in Indochina, where he survived the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu. His dozen decorations, which he proudly showed to visitors almost until his death, included the Croix de Guerre and membership in the Legion of Honor. At his death, Mr. Bokassa's only income was his French captain's pension, paid quarterly at the French Embassy in Bangui. **********Toward the end of his life, Mr. Bokassa returned to the intense religion of his youth, praying several times a day with a well-thumbed Bible. The former Emperor, long known for his high living, told a recent visitor that he had renounced alcohol and sexual relations for several years. **********Mr. Bokassa, who married several times, is survived by as many as 60 children. **********The Government announced today that Mr. Bokassa, who had enjoyed something of a return to popularity as a nationalist icon in recent years, would be given a state funeral."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/technology-connections-in-this-new-game-you-ll-never-play-with-a-full-deck.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Rothstein", "pub_date": "1996-02-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 754, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TECHNOLOGY: CONNECTIONS;In this new game, you'll never play with a full deck.", "print_headline": "TECHNOLOGY: CONNECTIONS;In this new game, you'll never play with a full deck.", "body_text": " **********SOMETIME next month a game will be played on the Internet, challenging surfers to leap between sites, solving puzzles and cracking codes that will give them access to secret data hidden behind firewalls and software barriers. The point of the contest will not be to declare a champion hacker (though some prizes will be awarded), but to beat the publicity drums for a new game called Netrunner. **********The game, which was demonstrated last week at the Toy Fair in New York, is set in the \"dark techno-future\" in which \"ruthless corporations scheme to accomplish secret agendas as they build elaborate fortresses of data.\" In opposition to such plots, \"anarchistic netrunners hack the system, infiltrating  data forts to liberate information.\" But this game of road-warrior libertarianism and cyberpunk paranoia will actually have nothing to do with data forts or hackers, nor will it require 64-bit chips and hand-held controllers. Netrunner is a card game. **********It is joining a genre that developed out of the extraordinary success of Magic: The Gathering, which, like Netrunner, was created by Richard Garfield and manufactured by Wizards of the Coast. Since its introduction in August 1993, Magic has inspired a cult among teen-agers and a surprising number of adults who have collected its cards, with their mythic images, cryptic instructions and literary quotations. **********And while Magic flourishes in high school cafeterias, comic store back rooms  and even on the occasional bridge table, it has found a particularly comfortable home in the technological realm. There are at least a hundred Web sites devoted  to the game and Usenet groups proliferate, complete with strategy hints, card trading proposals and news announcements. Wizards of the Coast now has offices in Seattle, Glasgow, Paris and Antwerp, Belgium. More than a billion Magic cards have been sold. **********In fact, the \"elaborate fortresses of data\" constructed by Wizards of the Coast have led to a new genre of collectible card games. Other games of similar  character include Middle Earth (based on Tolkien's novels), Illuminati (based on political conspiracy theories), Overpower (based on Marvel's comics), along with Rage, Star Trek and Star Wars. According to the Game Manufacturers' Association, the genre generated $280 million of business in 1994 and has continued to grow.  Yesterday the first international Magic tournament, in which hundreds of players competed, came to an end in the Puck Building in Manhattan. **********These card games, like Netrunner, also bear an intriguing relationship to technological game play. The effect can be read in Internet newsgroups where the often obscure Magic dialect is spoken. A law student seeks a Web server so he can offer an advice page on Magic strategy. A serious competitor asks whether foreign language cards should be banned from tournaments. \"If the opponent controls no land,\" goes one technical query, \"can you still tap a Felwar Stone for colorless mana?\" \"Does anyone out there have a Baron Sengir for trade?\" another message asks. **********This specialized language, the detail, the intensity of the interest, give some feel for the kind of social and strategic world Magic creates. Mr. Garfield constructed a universe possessing more subtleties than he could envision. He wanted serious players to be led into conversation, studying, collecting -- forming new communities and cultures. **********When inventing the game Mr. Garfield also applied his doctoral training in combinatorial mathematics -- a field that studies the interaction of objects in  complex systems. In Magic, each deck of 40 to 60 cards is just a small slice of  a dominion composed of thousands of cards, each with its own artwork (ranging from clever to kitsch) and instructions detailing the cards' powers and influences on other cards. New cards are always being introduced, giving the sense of an evolving universe. **********Each player's deck is actually a construction, a combination of forces and resources that create a persona. Collecting cards is partly a strategic activity, allowing for versatility and innovation, but also an obsession, encouraging many an under-the-counter request for trades or single-card purchases. There is even a stock market report for collectible card games -- Scrye magazine -- that publishes the range of prices paid for individual cards. **********It is no accident that such strategies and interactions have found a home in  cyberspace.

No one was hit and Mr. Hamilton made his way inside. **********\"Several people saw him, but I don't think they had the opportunity to challenge him,\" Officer Munn said. **********The shootings took a matter of minutes. The gunman entered the first-floor auditorium where children from Primary 1 -- equivalent to an American kindergarten or first grade -- were in gym class, and began to fire. He apparently shot the children even as they ran from him in panic. **********\"The bodies were all found in the same vicinity -- close together,\" Officer Munn said. Ambulance workers told the police that after shooting the children and the teacher, Gwenne Mayor, Mr. Hamilton shot himself in the head. **********The police received an emergency call at 9:38 A.M., and rescue workers later  said they arrived to a scene of unspeakable horror. **********\"It was a like a scene out of a medieval torture chamber,\" John McEwan, who coordinated the rescue operation, told The Scottish Daily Record. \"There were literally piles of dead bodies, most of them just little kids. Blood was splattered all over the floor and walls and there was literally blood everywhere.\" **********Pat Greenhill, a town official, said emergency workers were devastated by what they found. \"The policemen had seen nothing like that before,\" she said, \"having to go into that gymnasium and see all those little children lying there.\" **********Meanwhile rumors that something terrible had happened were spreading fast around the ancient cathedral town, where life is centered on one main street, the enormous Dunblane Cathedral at its top, and the Allenwater River, which cuts Dunblane in two. **********It is impossible, residents say, not to be personally touched by the shooting through relatives, friends or neighbors. **********\"It's been a horrible day,\" said a woman working behind the cash register at  Nicolson's Pharmacy, where the talk from lunchtime on was of nothing but the shootings. \"And it affects everyone here.\" **********The attack focused immediate attention on handgun legislation and school security in a country where most police officers do not even carry guns, and where most schools are more concerned about budget cuts than about violence. **********But at a news conference this evening, Officer Munn said that as horrific as  the incident was, it appeared to have been \"totally random\" and without explanation. **********\"At the moment we are unaware of any motive,\" Officer Munn said. **********But it later emerged that Mr. Hamilton, the gunman, had a long history of working with children -- and generating complaints from parents who found his behavior odd and \"improper.\" **********In recent years, Mr. Hamilton led several local boys' clubs. In 1973 he was made a Boy Scout leader in Stirling, the Scout Association said. But in 1974 he  was asked to resign \"following complaints about unstable and possibly improper behavior,\" a spokesman for the group told The Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency. **********\"Since then, he has made a number of attempts to get back into scouting,\" the spokesman said, \"but has never been accepted.\" **********In a nation where most guns are in the hands of inner-city criminals and country sportsmen, today's incident stirred immediate memories of a similar one  in Berkshire, England, in which a gunman in Hungerford used an arsenal of weapons to kill 14 people before killing himself. That incident, in 1987, led to a law banning the use of automatic weapons and requiring permits for any guns taken off the premises of authorized gun clubs. **********Mr. Hamilton was a member of several local gun clubs and appeared to have permits for some of his weapons, Officer Munn said. **********Reaction to today's incident was swift. Prime Minister John Major said the shootings were a \"sick and evil act that almost passes belief.\" And some teachers' groups began calling for better security at schools by, for example, insuring that each school has only one central entrance. **********There were 31 children in the affected Primary 1 section, and only one who was in class today escaped without harm. Two were home sick. **********Tim Campbell, an engineer in Dunblane whose 6-year-old daughter attends Primary 2 at Dunblane, said in an interview that he knew something had happened  when his assistant, who has three children at the school, answered the telephone and turned ashen. **********\" 'Something's happened at the school' \" he said she told him. \" 'Someone's been shot.' \" **********With that, they closed their office and rushed down to the school, but found  it already cordoned off. They were directed to the lobby of a nearby hotel, Mr.  Campbell said, where they joined a growing crowd of parents desperate to find out what had happened. **********\"Eventually they told us if we had a child in Primary 1 to go to one place, and everyone else go to another,\" Mr. Campbell said, describing his almost triumphal relief when he realized that his daughter was not a victim. He said his relief turned to immediate grief for the other children. **********Two of the most critically wounded children were taken by helicopter to hospitals in Glasgow, while the rest went by ambulance to Stirling Royal Hospital, where they were treated for gunshot wounds to the stomach, chest and limbs. **********Witnesses said doctors and nurses, some of whom had children at the school, were crying in the hallways as the children arrived. **********By evening, Dunblane had fallen eerily quiet. The police were still concluding interviews with children, teachers and parents in an attempt to piece together the exact sequence of events. **********And in the center of town, the Rev.

But shortly after the meeting tonight, Mr. Arafat telephoned Mr. Netanyahu and the two spoke for about 10 minutes, according to Mr. Bar-Illan. **********He said Mr. Arafat for the first time had expressed regret at the fatal shooting of a Jewish settler and her son last Wednesday and said he would do his best to prevent any more such attacks. Mr. Netanyahu, for his part, expressed his sorrow at the death of a Palestinian laborer who was shot by an Israeli who said he mistook him for a burglar. **********''The Prime Minister wanted to make clear that he was committed to the continuation of the peace process, and that he felt the responsibility lay on his and Arafat's shoulders to bring peace, and that he was sure they could do it,'' Mr. Bar-Illan said.

The status, intended for depressed areas, was taken away from the settlements by the former Labor Government in 1992. **********Though the decision did not include any actual expansion of the settlements, it brought immediate criticism from Western governments, and dire warnings of confrontation from the Palestinians.

''Don't they understand where they are dragging the region? In the end, it will be impossible to stop the downward flight. After the dead are laid to rest, we will be standing in the same place. What is the wisdom of this inflexibility?'' **********Mr. Netanyahu responded with his own volley of statements and interviews, arguing that the subsidy decision was not a violation of the agreements signed by the previous government and that the action did not include the establishment of new settlements. **********As he has often done when his actions have come under fire, Mr. Netanyahu sought to portray himself as defending an Israel from the perpetual assault of a hostile world. **********''I'd like to remind you that for a hundred years of Zionist settlement there was always international resistance to settlement,'' he said over Army Radio. ''The reason the settlements were successful is because we were able to overcome this resistance. If you give in at Beit El or somewhere else where pressure is exerted through terror, do you really think it will end there? We are under an attack aimed at us all.'' **********Mr. Netanyahu also charged that ''senior officials on the Palestinian side have been planning for weeks a wave of violence because they don't want to continue the process.'' **********''What nonsense,'' Mr. Arafat replied in his interview. ''What would we gain from this? The talk about the option of igniting the territories by us is cheap propaganda, behind which lurk dirty intentions.'' **********The verbal jousting contributed to a sense that relations between the sides were spinning out of control, with each seeking to shift blame onto the other for any violence that might ensue. **********Though the Government's decision on Friday was intended in part to placate settlers after the shooting of the woman and her son, settler leaders declared that the economic incentives were not enough, and continued to clamor for new settlements in meetings today with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai. **********A tight Israeli cordon around the Palestinian-controlled city of Ramallah, erected after the shootings, was further tightened today, raising loud complaints from residents. **********The Palestinian police reportedly rounded up several suspects in the shooting, which the Marxist faction known as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said it had carried out. Palestinian officials continued to insist that Palestinians would not be extradited to Israel, but there were reports that they would forward photographs to the Israelis to help identify the attackers. **********The rise in tensions dominated Israeli and Palestinian news media. **********''The new situation created by the Government decision on Friday leads us toward a moment of truth, to an hour of unavoidable confrontation,'' wrote Yaakov Erez in a front-page analysis in the daily Maariv. ''A minute before midnight, Benjamin Netanyahu must put a halt to this downward spiral.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/02/business/spending-it-thoroughbreds-aren-t-just-the-sport-of-kings.html": {"writer_name": "Carol Cropper", "pub_date": "1996-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1386, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SPENDING IT;Thoroughbreds Aren't Just the Sport of Kings", "print_headline": "SPENDING IT;Thoroughbreds Aren't Just the Sport of Kings", "body_text": " **********WHAT do M. C. Hammer, the rap star, and Queen Elizabeth have in common? **********Both have owned thoroughbred race horses. In fact, a horse owned by Mr. Hammer finished third in the Kentucky Derby four years ago. **********Which goes to show that in America, you don't have to have a kingdom for a horse. Just cash. **********Almost 8,000 thoroughbred yearlings, or year-old horses, went on the auction  block last year in the United States and Canada. The most expensive, a filly sired by Mr. Prospector -- one of the sport's leading stallions for more than a  decade -- sold for $1.25 million. That was down from the record $13.1 million fetched by Seattle Dancer, a colt sired by Nijinsky II, at a 1985 auction. But those were the giddy days when Arab sheiks went head to head with British millionaires and American industrial titans, and there seemed no limit to what a horse might bring. In fact, though, the early 1980's was the precipice for an eight-year-long free fall that plummeted stalwarts like Calumet and Spendthrift  farms into bankruptcy. **********\"The industry went through a long and painful correction,\" said David Heckerman, senior editor of The Blood-Horse, a publication that follows thoroughbred prices. But now, he said, \"Demand and prices are up.\" The average paid for a yearling has risen 35 percent over the last three years. **********The Maktoum brothers, of the ruling family of Dubai, are buying less. But they have been replaced by people like Michael Tabor of Monte Carlo; Robert Lewis, an American distributor of Budweiser, and Katsumi Yoshida, a Japanese horseman. Such buyers tend to be at the high end. It was Mr. Tabor and a partner, for example, who paid $1.25 million for the Mr. Prospector filly. **********Doctors, lawyers, dentists and stockbrokers have been known to buy thoroughbreds, too. In 1995, the average yearling sold for a mere $30,801, according to The Blood-Horse. At Keeneland, the track in Lexington, Ky., that is host to some of the world's top sales, yearlings could be had for less than $1,000. **********Even for the expensive horses, all it takes is money and a willingness to raise your hand, said Jim Williams, the director of publicity at Keeneland. The  track asks you to fill out a form in advance, showing you have the wherewithal to pay for the horse. **********Many small investors were scared away by the industry bust of the late 1980's, and by a 1986 tax-law change that made it more difficult for passive investors to write off losses. The average price of a young thoroughbred peaked  in 1984 at $41,396, then slid in six of the next eight years. **********But even in bad times, there are always horse-owning celebrities to watch --  whether yesteryear's Fred Astaire and Louis B. Mayer, or Mr. Hammer and George Steinbrenner today. **********And it is still terrific fun, say the people who play. \"You might be frustrated,\" said Juliette Combs Trapp, daughter of the man who built, then lost, Spendthrift Farm. \"You might be upset. But you'll never be bored.  It's a  very exciting way of life.\" **********The best chance to buy a pricey thoroughbred comes in July, when Keeneland holds its select yearling sale. Last year, the average yearling sold there for $242,361 -- almost eight times the industry average. **********The Saratoga sale follows in New York in August, where thoroughbreds sell for a bit less. Last summer, the average price was $128,097. **********Then, in September, Keeneland is host for the largest of all yearling sales -- with horses for just about everyone. Last fall, almost 3,000 yearlings -- 37.5 percent of the entire crop auctioned in 1995 -- sold there for $130.1 million. The highest price was $1.2 million, but there were colts for $500, too. **********Other, smaller auctions of yearlings are scattered around the country. **********Of course, horses aren't just sold at one year old. Experts buy younger horses, called weanlings, and then resell them at a profit as yearlings. Some buyers, increasingly the Japanese, like to wait for the auctions of two-year-olds, which have already been trained and are ready to run. **********THOSE who want to play in the more predictable arena of breeding buy broodmares and stallions, or interests therein, once the horses' racing days are over. **********And there are partnerships for horse enthusiasts who would like to buy small  interests in one or several horses and do not mind paying someone else to handle the details. Centennial Farms of Boston and Dogwood Stable of Aiken, S.C., are two of the best-known sellers of partnerships. Buying in costs $11,000 to $77,000. **********But the most common starting gate for novices is the yearling auction, said Ric Waldman, an industry consultant who is also stallion manager at the Lexington farm owned by W. T. Young, breeder of this year's Kentucky Derby winner, Grindstone. **********The yearling sales are the place to go for \"that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow,\" Mr. Waldman said. The fantasy may be particularly powerful right now, with the Belmont Stakes, the third leg of the Triple Crown, approaching this Saturday. A buyer lucky enough to spot a Triple Crown winner at an auction  can make a fortune -- or lose one if he or she is wrong. **********Many horse-racing fans know of Canonero II, the colt bought at Keeneland for  $1,200 that went on to win the 1971 Kentucky Derby. And of John Henry, purchased for $1,100 in 1976, with lifetime track earnings of $6.6 million. **********But what a newcomer may not hear is the tale of Snaafi Dancer, the Northern Dancer colt bought in 1983 for $10.2 million. \"He was slow and infertile,\" Mr. Heckerman said. \"Never won a race.\" **********Most horses lose money, he added. \"Race-horse ownership I view as primarily a pursuit of pleasure,\" he said. \"But with good business sense you can limit your  losses in bad years and put yourself in a position to make gains when you do get lucky.\" **********Horse traders being, well, horse traders, Mr. Waldman recommends that neophytes exercise caution as they approach the sales pavilion. \"We're not regulated,\" he said. \"None of the industry is regulated. There can be dishonesty in any industry.\" **********At auctions, the wary newcomer should bring along a professional -- a trainer, bloodstock agent or industry consultant. But be aware that, according to Mr. Heckerman, there have been recurring allegations of secret arrangements between such advisers and sellers. **********When paying much more than, say, $10,000, it is a good idea to have a veterinarian take X-rays of the prospect's ankles, knees and hocks (back leg joints) and check breathing passages, Mr. Waldman said. **********Even with a sound horse, though, there is the matter of upkeep. It costs $15,000 to $30,000 a year to board and train a race horse, depending on where you do it, Mr. Heckerman said. **********And be prepared for disappointment at the track. \"Only about 15 percent of horses in training would generate a profit -- that is, their purse earnings would exceed their training costs each year,\" Mr. Heckerman said. The best that  one can hope for is that a few big winners will pay for the losers. \"It's not clipping coupons and it's not the place to put the widows' and orphans' money.\" **********But there is still the excitement. \"I think anybody who has been bitten by the racing bug never lets go,\" Mr. Waldman said. Once hooked, he'll usually wind up dabbling in the breeding of horses, too, he added. **********That is where the stallions and broodmares come in. **********Stallion ownership is frequently divided into 40 equal shares. The Maktoums sold shares in Shareef Dancer, sired by the same stallion as the worthless Snaafi Dancer, for $1 million each after he won the Irish Derby in 1983, making  the stallion worth $40 million. One of the 32 shares in Nijinski II sold for $1.4 million at Keeneland the same year. At that time, just before the industry  slumped, people paid as much as $1 million for the chance to breed their broodmare to a coveted stallion. **********Top broodmares have always sold for less, because they produce fewer offspring. But to house them, you might want a farm. **********Manicured Bluegrass horse farms sell for $10,000 or more an acre, Mr. Waldman said. In 1992, Calumet Farm, with its white fences, and conveniently situated next door to Keeneland, sold for $17 million. That's after it went bankrupt."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/22/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-accounts-061379.html": {"writer_name": "Edwin McDowell", "pub_date": "1996-02-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 254, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Accounts", "body_text": " **********TMP Interactive, Framingham, Mass., to Harpell/Martins & Co., Concord, Mass., as the first agency to handle advertising for the developer of the Monster Board, which provides career information on the World Wide Web.

Before he became director of technology for the Atlanta Committee for the  Olympic Games -- overseeing the planning, preparation, operation, deployment and recovery of $300 million worth of technology for the Games -- he worked for NASA. **********\"The big difference between this and a moon shot is that with a moon shot you have windows of launch opportunity,\" Mr. Neal said. \"Here we have one window, July the 19th, and we have to get it right the first time.\" **********As the countdown to the Games gets shorter, the already 14-hour workdays in the Technology Operations Center in Atlanta are getting longer. No one expects to get much sleep until the Games conclude on Aug. 4. **********The operations center is the hub where an elite crew of technical specialists, most of them on loan from sponsor companies, will monitor and manage 7,000 computers, 9,000 radio phones, 6,000 pagers, 1,000 facsimile lines and 8,000 cable connections. A few dozen of the 10,000 Panasonic video monitors to be used at the Games are arrayed overhead in the control room. Now dark, they will soon light up with live images of the world's finest athletes competing for the gold. **********But it is not just the athletes who will be on public display. Olympic sponsors, including I.B.M., BellSouth, SMH Swiss, Scientific-Atlanta, Eastman Kodak, Xerox, AT&T, Motorola and Panasonic have both prestige and earnings riding on their Olympic performances. **********Can timing and scoring devices from Swatch keep pace with athletes, measuring the millimeters and microseconds that separate elation and despair? Can Panasonic's giant scoreboard remain readable in the Atlanta sun? Can Sensormatic Electronics keep the athletes and dignitaries out of harm's way? **********Failures in any of these systems will be highly visible -- there have been minor technological glitches in previous Olympics, but this level and scale of technology have never been attempted before -- and there will be a large audience of potential customers scoring the performance of the technological infrastructure of the Games. They will be wondering if I.B.M.'s OS/2 operating system is robust enough to handle the demands of thousands of users on 300 local area networks. Can Xerox handle the demands for copies and printouts, expected to be the equivalent of a paper trail stretching all the way to the moon? Can BellSouth's Sonet fiber optic ring carry all the video and data traffic in and out of Atlanta without interruptions? **********Each sponsor company is investing $20 million to $40 million or more for the  chance to be tested. Many of the companies decline to talk about the business aspects of sponsorship, preferring to stress good will and global harmony. Others are more candid. **********\"We've invested $20 million in the Games, and we've already received more than $27 million in future orders as a direct result,\" said a spokesman for Sensormatic, the key supplier of security systems for the Games. **********And no company would talk about the possibility of an embarrassing failure. For the last five years, Mr. Neal has worked toward this event with one goal: no mistakes. **********Balancing Gee-Whiz Against Reliable **********Mr. Neal and his army of technical specialists have spent an estimated 750 people-years of effort to find the right balance of reliable and gee-whiz technologies to insure the success of the 17-day event. The greatest challenge has been to integrate a wide array of computer and communications technologies to work together seamlessly, and internationally, often without the benefit of live trials, and without disrupting the existing technological infrastructure of Atlanta. **********Unlike most previous Olympics, these Games are being staged primarily in private venues, which means the planners do not have the luxury of unhurried access to Government facilities. At some venues, the facilities must be wired and tested as little as 48 hours ahead of the events, and dismantled just as swiftly. \"Everything is incredibly compressed,\" Mr. Neal said. **********And everything relating to and relying on technology at these Games is outsized. For a few weeks, there will be more cellular telephone traffic and video signals in Atlanta than anywhere else on the planet and more computing power and more electronic sensors than at any civilian event in history. **********Scores of other information technologies must be integrated on a scale that would astound chief information officers at billion-dollar companies. They know how difficult it is to get even two hardware or software systems to coexist reliably. Atlanta has systems for moving photons, systems for moving electrons,  systems for moving radio waves and systems for moving people. **********\"We have not been able to find any parallel to this event, from the telecommunications perspective,\" said Mark Hays, chief technology architect for  BellSouth. **********Will the Return Justify Investment? **********The total cost of the technology investment for the 1996 Summer Games is difficult to estimate. BellSouth added its planned 1997 capital spending to 1996, swelling its equipment investment alone to $170 million. The City of Atlanta got a $72 million grant from the Department of Transportation to beef up its traffic control systems for the Games. **********The 10 major corporate sponsors had to pledge a minimum of $40 million each in goods and services, and some, like I.B.M., the principal systems integrator,  have spent far more. **********Key elements of these technologies will be recycled, and the knowledge gained in this experiment -- like the world's largest array of solar cells atop the swimming and diving center -- will have long-term uses for Atlanta and other cities around the world. **********Some innovations, like Kodak's new system for printing color photos directly  on plastic ID badges, will soon be offered for sale. But because the main emphasis was on reliability, many of the technologies are already in commercial  use. The Olympics is no time for beta-testing, Mr. Neal said. **********\"We spent our money on that sort of insurance, as opposed to glitz and glitter applications,\" he added. **********... but the Gadgetry Is Fascinating **********Still, the list of technical innovations for the Games is long and diverse. Athletes and coaches will wear security badges that broadcast access codes and information as the wearer approaches security checkpoints, using microchips embedded in the plastic. **********At the gates, sensors will measure the unique geometry of each athlete's hand for identification purposes. Once found only in high-security areas like nuclear power plants, this innovation is replacing conventional time-clocks in factories and may eventually supplement plastic cards in automatic teller machines. **********A supercomputer that analyzes National Weather Service data much more swiftly and accurately than ever before will be used to forecast the Atlanta weather in  microcells as small as about 0.80 square mile. (The current national system, in  contrast, tracks weather in areas of around 11 square miles.) **********The backbone of the technological Olympics is BellSouth's vast network of fiber optic cables surrounding Atlanta and linking 41 different Olympic venues.  NBC television saved tens of millions of dollars by piping video images directly to New York City over the fiber network for editing, rather than sending dozens  of video editors to Atlanta. \"It's telecommuting on a Herculean scale,\" said Mr. Hayes of BellSouth. **********Everything except Motorola's extensive wireless communications systems will travel on optical fiber. Along with Panasonic and Scientific-Atlanta, BellSouth  has created a cable television system called Scarlet that will for the first time allow officials and commentators at any of the 41 Olympic sites to view live events at any other site -- even canoeing or sailing in Savannah, 300 miles away. **********To handle the torrent of cellular phone calls, estimated to exceed normal levels by a million minutes of air time a day, BellSouth will deploy mobile communications centers called Colts (cells on light trucks) and Cows (cellulars  on wheels). **********To help get those trucks around town -- along with 2,500 buses, countless private cars and hundreds of thousands of pedestrians -- Atlanta has been augmenting its traffic system with remote sensors, video cameras and global positioning systems. Eventually, when linked to the on-board navigation systems  now beginning to appear in some cars, the system will be able to monitor automobile traffic on major roads throughout the South. **********\"We still warn people not to try to drive into the city for the Games, because it could be a nightmare,\" said Gordon R. Bundy, traffic systems manager  for the Atlanta Traffic Control Center. While technology can help smooth the traffic, scaring people away is even more effective, he said with a wink. **********Other technologies are intended to get more people to come to Atlanta, either physically or virtually. I.B.M. has built the most extensive electronic commerce application ever on the Internet, for ticket and Olympic merchandise sales. Internet users bought more than $1 million in tickets on a recent weekend. **********Ronald V. Palmich, director of I.B.M.'s sponsorship program and also a NASA veteran, said I.B.M. had constructed four different interlinked computer networks to handle things like administration, security and time-keeping. All told, the computer networks will be storing and making available an estimated three terabytes -- the equivalent of 3 trillion words' worth of data. **********A Little Something For Posterity **********But the most lasting, if not the most remunerative, technological legacy of the Summer Games may well be a CD-ROM disk containing the \"franchise book\" that  will transfer the knowledge and technology developed in Atlanta to the next host sites, in Japan and Australia. The Atlanta planners were surprised that there was no such data base waiting for them. \"We spent a lot of time doing research that, quite frankly, I thought was unnecessary,\" Mr. Neal said. \"If we can pass along that knowledge, it will be a  much shorter learning curve and less expensive for them because they'll be in enhancement mode, rather than development mode.\" **********But he can't spare too much time thinking about the next Olympics. There are  only 11 more days before the 1996 Games begin. **********\"From a computing standpoint the most important thing is that we have maximum system availability,\" said Mr. Neal, whose office decorations include a giant Jolly Roger pirate flag and a model of the Harley-Davidson motorcycle he will ride into the sunset after the closing ceremonies. \"We cannot fail. To that end  we've incorporated a lot of things that may not be visible to the average spectator or viewer. Hopefully, you'll see it only because things won't fail.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/09/business/after-deal-fails-wellpoint-finds-another-target.html": {"writer_name": "Milt Freudenheim", "pub_date": "1996-01-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 653, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "After Deal Fails, Wellpoint Finds Another Target", "print_headline": "After Deal Fails, Wellpoint Finds Another Target", "body_text": " **********Returning to the merger trail after the collapse last month of its $1.89 billion plan to acquire Health Systems International Inc., Wellpoint Health Networks Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the life and health insurance unit of the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company for about $380 million. **********With the deal, Leonard Schaeffer, chairman of Wellpoint, could try to convert a million Massachusetts Mutual customers from traditional fee-for-service health coverage to Wellpoint's main business -- health maintenance organizations and other managed-care networks of doctors and hospitals. **********Like some other full-line insurance companies, Massachusetts Mutual has been trying to leave the costly and consolidating health care industry. The company said it would proceed with plans to merge its big money-management and pension-related businesses with the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company. **********Wellpoint already has 2.8 million members, mostly in managed-care plans. It said its deal would make it the nation's second-largest publicly traded managed  health care company, behind the United Healthcare Corporation, which covers 13.7 million people. **********Mr. Schaeffer said the acquisition would set the stage for more combinations  and alliances, including some with Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans. Wellpoint,  based in Woodland Hills, Calif., was created in 1992 by the nonprofit Blue Cross of California as a way to raise money to expand its managed care business. Wellpoint has been wooing Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in New Jersey and elsewhere, but no takers have been announced. **********Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health care analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said  the move yesterday was a \"step to diversify Wellpoint out of California, where they have 95 percent of their business.\" **********Massachusetts Mutual also covers 200,000 employees of California-based companies, and 60,000 in Texas, where Wellpoint is starting a managed-care network. The rest are spread across the country, with concentrations in New York, Georgia, Massachusetts, Illinois, Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania, a spokesman for the company, Eustis Walcott, said. **********Mr. Abramowitz said that to make the deal worthwhile, Wellpoint had \"to move  those people into managed care, but they only have networks in California and Texas.\". **********Edward B. Keaney, an analyst with Volpe, Welty in San Francisco, said that Wellpoint had been interested in acquiring Massachusetts Mutual's health care lines for some time and that a dispute over their valuation was a factor in the  breakup of the Wellpoint-Health Systems deal. He said Health Systems executives  thought that most of the health care customers of Massachusetts Mutual were \"spread too thinly\" to be attractive for managed care. **********Wellpoint and Blue Cross of California still face an obligation under California law to establish a charitable medical foundation to repay the state for Blue Cross's years of tax-exempt status. Until the Health Systems deal fell  through, they planned to allocate several billion dollars of cash and Wellpoint  stock for this purpose. Last week, several consumer advocacy groups asked state  regulators to specify stringent requirements for the new Blue Cross foundation. **********Wellpoint will \"move ahead quickly to help Blue Cross of California fulfill its public benefit obligation,\" John Cygul, a Wellpoint spokesman, said yesterday. **********The sale agreement by Massachusetts Mutual marks the latest move away from health insurance by a traditional insurance company. Last year, United Healthcare acquired Metrahealth, a short-lived joint venture of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and the Travelers Group, for $1.65 billion, and Healthsource Inc. acquired the health care operations of the Provident Life and  Accident Insurance Company. **********\"A lot of traditional insurers are looking for an exit from this business,\" said Robert Mains, a health care analyst with the First Albany Corporation. Bucking that tide, the Aetna Life and Casualty Company kept its managed-care business and sold its other insurance lines to Travelers in November. **********Traders on Wall Street, distracted yesterday by the East Coast storm, seemed  to pay little attention to the Wellpoint deal. The company's shares closed at $32.25, unchanged, in the shortened session of the New York Stock Exchange."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/05/world/in-bosnia-paint-and-plumbing-alone-cannot-heal.html": {"writer_name": "Kit Roane", "pub_date": "1996-05-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1160, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Bosnia, Paint and Plumbing Alone Cannot Heal", "print_headline": "In Bosnia, Paint and Plumbing Alone Cannot Heal", "body_text": " **********Sanija Mulic was in her garden transplanting flowering tulips.

Where families had celebrated birthdays and anniversaries, now lay charred walls. The gardens that were once the scene of barbecues had been uprooted. Graffiti covered what was not burned or reduced to rubble, and litter was blown aimlessly by the wind. **********I'm the electrician, plumber, yard man and painter,\" said Ms. Kosovac, a 58-year-old widow. She moved back into her dilapidated home on March 12, the day Ilidza, a suburb of Sarajevo that had been controlled by the Bosnian Serbs, was  transferred to the Muslim-Croat federation. \"But what can we do?

It came at the hands of what were sometimes close Serbian acquaintances from down the street. **********And now many of the original Muslim owners return here in their spare time to work at putting their homes back in order. As they worked, most peppered their talk with recollections of the street, a row of town houses and one- and two-family homes, in happier times. **********\"This street used to be profiled on television every spring because of all the beautiful flowers that bloomed here,\" Ibro Karup, a 49-year-old economics professor, said as he hoed the dirt. \"We all worked together to make it beautiful, and there was no division among us.\" **********Looking next door to where his elderly Serbian neighbor, Stanko Pokrajic, still lives, he added, \"I hope it can be like that again.\" **********Mr. Pokrajic, 74, has begun to rekindle his old friendships, offering tools to his former neighbors and congratulating them on their progress in sprucing up the place.

Then when they left, they started burning everything.\" **********\"I couldn't believe it,\" he added. \"My old neighbors would have never done that.\" **********Mr. Pokrajic is the only Serb left on the block, which once held a mixture of Muslims, Croats and Serbs.

He never thought the talk would turn to action. **********\"Then, one day, he and other Serbs took over my mom's home and began holding  militia meetings there,\" he said. \"One of them had helped her fix up the place when we first moved in, but all of these people began to see differences in stupid things. And finally they made us leave.\" **********Mr. Koca, a close friend of Ms. Hadzimehmedovic's father, added that he and Mr. Hadzimehmedovic stayed around long after things got bad. Neither was in the  army, so it seemed safe, at first. **********\"Muhamed and I were just sitting there in the yard when the Chetniks began to roll into town,\" he said, using the common name for the Bosnian Serb fighters. \"We couldn't believe the looks we were getting and we couldn't go anywhere so we just sat there and drank. It killed the fear but, boy, we were scared.\" **********While Mr. Koca later escaped to Sarajevo, Mr. Hadzimehmedovic found himself in police custody, interrogated by the Serbian authorities. After two weeks of being beaten and burned by cigarette butts, he said, he was saved by a Serbian friend and exchanged as a prisoner. **********The Muslims and Croats on Gavrilo Princip Street are among a lucky few who will see their homes again. Tens of thousands of refugees remain displaced, with little hope of ever returning to their former homes. And that those in Ilidza have realized their dream has left the residents of Gavrilo Princip somewhat open to forgiveness. **********They speak of inclusion and the return of Serbs who have not committed war crimes, and say how pleasant it is to chat with the one Serb who stayed. **********But there is skepticism in their words.

In addition, $130 million to $150 million of the relief goods will be reserved for Kurds in northern Iraq, a  minority abused in the past by Baghdad. **********Oil industry experts say the sudden infusion of Iraqi oil into the world market could mean a drop in oil prices of $2 to $3 a barrel. [Page A8.] **********That could translate into something of a political windfall for the Clinton Administration, which is under pressure to stem the rise in gasoline prices. **********The deal today became possible when negotiators for President Saddam Hussein  of Iraq dropped demands that Baghdad choose the bank to manage the oil money, that it and not the United Nations deliver relief to the Kurds, and that United  Nations inspectors have limited authority to check compliance. **********Oil is not expected to begin flowing for a number of weeks, perhaps months, because some operational details remain to be worked out. But diplomats and United Nations officials say they believe that the Iraqis mean business now, unlike the situation four years ago, when a similar plan collapsed. Since the earlier deal broke down, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have become malnourished or ill, with many dying from lack of medication, United Nations agencies estimate. **********\"This resolution is based on one of the most important objectives of the United Nations, which is to alleviate the problem of poverty -- and the poorest  of the poor were suffering in Iraq,\" Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said after announcing the agreement to the Security Council, which adopted the plan in April 1995 and has been waiting a year for an Iraqi response. **********Reuters reported that news of the agreement, broadcast on state radio and television, set off street celebrations in Baghdad. Iraqis embraced each other and fired volleys of shots into the air. **********Food vendors cut prices for eggs, sugar, rice, tea and cooking oils in anticipation that supplies would soon increase, the agency reported. **********The new agreement does not change the broad sanctions still in place against  Iraq. In order to have those lifted, and be free to sell oil in unrestricted quantities for purposes of its own choosing, Iraq will have to prove that its weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated, and it will also have to return looted Kuwaiti property and account for 600 Kuwaitis still missing after  the 1990 invasion and the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf. **********The United States has accused the Iraqi leader of building palaces and indulging in other luxuries while letting his population suffer as a way of generating international sympathy for an end to sanctions. **********\"The whole point here is that Saddam Hussein has been using his people as pawns in order to try to get a change in the sanctions regime,\" said Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate. This resolution would \"remove that blackmail,\" she said. \"The sanctions will stay in place until he abides by  all the resolutions.\" **********Under the plan, accepted by President Hussein after several months of off-and-on negotiations here, Iraq may sell up to $2 billion in oil during a six-month period, renewable if Baghdad meets all the conditions of the agreement, which will be monitored by the United Nations. Compliance with the accord will be checked by the Security Council every 90 days. Its Iraqi sanctions committee will be involved in all phases of the operation. **********The agreement would add about 700,000 barrels a day of Iraqi oil to world supplies at current prices. Before the 1990 embargo, Iraq supplied about 3 million barrels daily, or about 4 percent of world supplies. **********Iraq has the world's second-largest oil reserves after Saudi Arabia. Officially, reserves stand at more than 100 billion barrels, more than a tenth of the world's untapped oil. But analysts say the supply may be twice that amount. **********The plan outlined today requires that Iraqi oil must pass through pipelines the West regards as relatively easy to monitor -- the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline across Turkey to the Mediterranean, or through Iraq's oil terminal at Mina al-Bakr on the Persian Gulf. The new accord, in the form of a memorandum of understanding signed by Iraq's negotiator, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, and the United  Nations legal counsel, Under Secretary General Hans Corell of Sweden, leaves a few procedures still to be worked out, including how foods, medicines and other  goods will be distributed. **********During the last two weeks, prodded by objections from the United States and Britain, negotiators turned down an Iraqi request for greater authority over how supplies get to Kurds in the north of Iraq. Today's deal provides for United Nations agencies to deliver the aid. **********Iraq also lost a bid to choose the bank to be used for an escrow account to be handled by the United Nations. The bank will now be chosen by officials here, who will control the account so that Iraq cannot divert money or obtain credit for other purposes beyond humanitarian relief. **********The agreement also promises that United Nations inspectors will have freedom  to visit any site in Iraq to see if the goods imported are reaching the most needy. **********\"The United States intends to hold Iraq's feet to the fire to assure that this agreement is not violated,\" an American diplomat said today. Although some  countries, notably Russia and France, had argued for some relaxation of sanctions more than a year ago, Iraq lost most of its support after disclosures  last summer about the extent to which the Iraqis had been lying about their nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs. **********But there was always a sense that something had to be done to relieve the sufferings of Iraqis, said Emilio J. Cardenas, the Argentine envoy who helped draft the United Nations resolution on selling oil for humanitarian needs. \"The  general feeling by last year was that this was pretty much overdue,\" he said. \"The reports we were operating with indicated that there was a lot of suffering  in Baghdad and a number of other Iraqi cities. There was a prevailing mood all last year and this year that something had to be done.\" **********Under the sanctions resolutions enacted following the Persian Gulf war, Iraq  has been permitted to import medicines, food and other necessities. But increasing shortages of hard currency have made that very difficult. American officials say that what money is available has not gone to repairing or restocking hospitals or other urgently needed civilian projects. **********Some Iraqi oil has been smuggled out of the country in recent years. President Clinton recently reported to Congressional committees watching sanctions that some small shipments of oil had been intercepted. A senior United States official said today that the plan accepted by Iraq this morning would make it easier to keep sanctions in place indefinitely, a goal shared by Britain. Britain and the United States have at times been isolated on the Security Council, where other members say that the aim of Washington and London is not to punish the Iraqi leader but to topple him. **********\"This agreement is the best way to lock in a coalition in favor of maintaining sanctions against those who are squishy on Iraq,\" the senior American official said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/15/your-money/IHT-first-column-accepting-lessons-of-capitalism.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-06-15", "snippet": "SKEPTICS would call it fashion.

It is likely to become an early test case of Mr. Netanyahu's readiness to honor commitments made under the self-rule accords signed by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********The agreements say Israeli soldiers should withdraw from most of Hebron, remaining to guard the Jewish enclaves and the Tomb of the Patriarchs, a shrine  holy to both Jews and Muslims where a settler massacred 29 Arabs at prayer in February 1994. **********But the pullout, originally scheduled for March, was delayed by Prime Minister Shimon Peres after four Palestinian suicide bombers killed 59 people in Israel in attacks in February and March. Security concerns and fears of a damaging confrontation with settlers on the eve of elections led Mr. Peres to postpone the pullout again until after the May 29 vote. **********Now, the next move in Hebron is up to Mr. Netanyahu. He was vague about his plans during the election campaign, suggesting at one point that he preferred postponing the withdrawal until talks on a final peace settlement. But he was careful to dissociate himself today from statements by members of his Likud party ruling out any pullback. **********Ariel Sharon, a Likud leader expected to join Mr. Netanyahu's Cabinet, said in a radio interview that the agreements on Hebron would be reviewed and that there would be no withdrawal. Mr. Peres, meanwhile, decided after a meeting with his security chiefs not to go ahead with the pullout in his remaining weeks in office. Mayor Mustafa Natsheh of Hebron had urged Mr. Peres to order the troops  out before stepping down. **********In the Jewish enclaves of Hebron today, there was a collective sigh of relief at Mr. Netanyahu's victory, and hopes for renewed Government financing for building and expansion. The departing Labor Government had effectively frozen development of the Jewish neighborhoods in Hebron when it cut state financing for settlements throughout the West Bank soon after it took office. **********\"The next Government will give first priority to the needs of the people of Israel, not the people of Ishmael,\" Mr. Leibowitz said, using a reference to Arabs common among the settlers. **********Miriam Levinger, who with her husband, Rabbi Moshe Levinger, founded the settlement in Hebron in 1968, was in high spirits today. **********\"This is a victory of the Jewish people who did not abandon their roots and remained faithful to their heritage,\" she said of the election results. \"The Messiah hasn't arrived yet, but I felt that the Jewish people have made a 180-degree turn. This is the beginning of a new era.\" **********Shopping in Hebron's vegetable market not far from Mrs. Levinger's home, Ahmad Abu Turki had a gloomier vision of the future. He said he was worried that there would be violence if the Israeli soldiers did not withdraw. \"People will despair, there will be more trouble and the situation will deteriorate,\" he said. **********\"If President Clinton wants the peace process to continue, he has to press the Likud to redeploy the army in Hebron. We had hoped Mr. Peres would do it after the election, but when we heard the results, we lost hope. This is a retreat from peace, and the Likud will be harder on us.\" **********Other people in Hebron also pinned their hopes on American intervention, arguing that neither Likud nor Labor could stand in the way of the United States. **********\"The peace accords are not only a matter between the Likud and Yasir Arafat,\" said Adnan Abu Halaf, a taxi driver. \"They were signed before other nations, and Israel cannot stand up to the whole world.

If he were in a New York City hospital he would be isolated, breathing filtered air under ultraviolet lights. **********But here he shares a room in Reitfontein Hospital with 63 other men -- half of whom do not have his especially dangerous and nearly incurable form of the disease. And every night, despite the nurses' efforts, the patients shut all of the windows and turn up the heat. The coughing starts. The tin-roofed ward becomes an incubator for TB bacteria. **********Benedict Philomen, 37, in the bed two feet away, says he has ''regular tuberculosis,'' and he worries every night. ''There are worse patients in here than me,'' he said. ''Who says I won't grab their germs?'' **********The Government, he said, is dragging its feet on tuberculosis. ''There's no doctor in this whole hospital at night,'' he complained. ''There's not enough nurses capable about TB. If I gave you some water in my glass right now, no one will say, 'Stop, you're spreading the disease.' '' **********Just three months ago, the World Health Organization announced that South Africa had the worst known tuberculosis problem in the world. It has the highest documented infection rate -- about 350 cases per 100,000 people -- and a rising incidence of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, which kills 54 percent of those here who develop it. **********Mr. Philomen is not alone in his frustration over South Africa's response to the problem. Everyone from the doctors at Reitfontein up to the World Health Organization in Geneva thinks that the country -- in the midst of a wrenching transition to a non-racial democracy -- has a health emergency on its hands and is nearly paralyzed in the face of it. **********Government officials say they are tackling the problem. But experts say movement has been slow, and they fear that the consequences of the political transition -- health administrators new to their jobs, tight budgets and a calculated shift of power from Pretoria to the provinces -- are letting the disease proceed unchecked. **********A problem that existed under the former white-minority Government has grown steadily worse, in part because of a rise in drug use and the spread of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. The incidence of drug use and H.I.V. infection, which both depress the immune system and can increase vulnerability to tuberculosis, has risen as South Africa has renewed international contacts after the lifting of the sanctions imposed on the apartheid Government. **********''My big fear is that we're building up to an epidemic of virtually untreatable TB,'' said Dr. Theodore Collins, 72, a consultant to the South African National Tuberculosis Association who has spent 42 years fighting the disease. ''Right now, we probably have the worst TB control program in the world.'' **********Publicly, health officials have committed themselves to training hundreds of nurses to adopt the latest treatment method, set up a national case register and build 200 mini-laboratories to speed diagnoses. **********But experts say the plan is meeting resistance because provincial health officials are moving lethargically, the big private agency that treats TB victims is paid only for hospitalizing patients and the national health department is enmeshed in a scandal about its financing of an anti-AIDS musical, ''Sarafina 2,'' that is consuming officials' time. **********Officials of the World Health Organization, a United Nations agency, think President Nelson Mandela should declare a national health emergency to draw attention to the problem, and should talk about his own bout with tuberculosis when he was in prison. **********Other prominent South Africans  have had the disease, which in this country strikes hardest at the poor in rural as well as urban areas. **********Rates are high among miners and those who live in crowded urban slums, but the highest incidence is among the people of mixed race in the townships north of Cape Town. **********No one is sure why, but mixed-race people there, known as ''Cape coloreds,'' have high rates of drug abuse and of alcoholism -- the Cape vineyards used to pay workers in cheap wine -- both of which lower resistance to the disease and make patients forgetful about taking their daily pills. **********No one is quite sure why TB is so common, but there are many theories. Families packed 10 to a room, commuters packed 15 to a minibus and miners packed 60 to an elevator -- all features of South African life -- help spread the disease. Fear of being dismissed from jobs and a belief among rural Africans that the disease is spread by witchcraft keep sufferers away from treatment. **********The latest treatment, used everywhere from New York to Tanzania, is called directly observed therapy, short-course. Patients take their medicine under the eyes of a guardian every day for six months and are given regular sputum tests to see if the pills are working. **********The guardian may be a nurse or family member, but far from clinics it is sometimes a minister, a shopkeeper or even a sangoma -- an herbal healer. **********Thus monitored, a patient can usually be cured with about $12 worth of drugs a month, said Robert J. Davidow, chief pharmacist at Reitfontein. But someone who stops taking the pills after a few weeks, when the coughing and night sweats fade, will probably be back a year later with a drug-resistant strain of the bacteria that has a 50 percent chance of killing him or her and will cost about $60 a day to treat. **********The South African health system, never good at serving poor black patients and long isolated by apartheid, now spends about 20 percent of its tuberculosis budget on hospitalizing the 2 percent of patients with drug-resistant TB. Very few clinics have the resources or inclination to follow up patients who stop taking their medicine. **********South Africa realized how bad the problem was in June, when the World Health Organization completed its study. ''There was a real sense of urgency then,'' said Dr. Jacob Kumaresan, a specialist with the agency. But it has faded. **********Two administrators who run what are often cited as model tuberculosis control programs, Lyndon J. Barends in Cape Town and Dr. Elsa Balt in Mpumalanga Province, expressed frustration with the lack of urgency. **********Treatment succeeds, Dr. Balt said, only if there is a tuberculosis control officer in every province, dozens of districts and hundreds of clinics, each reporting upward so that every case in the country can be tracked. **********As of today, there is one tuberculosis control officer in Pretoria and four in the country's nine provinces. **********The TB chief in Pretoria, Dr. Harry Hausler, a Canadian newly hired from the World Health Organization, disagrees that progress is slow. But when he is pressed it becomes clear that most of the progress consists of promises made in meetings. **********Also, each clinic must have enough workers to hunt down missing patients. **********One obstacle is the health department's contract with the National Tuberculosis Association, a private charity that runs 22 hospitals. The association is reimbursed only for patients in beds, a disincentive for switching to outpatient therapy. **********Some of the association's 4,000 volunteers do outpatient work, said Jacqui van Rensburg, a spokeswoman. But many are retired health workers and set in their ways. One chapter, for example, refuses to stop using chest X-rays, which are expensive and inaccurate. On top of that, she said, the association's nurses distrust the volunteers and resist giving them pills to hand out. **********Dr. Hausler's boss, the director general of health, Dr. Olive Shishana, said she would end that inertia. The department is in upheaval, she said, as it tries to change its focus to providing primary care to poor black people, and simultaneously to lose hundreds of staff members through budget cutting. **********She expressed surprise that the World Health Organization and local TB experts were so unhappy, and she promised to visit places like Reitfontein soon. Shortly after she made that promise, the pharmacy budget at Reitfontein was increased. She also said she would find enough money to build 200 laboratories, rewrite the contract with the tuberculosis association and maybe even call President Mandela to ask him to talk about his TB. **********''The commitment from us is there,'' she said.

''Turkey is a powerful country at the center of the world.  The European countries have to review their policies on world affairs and on Islam. That is why we are warning them.'' **********Mr. Erbakan complained that the European Union does not recognize Turkey's strategic importance and stabilizing role in a turbulent region, and focuses instead ''only on human rights and the Kurdish issue.'' **********''The mechanism is working against us,'' he asserted. ''Things done to no other country are done to us. Obstacles are created for us.'' **********Turkey turned down a chance to join the European Union in 1977, when it was known as the European Community, but 10 years later reversed its position and filed an application for membership. It has faced resistance based in part on its economic underdevelopment and its human rights record. **********Successive Turkish leaders have  asserted that the true reasons for the European Union's reluctance include pressure from Greece, Turkey's historic rival, which accepted the 1977 offer of membership made to both nations, and fear of admitting an Islamic nation. **********Mr. Erbakan announced that instead of accepting the European Union's invitation for dinner this weekend, he will send Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller to bring his message. Mrs. Ciller is perceived as pro-European, but she has complained that the European Union is discriminating against Turkey by considering other applicants for membership more favorably. **********''I support Prime Minister Erbakan's view on this,'' she said this week. ''We are very disappointed with the E.U.'s attitude toward Turkey. Trying to exclude our country, which has been part of Europe for years, is unacceptable.'' **********While Mrs. Ciller's irritation is evidently based on a legitimate desire to bring Turkey into the European Union, Mr. Erbakan may have another motive. He and other leaders of the pro-Islamic Welfare party have for years criticized the European Union and asserted that Turkey should seek to strengthen its ties with other Muslim countries rather than concentrate on moving closer to Europe. **********By refusing to accept what he says is a second-class invitation to this weekend's summit meeting, Mr. Erbakan is portraying himself as a defender of the Turkey's dignity. He may also be chipping away at the support most Turks feel for closer ties to Europe. **********''He is mining a vein of nationalist feeling that is strong here, even among people who want Turkey to join the E.U.,'' said a foreign diplomat in Ankara. ''A large majority of Turks support what he did. They see it as a matter of national pride.'' **********In his five and a half months in power, Mr. Erbakan has not sought to change Turkish policy radically, either in foreign or domestic affairs.  But when he finds opportunities, as in the European Union invitation, he has made clear that he does not agree with a reflexive embrace of secular and pro-Western policies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/26/business/on-line-services-join-indecency-law-suit.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Lewis", "pub_date": "1996-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 643, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "On-Line Services Join Indecency-Law Suit", "print_headline": "On-Line Services Join Indecency-Law Suit", "body_text": " **********Asserting that the boundaries of free speech in the 21st century are at stake, more than 20 corporate and trade organizations have initiated a major legal challenge to the new Communications Decency Act. **********Their civil suit, organized by the American Library Association, America Online and the Center for Democracy and Technology, is expected to be filed today in United States District Court in Philadelphia.

''Iran's use of terror to try to erode support for the Mideast peace process is well known and documented. And we find it perplexing that Turkey, which has itself been a victim of terror, has taken these steps.'' **********The deal could provoke a variety of American sanctions against the state-owned Turkish oil and gas company under the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, which gives the President the power to penalize foreign companies that invest $40 million or more a year in the oil and natural-gas sectors of either country. President Clinton signed the measure last week, over the objections of European allies. **********Contracts already in effect were exempted, but possible sanctions for the new deal could include denial of loans from the Export-Import Bank,  denial of licenses for exports to the United States, a prohibition on loans or credits from American financial institutions and a ban on imports from the United States. **********American officials were reluctant to say today whether the agreement, the text of which they have not seen, violates the new American law, for which operating regulations have not yet been written. They noted that pipelines needed to be built and that gas would not flow until at least 1999, and they suggested that given Iran's economic problems, those grand plans may prove overly optimistic. **********Retaliation would create sharp new strains between Washington and a vital NATO ally that bridges Europe and Central Asia, the Balkans and the Middle East. Washington is already alarmed over the installation last month of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, head of the pro-Islamic Welfare Party, who has called for closer Turkish ties to Iran, Iraq and Syria, and a reorientation of Turkey away from the West. **********''Turkey remains a very important NATO ally in an extremely tough neighborhood, and it's on that basis that we've continued to consult with the Turkish Government on this issue,'' the White House official said. ''Whether or not it is a violation of U.S. law, it is certainly bad policy.'' **********With Mr. Clinton on vacation in Wyoming and Secretary of State Warren Christopher traveling, Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff telephoned his Turkish counterpart today to express American concerns about the gas deal, officials said. **********Turkish officials argued that the  agreement did not break American law, because it is a trade agreement to purchase gas, not an investment in Iran, and each country will be responsible for its own infrastructure. **********''The sanctions ban investments in Iran,'' a Turkish Cabinet minister, Abdullah Gul, said today in Teheran, where Mr. Erbakan signed the contract with the Iranian First Vice President, Hassan Habibi. ''We're not going to invest in Iran. This is only a trade agreement. The two countries will build their own sides of the gas pipeline.'' **********But the Iranian President, Hashemi Rafsanjani, hailed the agreement as a major triumph over American efforts to choke Iran's economy. And Mustafa Murathan, the director of the Turkish company, said Turkey might help cash-poor Iran build its part of the pipeline, from Tabriz to the border town of Teba, under a barter agreement. **********Mr. Erbakan chose to go to Iran on his first official trip abroad as Prime Minister. He was met on Saturday with full state honors and told Turkish television in an interview, before leaving for Pakistan, ''Turkey will not permit any third country to interfere in the growing trend of cooperation between Turkey and Iran.'' **********Iraq and Libya are subject to United Nations sanctions, but the American effort to isolate Iran and Cuba has been sharply criticized by the European Union and other countries, like China, as an effort to apply ''secondary boycotts'' and bring foreign companies under American law. When Arab states tried to apply such secondary boycotts against American and other companies that did business with Israel, the United States objected, but now is applying the same principle to others, European diplomats argue. **********Some nations, like Canada, have instructed their companies to ignore  a separate law, the Helms-Burton Act, that punishes companies investing in formerly American-owned properties in Cuba. **********In a public response, Glyn Davies, the State Department's deputy spokesman, said, ''Our general reaction is that we believe that this deal's conclusion sends the wrong message to Iran.'' But the details of the contract will have to be studied before the United States can decide if sanctions should be applied, he said. **********Top Turkish officials have told Washington that ''this isn't an investment but a purchase of gas,'' Mr. Davies said, ''and we'll see.'' **********But he emphasized the strong relationship between the United States and Turkey and said, ''We certainly don't expect that this will cause a major rift in our relationship.'' **********Turkey plays a vital role in various American policies to broaden the ''circle of peace'' in the Middle East, to train and equip the Muslim-led Bosnian Army, to help the newly independent Muslim states of the Caucasus and Central Asia and to serve as a restraining buffer to Iran, Iraq and Syria. **********Mr. Erbakan, while constrained by his coalition partner, the conservative former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, could undermine those policies if he tries to reorient Turkey in a serious fashion, as opposed to making merely symbolic gestures to his Islamist constituency, American officials say. It could also lead to a coup by the Turkish military, an embarrassing step away from democracy in a NATO that is looking to expand. **********New strains between Turkey and Greece, first over tiny islands in the Aegean and now over last weekend's rioting on Cyprus between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, could be worsened by the nationalist Mr. Erbakan and lead to a new cycle of reaction and overreaction in Athens, the officials say. **********So they are being careful to stress the longstanding ties between Turkey and the United States, while also indicating sharp displeasure at Turkey's new turn. **********Under the agreement signed today, Iran will start supplying Turkey with 105 billion cubic feet of natural gas a year beginning in 1999, rising to 350 billion cubic feet in 2005. **********--------------------        Turkish Aides Visit Iraq **********BAGHDAD, Aug. 12 (AP) -- Turkish Cabinet officials visited Baghdad  today, seeking to improve connections with Iraq, another adversary of the United States, so as to complete  plans to reopen a pipeline to carry Iraqi oil through Turkey. **********Justice Minister Sevket Kazan and Education Minister Mehmet Saglam drove across the desert from Jordan for talks, scheduled to begin Tuesday, about ''everything concerning our relations with Iraq,'' Mr. Kazan said. **********The pipeline is part of an agreement struck with the United Nations Security Council to allow Iraq to sell some oil, despite sanctions against the country. **********Turkey has been seeking United States and United Nations agreement to buy 200,000 barrels of Iraqi oil a day above the $2 billion Baghdad can sell every six months under a United Nations agreement that allows it to sell the oil to buy food and medicine for its people."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/28/business/investing-it-company-s-systems-know-the-way-to-san-jose.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Brush", "pub_date": "1996-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1162, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INVESTING IT;Company's Systems Know the Way to San Jose", "print_headline": "INVESTING IT;Company's Systems Know the Way to San Jose", "body_text": " **********IN centuries past, navigators used the stars and magnetized needles dangling  from strings to find their way. It's not that way anymore. **********Now, 24 satellites tended by the Defense Department circle the globe and use  radio signals and atomic clocks to pinpoint objects on earth within one centimeter. This network, the Global Positioning System, was created for military purposes, but increasingly serves civilian needs, too. Motorists whose  cars have devices that connect with the positioning system use the system to navigate streets. Surveyors use it for map-making. Pilots guide their flights with it. There are similar uses in areas from mining to agriculture to toll-taking. **********Furthermore, the biggest concern -- doubts about whether the Defense Department would allow the industry regular access to the positioning system signals -- vanished in early April, when the Clinton Administration committed the Government to free public access. On the strength of that commitment, sector analysts expect that the positioning system industry, which had revenues of $1.25 billion last year, will expand to $8.4 billion by 2000. **********How can one invest in this market? The possibilities are as simple as the Global Positioning System is complex. Only one publicly traded company focuses solely on producing the equipment: Trimble Navigation Ltd. All the other big players are either private companies, like Ashtech, or giant multinationals like Sony or Pioneer, which make only a small part of their earnings from system products. **********From many angles, Trimble looks like a good investment. It is the industry's  worldwide leader, with 20 percent of the market.  With sales in more than 60 countries, the company gets about half its revenues from overseas, where the Administration's April announcement is expected to spur large growth. Trimble also controls about 60 percent of the most profitable part of the market, surveying and mapping equipment. **********Based in Sunnyvale, Calif., Trimble is in the lead in product development as  well. It holds more positioning system technology patents than anyone, including the United States Government. During each of the last three years, the company has plowed back 13 to 15 percent of its revenues into research, making it the biggest such spender in amounts as well as percentage in the field. **********Trimble has also played the mating game well, which is important as new applications . cut across industries and as technology is integrated into products that can perform many tasks. **********Take the lucrative possibilities in aviation. Positioning system navigation allows pilots to choose their own routes. With it, they can fly around turbulence or choose a path that saves fuel. **********The technology also helps pilots avoid crashes in areas where ground-based navigation is inefficient. To gain a foothold in this market, Trimble has joined with Honeywell in an alliance that has helped it to secure new clients like American Airlines and American Trans Air. **********Or consider the car market, where technology enables drivers to punch in a destination and then follow voice directions. \"I remember years ago, one of the  big questions when you bought a car was whether it had F.M. radio,\" said Arthur  Calavritinos, who manages John Hancock's High Yield Bond Fund and owns shares of Trimble. \"Now you take it for granted. I think it will be the same for G.P.S.\" **********In autos, Trimble has teamed up with Germany's Philips Car Systems and Xanavi, itself an alliance between Nissan and Hitachi, to supply equipment for BMW and Nissan cars. These and other partnerships, such as with Pioneer and Delco Electronics, should help Trimble expand its 30 percent share of the car-navigation market. **********Companies in this high-tech area have much to do, though, before they can pull in profits. That means investors must assume the risk that things may not go as planned, or as quickly as anticipated. **********For the car-navigation devices to sell well in the United States, prices must fall markedly. The systems, currently on offer in a few General Motors models and some rental cars, cost about $2,000. \"Most people believe they have to go under $1,000 and that they will start to be more popular at $700, which is where we expect the price to be in three years,\" said Charles Trimble, the company's chief executive. **********Another obstacle, also from the auto market, is the availability of the digitized road maps drivers will need to use the navigation. While mapping is widespread in countries like Germany and Japan, only 11 states in the United States are mapped. **********As for positioning system products not yet in existence, like those that could be used to track children and others, there are many unknowns and their potential remains unclear. And the satellites on which the whole system depends  are subject to the risks of outer space. If they are damaged, the disruption could be costly for the industry. **********Competition is another threat. Many of Trimble's rivals, like Sony and Toshiba in the car-navigation market, are larger and richer. In the military sector, Trimble's alliances with firms like Honeywell and Lockheed Martin will help, but the company must still work hard to compete with heavyweights like Rockwell International, Texas Instruments and Magnavox. **********Quickening competition can mean price wars. In the lucrative market for surveying equipment, Leica P.L.C. and Ashtech have aggressively cut prices. **********\"In terms of quality, Trimble is still well respected,\" said John Calamos Jr., chief executive of Calamos Asset Management and portfolio manager of the Calamos Growth Fund. \"But there is a lot of competition in the field, and the profit margins are narrowing. They just can't command the same high price for their product.\" **********Mr. Trimble said his company was fighting back by introducing lower-cost products and controlling expenses. Gross margins, which were on steadily down in 1995, were back up in the first quarter of this year. **********Trimble has also missed its earnings estimates for the last three quarters. The explanations do not suggest big flaws in the company as an investment. Last  fall there was a shortage of parts, and a customer's big order was delayed because of problems the customer had that were not connected with the equipment. But in any event, these earnings problems have continued. In this year's first quarter, the company had a net loss of $1.14 million, even though revenues were  up 14 percent. **********Like many technology stocks, Trimble Navigation is volatile. After it missed  the analysts' earnings estimates last fall, Trimble stock plunged to about $17 from $35 in a matter of weeks. Likewise, the stock gained about 25 percent a month ago when President Clinton announced the new positioning system policy. **********\"I still believe the company is a long-term buy,\" said Darren von Behren, an  analyst with Comvest Partners in Dallas. But in the near term, he said he thought that Trimble's volatility might continue. \"There is some choppiness you  have to be able to weather as an investor,\" he said. Trimble closed Friday at $23.50 on Nasdaq. **********In a sense, that is good news. If an investor who likes the company is watchful, the price dips can become buying opportunities."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/24/world/little-buffalo-journal-in-a-poisoned-forest-a-tribe-canada-forgot.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1996-07-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1033, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Little Buffalo Journal;In a Poisoned Forest, A Tribe Canada Forgot", "print_headline": "Little Buffalo Journal;In a Poisoned Forest, A Tribe Canada Forgot", "body_text": " **********He shot and killed a fat bull moose last spring, his first moose in more than two years.

Sometimes you just want  to give up. If we could only go back to the way we were.\" **********Roads are dirt with potholes that could swallow a bear. Two and three families live together in ramshackle housing that would be condemned elsewhere in Canada. No one has running water. The outhouse stands 100 feet from Mr. Laboucan's kitchen.  Mr. Laboucan's wife, Alma, and daughter, Rema, do laundry in a bathtub. Some families have 40-year-old washing machines, but everyone has  to cart water from a pump a mile away. In the winter, drinking water is melted snow. In the summer, it comes from the nearest clean-water lake, Lake Haig, an hour's drive north. **********Such living conditions have taken their toll. \"There's a lot of alcohol-related domestic violence,\" said Jyoti Vasudev, the community health nurse. \"Usually the police don't get involved. It's soft violence: punch, kick and that sort of thing. But soft violence is detrimental to the children, to the families.\" **********Suicide attempts among the young are almost a common occurrence, as in other  communities of indigenous people. Mr. Vasudev counted a dozen here in the last four years. Three succeeded. **********Yet the children are eager students in the Little Buffalo public school, where 110 students are enrolled. **********\"I think they're happy to come to an environment that is cheerful, warm and safe,\" said a teacher, Joyce Willows, who is not Indian and has just completed her first year at the school. **********Another non-Indian teacher, Leanne Rein, added, \"There are times when it'll be 45 below, as it was this winter, and you'll have the kids try to walk to school because it's so cold the school bus won't start, and still they want to come.\" **********The Lubicons are a symbol of Canada's struggle to settle claims of indigenous people -- and the fearsome difficulties and human tragedies that are rising from that struggle. **********Indigenous people make up 3 percent of the population but claim more than a third of the land area. Polls show attitudes of Canadians hardening toward them. One recent survey by a polling concern called Insight Canada found that more than 40 percent of Canadians believe that indigenous people have only themselves to blame for their troubles. **********The plight of the people at Little Buffalo has at times embarrassed the Canadian Government, which is proud of its international reputation. **********In 1984 the World Council of Churches warned of \"genocidal consequences\" as a result of the oil and timber development in the Lubicon tribal lands -- hundreds of thousands of acres around Lubicon Lake in northern Alberta. To date some $8 billion of resources have been extracted, while the Indians themselves live in poverty. **********With money from the World Council of Churches, the small and diminishing tribe, now numbering probably little more than 300, appealed to the United Nations Human Rights Committee. In a judgment in 1990, that committee cited Canada for breaking international covenants on civil and political rights. **********Although Ottawa had no comment on the ruling and ostensibly paid little attention to it, the new Liberal Government of Jean Chretien is actively trying  for a settlement. **********Harold Millican, an Alberta construction company executive appointed by Indian Affairs Minister Ron Irwin as principal negotiator with the Lubicons, acknowledges that the story of the tribe is \"a blight on Canadian society.\" **********\"There's no question the Government of Canada wants this thing settled as soon as possible,\" he said in an interview. **********The story goes back to the end of the last century, when the Lubicons were overlooked by federal treaty commissioners because they were not living along one of the major waterways. So the Government never signed a land treaty with them, as it did with hundreds of other tribes. **********In 1939 Lubicons were promised reserve land. But after 57 years of bureaucratic deception and delays, the promise has yet to be kept. **********To try to prevent economic development of their tribal lands until their claim had been settled, the Lubicons turned to the justice system.  They were turned down by provincial and appeals courts. The Supreme Court of Canada refused to hear the case. **********The Lubicons are fighting for a land rights settlement that would give them a reserve area of about 95 square miles around Lubicon Lake, a few miles from the  present community at Little Buffalo, but also a few miles and downwind of a Unocal sour gas plant that removes lethal hydrogen sulfide from natural gas. **********The Lubicons have been offered housing, water, sewage and other basic services, but are seeking additional money to make the community economically viable -- for instance, help in learning trades and money for agricultural and small-business start-ups. **********One of the big issues is the number of Lubicons left. One splinter group, known as the Woodland Cree, accepted the Government terms and settled their claim in 1991. They live in a neighboring community a few miles toward Peace River. **********The Lubicon chief, Bernard Ominayak, declines to release the rolls. Published reports have suggested there could be even fewer than 300, which could reduce the amount of any settlement. **********\"It seems to be the hope and objective of both the provincial and federal government that there be no Lubicon people left,\" Mr. Ominayak said. \"We've looked up the definition of genocide in the dictionary, and at this point I would say that's what we're going through.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/22/business/taking-in-the-sites-but-what-about-ring-around-the-collar.html": {"writer_name": "Anne Cronin", "pub_date": "1996-01-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 549, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Taking In the Sites;But What About Ring Around the Collar?", "print_headline": "Taking In the Sites;But What About Ring Around the Collar?", "body_text": " **********Your house is haunted.

The Mississippi site, for example, differentiates between black coffee (flush with cool water, rub stain with detergent then launder with color-safe bleach) and coffee with cream (sponge stain with dry-cleaning solvent, let air dry, then rub in detergent and wash with color-safe bleach in the hottest water appropriate for the type of fabric). **********The fabric lovers on the World Wide Quilting page provide happy chat with their cleaning guides.

Turn fabric over and spray the other side. Apply liquid detergent and work into the stained area with paper towel, replacing the towels as they pick up the stain. Wash fabric in hot water  with laundry detergent and powdered bleach for 12 minutes, or the heavy soiled cycle; rinse in warm water. **********Mississippi State University method: Rub dampened stain with bar soap.

But they said the issue gained momentum in recent months as big bribery scandals have come to light affecting many governments. \"We think everyone has begun to see the huge social and economic and political consequences of bribery,\" Ms. O'Neil said. **********American diplomats who have worked on the anti-bribery issue said they felt vindicated as the 26 Governments approved today's anti-bribery move by consensus. **********\"We were considered naive Americans for pushing this issue,\" Mr. Aaron said.  \"Now many others recognize there is a serious problem.\" **********Since 1977 several dozen American companies have been charged with violating  the anti-bribery law, but no chief executive has been convicted. **********Today's decision is part of a broad crusade by the Clinton Administration, which has said that bribery used by America's rivals represents a real if invisible form of trade barrier. It has said bribery inhibits American exports and cost Americans jobs, all the more so in the present rush toward the globalization of business, with opportunities growing rapidly in Eastern Europe  and Asia. Large American companies, including General Electric and Boeing, have  openly complained that they have difficulty competing for contracts with European rivals who are free to use bribes. **********In March the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, calling bribery an unfair tariff, said, \"Last year, from April 1994 to May 1995, the U.S. Government learned of almost 100 cases in which foreign bribes undercut U.S. firms' ability to win contracts valued at $45 billion.\" **********He added that the Administration's goal was \"to level the playing field and make the rules fair by eliminating his pernicious practice.\" **********The Clinton Administration is not alone. Several West European governments have said that they are in favor of addressing the issues of bribes and extortion in future loan and aid agreements and have begun debating at the O.E.C.D. the question of how to police development aid. **********Two weeks ago the International Chamber of Commerce, based in Paris and with  members from more than 130 countries, published new rules on how to handle extortion and bribery. **********\"We are definitely noticing a change in attitude,\" said Karen Hussmann, an official of Transparency International, a Berlin-based group that fights corruption. \"Many governments and companies are becoming sensitized to the devastating impact of corruption.\" **********On March 29 the United States was successful in its campaign to have the Organization of American States adopt an Inter-American Convention Against Corruption. **********Next, the Clinton Administration has said, it wants to put corporate bribery  on the agenda of the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization in Singapore later this year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/02/business/worldbusiness/IHT-us-warns-adb-development-aid-will-face-a-strain.html": {"writer_name": "Kevin Murphy", "pub_date": "1996-05-02", "snippet": "The United States pledged Wednesday to support the Asian Development Bank despite Washington's embarrassing failure to honor its earlier commitments to the bank's program of soft loans to poor governments in the region..But in numerous private con...", "word_count": 5481, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Warns ADB Development Aid Will Face a 'Strain'", "print_headline": "U.S. Warns ADB Development Aid Will Face a 'Strain'", "body_text": " **********The United States pledged Wednesday to support the Asian Development Bank despite Washington's embarrassing failure to honor its earlier commitments to the bank's program of soft loans to poor governments in the region. **********But in numerous private conversations at the bank's 29th annual meeting, the undersecretary of the Treasury, Jeffrey Shafer, and other U.S. officials warned their counterparts that, as far as Washington is concerned at least, a new, leaner era for development banks has dawned. **********The stance by the United States, which after Japan is the bank's leading shareholder, worries countries now receiving development assistance.

Money once spent without question has to be justified. We are going to have to think now about a world more focused on quality than quantity.\" **********Under steady pressure from the United States and some other donor countries, the development bank has been steered away from directly financing large infrastructure projects and other programs now increasingly backed by private foreign investors. **********Instead, the bank is seeking to use its resources as a catalyst for private-sector investment and to emphasize social and environmental considerations in future projects, a transformation lauded by Mr. Shafer in his address to the board of governors Wednesday. **********Now, the United States is leading an effort to require the bank to better use its ongoing earnings to buoy its Asian Development Fund, the chief source of financing for so-called concessional lending, loans made on favorable terms to countries in need of development help. The bank is seeking $5.3 billion to replenish its Asian Development Fund, the seventh in its series of fund-raising exercises to benefit the region's poorest countries. **********\"We realize that under a new environment, concessional funds have become more scarce,\" said the bank's treasurer, Tadahiro Asami, who is directing a re-examination of the way the bank allocates its revenue, resources and risks. \"We have to carry out the ADF-7 negotiations against this backdrop of change.\" **********The United States is not alone in telling the bank that its hopes for the fund may be too high unless it gets larger contributions from East Asian members that have shown impressive economic growth lately. \"Many donors face severe budgetary constraints which seriously limit their capacity to provide the same level of support as in the past,\" said New Zealand's chief representative to the bank, Lockwood Smith, urging newly wealthy Asian members to shoulder an increased portion of the development burden. **********Washington's ability to lead the debate has been hampered by its failure to pay $337 million of the $680 million it pledged for the development fund in 1991. **********The United States is the only one of 24 donor countries to be in arrears, a situation that elicits both sympathy and keen concern from its peers about Washington's future actions toward this and other development banks. **********\"We are extremely disappointed with the lack of leadership by the United States,\" said Mats Karlsson, state secretary of Sweden's Foreign Ministry, echoing sentiments expressed by several other European delegations. **********\"We have talked about being more efficient for 10 years, and we are making great progress here,\" he added. \"Should talk of less support now be the response? There is no logic to this.\" **********The unpopularity of foreign aid in a U.S. Congress dominated by conservative Republicans has caused Washington to fall behind in its commitments to the World Bank's soft-loan arm as well. The failure to clear up those arrears while working on a new fund-raising effort prompted other donors to the International Development Association countries to negotiate a provisional solution without the United States. **********The interim program penalizes the United States by preventing U.S. companies from participating in any of the development association's contracts until Washington comes up with the funds it has agreed to contribute. **********But excluding U.S. companies from contracts only makes it more difficult for the government to ask Congress for funds, Mr. Shafer said. **********\"The people who think an IDA-type solution would lead the U.S. Congress to act to redress the problem should listen closely to the questions I have to answer,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/10/business/at-the-gate-getting-a-grip-on-the-value-of-a-glamorous-new-act.html": {"writer_name": "Reed Abelson", "pub_date": "1996-03-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1560, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AT THE GATE;Getting a Grip on the Value Of a Glamorous New Act", "print_headline": "AT THE GATE;Getting a Grip on the Value Of a Glamorous New Act", "body_text": " **********WHEN Planet Hollywood International makes its appearance as an initial public offering this spring, it is likely to be one of the year's hottest performers. Crowds always gather when the company opens a new restaurant, and investors are  expected to come for the same reason the crowds assemble: celebrity glitz. **********\"Obviously, it's going to be a deal that gets a lot of press attention and publicity,\" said George Novello, the portfolio manager of the Smith Barney Special Equities Fund who plans to invest in the stock. That buzz, he believes,  will translate into profits for those who buy the new issue. **********While Planet Hollywood has not yet revealed the price or volume of shares it will offer, it's not too early for investors to make rough estimates of the company's worth -- and try to avoid overpaying for the sought-after stock. As such, investors will be doing just what the company and its underwriters will do when they try to fix a range of possible prices for the issue, with which they hope to raise as much as $190.5 million. The money will mostly be used to pay off debts, but also to expand the chain. **********In valuing a soon-to-be-public company, the first job is to find those public companies most similar to it. With Planet Hollywood, that's not simple. **********While there are several publicly traded restaurant stocks, like McDonald's and Applebee's, Planet Hollywood, which is based in Orlando, Fla., bills itself  as a theme restaurant that mixes entertainment -- loud music, videos and displays of Hollywood memorabilia -- with standard fare like pizza, hamburgers and pasta. Much of the restaurants' appeal depends on convincing stars -- they double as big Planet Hollywood stockholders -- like Bruce Willis and Whoopi Goldberg to show up at the openings of new restaurants and to appear occasionally at existing ones. **********Unlike a typical restaurant chain, Planet Hollywood also sells a lot of related merchandise, from a $3.50 pin to a $325 leather jacket. Almost 40 percent of its sales are from such products. **********Theme restaurants are risky: today's hot theme can be passe tomorrow. But because of profitable merchandise sales, their stocks command higher prices than a typical restaurant chain, said Linda Killian, an analyst for Renaissance Capital, a research firm. **********However, the only other publicly held theme restaurants, Rainforest Cafe and  Dave & Buster's, are much smaller than Planet Hollywood. The only similarly sized public company that comes close to a theme approach is the Starbucks Corporation, the chain that is \"not only selling coffee but also cachet\" in the  form of T-shirts and coffee mugs, as Ms. Killian says. **********Starbucks has a current market value of about $1.4 billion, or roughly three  times its trailing annual sales of $519 million. By the same measure, Planet Hollywood, which had 1995 sales of $270.6 million, could command a market value  of around $800 million. **********But that calculation is just one way to get a hint of Planet Hollywood's value. A second looks at speed of company growth. Because of its tiny size, for  instance, Rainforest Cafe is expected to be able to double its earnings annually, said Andrew Zarnett, an analyst with Ladenburg Thalmann. Thus, the market values Rainforest stock at a market value that is equivalent to 11 times  the company's 1995 revenues of $13.5 million. **********But such a rate is unduly optimistic for Planet Hollywood, whose market value would be about $3 billion under it. While the company does expect to add 17 restaurants this year, and to develop restaurants with themes tied to athletes and Marvel comic book characters, its growth rate will still probably be much less than Rainforest's. **********Then comes the \"I.P.O. discount,\" which analysts use to factor in the inexperience and modest size typical of new public companies. When the enterprise sells a large amount of stock and when it is far less seasoned than its peers, this discount can rise to as much as 20 percent, said Brian P. Hehir, managing director for equity capital markets for Merrill Lynch, which is not involved in Planet Hollywood's deal. **********But Planet Hollywood scores fairly high by this measure. While Rainforest Cafe had just one restaurant, with less than a year under its belt, when it went public last year, Planet Hollywood has been in business for more than five years and operates 28 restaurants worldwide. \"This is a real company with real earnings and with real global expansion,\" said David Menlow, president of IPO Financial Network, a research firm. **********But despite its five years of revenue, Planet Hollywood did not turn a profit until 1995. And the company's four largest restaurants accounted for more than 40 percent of last year's total sales. Such concentrated revenues would make it  very vulnerable to a problem at one of the locations. **********And there are questions about how many more restaurants the company can build. It acknowledges that few, if any, cities can support more than one Planet Hollywood, and only so many places can support even one. An Orlando or a Las Vegas can attract enough tourists and locals, according to Ron Paul, the president of Technomic Inc., a restaurant consulting firm in Chicago. But with 28 outlets, the chain may soon have to head into smaller, less lucrative markets. **********Even so, there is no arguing that Planet Hollywood stock will be hip. The underwriters can probably count on a lot of buyers desperate to own the same stock as Demi Moore and Don Johnson. Ms. Killian, the analyst, would put Planet  Hollywood's market value at $1 billion, at least, in part because of this celebrity premium. **********Nevertheless, Planet Hollywood is not without risk of losing its appeal. People who flock to the restaurants today may suddenly find the experience -- music that some might call overbearing and food that some would describe as mediocre -- a bore. **********And celebrity connections are no proof against disaster. Wilt Chamberlain had to cancel plans to take his restaurant public, for instance. There have been plenty of casualties among other \"hot concept\" restaurants, too, Mr. Paul said.  Victoria Station, which had a railroad theme, also ran off the track. **********It may also be that the celebrities will desert Planet Hollywood, not vice versa. **********To be sure, Planet Hollywood is working hard to keep the stars that are so crucial to its success -- so hard that shareholders may object to the company's generosity. The company has given the stars and industry executives roughly 12.8 million shares. That's 16 percent of the company's outstanding private shares, and it doesn't even count options to buy another 2.25 million shares at $7.88 apiece. **********As is often the case, the stars can cash in some of their shares in the not-too-distant future. And -- only in Hollywood -- they can sell their shares to the company if a \"high profile senior executive officer is convicted of a felony, or for use of illegal drugs, or of a crime of moral turpitude\" and the company is harmed as a result. But the celebrities must hold the shares for at least six months after the offering, and keep at least half their stake for three years. **********If the stars eventually bail out, they will have much less reason to make restaurant appearances. Even with substantial stock ownership by the stars, the  company may have difficulty luring the stars to the smaller cities where new outlets will be unveiled.  Bruce and Demi may have been willing to go to Aspen,  but what about Scranton, Pa.? **********If Planet Hollywood loses its glitz -- and this may explain the company's stock deals with its stars -- then investors may decide the company is no more entertaining than a typical restaurant chain, like Outback Steakhouse. That stock sells for just 31 times trailing earnings. At that valuation, Planet Hollywood would have a market value of just $600 million. **********There may also be trouble from another direction: growing competition in the  booming field of theme restaurants. There's Hard Rock Cafe, which pioneered the  concept, as well as Brooklyn Diner, Motown Cafe and others. RKO Pictures plans to build a $35 million, five-restaurant complex in Times Square, with each restaurant featuring a distinct theme with live music -- like Western movies and country tunes. \"If it goes as well as we think it will, it can be a new kind of  entry into this whole field,\" said Ted Hartley, the chairman of RKO Pictures. **********All these factors will influence investors, underwriters and executives as they seek a fair value for Planet Hollywood. But more general factors will also  have an impact. **********In the weeks ahead, for example, the underwriters will keep a close watch on  the gyrations of the overall stock market and the popularity of restaurant stocks in particular. \"In the course of three weeks, you can have a severe change,\" Mr. Hehir said.  Then comes a practical, pocketbook limit: Underwriters are unlikely to ask for more than $20 a share, said Ms. Killian, because they don't want to alienate small investors, who are expected to be eager buyers. **********Among all this information, the most valuable may be this: Beware glamour. Such stocks \"come to market with sizzle,\" warned John E. Fitzgibbon, the editor  of the IPO Aftermarket, a publication of the Securities Data Company. \"But when  it's all over, all you're looking at is some dead cow.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/06/business/exxon-to-add-to-surge-in-oil-from-north-sea.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1996-02-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 348, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Exxon to Add To Surge in Oil From North Sea", "print_headline": "Exxon to Add To Surge in Oil From North Sea", "body_text": " **********The Exxon Corporation said yesterday that it would spend $800 million to develop a big oilfield in the Norwegian part of the North Sea, adding to the area's surging output. **********A surprisingly strong flow from the wells of Norway and Britain has checked the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to push up prices at a time when world demand has grown. **********The Exxon project, which the company said would begin production in early 1997 and plateau at 75,000 barrels a day, will add to the growth and put pressure on OPEC's sales of about 25.9 million barrels a day. **********William L.

Mr. Allen, in a long and testy message to all company employees on Monday, said he had actually taken a 20 percent cut in cash compensation and was \"in line with C.E.O.'s of comparable companies.\" **********But Mr. Allen's pay package, which is included in a proxy statement that AT&T sent to shareholders on Monday, is likely to antagonize many workers and increase bad publicity that has already infuriated the usually unflappable chief executive. **********In the last several weeks, AT&T and its layoffs have come under a torrent of  hostile coverage on television, newspapers and news magazines that have highlighted the company's cutbacks as a sign of deeper troubles in the American  workplace. AT&T has also come under repeated attack by Patrick J. Buchanan, the  Republican Presidential contender, who has cited the company as an example of how big corporations shirk their responsibilities to ordinary workers. **********Mr. Allen, in a message to all of AT&T's 303,000 employees, lashed out against what he called \"relentless\" and \"inaccurate\" news coverage and defended  his business judgment, his salary and his empathy for the \"painful results\" of AT&T's job cuts. **********\"Restructuring to get to a strong future does unfortunately require force reductions,\" he said. \"I'm not immune to the emotions they engender. I'm deeply  saddened by the pain and loss this is causing some of our people and their families. But in the end, concern isn't enough.\" **********AT&T's core long-distance telephone and equipment manufacturing businesses were fairly healthy last year, generating $79 billion in revenues. With intense  new competition on the horizon, however, Mr. Allen embarked on a corporate revamping last month that included taking more than $6 billion in write-offs and announcing plans to cut 40,000 workers. **********Despite the huge write-offs, as well as the confession that AT&T's $7.5 billion purchase in 1990 of the big NCR computer company had been a complete failure, Mr. Allen's compensation got a substantial lift last year. **********His cash compensation, in salary and bonuses, did in fact decrease about 20 percent from 1994 to $2.67 million. But Mr. Allen also got 750,000 stock options to buy AT&T stock at $63.50; the stock closed today at $64, down $1 on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Mr. Allen cannot exercise those options for at least four years, and company  executives said that 75 percent of those options could not be exercised until AT&T stock had increased from 10 to 30 percent above $63.50. **********\"We want to retain these guys in the business,\" said Dick Gray, head of investor relations for AT&T.  \"These options are designed to operate for the long-term good of the company.\" **********But Graef S.

And that is exactly what the Stratosphere Tower, Casino and Hotel seemed to have. **********Let the other casinos have their volcanoes, pyramids, huge guitars and shark tanks. At the cost of a mere $550 million, the Stratosphere Corporation conjured up a 1,149-foot-high hotel, gambling and retail spire, the tallest building west of the Mississippi. Its pinnacle was wrapped with a roller coaster and then topped with a heart-stopping slingshot of a ride called the Big Shot. **********The Stratosphere -- which is about 43 percent owned by Grand Casinos, Inc. -- was the toast of the town when it opened on April 30. And Wall Street liked the  stock, sending its price to a peak of nearly $14 just before the opening, up from about $8 at the end of last year. The market had generally been good to the gambling stocks for months, and particularly liked any company that talked up an expensive new casino project. **********That was then. **********Shares of Stratosphere have since tumbled, to $5.8125, off 43.75 cents, yesterday in Nasdaq trading and gambling revenues have been deeply disappointing -- $7.7 million after the first five weeks. **********\"What I think is happening is that the people who are attracted to a facility like that are not necessarily the people who are going to sit down and do some serious gaming,\" said Scott Renner, an analyst with Salomon Brothers, which has  lowered earnings estimates just two months after the tower's opening. Salomon is now predicting earnings of 5 cents a share this year, compared with an earlier forecast of 20 cents a share. **********Dennis I. Forst, an analyst at Hancock Institutional Equity Services, said: \"The hype moved the stock more than it should have. Frankly, it says more about  the securities business than the gaming business. I see further downside risk in the stock.\" **********But there are several lessons in the Stratosphere's problems that are already having big implications for the industry. One is that while the casino business  is about entertainment, it ultimately has to be about the entertaining qualities of gambling. **********Several other Las Vegas casinos have spent huge sums learning this lesson. The MGM Grand built a splashy amusement park on some 30 acres of prime land and  Circus Circus constructed its Grand Slam Canyon amusement complex. Both have done poorly and MGM Grand has announced that it is going to cut the space at its park roughly in half. **********But what is important is that the idea of building an attraction has been refined, not dropped, by the industry. Take yesterday's announcement by ITT that its Caesars Palace subsidiary is planning to construct two big casinos with the  Planet Hollywood themed restaurant chain, one in Las Vegas and the other in Atlantic City. **********In this venture, the amusement part of the business will be integrated with the gaming hall, trying to make gambling itself more fun. That is the real trend in gambling, not human slingshots. The Hilton in Las Vegas is constructing a big Star Trek themed casino and amusement area and the musically themed Hard Rock Hotel and Casino has been packed since its opening last year. **********The point is that at some point, entertainment can become a mere distraction, not an enhancement of the experience for a gambler. **********Another major lesson is that location counts more than gimmicks. The Stratosphere is at the north end of the legendary Las Vegas Strip, almost a mile from the nearest giant resort. The casino companies accept now that gamblers are going to stroll from one casino to the next in the never-ending search for Lady  Luck, and that having other attractive properties nearby is a competitive advantage. **********\"It's difficult to overcome the fact that it's not in a great location,\" Mr.  Renner of Salomon Brothers said of the Stratosphere. (The new ITT-Planet Hollywood casinos will be in prime locations.) **********Yet another problem is that the Stratosphere, whose opening was delayed by various problems, may still have opened too soon. Its retail complex is not yet  completed, and an additional 1,000 hotel rooms, on top of the existing 1,500, will not open until next year. **********\"The biggest mistake a company can make is to open too soon,\" said Jason Ader, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company. \"First impressions can last a long time.\" **********He added: \"Most of the problems are fixable. But these are the growing pains  of a young company learning about the business.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/28/world/serbs-in-pragmatic-pullout-from-albanian-region.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1996-07-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1327, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Serbs in Pragmatic Pullout from Albanian Region", "print_headline": "Serbs in Pragmatic Pullout from Albanian Region", "body_text": " **********In 1989 the Serbian strongman, Slobodan Milosevic, swooped down in a helicopter onto the field where 600 years earlier the Turks had defeated the Serbs at the Battle of Kosovo. In a fervent speech before a million Serbs, he galvanized the nationalist passions that two years later fueled the Balkan conflict. **********Now, in this bedraggled southern province of Kosovo, a predominantly Albanian Muslim region where President Milosevic promised a glorious future for the minority Serbs, the Balkan conflict appears to be playing out a subdued denouement. **********More than 90 percent of Kosovo's two million people are Albanians, and their resentment of Serbia's assertion of dominance has long made Kosovo a tinderbox that has threatened to entangle Macedonia, Albania, Greece and Turkey in a wider Balkan conflict. **********But instead of seeing Kosovo reinforced as a Serbian stronghold with the resettlement of Serbs from the former Yugoslavia, as Mr. Milosevic promised, the last Serbs of Kosovo are fleeing, embittered that their leader appears to be deserting them. **********\"Many Serbs are leaving right now,\" said Momcilo Tradkovic, a former Serbian  Governor of Kosovo. \"More than 50 percent of the Serbs in Kosovo have already built houses in Serbia. If this continues, the bulk of the Serbs will leave in the next five years, and after that it won't matter.\" **********The idea that Mr. Milosevic might allow Kosovo, the cradle of Serb history and mythology, to drift away would have been preposterous at the height of the Balkan war. **********But boxed in by the Dayton peace agreement, which requires Serbia to safeguard the rights of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo or forgo access to international credits, Mr. Milosevic appears to be undecided about what to do, Western diplomats say. **********The United States, in an attempt to demonstrate its seriousness about enforcing the accord, opened an information center here on July 20 -- the first  office of a foreign power in Kosovo's capital. And in another effort to keep Mr. Milosevic on better behavior, the Clinton Administration has said it will not send an ambassador to Belgrade while Serbian authorities continue to abuse Albanians' human rights. **********The possibility that Mr. Milosevic may be preparing to soften his stance on Kosovo was further signaled in a recent paper by a member of the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts, who argued that the Albanians and Serbs should share power  in Kosovo or divide the province into two ethnic enclaves. In the past, Mr. Milosevic has often used the academy as a harbinger of policy shifts. **********And in a move that was interpreted by the Serbs of Kosovo as another betrayal by the leader they increasingly distrust, Mr. Milosevic signed an agreement with the German Government this month that calls for the return to Kosovo of 120,000  Albanian refugees now in Germany. **********The tensions over Kosovo intensified in 1990 when Mr. Milosevic infuriated the Albanian majority by revoking Kosovo's autonomy and incorporating it into Serbia. He then strengthened the hand of the heavily armed Serbian police who, human rights monitors say, have made life miserable for the Albanians. About 120,000 Albanians have been dismissed from jobs in state-run plants in the last  five years, the monitors say, and Albanians have been subject to arbitrary arrests, beatings and shakedowns. **********In 1993 Zeljko Raznjatovic, the paramilitary leader known as Arkan, who did much of the \"ethnic cleansing\" of Bosnia for Mr. Milosevic, turned up in Kosovo  to warn the Albanians what might be in store for them. **********Human-rights abuses persist, said Fred Abraham, a monitor from Human Rights Watch in New York, who recently spent a month in Kosovo. **********\"The most severe problem is police violence and torture,\" he said, adding that Albanians were frequently stopped in their cars by the police and beaten. Detention and sometimes torture in prison were particularly directed to politically active Albanians, he said. **********Ibrahim Rugova, a former Albanian Communist leader during Tito's rule, has been leading a campaign for Albanian independence. Some more moderate Albanian leaders say they would accept a halfway step of autonomy, leading to eventual independence. To underline this goal, Mr. Rugova has formed a shadow government  and established separate Albanian schools, medical facilities and local councils, much of it with funds from Albanians abroad. **********Mr. Rugova's nonviolent civil disobedience and his support from Albanian exiles in Switzerland, Germany and the United States have resulted in a parallel society. Satellite dishes directed toward Tirana, the capital of Albania, enhance even the poorest Albanian dwelling here, suggesting that while Albanians physically live in Serbian-ruled territory, mentally they are elsewhere. **********The inability of the financially strapped Mr. Milosevic to prevent the economic free fall in Kosovo is also propelling the steady Serb exodus, Serbs say. **********\"There is no life for us here,\" said Milica Borzos, a Serbian pensioner whose ancestry in Kosovo goes back centuries and who has seen the once prosperous zinc mining town of Zvecan, where she lives, sink into despair. **********With most industry shuttered and agriculture moribund, Kosovo is kept afloat  largely from the proceeds of Albanian drug-running to Europe and remittances from Albanian expatriates. **********With the help of the drug money that filters down into Albanian villages from the couriers who drive their flashy cars from Kosovo to Switzerland, many Albanians are able to build a future that some Serbs, Mr. Tradkovic asserted, are beginning to envy. **********In Veliki Trnovac, a strategically located Serbian village that borders Kosovo, a handful of tightly knit Albanian families are reported by Western drug enforcement agencies to control the traffic of heroin as it passes from Turkey to Germany and Switzerland. **********Expensive European cars with Swiss license plates and tinted windows parked on the village's narrow streets are the only outward signs of the courier system that is reportedly run out of the village. But a cafe owner gave a sense of the importance of the European connections. **********\"There are 25-year-old men who linger in the street who have never worked in  their lives,\" said the owner, who would give his name only as Ibrahim. \"They are just waiting for money to come from Switzerland.\" **********To help pay the $300-a-month rent for his cafe, Ibrahim said, he received money from three brothers in Switzerland. **********Fehmi Agani, a sociology professor and vice president of the main Albanian party, the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo, acknowledged that Albanians were involved in drug trafficking. But he said that the Albanians were not \"in charge\" of the drug trade and served only as couriers. \"People have no other way to survive,\" he said. **********And when Kosovo Albanians end up in Swiss jails on charges of drug trafficking -- about 3,000 are currently being held -- life is not so bad, he said. **********\"A large number of people live better in jail in Switzerland than here in freedom,\" said Mr. Agani, who gets by with the help of $150 his son sends each month from Germany. **********The ability of the Albanians to survive economically, by legal or other means, rankles many Serbs, particularly those who arrived in Kosovo last year as refugees from Croatia. **********In the basement of an ostentatious sports hall here built by Tito to celebrate the brotherhood of Yugoslavia's Serbs and Albanians languish about 500 ethnic Serbs who fled the Krajina region of Croatia last year as Croatian troops advanced and Mr. Milosevic failed to come to the Serbs' defense. **********Instead of finding refuge in the heart of Serbdom, they now feel abandoned at the end of the world. **********About 15,000 of the estimated 150,000 Krajina Serbs were sent by the Belgrade authorities to Kosovo. And like many of their Kosovo brethren, they are desperate to leave. **********Mladenka Rajlic, the mother of two children, has visited all the shrines of Kosovo: ornate Orthodox churches, monasteries and the medieval battlefield where Mr. Milosevic proclaimed his vision of a new Serbia. **********But history left her unimpressed. **********\"God forbid I should stay here; this place is 300 years behind civilization,\" Mrs. Rajlic shuddered as she sat in a makeshift room with no running water. \"I'm only 36 and I'd rather die than remain in Kosovo.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/27/business/international-briefs-russia-cancels-bill-sale.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 59, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Russia Cancels Bill Sale", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Russia Cancels Bill Sale", "body_text": " **********Russia canceled a bill auction planned for today after Merrill Lynch withdrew from the sale and yields soared.

The declaration also incorporated a plan for the American military to return an air base, two communications centers, a port and other military properties on Okinawa, where the rape of the girl set off anti-American protests. **********The leaders also signed a separate document setting forth areas of cooperation between the two nations on regional disputes and in the United Nations. **********On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Clinton visited an aircraft carrier that had recently been deployed in the Taiwan Strait in order to thank the American forces serving in Japan. **********On the carrier deck of the Independence, the oldest active ship in the service, under the banner \"Don't Tread on Me,\" Mr. Clinton told the sailors and  marines that their presence in the strait during China's military exercises \"reassured nations all around the Pacific.\" **********The President also saluted the crew of the Japanese cruiser Myoko, who had joined the ceremonies at the Yokosuka Naval Base outside Tokyo. **********\"Fifty years ago no one would have believed that an American carrier and a Japanese cruiser could be berthed side by side, that our forces would work shoulder to shoulder, day in and day out,\" Mr. Clinton said. **********On Wednesday night the President and his wife were welcomed by Emperor Akihito at a white-tie state dinner in the Imperial Palace.

There is a chance, he said, that the yield on today's 10-year note could be below the 25-year low of 5.69 reached in November 1993, and the 30-year bond below the more-than-20-year low of 6.33 percent in August 1993. **********\"The economic fundamentals, low inflation and the slowdown in economic growth are positives,\" Mr. Guild said, \"while the big negative remains the impasse between Congress and the President on budget and debt ceiling. I personally do not believe the market will do well until the issues are resolved, which may not be until after the election. As a result short rates likely will decline more than long rates.\" **********Traders said investors bid strongly for the three-year notes because they believed that the Federal Reserve would continue to lower interest rates to help the economy. The average yield on the three-year notes was down from 5.549 percent in November and the lowest since 4.83 percent on Feb. 8, 1994. **********In when-issued trading, the 10-year notes in today's auction were being offered at a price to yield 5.65 percent, and Thursday's 30-year bond, 6.06 percent. **********Last week the Fed lowered short-term rates for the third time in eight months, cutting the Federal funds rate a quarter-point, to 5.25 percent. **********David Ader, managing analyst with Technical Data in Boston, termed yesterday  an uneventful day, with buying interest at the note auction seen coming from central banks and retail investors. \"Although today's auction went off without a hitch, the 10- and 30-year auctions will not be as easy,\" he said. **********\"The market is currently trading in the middle of a range,\" Mr. Ader added, \"and players don't know if they want to buy or sell. I expect, though, that the  market is setting itself up for a buy.\" **********The economic reports issued yesterday were the Mitsubishi Bank/ Schroder Wertheim report on retail sales, which showed salesdown three-tenths of a percent for the week ended Saturday, and the Johnson Redbook report, which put retail sales for the first week in February up seven-tenths of a percent. **********Elsewhere in the fixed-income market, Argentina plans to sell $1 billion in five-year bonds within the next several weeks, said an official at Merrill Lynch & Company, which will co-manage the sale with CS First Boston. **********Argentina had planned to sell $750 million worth of bonds in January, with those bonds expected to be priced to yield about 425 basis points more than comparable United States Treasury securities. According to traders, Argentine bonds have rallied in recent months as investors bet that the country would emerge from a recession in 1996 and more money would flow into emerging markets. **********Bloomberg Business News said the Argentine 8 3/8 percent global bond due in 2003 was trading around 89 1/2, up from 72 on Nov. 15, dropping the yield to 10.35 percent, 485 basis points more than comparable United States Treasury securities. **********Slim pickings in higher corporate-grade issues brought investors out for yesterday's junk-bond sale by the El Paso Electric Company, which is emerging from bankruptcy. **********Underwriters led by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette priced six maturities running from 3 to 15 years, with the longest maturity priced to yield 8.9 percent. **********The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-year notes: **********(000 omitted in dollar figures) **********Average Price . . . 99.882 Average Yield . . . 5.043% Low Price . . . 99.873 High Yield . . . 5.046% High Price . . . 99.898 Low Yield . . . 5.037% Accepted at low price . . . 51% Total applied for . . . $49,440,971 Accepted . . . $18,505,941 Noncompetitive . . . $857,000 Interest set at . . . 5% **********The three-year notes mature on Feb. 15, 1999."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/07/business/worldbusiness/IHT-tensions-over-single-currency-intensify.html": {"writer_name": "Tom Buerkle", "pub_date": "1996-11-07", "snippet": "The tensions underlying the European Union's drive toward a single currency were exposed Wednesday by two official reports, one that criticized national governments for running excessive budget deficits and one that predicted 12 of the 15 EU count...", "word_count": 3917, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tensions Over Single Currency Intensify", "print_headline": "Tensions Over Single Currency Intensify", "body_text": " **********The tensions underlying the European Union's drive toward a single currency were exposed Wednesday by two official reports, one that criticized national governments for running excessive budget deficits and one that predicted 12 of the 15 EU countries would get their financial books in order by next year. **********The reports from the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute illustrated the conflicting agendas of EU governments and their central banks. The commission's report reflected the view of governments, which have resorted in recent weeks to accounting moves and rosy economic scenarios to present 1997 budgets that meet the requirements for a single currency. **********Meanwhile, the EMI echoed the views of central banks, led by the Bundesbank, which insist on strict compliance with the Maastricht treaty's criteria to guarantee the stability of the Euro. **********But both reports were in line with expectations and did little to alter the view in financial markets that Europe is more likely than not to launch the single currency in 1999 \u2014 primarily for political reasons rather than economic ones. **********\"The bottom line is that the markets remain fairly positive,\" said Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Goldman. Sachs & Co. in Frankfurt. **********The monetary institute, the forerunner of a future European central bank, said in its annual report on compliance with the single-currency rules that progress in reducing deficits \"has generally been too slow.\" The report also adopted the tough language used by senior Bundesbank officials in recent months: It cited the need for sustainable compliance with the economic criteria and delivered an unmistakable criticism of France's bid to meet the deficit target with a pre-privatization payment of 37.5 billion francs ($7.32 billion) from France Telecom to the French treasury. **********\"The improvement of the deficit by measures with a one-off effect does not ensure sustainable consolidation, and great attention will have to be paid to the substance and not only to the accounting methods used in measuring both deficits and debt,\" the report said. **********Italy, Spain and Portugal have unveiled ambitious deficit-reduction programs for 1997 in recent weeks in a bid to qualify for monetary union from the outset. But Bundesbank officials, led by President Hans Tietmeyer, have increasingly insisted that countries meet the criteria on a lasting basis rather than with a last-minute rush. **********The commission, meanwhile, predicted that all EU countries except Italy, Greece and Britain would get their deficits down to or below the single-currency ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product in 1997, compared with an EU average of 4.4 percent this year. **********The progress in part reflects an upturn in growth, which the commission forecast would rise to an average of 2.3 percent in 1997 from 1.6 percent this year. **********The commission assumed that national governments would deliver on the deficit-cutting promises made in recent weeks, a view not shared by many private forecasters. For example, the commission's forecast of a 2.9 percent deficit for Germany next year is much more optimistic than the 3.5 percent forecast issued by the top six German economic institutes just last week. **********Meanwhile, financial markets regard the commission forecasts as a \"nice statement of objectives\" rather than a serious forecast, said Alison Cottrell, economist at PaineWebber in London. **********By forecasting a French deficit of 3 percent next year, the commission endorsed the government's use of the France Telecom payment, a move criticized by Germany. But in an unexpected warning to Paris, Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the commissioner for monetary affairs, said countries would be judged in early 1998 on the \"durable character\" of their budget reforms. **********\"We will not be content with one-shot measures,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/06/business/company-news-bristol-myers-squibb-increases-buyback-plan.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 95, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB INCREASES BUYBACK PLAN", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB INCREASES BUYBACK PLAN", "body_text": " **********The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company said yesterday that it had increased its share repurchase program 50 percent, to 75 million shares from 50 million, to help raise shareholder value.

Like many working-class boys of his generation in eastern Connecticut, he had entered Windham Regional Vocational-Technical School to learn a trade and follow in his father's footsteps. **********Last month, Mr. Brand was among some 200 alumni who attended a reunion dinner-dance at Tech, as they call the school, entering from bright sunshine into a building many had not visited since graduation. **********Members of classes spanning five decades gathered in small groups on the gymnasium floor, beneath bunches of blue and white balloons and yards of bunting, to exhume adolescent memories of shop routines and classroom pranks. As late afternoon slipped into evening, they also examined their working lives and  whether the maxims they learned about jobs and security still held true for their sons and daughters. **********\"We are the lucky ones, the last of the working rich,\" said Dave Meikle of the class of 1959, a modest man with a quick smile who has worked 32 years as an electronics technician at the Pratt & Whitney aircraft engine plant in East Hartford. \"We still hold good-paying industrial jobs we were trained to do.\" **********But Mr. Meikle, 55, says he will accept an incentive package to leave his job by the end of summer, a program he says is intended to eliminate senior workers  at his wage level of $20 an hour. Similarly, Ronald Drouin, 54, a classmate of Mr. Meikle, hopes to get a buyout at the Electric Boat submarine division of General Dynamics in Groton before his job is eliminated in a new round of 2,000  layoffs this summer. He has worked at Electric Boat as a draftsman for 33 years. **********\"Electric Boat and Pratt were companies a guy who came out of Tech could always find work,\" said Mr. Meikle, who studied television and radio repair at Tech and then went into the Navy, where he was trained in electronics. \"When I started at Pratt in 1964, we had 20,000 hourly workers at the East Hartford plant. Now we're down to 2,500.\" **********For earlier generations, the mainstay of employment was the American Thread Company, a mill that opened in 1854 on the banks of the Willimantic River, a swift-running ribbon of turbulent water that bisects this community of 22,000. At one time, the mill had 2,500 workers tending 30,000 spindles, which turned out everything from Aunt Lydia's carpet and button thread to material used in the making of fire hoses, seat belts and baseballs. The city's identity was so interwoven with the mill that the centerpiece of emblems on police cars was a thread spool. **********In 1985, American Thread shut down the Willimantic operation and moved to North Carolina. The abandoned mill still stands like a haunted relic of past economic glory, a chain of sturdy stone and brick buildings dominated by a smokestack with a handsome mosaic design on its blunt tip 175 feet above the ground. **********Textiles were already seen as a dead-end industry by the time the new vo-tech school opened in 1956 on the north brow of the shallow valley overlooking the mill. Mr. Meikle and Mr. Drouin enrolled that fall as eager sophomores and signed up for shops intended to feed the growing demand for workers in military-related industries and the home construction trades. **********The school they came back to this year again reflects a changing marketplace. Service industry jobs are replacing those based in manufacturing; culinary arts  and health care courses have far more students than tool-and-die making. **********\"There are still small machine shops around, but we have a tough time encouraging kids to go into that line of work,\" said Paul Manzone, a guidance counselor at Tech for 24 years. \"You don't hear them say anymore, 'Dad is going  to get me a job in the union and I'll lead the good life.' **********\"Now you hear them say, 'My parents are divorced and my father is working in  Florida and I'm headed south as soon as I get out of school.' \" **********If they stay around, he continued, many take state jobs; the three largest employers in the area are the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Eastern Connecticut State University in Windham, and a nearby state prison. Otherwise, he said, unless a local contractor is hiring, the only opening may be at Home Depot for $9 an hour. **********Many in the gymnasium said the shifting economy had forced them to switch jobs. Mr. Brand quit carpentry to teach at another vo-tech school, a choice he did not regret as the home building boom of the 1980's collapsed in this decade. Horace Geer, 54, used his fingers to pick off the number of jobs he has held since leaving Tech in 1960; he stopped when he got to 10. **********\"Next week I start work as a janitor at Foxwoods Casino, run by the Indians,\" he said with a husky voice as \"A Teen-Ager in Love\" by Dion and the Belmonts drifted through the gymnasium, part of a taped stream of reunion nostalgia. \"I don't know how long that will last, but they have good health benefits, which you can hardly get anymore.\" **********Steve LeBel, class of '79, expressed impatience when he heard the older men lament the loss of industrial jobs. **********\"Trouble is, they've been ruined by industry,\" said Mr. LeBel, who manages a  small machine shop. \"They're afraid of the new machines. A lot have been spoiled by union jobs. They didn't have to work hard and got lots of overtime and benefits. **********\"This guy from Pratt & Whitney comes by my shop looking for a job but he's not versatile and has a lot of holes in his skills. I tell him, 'I'll start you  off at 11 bucks an hour and see how it works out. Medical covers you but not your family and there's no pension.' **********\"He looks at me like I insulted him and walks out,\" Mr. LeBel said, a quizzical look on his goateed face. **********Dave Meikle took issue with that assessment. \"I believe we earned our high wages and benefits at Pratt,\" he said as he prepared to sit down for dinner in the cafeteria. \"The trouble is, those jobs are not there for the next generation because the work is being placed with vendors who are either out of the country  or don't pay union wages or benefits. **********\"Like I said, my class from the 50's was the lucky one. We knew what we wanted and it was there for us. It's just not that easy anymore,\" said the electronics technician, whose daughter, the youngest of his five children, graduated this spring from Yale with a degree in fine arts. **********By now, the sun rimmed the western skyline and lengthening shadows chased through the Willimantic valley. The turbulent ribbon of water rushed by the shuttered mill, which had once been a symbol of so much in this New England town, tossing spray in bursts of energy no longer yoked and converted to man's will. **********Only the mosaic-tipped brick chimney continued to catch the receding light creeping up its shaft, and in a few minutes that, too, blinked out."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/23/business/worldbusiness/IHT-economic-scene-rising-asian-deficits-threaten.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Richardson", "pub_date": "1996-03-23", "snippet": "Surging current-account deficits in several Southeast Asian countries, caused largely by a rapid rise in imports, are prompting government and monetary authorities to rethink free-trade policies..Economists estimate that spending by Indonesia, Mal...", "word_count": 3942, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ECONOMIC SCENE : Rising Asian Deficits Threaten Trade", "print_headline": "ECONOMIC SCENE : Rising Asian Deficits Threaten Trade", "body_text": " **********Surging current-account deficits in several Southeast Asian countries, caused largely by a rapid rise in imports, are prompting government and monetary authorities to rethink free-trade policies. **********Economists estimate that spending by Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand on imports of goods and services in 1996 is likely to exceed their export and other earnings by more than $30 billion **********While taking some measures to tighten credit and slow growth to more sustainable levels, Indonesia and Malaysia are also applying import-substitution programs.

The time seems ripe for this financial-services niche market to try to entice computer-savvy investors to experiment with on-line trading. **********The new campaign represents a change in marketing for PC Financial Network,  a Jersey City unit of the Equitable Companies' Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities division. For the first time since its start-up in 1988, the discount broker is advertising in traditional print and electronic media; previously, it  advertised only on Prodigy and America Online. **********Unlike its on-line ads and current advertising by many of its rivals, the new campaign by the network features clever, tongue-in-cheek humor. And unlike most  ads for on-line investing, PCFN's advertising does not feature commission charts and pictures of computer screens. **********Created by Goldsmith/Jeffrey -- which has also done award-winning work for J. P. Morgan Private Banking -- the black-and-white campaign has a tag line that says \"PCFN, you'll get attached to it.\" **********Each ad shows a single object, such as a piece of burnt toast. In that ad, the copy, a memo to a hypothetical investor, says PCFN knows how much the investor likes the convenience of trading on line, but reminds him or her that the toast is ready. The basic message: users become so engrossed in on-line trading they forget the demands of daily life. **********\"Traditional financial services advertising has talking heads discussing commissions and how much you can save,\" explained Stephen Killeen, PCFN's director of marketing.  \"Our goal is to say you can save, but also look at all the stuff you can do, on your own schedule.\" **********The new campaign -- costing an estimated $4 million to $5 million, less than  half of the network's annual marketing budget -- began last month. Print ads run through mid-summer in the financial and computer publications Barron's, Investor's Business Daily, Worth, Wired, Home PC and Individual Investor. Cable- TV advertising is running nationally on CNN, CNNfn and CNBC, in some cases through December. **********In addition, the campaign will run in the specific markets of New York, Seattle and San Diego, with ads in The New York Times, The Seattle Times and The San Diego Union Tribune and on A & E, Discovery and ESPN. **********Those areas, Mr. Killeen said, \"are pockets where there is high penetration of electronically enabled consumers.\" **********Goldsmith/Jeffrey is also preparing a direct-mail campaign for PC Financial Network, which is continuing its on-line advertising as well. **********The network's rivals, meanwhile, are themselves paying increasing sums to advertise their services. According to Competitive Media Reporting, Charles Schwab spent a hefty $654,000 just in January to advertise e.Schwab, which was introduced that month; people close to the account say that monthly media buys for the rest of the year will probably not match this level. **********Lombard, a division of Thomas F. White & Company, a San Francisco brokerage firm, is about to start a $2.4 million print and cable TV campaign by Tracy/Ryan & Partners of San Francisco; E*Trade, of Palo Alto, Calif., is estimated to be spending more than $300,000 a month on print, radio and on-line ads, quadrupling what it bought monthly in 1995's fourth quarter. **********The e.Schwab campaign is utterly straightforward, while Lombard and E*Trade inject some levity into their advertising. Both e.Schwab and E*Trade ads contain charts comparing commission structures for electronic trading among various firms. Typically, commissions charged by electronic brokers are smaller than those for conventional trading. **********Bill Bluestein, group director of new media research for Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass., said all electronic discount brokers have to get their advertising strategies in order because on-line investing \"is about to take a huge jump forward.\" **********\"Between 50 percent and 60 percent of mutual fund and discount broker clients have personal computers, but only a tiny percentage currently invest on line,\" he said. **********Mr. Bluestein found e.Schwab's advertising thrust appropriate for the \"hard-core, active trader,\" but predicted that PCFN's campaign could be more effective in the long term. **********\"The hard-core, active trader represents a minority of investors who use on-line services like AOL or Compuserve,\" he said. \"PCFN has developed a message that can span this frequent trader as well as the less active trader. PCFN's strategy is to stand out from the pack; its campaign has a broader reach.

Executives at both airlines said yesterday they were confident that they would win the required approvals for their alliance by November. **********But their proposal has already generated controversy because of the combined market power of American and British Airways, two large and profitable airlines whose combined route networks, including alliances with carriers like Qantas, would reach most continents. **********The two airlines currently provide 58 percent of the flights between the United States and Britain. By comparison, United Airlines, a unit of the UAL Corporation, and Lufthansa already have a similar alliance that accounts for 39 percent of flights between the United States and Germany. **********American is also only one of two United States carriers -- United is the other -- that is formally authorized to fly into London's Heathrow Airport, the world's busiest international hub, under an aviation agreement signed by Washington and London 50 years ago. **********Although an open-skies agreement would allow others to fly to Heathrow, using their own aircraft, the airport is at full capacity. That makes it unlikely for this deal to satisfy the concerns of all airlines and governments in each country. **********Delta Air Lines, for example, described as ''frightening'' the market dominance of an allied American Airlines and British Airways. A company spokesman said that Delta would need ''meaningful access'' to Heathrow before it went along with the plan. **********Delta and others are expected to file their concerns with the Justice Department, whose ruling on the proposed alliance would carry the weight of a recommendation to the Department of Transportation. The Transportation Department., which will rule on whether the proposal is anticompetitive, has said that it will require additional and ''commercially viable'' access to Heathrow for other United States carriers. **********But Robert L. Crandall, chairman of the AMR Corporation, American Airlines' parent company, said that any slots for takeoffs and landings would not come from American or British Airways, and that slots at Heathrow would be a make-or-break issue for the proposed alliance. **********''If we are expected to give up slots, this deal will not happen,'' he said. **********Jon F. Ash, a managing director at Global Aviation Associates, a Washington consulting firm, said yesterday that if Mr. Crandall was unwavering in his stance, ''this is going to be a tough battle.'' **********An American-British Airways partnership would be the latest major airline alliance between United States and European companies. Other deals include those between Northwest and KLM, United and Lufthansa, and Delta's alliances with Virgin Atlantic, Sabena, Swissair and Austrian Airlines. **********British Airways' alliance with USAir has been in place for several years, with the British carrier owning 24.6 percent of its smaller partner. **********American and British Airways officials said that their plan did not affect the USAir alliance, and that a new role for USAir might evolve in coming months. **********USAir said that yesterday's proposal ''has the potential to provide USAir with the ability to pursue new and positive opportunities.'' It did not elaborate, adding only that it would act in the best interests of its shareholders, employees and customers. **********USAir executives have said that one of their strategies is to expand the airline's international network. Industry analysts predicted yesterday that USAir would use the announcement as a reason to dissolve its marketing alliance with British Airways and to fly more international routes on its own. **********''The British Airways-American Airlines alliance probably severs the connection permanently,'' said Mark Ray, who manages a transportation bond portfolio for John Hancock Financial Services. **********Industry analysts have said that the relationship with USAir has grown lopsided as it evolved. Some analysts have suggested that British Airways has benefited more from USAir's vast domestic network than USAir has gained from British Airways' international routes, generating an additional $300 million in revenue for British Airways and a fraction of that for USAir."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/21/world/clothing-makers-taking-steps-to-limit-child-labor-abroad.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Myers", "pub_date": "1996-10-21", "snippet": "US Labor Department reports fewer children appear to be working overseas to make apparel sold in US as companies facing adverse publicity adopt standards barring such practices by subsidiaries and suppliers; says American companies have failed to ...", "word_count": 678, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Clothing Makers Taking Steps To Limit Child Labor Abroad", "print_headline": "Clothing Makers Taking Steps To Limit Child Labor Abroad", "body_text": " **********Fewer children appear to be working overseas to make apparel sold in the United States, as companies facing adverse publicity adopt standards barring such labor in their subsidiaries and suppliers, the Labor Department has found. **********But the department has also found that American companies did not adequately enforce their own standards, often known as ''codes of conduct,'' and that child labor remained pervasive in smaller factories and even in homes in some countries, particularly in Asia. **********In a report to be released on Monday, the department concluded that the codes of conduct had become increasingly common among the largest American retailers and manufacturers. With stricter enforcement, the report says, they could reduce the number of children working in foreign factories, often in dismal working conditions at substandard wages. **********''Codes of conduct are not a panacea,'' the report said. ''Child labor remains a serious problem -- with hundreds of millions of children working around the world.'' **********The survey was completed two years after two reports by the department concluded that children were involved in the production of garments for export to the United States -- often working long hours and receiving less than minimum wages and in some cases working in shops with armed guards blocking the exits. **********''This is a major change from just a few years ago, when importers were more inclined to avoid any responsibility on this matter,'' the report said. **********While the new report suggested that fewer children were working in these industries in some countries since those reports were released, it said it remained unclear that ''a downward trend in the use of child labor in garment production is a universal phenomenon.'' A cable from the American Embassy in Cambodia just last month, for example, reported children working in a garment factory there. **********Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said the latest report was the first comprehensive survey of efforts by American companies to address the problem. ''Although our laws don't reach to other nations, we can at the very least alert American consumers, the media and the major retailers and manufacturers to the extent of the problem with child labor,'' Mr. Reich said in a telephone interview on Friday. **********As imports of apparel have steadily climbed, working conditions in overseas factories have become a growing concern. The department noted that more than half of the $178 billion worth of garments sold in the United States in 1995 were imported, compared with 30 percent in 1980. **********In recent years, several companies have found themselves embarrassed by those conditions -- the most recent and most publicized example being the controversy last spring involving a line of clothing bearing Kathie Lee Gifford's name manufactured in Honduras. **********The department's new survey found that 36 of 42 of the largest apparel companies had adopted formal standards prohibiting child labor, as well as other labor violations like the use of forced labor. Many have done so only in the last couple of years. **********The department examined the companies' codes and visited six countries with significant imports to the United States -- the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, India and the Philippines -- to assess the effects the codes were having. **********The report concluded that child labor is ''not now prevalent'' in the Latin American countries surveyed, although there was anecdotal evidence that it had been common in the past. Only four of the companies that took part -- the Gap, Levi Strauss, Phillips-Van Heusen and Sears -- reported that they had themselves encountered cases of child labor. **********But the department also reported evidence that dates of birth documents had been falsified, suggesting efforts to evade the prohibitions, and that children continued to work for small subcontractors, including in the San Pedro de Sacatepequez region of Guatemala, an area with a substantial garment industry. **********And the department concluded that child labor remained a greater problem in Asia, with children in India and the Philippines working for small subcontractors or for their parents at home. **********The report recommends that all American retailers, manufacturers and buyers adopt stronger, more explicit and uniform standards and that they make a greater effort to enforce them."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/world/world-news-briefs-nigerian-publisher-wounded-by-gunmen.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 142, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs;Nigerian Publisher Wounded by Gunmen", "print_headline": "World News Briefs;Nigerian Publisher Wounded by Gunmen", "body_text": " **********The publisher of Nigeria's leading independent newspaper, The Guardian, has been shot and seriously wounded, the newspaper said today. **********Guardian executives said Alex Ibru, 61, was shot by unknown assailants here on Friday night while on his way from work. **********They said that the motive of the attack was not clear but that nothing was stolen from Mr. Ibru, a former Interior Minister in Gen.

Although communities have struggled for  centuries to preserve local laws and standards when they come into conflict with the outside world, the Internet and on-line information networks are presenting  them with new problems that defy old solutions. **********For example, German officials last month persuaded Ohio-based Compuserve to  cut off access to some 200 sex-related news forums worldwide. Chinese officials  said last week that they wanted to stop \"detrimental information\" from entering  the country via the Internet. And the United States Congress, in legislation still stalled by disagreement over other issues, has voted to halt the flow of \"indecent\" computer files through this country, even if the offensive material is created and maintained on computers halfway around the world. **********Even as pressure is intensifying to restrict the flow of pornography, hate speech and other offensive material in electronic form, Internet technologists say that ultimately there is no completely effective way to block the relatively small number of \"bad bits\" out of the torrents of data available to tens of millions of people in more than 150 countries. **********But there are some partial solutions. A growing industry has emerged in the last two years to offer individuals, schools and businesses a variety of tools,  ranging from complex computer barriers known as firewalls to simple software programs, to screen certain bits while allowing others to pass. Most of these tools are effective in stopping some unwanted data traffic, but none guarantees  100 percent effectiveness. **********\"Nothing we can do will be a perfect solution, for two important reasons,\" said Brian R. Ek, spokesman for an industry group trying to create the equivalent of a motion picture ratings system on the Internet. \"First, no matter what technologies we come up with, somewhere, somehow, someone is going to figure out a way to circumvent them. That's the nature of programming.\" **********\"Second,\" Mr. Ek continued, \"there is an ocean of Web pages and news groups already out there, and being able to rate them all, with several hundred new ones coming on line every day, is an impossibility.\" **********Even so, Mr. Ek and others say, new software and hardware tools hold the promise -- or the threat, depending on one's point of view -- of allowing people to filter out certain kinds of information while allowing other kinds to be viewed on a personal computer screen. \"Yes, with the right software tools you can selectively block access for some people,\" said Paul Resnick, an AT&T Bell Labs researcher who is co-chairman of the technical committee for PICS, the Platform for Internet Content Selection, the group trying to develop a ratings technology. \"The key is to have selective  rules rather than blanket rules.\" **********There is disagreement over whether it is technically possible to impose blanket control over incoming information, as Germany is seeking in the Compuserve case, without resorting to Draconian measures that most democratic countries find distasteful, like limiting access to telephone lines or employing vast squads of censors to monitor all data traffic. **********The biggest obstacle seems to be the basic design of the Internet itself, which was created during the cold war to allow uninterrupted routing of data traffic even in the event of a nuclear war. At that time, the Internet comprised only a handful of computers, and if one computer failed, the data packets would  automatically detour around it. **********Today the Internet is composed of millions of \"host\" computers, all but a few of them privately maintained. Tens of millions of personal computer users tap into this vast ocean of data on any given day. It is as easy to retrieve data files from halfway around the world as it is to get a file from the computer on  the next desk, and the data path may snake through dozens of cities and countries along the way. **********Trying to keep certain types of information from entering a jurisdiction is as difficult as keeping certain kinds of molecules from entering a country's air space, or certain kinds of fish from swimming in its waters. **********\"The nature of the Internet, if not contemporary telecommunication and transportation technologies in general, make this intrinsically impossible to achieve,\" said Anthony M. Rutkowski, an engineer and lawyer who until recently was head of the Internet Society, an international association of Internet access companies. **********\"One can regard the Internet in some of the same ways as radio waves with respect to the abilities of the medium to transparently flow across national boundaries,\" Mr. Rutkowski said. **********For decades, some countries, like the Soviet Union and what were once its East European satellites, did try jamming radio and television signals, with limited success. **********\"This century has seen numerous energetic efforts to control information that comes via the airwaves, as well as to stop publications from being smuggled across borders,\" said Mitchell Stephens, a fellow at the Freedom Forum Media Studies Center and a journalism professor at New York University. **********\"Some countries have never quite accepted the idea that information goes wherever it damn well pleases, and they try to extend their walls to reach up into the air. It is not surprising that such efforts would be made with computer technology now, especially in light of the incredible potential power inherent in the Internet.\" **********\"I suspect we're just seeing the start of this,\" Professor Stephens said, \"because the major authoritarian countries that remain are typically poorer countries, where most of the population does not have access to computers or televisions or other information sources. When that changes, it will be a huge issue.\" **********If access to information on a computer is blocked by one route, a moderately  skilled computer user can simply tap into another computer by an alternative route. Or one can easily disguise a flurry of bad bits, either by data encryption, which renders them unreadable except by the intended recipient, or simply by changing the file name to something that will pass through most filtering mechanisms. **********An Internet axiom credited to John Gilmore, an engineer at a Silicon Valley networking company, puts it succinctly. \"The Internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it,\" he said. **********Disputes over international broadcasting have been common since 1928, when international delegates gathered in Vienna to discuss cross-border transmissions. **********In 1948, at the dawn of television, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which said: \"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and  impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\" But some governments' efforts to control information have often meant those words constituted little more than an unfulfilled hope. And with each new and more powerful communications medium, attempts to restrict the flow of information across borders increase. **********Recent technical advances suggest that it is easier to block the sending of certain forms of information to a specific country or a specific computer than to keep people in that country from reaching across the border to get the information. **********\"From a technical-feasibility point of view, we could segment content country by country,\" said George Meng, a manager for the Microsoft Network, which offers Internet connections in 50 countries. \"The question is whether that is something we want to do.\" **********But a more intractable problem, he said, arises when an MSN subscriber goes through the system to gain access to the Internet and the World Wide Web. \"If they know the URL of a site,\" he said, \"they can enter the Web directly via our  Internet Explorer. If we don't maintain the server, my guess is that we could not control the content.\" **********If Internet companies cannot control millions of servers, at least the individual user can control his or her own machine. A small industry has grown up in the United States to produce filtering software, which a parent, teacher or boss can install to keep other users from straying into forbidden areas of the network. **********Programs like Surf Watch and Net Nanny typically work by comparing a user's request for information against a list of prohibited sites. Each program's list  is compiled from well-known sources of sex-related discussions or pictures, and  is updated periodically, either by computer programs that scan the data stream for key words, or by teams of people employed to find objectionable material on  the Net. **********There are many drawbacks to the filtering approach. First, new data sites are created every day, so even with frequent upgrades the software is always at least partly out of date. Also, content within a site can change at any time, compromising the reliability of any rating system, and a skilled and determined  teen-age programmer can generally find his or her way to any filtered site. **********But the programs can be effective in stopping casual users from gaining access to the better-known sources of pornography or sex-related discussions. **********One promising attempt to filter information is the PICS proposal, which is defining voluntary technical standards to enable individuals, groups, or even government agencies to establish ratings for Internet, Usenet and World Wide Web files. **********A ratings tool would be encoded into the browser software used to gain access to Internet data sites, for example. Parents could choose a browser endorsed by  the Christian Coalition, for example, or by the local school board or the on-line service provider itself. \"We want individual families to set their own selection rules,\" Mr. Resnick said. \"You could have different rules for different countries, too. Of course, we don't get to set the rules for China.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/30/business/us-defeated-in-its-appeal-of-trade-case.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1996-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 959, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Defeated In Its Appeal Of Trade Case", "print_headline": "U.S. Defeated In Its Appeal Of Trade Case", "body_text": " **********The United States lost its final appeal today in the first major case brought before the newly created World Trade Organization. A three-judge panel ruled that regulations issued under the Clean Air Act discriminated against foreign oil refiners. **********The practical effect of the ruling is that the Environmental Protection Agency will almost certainly be forced to rewrite some of the rules concerning the environmental standards for imported gasoline or face trade sanctions from the countries that filed the complaint, Venezuela and Brazil. Imported gasoline  accounts for only about 5 percent of gasoline sold in the United States, but about 20 percent of gas sold in the New York area. **********The changes seem unlikely to have a major effect on the environment. But the political significance of the decision may be far larger. Senator Bob Dole, the  presumptive Republican nominee for President, has long argued that the trade accord that created the trade organization in late 1994 as an international arbiter, runs the risk of surrendering sovereignty over American laws to foreign judges. **********Today's rulings bolster his argument that the international organization can  effectively force the United States to rewrite its rules. Mr. Dole's office said today that it was still reviewing the decision and had no comment on its contents. **********The judges -- from the Philippines, Japan and New Zealand -- concluded that standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency constituted \"unjustifiable discrimination\" because they set different rules for foreign producers than for domestic refiners. They found that the rules were a \"disguised restriction on international trade.\" **********In a brief statement today, the acting United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, said that she was \"disappointed that the practical result of this case remains unchanged,\" but \"gratified\" that the appellate panel ruled  for the United States on a number of technical points. Administration officials  noted that the panel acknowledged that countries had the right to control air pollution or take other steps to protect the environment -- as long as the rules applied equally to domestic and foreign companies. **********The United States faces another potential conflict after the World Trade Organization threatened to scuttle talks over a global telecommunications agreement that faces a deadline of midnight on Tuesday. American negotiators in  Geneva said they were not yet satisfied with market-opening offers from Asian nations. The accord among 53 nations would regulate the $500 billion global telecommunications services and equipment industry. **********Jeffrey Lang, the deputy United States trade representative and top American  negotiator at the talks, said that after American officials made their objections clear, they had not received improved offers from other nations. **********Today's decision on gasoline regulations, announced at the World Trade Organization's headquarters in Geneva, was the first ever handed down by the organization's recently appointed Appellate Body, which is essentially the Supreme Court of international trade. It is charged with reviewing decisions issued by panels that hear trade complaints brought by any of the 120 nations that have signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. **********The trade organization's judicial authority has long been a main sticking point for economic nationalists who opposed America's entry into the worldwide trade accord. Opposition has created a disparate group of critics, including consumer advocates like Ralph Nader, trade hawks like Ross Perot and Patrick J.  Buchanan and conservatives like Senators Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. They argue that environmental protections, laws against the purchase of goods made by child labor and even steps taken to cut down on drug imports can be challenged as trade barriers. **********The Administration has argued that those concerns are overblown: The world organization does not have the power to strike down laws, only to impose trade penalties. **********After weeks of haggling with Administration officials over that issue in 1994, Mr. Dole reached an agreement with Mr. Clinton to support the trade accord -- thus assuring its passage -- as long as a commission was appointed to review  all decisions that go against the United States. If the commission concludes that three such decisions are capricious, Congress will automatically be asked to vote on whether to pull the United States out of the trade group. **********But more than a year and a half later, the commission has yet to be established. The legislation creating it was held up by Senator Robert C.

The 45-year-old Harvard M.B.A. earned $20 million -- and his nickname -- marketing the Wacky Wallwalker, a sticky plastic octopus that was the Pet Rock of the mid-80's. And, he has made millions more manufacturing the tiny toys found in cereal boxes. **********But by 1990, he was looking for a different challenge, and he couldn't have taken more of a left turn. For about $1 million, he bought over several years one of the world's best assemblages of Shaker furniture, the Mount Lebanon Collection, dedicating much of his energy to preserving the cultural legacy of the millennialist Christian sect, whose heyday was before the Civil War and which largely died off by the 1940's. **********With the money I had to spend, I could either buy a third-rate Picasso or this entire collection, which represents one of America's most important contributions to the arts,\" Mr. Hakuta said in the ringing tones of the zealot.  \"It's been a lot more work than just hanging a picture on my wall, but it's also been a lot more rewarding.\" **********The story of how Mr. Hakuta acquired his collection is a complex tale of chance encounters, mystical experiences with the dead, the difficulties of reaching Bill Cosby on the phone and hardball business negotiations. It is also  about how a thoroughly modern mogul added meaning to his life through a group whose motto is: hands to work; hearts to God. **********The story begins in 1774 when Mother Ann Lee and eight companions came to America to escape religious persecution in England. At their central site in Mount Lebanon, N.Y., near Albany, they practiced communal ownership of property, equality of the sexes and, perhaps because four of Mrs. Lee's children had died  young, celibacy. (This helped lead to their eventual demise because they could only increase their ranks through recruitment.) By 1850 more than 6,000 members  lived in 19 established communities from Maine to Kentucky. **********The Shakers shunned the outside world to pursue plain and simple living. They developed a stripped-down esthetic, which held that beauty rests on utility. Symmetry and simplicity were the hallmarks of this style, which informed their many practical inventions, including clothespins and the functional cupboards, desks and bureaus that are masterpieces of Shaker design. **********When the Mount Lebanon community withered away, the Shakers sold their buildings, furniture and land in 1930 to a small coed boarding school, the Darrow School, which still operates on the site. Few people then attached much value to the furniture, so Darrow used the 2,500 pieces in its dormitories and offices. **********Darrow parted with some minor pieces as interest in Shaker design developed in the 1970's, but it wasn't until 1988 when, faced with financial problems, it  sold one of its prize possessions, a circa 1820 cupboard, to Bill Cosby for $200,000. **********During the next two years, the school sold four pieces to Mr. Hakuta, who had long been interested in American folk art. He paid half a million dollars for the pieces, which included a tall clock made in 1806. **********As the school's finances continued to weaken, Darrow called Mr. Hakuta in the summer of 1990, offering to sell him everything. Sotheby's had told Darrow the lot might fetch $1.3 million at auction, but the school hoped to find a single buyer who would agree to leave it on site. **********\"They wanted to sell it to Cosby,\" Mr. Hakuta said, with a hint of skepticism. \"But they told me they couldn't reach him. I guess he doesn't give his private number out.\" **********When Mr. Hakuta and his wife, Marilou, visited the school, he had two transforming experiences. While at an old Shaker graveyard one night with two curators, \"we saw this light, an intense white light that suddenly came up,\" he  recounted. \"And it became so noisy up there, an internal sound, inside your head. We had to yell. Later, we decided that the Shakers were not at peace there.\" **********One of the curators, Andy Vadnai, said, \"I didn't see any white light, but there was an eerie sound about and strange electricity in the air. I think Ken was more affected than we were, but there was definitely something spiritually powerful going on there.\" **********The next night, rummaging through an old attic, \"I kicked something and there was the rusting grave marker of a 4-year-old girl, Elida Barbour,\" Mr. Hakuta said. \"Maybe because I have three sons but no daughters, this discarded object made me think, 'I've got to save this.' \" **********Through tough negotiations, Mr. Hakuta bargained Darrow down to $600,000 for  the entire lot. Under the agreement, the collection would remain in Mount Lebanon and a local foundation, now called the Mount Lebanon Shaker Village, would have the right to repurchase it for an undetermined price for display in a new museum. **********\"They wanted my money and the collection, and I was happy to oblige because we were keeping everything together,\" Mr. Hakuta said. \"But then I became a fanatic. I wanted to care for my babies, as I call them.\" **********Within a year, foundation members told him they would not be able to build the planned museum, and Mr. Hakuta became increasingly prickly about the school's use of the furniture. \"One faculty member was keeping his socks in a $200,000 cupboard; another was using a magnificent piece as a home entertainment center for his stereo and VCR,\" he said. \"They hadn't changed the way they were  using the furniture, but now it was mine.\" To the school's consternation Mr. Hakuta exercised his rights under the contract in the summer of 1991 and removed the collection. **********\"He snookered us,\" said Earl D. Samson 3d, chairman of Darrow's board, who agreed that the school was ill-equipped to care for the collection. \"We sold at  a low price because Hakuta gave us verbal assurances he would not remove the collection. When he decided to take it, we were facing bankruptcy and didn't have the time or money to fight him.\" **********Mr. Hakuta says he made no such assurances and that making a profit was never his goal. \"Only about 60 percent was of real monetary value, but I took everything, including rusty old pieces of pipe from their aqueduct system,\" he said. \"When we removed an old stove, I kept the ashes because they were Shaker ashes. I know it's a little crazy, but I wanted to preserve everything these people had left behind.\" **********He moved lock, stock and aqueduct to a warehouse near his toy factory in Laurel, Md. He says he has since spent $500,000 and much time restoring, photographing, insuring and caring for the collection, which was recently appraised for $2.5 million. **********\"Ken Hakuta saved the collection,\" said Tim Rieman, a board member of Mount Lebanon Shaker Village and author of \"The Complete Book of Shaker Furniture\" (Abrams, 1994). \"It is finally getting the care and attention it deserves.\" **********Now Mr. Hakuta wants to \"show the world the Shakers' wonderful legacy.\" After a recent exhibit in Hartford, the collection has traveled to Lincoln, Neb., as a part of a United States tour that will wind up at the Smithsonian Institution in 1999. **********He would like to find a permanent home for the collection, but, he said, a museum will only accept the furniture as a gift if he includes perhaps $10 million to cover the costs of storage and display. **********\"I'm still not sure how I got into this,\" he said. \"And I have no idea how it will end. But the fact that Dr. Fad and the Wacky Wallwalker could save a piece  of American history, that's reward enough.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/14/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-accounts-044199.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 162, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Accounts", "body_text": " **********Round Table Pizza Franchise Corp., San Francisco, to Butler, Shine & Stern, Sausalito, Calif., to handle the broadcast creative portion of the restaurant company's account, previously handled by Bertram Wooster, San Francisco.

Bailout Renewed", "print_headline": "Fight Over Picking Up Tab For S.&L. Bailout Renewed", "body_text": " **********The savings-and-loan crisis may have passed, but the fight over who picks up  the bill rages on. **********Six and a half years after Congress passed sweeping legislation to clean up $150 billion in losses from a decade of mismanagement and fraud at the nation's savings and loans, savings institutions and their commercial bank competitors are arguing anew over how much responsibility each industry has to make up a share of the losses. **********At stake is not just the cost to financial institutions, but the growing possibility of default on $8.2 billion of bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, an arm of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, which was established in 1987 to help pay for an early bailout package. And in the long run, Federal regulators including Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned in testimony to the House Banking committee today, the hard-won stability of the savings-and-loan industry and of its deposit-insurance fund could be undermined. **********The survivors of the financial carnage in the savings industry are now very healthy, and though regulators said another recession could create some problems, no one is worried about systemic failures. **********Rather, regulators said, the main problem now is that savings institutions are forced under terms of the bailout package to pay hefty premiums into the industry's depleted deposit-insurance fund, while banks pay little or nothing into their industry's fund. As a result, healthy savings institutions are moving deposits into affiliates that qualify as banks. **********Because the bank insurance fund is fully capitalized, healthy banks now pay only a token $2,000 a year into their fund. **********Savings institutions, by contrast, pay 23 cents for each $100 of deposits into their deposit-insurance fund. That means an institution with $100 million in deposits -- relatively small by industry standards -- would pay $230,000 a year. **********As the amount of deposits covered by the savings industry's insurance fund declines, so does the total of premiums the fund takes in. The remaining savings institutions will probably tend to be those with a higher risk of financial problems, the regulators said, potentially putting more strain on the fund. **********In total, the savings industry's fund is required to have $1.25 on hand for every $100 of deposits held by the industry, but at the end of last year had only 47 cents for every $100. **********Indeed, the fund has only $3.4 billion in it. That's a little more than a third of the reserves it is supposed to have -- and a level that the Treasury said could be wiped out by the failure of a single large savings institution or  several medium-sized ones. **********Not only is the fund left badly undercapitalized, but because nearly half of  the premium income is used to pay holders of the Financing Corporation bonds, regulators said that the risk of the fund defaulting on the bonds was also increasing. **********\"We're looking at a deteriorating process where as healthy institutions leave, then the burden falls on, by definition, less healthy institutions,\" Mr.  Greenspan said. \"It's a cumulative downward spiral which seems to me inevitable  in the long run, although the time frame is difficult to judge.\" **********Asked at the hearing by Representative Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican, whether time was of the essence in dealing with the problem, Mr. Greenspan replied, \"Unquestionably.\" **********A measure passed last year with support from both parties and the White House was meant to solve the problem. But the measure was attached to the vetoed balanced-budget bill, making the savings-industry legislation the victim of a bigger and more politically charged dispute. **********The measure would have charged savings institutions a one-time assessment of  $6 billion to lift the insurance fund to its required level. It would also have  spread responsibility for paying interest on the bonds across both the banking and savings industries -- a step that commercial banks said would cost them $12  billion in the next 25 years. **********With the issue now reopened, banks are lobbying hard against it and their pressure has stalled if not killed efforts to revive last year's legislation. **********Citing heavy opposition from banks around the country, James M. Culberson Jr., the president of the American Bankers Association, told the committee: \"Bankers are extremely upset with the prospect that having rebuilt their fund at no cost to taxpayers they may be asked to pay approximately $12 billion to help  relieve an obligation of one of their principal competitors.\" **********The savings industry's survivors said they were happy to shoulder the heaviest share of recapitalizing their insurance fund and paying interest on the bonds. But they said they should not be held solely responsible, especially since as survivors they constitute the savings industry's most conservatively run institutions. **********James F. Montgomery, the chairman of America's Community Bankers, the savings industry's trade group, urged the committee to try again to pass the legislation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/25/business/67-million-settlement-by-bankers-trust.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1996-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 678, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "67 Million Settlement by Bankers Trust", "print_headline": "67 Million Settlement by Bankers Trust", "body_text": " **********The Bankers Trust Company has agreed to pay $67 million to Air Products and Chemicals Inc. to settle a dispute over money-losing derivatives contracts, the  companies announced yesterday. **********The settlement is by far the largest so far in disputes involving the New York bank holding company and its clients over the highly complex, volatile securities, which in 1994 generated huge losses at some of the nation's best-known and biggest companies. **********Experts said the settlement, and an accompanying conciliatory statement from Bankers Trust, indicated that the bank might now be willing to settle remaining  lawsuits. In the past it has sent out strong signals that it intended to defend  its actions in court. **********Of the other derivative-related actions brought against Bankers Trust and yet to be settled, by far the largest is a lawsuit by Procter & Gamble, which is seeking $130 million, plus unspecified punitive damages. **********In a statement, Thomas Parisi, a Bankers Trust spokesman, said the financial  effects of the settlement were reflected in the bank's fourth- quarter earnings  results, which were announced last week. The settlement is expected to be covered by the bank's reserves for potential credit losses, which are just under $1 billion. **********\"As we said at the time of the earnings announcement, management believes that the expected potential impact of all outstanding issues related to leveraged derivative transactions are now covered by existing reserves,\" Mr. Parisi said. \"We are pleased to be able to put these past difficulties behind us, and are especially pleased to conclude this matter with Air Products, a valued client with whom we continue to enjoy a constructive relationship.\" **********Harry T. C. Hu, a law professor at the University of Texas in Austin, said: \"The fact that Bankers Trust settled this thing and is saying kind words about Air Products seems to signal they care about customer relationships right now, and are perhaps more willing to settle cases now than they were under the Sanford regime.\" **********Mr. Hu was referring to Charles S. Sanford Jr., the chairman and former chief executive of Bankers Trust. Mr. Sanford surprised banking analysts last year when he announced he intended to retire. He plans to step aside as chairman in April. **********Also last year, Eugene B. Shanks Jr., the bank's president and the executive  who oversaw the derivatives business, resigned when the Bankers Trust board passed him over as Mr. Sanford's successor as chairman and chief executive, and  chose Frank N.

All through last year they said they were fully reserved, and then they added an additional $51 million in the fourth quarter.\" **********Still, Mr. Cohn said he was recommending Bankers Trust stock, which yesterday fell by 50 cents a share, to $62.125. **********\"Their capital position is as strong as J.

He weeps at the bedsides of his daughter and father, who were gravely injured by a Bosnian Serb grenade, and wonders why he spends his days cheerfully greeting his former enemies, offering them his hand and the reassurance that they should stay in their homes. **********\"That is what I do, but sometimes I think that I really want them to leave because of what they have done to my family, what they have done to my country,\" said Mr. Zidovic, scratching at his mustache and pointing to some of the few apartments still occupied by Serbian residents. **********I feel for the old people who are left here and have nothing,\" he said. \"And I know they are innocent of the crimes that have been perpetrated over the  last four years. But my heart still bleeds for my own.\" **********He added: \"It is especially hard for me. I am a Serb. I am here to be a symbol that the Federation wants them to stay.\" **********Convincing the thousand or so elderly Serbs stuck in Vogosca that they will not be killed in their sleep or harassed during the day has become one of the main tasks for the Federation police officers now making their rounds here. It is a difficult job, because many of the officers find it hard to offer condolences. **********Many of them have watched loved ones killed during their country's 43-month war. Nearly all have lost friends or seen the deadly aftermath of a hit by a Serbian shell. And as they walk among their former enemies, it is sometimes a challenge to hold back from swinging a billy club out of anger or uttering words of retribution. **********\"At first I wondered if I had the nerves to do this job,\" said a fellow officer, Bojan Marjanovic, who is also a Serb, one of the minority who remained  on the Government side during the war. **********\"We just have to keep in mind that these are people too,\" he said. \"These are not the war criminals who tried to destroy us.\" **********Mr. Marjanovic added that he is looking forward to the \"liberation\" of the suburban town of Grbavica, his former home and where his mother lives. The last  of the five Sarajevo towns scheduled for transfer under the Dayton peace agreement, Grbavica is to come under Federation control on March 19. **********So far, the Federation officers patrolling Vogosca have offered forgiveness and taught the necessity of inclusion. And they have done their job with a professionalism that has surprised not only the foreign journalists who watch their every move, but also the few Serbs who found themselves trapped in the town. **********\"When I found out that the Federation was coming on Friday, I started to shake with fear,\" said Dragan Knezevic, 72, a Serb who immediately began packing up his small apartment into neatly arranged boxes. \"But no one would help me move without money and I figured that I could only go if I left all my things. I was on my last box when I decided to stay and give this new time a try.\" **********He added: \"I am not afraid of the Federation anymore. Some of these officers  came to my home yesterday and gave me bread. Then they asked that I stay and this freed my mind.\" **********Eighty-five Federation policemen, including 30 Serbs and 8 Croats, now patrol the town. All of the officers have at least eight years previous experience, were screened and are monitored by the International Police Task Force. **********Though the new officers were culled from the Bosnian police force and a Bosnian flag hangs outside the new police station, they are called Federation officers in preparation for the new Muslim-Croat republic envisioned in the Dayton accord. **********The shaky alliance between the two groups was preceded by their own bitter 10-month war that ended in February 1994 and has so far been put to little practice. **********The town is populated mainly by former residents making day trips from Sarajevo to gawk at the scenery or see if their old homes are still standing. **********The officers admonish the visitors to watch out for booby-traps and mines, though none have been found. **********Often, they have little work other than directing traffic. **********\"Really the cold is the only problem here,\" Mr. Marjanovic said.  \"And of course there are no coffee shops. We cops really like to sit and drink coffee.\" **********Nearby, a fellow officer ran through a book of traffic signs. \"Just brushing  up while I've got the time,\" he said. **********They expected much worse. Upon arriving last Friday, they clustered around the police building, fingering their pistols and darting their eyes suspiciously over the few Serbs turning up for bus service to Pale, the Bosnian Serb regional headquarters. At first, they made only token efforts at patrols, preferring instead to set up checkpoints in front of the police station. It was  all a no-man's land, mysterious ruins that could hold snipers and mines. And no  one wanted to be killed on the first day on the job. **********\"For me it was like I had just joined the force,\" said Sakilo Omeragic, Mr. Zidovic's Muslim partner. \"I was so excited, I couldn't sleep. I don't know what I expected, but I thought it would be more damaged and dangerous.\" **********He added: \"Now that we're here, its great.

clearacknowledgement that a single European currency will significantly curtail the autonomy of the 15 EU governments in handling their economic affairs. **********While many details remain to be worked out in coming months, the officials agreed to grant decisive power over future exchange-rate realignments to the independent head of the planned European central bank. **********They also committed their governments to bringing budget deficits well below the single-currency ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product and to seek ways to make that commitment binding. **********By ensuring greater exchange-rate stability and encouraging all 15 governments to stick to the path of low inflation and low deficits, the measures aim to prevent a single currency from dividing the EU between a minority of states entering monetary union in the first wave and those remaining outside. **********\"For the general interest, we must create a system that has rights, obligations and advantages for those that are in and those that are out,\" said Prime Minister Lamberto Dini of Italy, who was the chairman of the meeting Saturday. **********But none of the mechanics discussed at Verona directly addressed the problems of sluggish growth, rising unemployment and high budget deficits that are the main obstacles to a single currency. **********Hans Tietmeyer, president of theBundesbank,acknowledged as much when he said Germany and France needed to fulfill the Maastricht treaty's criteriato launch a single currency on schedule in 1999. **********But Mr. Tietmeyer expressed confidence that growth would lead to recovery in the second half because of low interest rates and the recent fall of EU currencies against the dollar, which makes European goods more competitive. **********Meanwhile, Finance Minister Theo Waigel of Germany, said Germany would not accept any softening of the requirement on budget deficits. \"As far as the 3 percent goes, that means three-point-zero percent, there's no question,\" he said. **********Senior officials of Bonn's ruling coalition met Sunday evening to seek ways to cut public spending by at least 50 billion Deutsche marks ($33.33 billion) in 1997, the year in which countries must hit the single-currency targets. **********Still, the Verona agreement was significant because the potential for a split between participants in monetary union and those outside had loomed as one of the biggest political risks to a single currency. **********The agreement was particularly sweet for French officials, who were criticized for seeking to erect protectionist barriers within the EU last year when they first pressed for a revived currency grid. **********\"Six months ago, we were the only ones calling for a new exchange-rate mechanism,\" Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said. \"Now only the British and Swedish are opposed.\" **********Finance Minister Philippe Maystadt of Belgium said a new mechanism \"would send a strong message to financial markets about the willingness to preserve exchange-rate stability in Europe and to extend monetary union as quickly as possible to all EU countries that want to join.'. **********The new mechanism, which EU countries would be encouraged but not obliged to join, would maintain current broad fluctuation bands of plus or minus 15 percent to avoid setting easy targets for currency speculators, officials said. **********But it would allow countries to peg their currencies more closely to the Euro if they keep inflation and deficits under strict control. **********There would be limits to the European central bank's intervention in defense of exchange-rate limits, and the central bank president would have the power to initiate negotiations to realign currencies. **********Those features, advocated strongly by the Bundesbank, are designed to prevent a repeat of the collapse of Europe's old currency grid in 1992, when Britain and Italy held out against a realignment until their currency reserves were exhausted. **********Even Britain's differences with its partners over the mechanism were less than they appeared. **********Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke saidBritain would not participate in the mechanism even though it intended to keep its options open on joining monetary union. **********While most EU officials stressed that two-years' participation in the mechanism was a key Maastricht treaty requirement for joining monetary union, Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, dismissedthe idea that Britain would be denied entry if it met the Maastricht budget and inflation criteria and kept the pound steady. **********Many EU officials agreed, saying Britain's commitment to a stable pound was more important that its refusal to re-enter an EU currency grid. **********Finance ministers and central bankers also agreed to strengthen budgetary discipline. Although they stopped short of Mr. Waigel's demand for swift, automatic sanctions for any country exceeding the 3 percent limit, they agreed to explore ways to speed up the penalties spelled out in the Maastricht treaty and to seek a medium-term budget target of \"near balance.\" **********Ministers instructed the European Monetary Institute and the EU monetary committee to present detailed reports on the exchange-rate and budget regimes to EU leaders at their summit meeting June 21-22 in Florence. **********They hope to reach final accords by December. **********\"If you believe that monetary union is a gradual process and not a big bang, then Verona is a big step forward,\" said Mario Draghi, the director-general of the Italian Treasury."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/09/business/ann-taylor-to-buy-rest-of-joint-venture.html": {"writer_name": "Jennifer Steinhauer", "pub_date": "1996-04-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 448, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ann Taylor To Buy Rest of Joint Venture", "print_headline": "Ann Taylor To Buy Rest of Joint Venture", "body_text": " **********In an effort to salvage its ailing principal supplier, Ann Taylor Stores said yesterday that it would buy 100 percent of a joint venture it now shares with Cygne Design Inc., as well as another unit of that company. **********The retailer will buy Cygne's 60 percent interest in the venture, known as CAT, which provided Ann Taylor with about 38 percent of its merchandise last year, and Cygne's Ann Taylor Woven division, a merchandise sourcing unit. **********Ann Taylor said it would pay for the acquisitions with about $36 million worth of its common stock, plus a cash payment to be determined.

How can grandparents setting up Uniform Gift to Minors Act accounts for their grandchildren's education make sure the money won't be squandered by divorcing parents? **********A. First of all, thank goodness for all those grandparents without whose generosity thousands of high school seniors would not be going to college next fall. My paternal grandfather was fond of saying that the second best thing about getting old was being able to help the next generation. (The best thing, he felt, was Polident, which enabled him to sing while brushing his teeth.) **********The Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, or UGMA, allows grandparents, parents and others to give a child money, which is usually held in a bank, mutual fund or brokerage firm. The account is in the child's name and carries his or her Social Security number, but is supervised by an adult, known as the custodian. When the child comes of age -- between 18 and 21, depending on the state, although in California it can be delayed to 25 -- he or she gets the goods. **********Generosity isn't necessarily the only motivation for these gifts. Many wealthy parents and grandparents use these accounts to give up to $10,000 each to children every year; the donors pay no taxes on the gifts and, at the same time, they winnow their estates and thus shrink the potential inheritance taxes. Parents often like these accounts because the earnings are often taxed at a lower rate than their own. **********Nevertheless, parents may be doing themselves a disservice by stashing money  in a child's name. When schools determine a student's eligibility for financial  assistance, they consider 35 percent of the holdings in an UGMA to be usable for tuition. For assets held by parents, the figure is 5.6 percent. **********Another caveat: don't put money in an UGMA account if you may need it yourself.  Once the money has been deposited, it cannot be taken back, even to be returned later. **********Which may answer your question. It would be illegal for a parent to use custodial powers to appropriate assets of the account.  If this happens, a donor should hire a lawyer immediately to protect the child's interest and to replace  the custodian. **********This brings up a good point. The custodian doesn't have to be a parent. You can name a lawyer, a financial adviser or a friend. **********A bigger problem with these accounts, however, is the possible immaturity of  the recipients. Many 18-year-olds are not up to handling the windfall. Nor are some 25-year-olds. Yet there are no restrictions once the children come of age,  and UGMA checks can make for a big birthday blast. **********Estate lawyers have many stories of young recipients who put college on hold  while they join a rock band or ride a motorcycle across Asia. One father received a certified letter from a lawyer representing a commune where his daughter had fled; the lawyer demanded that her UGMA funds be transferred there. With $50,000, you can fertilize a lot of organic kohlrabi. **********For such reasons, donors should consider alternatives to these accounts, said Michael Hartz, a partner in the Chicago law firm of Katten, Muchin & Zavis. **********For example, grandparents can hold onto the money and pay the tuition directly to the school, said Terry Savage, author of \"New Money Strategies for the 90's\" (Harper Business, $14, 1995). The grandparents avoid the gift tax, keep control of the money and can look forward to being fussed over on their birthdays by the grandchildren. If the grandparents are worried that they won't  be around to receive the bills, they can stipulate in their will that a trust fund be set up for the grandchildren, though it may be subject to a generation-skipping tax. **********Other ways to deter untoward use of such gifts include long-term investments  in Treasuries, certificates of deposit or zero-coupon bonds in the child's name. Why? Because early withdrawal can be costly for all of these investments. And under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, a broader version of UGMA, you can leave them real estate and works of art -- assets that you cannot put into an UGMA account and are not easily converted into cash. **********Another alternative is a Crummey trust (named for the taxpayer, not the adjective). According to Mr. Hartz, this is the logical choice for a donor who wants to qualify for the $10,000 annual gift-tax exclusion but also desires to keep control over how or when the money is used. The trust donor is not limited  to making the money available at a certain age and can specify the use of the money. **********But Crummey trusts involve some legal time to set up: be prepared to spend $500 to $1,500, depending on how many bells and whistles you want. **********For those planning a more modest gift, say $500, there is another way to delay all or part of it past the commune years: buy into a no-load mutual fund that allows you to set up an irrevocable trust account for the child.  For example, Twentieth Century Giftrust Investors (800 345-2021) invests for long-term growth and requires only that the gift remain in the fund for at least 10 years or until the child reaches the age of majority, whichever is longer. Unlike Crummey trusts, these trusts do not confer control over how money is spent. **********Donors should note that the Twentieth Century fund has different tax consequences than UGMA's. Contributions count against the $600,000 available for the gift and estate tax exemption, and the fund pays taxes annually and at maturity. But the contributions don't count toward the annual $10,000 gift limit, leaving you free to make a separate gift to your grandchild. **********For those who already have UGMA's and worry about their children running amok, Ms. Savage recommends a strategy of \"don't ask and don't tell all.\" Children kept in the dark about the pot of gold awaiting them at the end of the  high-school rainbow are not likely to blab about their good fortunes to friends  or Porsche salesmen. **********\"Instead,\" Ms. Savage advised, \"start another, separate account at your local brokerage firm and throw in shares of a mutual fund or whatever so your kids can learn about investing and watch their money grow.\" **********Envious of all these potentially wealthy college students, I called my mother and asked why she hadn't set up some sort of tuition fund for me. Her side of the family, I was informed, firmly believes that the way I spent my weekends as a child -- trying to win money for college at the Fort Erie, Ontario, race track, close to our home in Buffalo -- best prepares one for the real world.

The stock could be picked up for about $1 a share early last year, and last week, it traded as high as $20. **********Recently, though, Iomega has wound up with more detractors than perhaps any other company listed on the Nasdaq stock market. Last week, Nasdaq reported that as of mid-February more than 18.1 million shares of Iomega stock had been sold short, a bet that a stock will decline. The huge short position is equivalent to 30 percent of the company's shares. **********Iomega, whose market value is more than $1 billion, is certainly facing its  share of problems. It is having trouble getting enough parts to build its drives and still doesn't have patents on the disk technology, leaving the door open to  competitors. Wall Street is confused about its earnings; more ominously, the company is facing a cash crunch, which a planned debt offering would ease only until the summer. Much of the debate over Iomega's future has taken place not in Wall Street trading rooms, but, according to a prospectus Iomega filed last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on \"electronic bulletin board postings on America Online and other similar services.\" **********The debate has gone beyond the normal tug-of-war between buyers and sellers,  to the point where two weeks ago the company postponed an offering of 5.25 million shares of common stock, which could have raised up to $100 million in much-needed cash, because of \"confusion and misinformation in the marketplace\" regarding the company and the offering. **********Last week, Iomega announced a plan to raise $40 million in an offering of convertible notes -- a plan Iomega apparently hopes will fill its short-term cash needs and quiet some of the debate. **********The remarkable surge in Iomega's share price was sparked by one of the technology industry's most impressive turnarounds. For about a decade, Iomega has been best known for its popular Bernoulli disk drives. Bernoulli boxes, as they are known, overcame the relatively small storage capacity of early personal computers. **********But with leaps in data storage technology, Bernoulli boxes became all but obsolete. Only recently, as data-intensive multimedia programs have gained popularity, have computer users again found their PC storage capacity stretched  to the limit. **********Once again, Iomega has a niche, this time with a new but anthropologically similar line of disk and tape drives, which go by the brand names Zip, Jaz and Ditto. **********Introduced a year ago, the products quickly bolstered Iomega's sales, to $148 million in the fourth quarter of last year from $40 million in the first. The company earned 14 cents a share last year, its first year in the black since 1992. **********Joseph E. Besecker, an analyst for the Emerald Investment Companies, a money  management firm based in Lancaster, Pa., now estimates that Iomega will earn more than $1 a share this year. **********That estimate might be a bit rich. In a prospectus for the debt offering filed last week with the S.E.C., Iomega notes that initial sales of the Zip drive \"may be attributable in large part to the novelty of the product and the initial publicity surrounding the introduction of the Zip, and may not be indicative of the long-term demand for the product.\" **********Also, Iomega has no patent protection for the disk drives or the disks, which can be removed from the computer and carried to other sites, although it has applied for some. That leaves the company wide open to potential competition. **********Mr. Besecker's estimate is nearly double what Hambrecht & Quist estimated earlier this year as it prepared to underwrite Iomega's proposed stock offering, according to people familiar with the estimates. When those estimates  began circulating on Wall Street, short-sellers stepped up their attacks on Iomega's stock. Officials at Hambrecht declined to comment. **********Iomega officials also declined to be interviewed because, according to S.E.C. rules, the company cannot promote itself while preparing for a public offering.  The latest offering is critical to Iomega. Because of sharp increases in accounts receivable and inventories, the $40 million in expected proceeds will be enough to finance Iomega's operations only through June 30; thereafter, \"the  company expects to require additional funds to finance its operations,\" the prospectus states. **********Some of its cash needs might be satisfied by sales growth. Just last week the company announced that Hewlett-Packard will offer Zip drives as an option in its Pavilion line of personal computers later this year. **********But Iomega has a key problem. Industrywide shortages of the integrated circuits that are critical to construction of its drives could limit Iomega's ability to meet demand this year. **********In its prospectus, the company also warns that \"investors should not assume fourth quarter of 1995 revenues are necessarily indicative of the revenues to be expected in any future quarter.\" **********It looks as though some investors are expecting just that. Even assuming that Iomega can replicate the fourth quarter's sales in every quarter of 1996, the company's shares are being valued at more than two times total revenue. At its recent price of $17.125, the stock trades at more than 16 times this year's expected earnings. **********By contrast, when Seagate Technology recently bought Conner Peripherals to create the country's single largest disk drive company, Seagate paid about 0.72  times Conner's sales. Iomega's competitors in the disk drive industry trade at about 12 times this year's expected earnings. **********By those standards, Iomega shares appear due for a pause."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/01/business/looking-glass-summer-s-math-lesson-the-movies.html": {"writer_name": "Kris Goodfellow", "pub_date": "1996-07-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LOOKING GLASS;Summer's Math Lesson: The Movies", "print_headline": "LOOKING GLASS;Summer's Math Lesson: The Movies", "body_text": " **********Independence Day,\" the science-fiction thriller know for the aliens that make wood chips out of the White House, will land in thousands of theaters Wednesday.

Well, people in Yomitan are normally very patient, but if the Japanese and American Governments insist on putting a new military facility here, we'll have to rise up in rebellion.\" **********Just so that no one thinks he is using hyperbole, Mr. Yamauchi says citizens  would first use lawsuits and procedural delays to harass those planning to put in an American military heliport. \"But if the Governments insist,\" he added, \"we would have to consider physical resistance.\" **********Neither American nor Japanese generals seem to be trembling at the prospect.  But Mr. Yamauchi's threat underscores the difficulties facing the American and Japanese Governments as they try to adjust the American military presence in Okinawa. **********Last month Washington and Tokyo observed President Clinton's visit to Japan by announcing a landmark package that would sharply scale back the annoyance level of the American bases in Okinawa, more than almost anybody had imagined they would. One-fifth of the land taken up by the bases would be returned to Japan. **********But the return of some bases was conditioned on their functions being moved to existing bases elsewhere. The heliport, for example, may be moved near Yomitan, and so Mr. Yamauchi and the other citizens of towns like Yomitan are doing their best to block the deal. **********While here in sun-drenched Okinawa many people are less than delighted with the package, the deal seems to have had its intended effect on the Japanese-American relationship as a whole. Polls show rising support for the military partnership between the two countries, and many Japanese seem to have concluded that America made a good-faith effort to resolve the problems on Okinawa and that not much more needs to be done. **********That is a striking turnaround from the mood last fall, after the rape of a sixth-grade Okinawan girl by three American servicemen. At that time, as Ambassador Walter F. Mondale noted recently, \"the whole security relationship was in question.\" **********\"The rape triggered a long overdue debate in Japan about whether the alliance was necessary following the end of the cold war,\" Mr. Mondale said. \"As the debate went on, the answer came in the affirmative, stronger than ever. So I believe there's some greater depth underpinning this alliance as a result of that debate.\" **********The agreement to return some American bases has also strengthened the position of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, in that he has been given credit for demanding that Americans pay attention to the Okinawans. But in fact officials say the crucial figure in pushing for a less intrusive Japanese presence was not Mr. Hashimoto but Defense Secretary William J. Perry. **********As a young serviceman, Mr. Perry traveled throughout Okinawa to survey the island. Throughout the negotiations over the bases, he reportedly showed great sympathy -- sometimes more than Japanese counterparts from Tokyo -- for islanders who have to live with the noise and inconvenience of bases next door. **********Japanese officials agree with Mr. Mondale that the summit meeting last month, plus recent Chinese and North Korean military moves that worried some Japanese, nurtured a new consensus in Japan about the need for American bases. Kiichi Miyazawa, a former Prime Minister, said the base-reduction package \"showed the American Government's sincerity.\" **********Yet while the American announcement about base reductions has helped defuse a crisis over the security alliance, it is not clear that the plans will really be put into effect.  The problem is that nearly all the cutbacks on bases were conditioned on functions being moved elsewhere -- and no other place wants to accept them. **********The centerpiece of the package was the return of Futenma, an air base in the  middle of the city of Ginowan. The United States said it would return Futenma in five to seven years, after its functions had been moved elsewhere in Okinawa. **********The informal plans are for the heliport now at Futenma to be moved to the Yomitan area and for other functions to be moved to Kadena, on the site of an existing base. But now, with Mr. Yamauchi in Yomitan threatening an insurrection and many local citizens outraged, the return of Futenma is looking more doubtful. **********Faced with much opposition, it might be in the interests of the Japanese and  American Governments to let the timetable slip and stick with the existing bases rather than move troops to towns that refuse to have them. The opposition to the bases, though aggravated by the rape last year, goes much deeper. **********In the town of Kadena, where 83 percent of the city's land is taken up by a huge air base, residents compare their own cramped quarters with the American military's spacious green lawns and golf course -- and then their irritation grows when their windows rattle each time a jet flies low over their home for a  landing or takeoff. **********\"The residents of Kadena have suffered from this air base for 50 years,\" Tokujitsu Miyagi, the Mayor of Kadena, said in his office (with double-glazed windows) as helicopters roared over the base a few hundred yards away. **********\"So we can't tolerate any extra activities at this base,\" he added, \"and we can't compromise on that.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/19/business/media-business-advertising-country-s-biggest-brewer-renews-its-defense-that.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-03-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 905, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;The country's biggest brewer renews its defense of that position.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;The country's biggest brewer renews its defense of that position.", "body_text": " **********ANHEUSER-BUSCH is seeking to regain momentum in the beer wars by undertaking  several marketing initiatives. **********For one thing, Anheuser-Busch, the beer marketing unit of the Anheuser-Busch  Companies, is returning to Times Square with an oversized neon sign promoting its flagship Budweiser brand. And the company has expanded its relationship with Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco by designating that agency  to produce two unconventional corporate and product campaigns. **********There is also speculation about further changes on the agency front. The Leap Partnership in Chicago, which until recently worked for the Miller Brewing  Company -- Anheuser-Busch's principal rival -- has hired a former Anheuser-Busch marketing executive. **********The steps come as Anheuser-Busch continues to hold a commanding lead in the American beer market of 44.1 percent, according to the Beer Marketer's Insights  newsletter, compared with 22.6 percent for No. 2 Miller, which is owned by the Philip Morris Companies. **********But Miller has lately been the busier of the two brewers, introducing a premium-priced brand bearing the Miller name, which is meant to battle Budweiser, as well as sponsoring its first image campaign for the Plank Road Brewery, which markets smaller specialty Miller brands like Red Dog and Icehouse. **********\"Anheuser-Busch's plans for 1996 seem extremely ambitious,\" said Benj Steinman, president of Beer Marketer's Insights in West Nyack, N.Y. \"And they're throwing a lot of money into it, too.\" Anheuser-Busch will spend an estimated $600 million on advertising this year, as its parent rededicates itself to core operatons like brewing after leaving fields like snacks and baked goods. **********In Times Square, Anheuser-Busch has signed a multiyear contract for the Budweiser sign, of a type known in the outdoor advertising industry as spectaculars for their gaudy displays. Terms were not disclosed; typical leases  run from $350,000 to $1.5 million annually in addition to construction costs that can total $1 million or more. **********The Budweiser sign, 40 feet wide by 70 feet high, is scheduled to appear by the fall on the north face of One Times Square -- the building that plays host to the annual ball-drop on New Year's Eve -- directly above the Sony Jumbotron screen. **********\"We've tried to use outdoor advertising more impactfully,\" Tony Ponturo, president of the Busch Media Group in St. Louis, the Anheuser-Busch unit that handles media planning and buying, said yesterday. \"Times Square is a place where you can make a dramatic statement.\" **********Tom Turner, vice president at Van Wagner Communications in New York, the advertising representative for One Times Square, said: \"This is a great marketing opportunity.

Billings are not being disclosed. **********One is a humorous campaign, carrying the theme \"It'd be weird without beer,\"  that promotes beer as a beverage for good times. Rather than pitching specific brands, it is billed as \"brought to you by the brewmasters at Anheuser-Busch.\" **********Anheuser-Busch had sought to involve Miller in the campaign, Mr. Busch said,  under an industry sponsorship. Miller \"was very interested,\" he added, but a joint venture could not be worked out. **********Gina Shaffer, a spokeswoman for Miller in Milwaukee, said: \"Anheuser-Busch did come to us and we did seriously consider the opportunity. We definitely support their efforts but unfortunately our time-lines didn't coincide, so we couldn't do it this time around.\" **********Mr. Busch said the other campaign by Goodby, Silverstein would introduce \"an  eccentric delivery-driver-salesman named Gus\" who discusses beer quality; in August, the ads will segue into promoting new freshness dating on cans and bottles of Budweiser, Bud Light and Bud Ice beers. **********Goodby, Silverstein has worked for Anheuser-Busch since August on Bud Ice. Mr. Busch praised the agency's offbeat commercials, which feature a mysterious penguin; one ran during Super Bowl XXX and two more began appearing last week. **********The speculation about Leap was fueled by word that Thomas R. Sharbaugh, who in 16 years at Anheuser-Busch held posts like vice president for brand management, is joining the agency as president. Mr. Sharbaugh, 51, comes to Leap from Sears, Roebuck & Company in Chicago, where he held advertising and marketing positions; he succeeds Frederick Smith, 41, a partner who was named to the new post of chief operating officer. **********Leap was formed in 1993 by executives who had worked at DDB Needham Chicago on Anheuser-Busch brands like Bud Light. The next year, Miller hired Leap to handle projects and later awarded the agency the Lite Ice account. When Leap unexpectedly resigned its Miller assignments in December, billings were estimated at $30 million. **********Beth Heitzman, a creative partner at Leap, said Mr. Sharbaugh's hiring was not an effort to land Anheuser-Busch as a client.

On Monday, Western officials delayed the official start of campaigning for the Bosnian elections until Friday to allow time for his removal, and said they would not allow Dr. Karadzic's powerful party to take part if he remains in office. **********Unwilling to risk provoking retaliation by using NATO troops to arrest Dr. Karadzic, Western countries have threatened renewed economic sanctions against Belgrade, which is believed to have the ability to force Dr. Karadzic out. This  threat may be Mr. Holbrooke's strongest lever as he negotiates with Mr. Milosevic here. **********But diplomats and economic analysts wondered how seriously Mr. Milosevic would take the threat. **********A Western diplomat here said Mr. Milosevic held a \"healthy skepticism\" about  whether the major powers, who are divided over the question, would quickly organize effective sanctions like a ban on trade. **********Economists also questioned whether Mr. Milosevic, a skilled political poker player, would be influenced by the economic threats or rewards Mr. Holbrooke can offer. **********United Nations sanctions against Serbia were suspended after the Dayton accord but can be reimposed for noncompliance with the treaty.  On the positive  side, Mr. Holbrooke can offer to formally end the sanctions, lifting the cloud of uncertainty that might deter international investors. **********Since the suspension of sanctions last December, there has been little improvement in the Serbian economy, largely because of the determination of Mr.  Milosevic, a former Communist, to keep state controls and his refusal to allow privatization. **********But daily life has regained a modicum of normality. Families no longer hoard  oil, sugar and other foodstuffs and gasoline, previously sold on the roadside by black marketeers, is more easily available. **********Thus, initially, the reimposition of sanctions would mainly have a negative psychological impact on the country, economists said. **********\"If we have sanctions again, we will have a really bad situation,\" said Tomislav Popovic, director of the Institute of Economic Sciences in Belgrade, and a critic of the government's policies. \"But we have developed survival mechanisms and the possibility to live under many limitations.\" **********In the longer term, however, new sanctions would be \"catastrophic,\" Mr. Popovic said. The once healthy but now decrepit industrial base -- 70 percent of factory machinery is useless because of the effect of three years of sanctions -- would decay further, he said. **********Western diplomats said that one of Mr. Holbrooke's strongest positive incentives would be allowing Serbia to re-enter international organizations, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization and the  United Nations.  But a Serbian economist at the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies, Vladimir Gligorov, said that because state monopolies were enriching Mr. Milosevic's political cronies, membership in the I.M.F. and the World Bank would not be that attractive at the moment. **********\"They are not in a great hurry about that because they are not ready to accept the conditions the I.M.F. would put on Serbia,\" Mr. Gligorov said. **********To gain I.M.F. support Mr. Milosevic would have to agree to politically unpalatable policies, like reducing the deficit, now estimated at between 10 and 20 percent of gross domestic product, and slashing subsidies to industry. **********Politically, Mr. Milosevic seems to have little to lose by ousting Dr. Karadzic and may even gain. With Dr. Karadzic out of the way, for example, Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party would have a better chance of winning seats in the Bosnian elections. **********\"We are actually asking Milosevic to do something that will help him in the election but Milosevic has set it up so cleverly we have to grease his palm to get him to do it,\" one diplomat said. **********Should he choose to act, Mr. Milosevic has plenty of economic and political leverage over Dr. Karadzic, said Serbian economists who described the Serbian-held region of Bosnia as a virtual colony of Belgrade. **********The Bosnian Serb police are heavily infiltrated by people loyal to the Serbian leader, they said. Almost all of Serbian-held Bosnia's food and industrial products come from Serbia and the Bosnian Serb military is completely dependant on the Yugoslav national army, run by Mr. Milosevic. **********Further, Mr. Milosevic could, if he wanted to, choke off the profitable smuggling businesses that many Bosnian Serb leaders run through Serbia. **********White House officials in Washington, mindful that President Clinton faces election in November, sent Mr. Holbrooke on his mission in the hope that the Bosnian elections can proceed smoothly, avoiding a collapse of the Dayton peace  effort. However, they say they feel little domestic political pressure to take military risks to arrest Dr. Karadzic. **********The expected Republican nominee, Bob Dole, attacked the President's approach  this week in response to questions. **********Referring to the continued power of Dr. Karadzic and the Bosnian Serb military leader General Ratko Mladic, who is also under indictment for war crimes, Mr. Dole said: **********\"All we've heard from the Administration are empty threats, not even the minimal action of reimposing sanctions.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/13/business/august-producer-price-report-shows-inflation-in-check.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-09-13", "snippet": "Labor Department report shows inflation fundamentally remained in check in August, even though hefty increases for food and energy drove producer prices up three-tenths of 1 percent, second-biggest rise this year; Labor Department says first-time ...", "word_count": 717, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "August Producer Price Report Shows Inflation in Check", "print_headline": "August Producer Price Report Shows Inflation in Check", "body_text": " **********Inflation fundamentally remained in check last month, even though hefty increases for food and energy drove producer prices up three-tenths of 1 percent in August, the second-biggest rise this year, a Labor Department report showed today. **********Economists and the securities markets largely disregarded these two erratic sectors and dwelled instead on a decline in the rest of the Producer Price Index for finished goods.

The Federal minimum rises 50 cents an hour, to $4.75, on Oct. 1. **********Prices of finished foods advanced 1 percent in August, with pork prices leaping 8.7 percent. Fresh fruits and melons, eggs for fresh use and shortening and cooking oils also turned up after July declines. Fresh and dry vegetables, however, dropped 11.9 percent, and fish and young chickens also turned down. **********Prices obtained by energy producers climbed seven-tenths of 1 percent after a modestly larger July decline, with gasoline a major contributor. Residential electric power and lubricants also moved up. Residential natural gas and heating oil rose less than in July. **********Elsewhere, price increases for paper products, alcoholic beverages, tires, floor coverings, sporting goods and newspaper circulation were offset by declines for prescription drugs, passenger cars, books, apparel and light trucks, the department reported. Producers of capital equipment saw prices they receive edge down one-tenth of 1 percent. **********Among intermediate goods, durable items like aluminum mill shapes used in manufacturing fell six-tenths of 1 percent following a nine-tenths of 1 percent decline in July. Nondurables like organic chemicals used in factories posted a three-tenths of 1 percent increase in August, reversing a larger July decline. **********The index for all domestic manufacturing, including petroleum refining, advanced two-tenths of 1 percent after showing no change in July. **********The department's report on jobless claims, which analysts viewed with more than the usual caution because of the difficulty of adjusting for the Labor Day holiday, found 338,000 workers applying for new benefits.

The reason has chiefly been that intelligence agencies feared such equipment would be used by foreign terrorists, drug cartels and other criminals to hide transactions and communications. **********Now, in a compromise, according to two senior officials in the Administration who have been deeply involved in the new policy, American companies will be permitted on Jan. 1 to export software that encrypts, or scrambles, data using ''keys'' -- lengthy numeric codes -- that are up to 56 bits long. Until now, companies have been prohibited from selling products abroad that have keys longer than 40 bits. **********Mr. Clinton has also decided to move the authority for exporting the encryption software from the State Department, which has had export-licensing authority because the technology has been classified as munitions, to the Commerce Department, which controls the export of products that have both commercial and military use. Industry officials have long urged that change, betting the Commerce Department would be more inclined to give a higher priority to American competitive interests. **********But starting in two years, American companies choosing to export  the more sophisticated software would have to set up what the industry is calling a ''key recovery'' system. That system would enable intelligence officials and law enforcement agents, armed with court warrants, to go through a lengthy multistep process that would give them the mathematical key to decoding  scrambled communications. **********The approach replaces the Administration's earlier proposed ''key escrow'' system in which the Government would have been the repository of the numeric keys -- leading to fears of potential Government abuse, or a reluctance by legitimate foreign users to buy the software. **********Under the new plan, the keys may be held by third-party companies. And large institutions, like banks, may be allowed to hold their keys in escrow -- assuming they pass some kind of Government certification. **********Still, the success of the system will depend on large part on the Administration's efforts to persuade other countries to adopt the same ''key recovery'' system, allowing their intelligence agencies and justice systems to cooperate in trailing criminals across national borders. But Mr. Clinton's aides acknowledged today that this process has just begun, and so far only England and France have expressed much enthusiasm. **********''It is going to take a while to persuade people that their data is safe under this system, that it protects privacy, and yet that we can use the system to trace terrorists or drug dealers,'' one senior Administration official said. **********Officials at I.B.M., which is expected to announce on Wednesday the creation of an industry consortium to aid in establishing the ''key recovery'' system, said today that no single entity would hold the entire key. **********Instead, it will be divided up across several companies that would handle any given message, much the way the launching officials in nuclear missile silos each had only part of the key instructions needed to begin a nuclear attack. **********If the C.I.A., for example, obtained a court order to decode a message, it would have to go to several groups with its warrant to piece together the key. **********''We believe that this solves the biggest weak point in the previous plans, where one entity held the key,'' said an I.B.M. official familiar with the company's announcement. **********But these steps are not likely to silence all the critics. **********''There is still a perception that the U.S. is trying to extend its intelligence capability by setting standards around the world,'' said Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. **********There are other potential holes in the system. Customers in the United States will be free to buy encryption software of any complexity -- as they can today -- with keys that are much longer than 56 bits and are nearly impossible to break. That means terrorist groups or drug dealers could still buy such software and sneak it out of the country, or even transmit it over computer networks. **********''There is nothing we can do about bright students or Joe Terrorist who use sophisticated encryption systems to communicate with each other,'' one senior administration official said. ''But when they brush up against legitimate groups, especially banks,'' the official said, ''then they are more likely to be dealing with a system'' where law enforcement could use the key recovery system to decode the communications. **********On Capitol Hill, several bills had been pending that would lift all export controls on encryption software, but the legislation did not move as the current session of Congress wound down. In Congressional testimony last week, Jamie S. Gorelick, Deputy Attorney General, said lifting all export controls would ''undermine our leadership role in fighting international crime and damage our own national security insterests.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/30/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-ragu-sauce-account-is-placed-in-review.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 195, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Ragu Sauce Account Is Placed in Review", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Ragu Sauce Account Is Placed in Review", "body_text": " **********The Van den Bergh Foods Company unit of Unilever, the British-Dutch consumer  products giant, said yesterday that it had placed in review the account of its Ragu line of pasta sauces.

Think Germany will soon cut interest rates and drive up that country's stock market? Some new investments make it particularly easy to speculate on just such matters. **********The American and the New York stock exchanges recently introduced stock index products for several countries. The issues, which trade like stocks, let investors buy the bulk of a foreign market in one fell swoop, in much the same way as a Standard & Poor's 500 index fund allows one to own most of the United States market. **********This is the simplest and most convenient way for most Americans to invest abroad,\" said Jim Rogers, the author of \"Investment Biker\" and a financial adviser. \"You can tell your broker, 'Instead of buying me I.B.M., buy me Germany or Australia.' \" **********Not that it was impossible to buy a fund specializing in these areas before.  But the choices were mostly closed-end funds, which issue a fixed number of shares and often trade at a discount or a premium to their underlying stock prices. Most closed-end country funds do not track an index but are actively managed, meaning they are run by stock pickers who aim to do better than the broad market. **********Along with closed-end funds, some open-end mutual funds specialize in specific countries, but most of those are also actively managed. Open-end funds  are priced once a day and can be bought or sold at their net asset values. Among the biggest managers of these funds is Wright Investors' Service, in Bridgeport, Conn., which has nine actively managed open-end country funds. \"Our objective is to outperform,\" said Peter Donovan, chairman of Wright, adding that investors will choose based on performance. \"If the index outperforms, they'll buy that.\"  Index funds aim to replicate the performance of the broad market by buying all the shares in a stock index and then keeping their expenses low. Only a few foreign funds, including the Vanguard International Equity Index European, now use indexing. Given how Americans have flocked to the concept of index investing at home, the new country index investments -- really a cross between open-end and closed-end funds -- are likely to attract a fair share of fans. World Equity Benchmark Shares, or WEBS, made their debut in March on the American Stock Exchange, and come in 17 varieties, each based on a different Morgan Stanley Capital International index. Country Baskets Index Funds, listed  on the New York Stock Exchange, come in nine versions, including one for the United States, and are based on Financial Times/Standard & Poor's AWI indexes. Most of the countries covered have relatively large, stable stock markets. You won't find Turkey or Israel in either group -- at least not yet. **********\"This is the first time you can easily buy an index fund for most of these countries,\" said Gregg Wolper, who specializes in closed-end funds at Morningstar Inc., the fund tracking firm in Chicago. \"Whether that's good or not remains to be seen. It's very possible you could do just as good or better with  a closed-end fund.\" **********The biggest impact could well be on the closed-end fund market, which has been in the doldrums, with only a handful of new issues in the last year. **********\"Since the WEBS and country baskets started, discounts on some closed-end funds have widened,\" said Thomas Herzfeld, who specializes in closed-end fund investing and is president of an advisory firm bearing his name in Miami. The discount on the Germany Fund has increased to 18 percent from 11 percent in January, he said, and the discount on the Scudder New Europe Fund, which has holdings in France, Germany and the Netherlands, has grown to 20 percent from 10 percent at the beginning of the year. \"The result is that closed-end funds are currently cheap,\" Mr. Herzfeld said, \"compared to WEBS and country baskets.\" Investors could reap a nice profit if the price of the closed-end funds moved closer to their underlying values and perhaps a windfall if the funds ever decided to convert to open-end status, issuing new shares. **********As an example, look at the Germany fund, a closed-end fund, and the new indexed Germany products. The portfolios are similar. \"If the discount narrows,  you'll make a lot more money buying the closed-end Germany Fund,\" said Mr. Wolper of Morningstar. There is no guarantee, however, that a discount will disappear over time. **********Some investors have long treated closed-end country funds as something akin to a broad market basket. That's not always the case. Even portfolios with similar holdings may have weighted the stocks differently. At the end of January, the Mexico index for WEBS consisted of 41 stocks, with Telefonos de Mexico at 28.2 percent. The Wright-Equifund Mexico, by contrast, had just 5.5 percent in Telmex at the end of March. **********The choice between actively managed funds and index funds is a basic one for  investors. Index funds have proved particularly useful for buying large-company  stocks in the very efficient stock market in the United States. The markets overseas may not be as efficient because of different accounting rules and difficulties in getting access to information. **********For these reasons and others -- like a desire to buy a fund that hedges against currency risk or one that moves into cash in times of political uncertainty -- many investors are willing to pay more for actively managed funds. Average annual expenses on international stock funds are 1.8 percent of assets, versus about 1 percent for WEBS and country baskets. Other costs to consider are brokerage commissions, which apply to WEBS, country baskets and closed-end funds, and sales charges, levied on many international mutual funds. **********\"The indexes are a low-cost alternative,\" said George Murnaghan, vice president of Rowe-Price Fleming International, which runs $23 billion in actively managed international funds for T. Rowe Price. \"But an investor may not want to have exposure to certain things in an index. They may want to skew their portfolio away from certain companies, like banks in Japan.\" **********Financial advisers generally urge small investors to start with a foreign fund that invests in many nations. **********\"The single worst investment you can make is in a single-country fund, especially in emerging markets, which are highly volatile and high risk,\" said Frank A. Fernandez, chief executive of Global Emerging Market Advisors L.P., of  New York, a specialist in diversified funds. \"And the toughest investment decision to make is 'top down' by country. It's easier to pick individual stocks in individual markets than to follow the political, economic and cultural events that can affect a single-country market.\" **********STILL, some people want to speculate -- at least with a small part of a portfolio -- with a single-country fund. **********And large investors may find the products particularly appealing. Money managers and fund companies may buy the country baskets and WEBS for their mutual fund portfolios. One appeal for anyone investing at least $450,000 is the possibility of getting out of WEBS or country baskets by taking the underlying stocks instead of cash. Such redemptions, granted at the issuer's discretion, allow investors to time their gains and losses on specific stocks. **********Sophisticated investors many also use the index products for arbitrage, taking advantage of temporary discrepancies in markets. For example, they could  sell the index fund short -- a bet that its price will fall -- during New York trading hours and then buy the underlying shares abroad when that market opens if the price indeed falls. They would pocket the difference as a profit. Country baskets can already be sold short when the price is going down; WEBS are seeking authorization to do so. Shorting is rarely possible with funds. **********\"I think the new indexes will make the markets more efficient,\" said Gary Evans, senior strategist for fixed income in emerging markets at Lehman Brothers. **********Investors in foreign countries may clamor for the new products as well. \"You  can't buy index funds in most countries of the world,\" said Mr. Rogers, the investment adviser, \"so I suspect these funds also will be a way for foreigners  to invest in their own markets.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/21/business/executive-changes-016969.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********BEHRMAN CAPITAL, New York, said that William Merrill Matthes had joined the firm as a partner. **********COMMON FUND, Westport, Conn., named Robert L.

Investing in the stock market? That was for \"swank\" people, an activity to be mentioned only mockingly (\"I guess you must have shares in Consolidated Edison\") if, say, a visitor insisted on lighting a few living-room  lamps when it got dark. **********These days, as some recent books on pensions tell it, the outlook for retirement is both better and worse than it was for Sophie (who ran out of life, at the age of 100, before she ran out of money). **********Better, because do-it-yourself pension plans like 401(k)'s offer employees a  chance to amass some real retirement money by diverting part of their salaries to tax-deferred investment funds. Worse, because many workers cannot afford or are not allowed to put money in a save-it-yourself plan, at a time when company-paid retirement programs are in retreat and Social Security benefits, as always, give retirees just a taste of the money they used to make. **********Among the optimists are the 15 members of the now-famous Beardstown Ladies' Investment Club, who, with Robin Dellabough, are the authors of \"The Beardstown  Ladies' Stitch-in-Time Guide to Growing Your Nest Egg\" (Hyperion, $19.95), which became a business best seller this month. The authors -- eight of whom are retired -- acknowledge that \"traditional pensions have been getting scarcer,\" but they interpret this as a trend to \"put  more responsibility back onto the employee\" for retirement. **********The goal for pensioners, they say, should be to capture 75 to 80 percent of their preretirement income. Aggressive investing within a tax-deferred employee-savings plan is at the heart of their strategy, of course, but that comes later. **********First, readers are advised to assess their net assets (work sheets are included) and figure their potential income from these and other sources -- including Social Security, which the authors believe will be with us for a while. **********They recommend, however, that people check in regularly with the agency before they retire to head off any accounting mistakes and to learn what their future benefits will be (telephone numbers, addresses and instructions are handily provided). **********The \"Stitch-in-Time Guide\" also gives tidy, coherent explanations of each pension category -- from traditional employer-paid plans to 401(k)'s, I.R.A.'s,  Keoghs and a little-known option called an S.E.P., or simplified employee pension. It also gets into real estate investments and \"reverse\" mortgages (which turn home equity into cash). And it includes a handy pension resource list. **********This Beardstown book is at its best where its authors are happiest: in the chapters on the joys of stocks -- in this case, within a 401(k) or other tax-sheltered plan. But as a sequel of sorts to the \"Beardstown Ladies' Common-Sense Investment Guide,\" it disappoints. The 30 pages of author profiles  and recipes feel like padding this time. There's also a forced folksiness afoot, with adages (\"put the horse before the cart\") appearing in every chapter and investment charts bearing labels like \"Homemade Apple Pie.\" And, ladies, I'm going to have to mention the mixed metaphor in the title. If you want more on 401(k)'s, take a look at \"Building Your Nest Egg With Your 401(k),\" by Lynn Brenner (Investors Press, $14.95) or \"The 401(k) Book,\" by Richard Sasanow (Henry Holt, $9.95). Both are useful and readable (and, in the case of Sasanow, relentlessly upbeat).    THIS brings us to \"Pensions in Crisis,\" by Karen Ferguson and Kate Blackwell  (Arcade Publishing, $22.95), a comprehensive and sobering look at America's pension policies. **********The crisis, the authors say, is that for many people, the theoretical triad of pension sources -- Social Security benefits, traditional company plans and individual savings -- doesn't add up to much protection. Only about a third of private-sector workers are in employer-paid plans, they assert. And half of the  retirees receiving these benefits get less than $4,500 a year. Some private pensions are \"integrated\" with a retiree's Social Security benefit, meaning that the company's monthly payments are reduced by part or all of that amount. **********Meanwhile, the authors say, half of all Americans rely solely on Social Security -- with average benefits of less than $8,400 a year. Women, especially  widows, do most poorly. **********As for the rush into 401(k)'s, the authors say, \"those who will profit from these new savings plans are people wealthy enough to save without tax incentives.\" **********Ms. Ferguson, director of the Pension Rights Center in Washington, and Ms. Blackwell, a co-author with Ralph Nader of \"You and Your Pension,\" contend that  companies have embraced these new plans because they are cheaper than old-style  pension funds. Do-it-yourself plans typically cost a company 1 to 2 percent of its total payroll, they say, compared with about 7 percent for the traditional employer-paid pension plans. **********\"Pensions in Crisis\" calls for a national pension policy based on these traditional, voluntary, private-sector plans -- all in the context of a Pension  Bill of Rights that would, among other things, shorten vesting times and give all employees access to retirement benefits. (Today, companies can exclude some  workers from both traditional and tax-deferred plans.) **********But the book is also a practical primer for employees, one that deftly delineates the pension choices and dispenses advice about what workers can do to protect an underfinanced or overfinanced plan (the latter being ripe for raiding by the company) or to persuade an employer to start a pension plan. There's even a section on getting the most out of that 401(k)."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/16/business/westinghouse-offers-big-buyout-at-unit.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-09-16", "snippet": "Westinghouse Electric Corp offers voluntary buyouts to 4,600 of the 6,600 workers at its nuclear energy systems unit in Monroeville, Pa, where profits have fallen for more than two years because of weaker demand by utilities for equipment and serv...", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Westinghouse Offers Big Buyout at Unit", "print_headline": "Westinghouse Offers Big Buyout at Unit", "body_text": " **********The Westinghouse Electric Corporation is offering voluntary buyouts to 4,600 of the 6,600 workers at its slumping nuclear energy systems unit. **********Westinghouse has made previous moves to cut jobs at the unit, which is based in Monroeville, Pa.

''They just fired the missiles into nothingness,'' said Kenneth Bacon, the Defense Department's chief spokesman. **********The Enterprise received its new deployment orders as the Pentagon toughened its warnings to Iraq, telling Baghdad that a new threat today to Kuwait was ''rash'' and ''unacceptable'' and that any military action there would be met with ''all necessary and appropriate actions.'' **********The warning came after Tariq Aziz, Iraq's Foreign Minister, accused Kuwait today of an ''act of war'' for having agreed to allow the United States to send F-117 stealth fighters to Kuwait. **********In a commentary carried by the Iraqi News Agency, Mr. Aziz likened the recent turmoil in the Persian Gulf to the period six years ago before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and he accused Kuwait's rulers of ''evil collaboration with America in conspiring against Iraq's people.'' **********''Those kinds of rash statements are totally unacceptable,'' Defense Secretary William J. Perry said. **********In a campaign appearance in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., President Clinton said that ''I don't want to get in a word war with Saddam Hussein, but we're going to do whatever it takes to keep him from threatening his neighbors, threatening our pilots.'' He added, ''We cannot allow anybody anywhere to believe they are not bound by the rules of civilized behavior.'' **********With its 75 planes, the Enterprise would add significant muscle to the American military presence in the Middle East. But Pentagon officials said they had not yet received permission from Saudi Arabia for the Enterprise's fighters to cross Saudi Arabia en route to Iraq. Without such permission the next most direct route would be to cross Israeli and Jordanian airspace, or the carrier would have to reach the Persian Gulf, sometime next week, to bring its planes within range without mid-air refueling. **********The Israel-Jordan route would seem less likely, given the aversion of America's Arab allies to any Israeli involvement in an attack on another Arab nation. **********Mr. Bacon acknowledged today that while the United States was ''satisfied with the cooperation we're getting'' from American allies in the Persian Gulf, saying ''it's no secret that this is a touchy business for our allies in the Gulf.'' **********As the Clinton Administration sent the aircraft carrier to the Red Sea, ,  Republicans heaped criticism on the Administration. **********Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, James A.

Such give-and-take is provided for in the sweeping Federal telecommunications law that went into effect earlier this year. **********While the deal is the first such agreement between a regional Bell company and a cable operator, it is by no means the first or broadest open-network deal  between a Baby Bell and a would-be competitor. Late last month, the Ameritech Corporation, the Bell company serving five Great Lakes states, agreed to open its local networks to the MFS Communications Company, a provider of telecommunications services to business customers. **********Still, the Jones-Bell Atlantic agreement is significant. And it came on the same day that the Federal Communications Commission introduced new rules for letting large telephone companies offer cable-like video services over their phone wires. These F.C.C. rules, mandated by the new telecommunications law, would require phone companies to reserve much of their video-network capacity to outside programmers in return for being able to offer their own video programming -- with few of the regulations currently borne by cable companies. **********James Cullen, vice chairman of Bell Atlantic, described the Jones deal in a statement as \"indisputable proof that Bell Atlantic is absolutely serious about opening its markets to competition as soon as possible.\" **********Bell Atlantic will connect Jones to its network this summer.

There, with incense drifting around him, the Secretary General pauses alone for a moment or two and bows. **********The shrine is a monument to Adm. Heihachiro Togo, the Japanese naval commander who defeated Russian fleets at Port Arthur and the Tsushima Strait in 1904 and 1905 -- the first great victories of an emerging nation over an imperial European power. **********Today, as Mr. Boutros-Ghali stood his ground against an American veto, the first of as many as it will take to deny him a second term as Secretary General, this proud descendant of Egyptian aristocracy could draw from a complex personal history: part radical anti-colonialist, part French-educated intellectual and scholar, part diplomat sharpened and deromanticized by the politics of the Middle East and Africa. **********Today's vote in the Security Council was 14 to 1 in his favor, but the American no vote sets the stage for a prolonged battle over his future, and opens the way for new compromise candidates. **********It is a matter of principle, he insists as he carries on his almost certainly futile confrontation with the last superpower, that he fight not only for himself but also for the third world. The less developed countries do indeed still support him, though not always with the enthusiasm he might expect given his long association with nonalignment and other policies unpopular in most Western capitals. But Mr. Boutros-Ghali, 74, knows the odds, he said with a hint of resignation in an interview Sunday at his Sutton Place home. **********In the other corner in Washington is a 50-year-old American President from Arkansas with little experience in foreign affairs but a good political instinct for distancing himself from a man viewed with suspicion by many American conservatives.  President Clinton's aides say they never considered the United Nations Secretary General important enough to warrant a private meeting with their chief. **********''Friends come to me and say, 'Don't be passive,' '' Mr. Boutros-Ghali said. ''You are in America; they like fighters. You look like a lame duck. You have to act. But how can I fight Goliath? Come on! Who am I to fight a superpower? I cannot.'' **********He said that when he asked Secretary of State Warren Christopher to make his case with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Christopher told him, ''I'm the lawyer of the President; I'm not your lawyer.'' **********Mr. Boutros-Ghali's style, he said, is tete-a-tete, and it helped him build ''good chemistry'' with Presidents Carter and Bush. Now he finds himself frozen out of the White House. **********''Do I represent a danger to the security of the United States?'' he said, with the edge that can intimidate those who work for him. ''No. Did I smuggle something? Am I Noriega or Saddam Hussein?'' **********Boutros Boutros-Ghali is the great-grandson of a Coptic Christian courtier who managed the vast holdings of a royal prince in a 19th-century Egyptian caliphate and the grandson of a former Prime Minister who was assassinated in 1904. **********He said he was an active opponent of Muslim fundamentalism from his student days and a fervent anti-colonialist by the time he arrived in Paris in 1946 (the year President Clinton was born) to study at the Sorbonne, where he received a doctorate in international law. He has written books on Islamic thought. **********He likes to draw historical analogies. The United States, he suggested, has developed an attitude not unlike that of the Roman Empire.  ''Like in Roman times, they have no diplomacy,'' he said of Washington in its current mode. ''You don't need diplomacy if you are so powerful.'' **********Mr. Boutros-Ghali is an elegant man of wry wit whose understated tailored suits never crease or his polished shoes scuff, even in the African bush or battlefields in Bosnia. He has never sought to cut a figure in New York society. His visibility is so low that Americans who poke fun at his name probably do not really know who he is or what he does for a living. **********Barbara Walters, who has known Mr. Boutros-Ghali and his wife, Leia, since she was first assigned to interviews with President Anwar el-Sadat in Egypt in the 1970's, is one of the few people who have been able to draw him out socially. Ms. Walters says that the Secretary General prefers small dinners at home to big social events. **********But she does not think, as others do, that this has hurt him much in celebrity-conscious New York. ''In Washington, maybe, that would matter, but not in New York,'' she said. Still, Mr. Boutros-Ghali may not feel totally at home here. He muses about a future life writing in Europe. **********An American diplomat took a slightly different view of the importance of media appeal. The next Secretary General, he told reporters recently, needed to be a bit more media-friendly if not exactly social. Mr. Boutros-Ghali, Administration officials are fond of saying, had such a negative, arrogant image that he had become ''radioactive'' in Washington. **********Under his tenure, the United Nations has made steep staff cuts and held its budget level for the first time. **********But American critics say the organization needs more aggressive streamlining and Administration officials say that if he continues in office it will be impossible to persuade Congress to begin paying off the large American arrears at the United Nations. **********Warm and indulgent he is not, say many at the United Nations who have worked for him -- or been dismissed by him -- during his first term, which ends on Dec. 31. Stories are told of days off to attend family events denied; vacations barely tolerated. He does not see himself that way. He just does not like people to be somewhere else when he needs them, he says. **********Mr. Boutros-Ghali, who for many years was Egypt's chief foreign affairs minister, had built a good working relationship with succeeding American administrations through his work on Middle East peace efforts, including his visit to Jerusalem with President Sadat in 1977. As a Christian in the Middle East he had often been seen as a betrayer. **********He has remained close to a number of American officials, including Cyrus R. Vance and Lawrence S. Eagleburger, two former Secretaries of State. **********His relationship with Madeleine K. Albright and others in the Clinton Administration was not so bad until very recently, he added, when he got tangled up in an American Presidential campaign. **********''I had cooperated with the Americans in so many ways'' he said.

Telecronics, based in Englewood, Colo., has had losses since early 1995, when the company was forced by the  Food and Drug Administration to temporarily cease manufacturing heart pacemaker products for the American market. That ruling followed the deaths of several patients fitted with faulty heart pacemaker leads -- the wires that deliver the electrical current from the device to the heart -- made by Telectronics. **********''St. Jude has once again shown their savvy as buyers,'' said Kurt Kruger, an analyst with Montgomery Securities. ''They are paying a modest premium for Ventritex to gain a turn-key operation in the fastest-growing market,'' in the cardiology device business, he said. **********St. Jude executives said the deals would allow them to offer a complete line of heart rhythm regulating devices. ''Since St. Jude entered the cardiac rhythm management market with the Pacesetter acquisition, we have been committed to offer our customers a full line of products'' said Ronald A.

The team is experienced, well-knit and highly effective. The team members have paid their dues and know their subject area better than anyone else on earth. Their project is on track. And now, to your dismay, one of the five announces that she will be leaving at the end of the month. What a disaster. You call Personnel. \"Louise is leaving on the 31st,\" you tell them. \"Send me another Louise.\" **********But experienced team members like Louise are, sadly, out of stock. \"How about a Ralph?\" they suggest. The deal is done: Louise out on the 31st, Ralph in on the 1st. **********In an accounting sense, nothing has changed. Ralph makes about the same salary and has about the same workload as did Louise. Input (cost) is the same,  and output (effort) is the same. If the project was on track last month, it should still be O.K. this month. Why are you complaining? **********To understand the problem, consider Ralph's meaningful production on his first day on the job. How much does he chip away at the remaining project work?  Not at all, of course. He is trying to figure out who's who, how to find the gents' room and where to get those yellow legal pads. Mostly, however, he is poring over the notes Louise left about her work, notes that Louise would have no need to consult (and probably wouldn't even have written if she hadn't been about to leave). **********Every now and then Ralph has a question, so he looks for another team member  for help. Ralph's productivity on the first day is not even zero; it is negative. He is keeping other people from working at full capacity.  On the second day, he may be a bit less of a burden, and still less on the third. **********Eventually he comes up to speed, producing at the same level as his predecessor.  In picture form, it looks like the graphic below. The shaded area  is the lost production attributed to the sudden loss of an experienced worker, Louise. Put another way, it is the investment that the company is forced to make in the new worker, Ralph. The extent of the investment is a function of how long it takes new people to become as effective as the ones they replace. **********Depending on the type of work, the investment can be substantial. One of my clients, a network protocol group at Hewlett-Packard, figures that it takes 25 months to bring a new engineer up to speed. In simple terms, the shaded area in  such a case would be a bit more than one work year, including all the costs, salary and overhead. Each time a new engineer is hired, $150,000 has to be invested in that person before the investment begins to pay off. **********For reasons best understood to bean counters and tax authorities, modern companies do not capitalize their investment in people. Their rules make us pretend that people are a pure expense. Of course, that might have made sense for the unskilled workers of 100 years ago. But today's knowledge workers are different. They represent an enormous hidden investment, the company's human capital, shielded from the eye by let's-pretend bookkeeping. **********We often evaluate companies as if human capital doesn't matter. And so a company like AT&T; can lay off 40,000 knowledge workers, and the market will respond positively because expenses are trimmed. If corporations booked their investments in workers as capital assets, as I believe they should, AT&T; would not have been able to eliminate those jobs without writing down $4 billion to $8 billion of assets. Then the market response would be different. Instead of applauding the company's executives, we'd be looking to give them the boot."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/09/business/company-news-tandy-shares-fall-on-report-of-lower-earnings.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-07-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;TANDY SHARES FALL ON REPORT OF LOWER EARNINGS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;TANDY SHARES FALL ON REPORT OF LOWER EARNINGS", "body_text": " **********The shares of the Tandy Corporation tumbled yesterday after the company said  it expected second-quarter earnings to decline as much as 30 percent because of  weak same-store sales and higher interest costs.

The American law requires foreign companies to report any property they have in  Cuba that was confiscated from American owners by the Communist Government of President Fidel Castro. It also opens the way for those companies to be sued in  American courts for compensation. **********The law could have a damaging impact on companies like Grupo Domos, a Mexican company that bought half of the Cuban telephone company in 1994 for $750 million. ITT, the New York-based communications company, ran the Cuban phone system before Mr. Castro took over. **********Canada, which has no restrictions on trade with Cuba, has passed a law blocking local companies from complying with the reporting provisions of the American law and also forbids Canadian businesses from paying any fines that might be levied by an American court. Mr. Chretien said this morning that even tougher measures are being considered. **********Mexico, which has more money invested in Cuba than any other country, is considering adopting a law similar to that of the Canadians and perhaps imposing retributive tariffs. **********\"Mexico and Canada consider inadmissible every measure that, rather than promote liberty, obstructs freedom, that instead of dropping barriers, erects them to the detriment of international investment and business,\" Mr. Zedillo said at a joint session of the Canadian Parliament on Tuesday. **********The Helms-Burton Act is the central theme of the first state visit to Canada  by Mr. Zedillo, who took office in December 1994. His visit to Canada began on Monday in Ottawa and ends on Friday in Vancouver. **********American officials say they are not surprised by the complaints by Canada and Mexico, which have also been voiced by European and other Latin American countries. Last week Washington was handed a stinging setback as the Organization of American States, a hemispheric organization normally dominated by the United States, condemned laws that reach beyond the country where they are adopted. **********But the Americans warned against pushing too far. **********\"A lot of people on Capitol Hill are very irritated about this,\" said a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official called some recent comments by officials from neighboring countries \"gratuitous U.S.-bashing.\" **********Canada, Mexico and the United States joined in the North American Free Trade  Agreement in January 1994, forming the largest trading bloc in the world. The three trading partners have already met several times to determine whether Nafta regulations supersede the provisions of the Helms-Burton Act. Nothing has been resolved. **********The law was hastily passed last March after Cuban fighters shot down two unarmed civilian planes flown by anti-Castro Cuban-Americans from Miami. Four men died in the incident. **********The most controversial aspects of the law, permitting lawsuits against foreign companies and their executives doing business in Cuba, do not become effective until Aug. 1. Some officials from Canada and Mexico believe there is still a chance that President Clinton, who initially opposed the legislation, will not allow it to be enforced. **********Cemex, a large Mexican cement company, announced two weeks ago that it was pulling out of Cuba to avoid trouble with American laws. But other Mexican businessmen have taken a defiant stand. **********\"If someone starts a legal action against us in the United States, we're ready to defend ourselves,\" said Bernardo Dominguez, president of the Mexican construction and hotel company Grupo DSC. **********Canada also has large investments in Cuba, including several hotels and Sherritt International's sprawling nickel mine. **********Both Domos and Sherritt were among the first companies to receive warnings from the United States State Department last month that they may be operating in Cuba in violation of the Helms-Burton law. **********Miguel Angel Gonzalez Felix, legal counsel to the Mexican Foreign Relations Ministry, said Mexico had focused on the date July 15 to decide how to respond to the United States initiative. Under the Helms-Burton law, Mr. Clinton must decide no later than 15 days before the implementation date whether he will allow the law to take effect. **********\"Right now everyone in the world is focusing on that date to see what the Americans will do,\" said Mr. Gonzalez Felix. **********But the White House insists the law will be enforced and preparations have already been made for a Mexican counter law based on the Canadian model. **********Canada has what is called a \"blocking statute\" that would prohibit Canadian businesses from complying with the Helms-Burton law. Canada toughened the blocking statute in January. There is also a \"claw-back\" provision that allows Canadian companies to countersue to be compensated for judgments made against them in the United States. **********\"In trying to isolate Cuba, they're hurting their largest trading partners,\"  said Roy MacDonald, a Liberal Party Member of Parliament, referring to the United States. \"In our view, that's not how you treat your friends.\" **********Despite the polemics, Canada and Mexico seem to understand the limits of what they can do. **********\"I do not want to lie to Mexican businessmen and promise them legislation that will make them totally invulnerable to the Helms-Burton law,\" Mr. Zedillo said at a news conference this morning. \"That is not possible.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/11/business/ford-places-top-designer-on-the-leadership-track.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1996-10-11", "snippet": "Ford Motor Co names Jacques A Nasser to head its North American and European automotive operations, clearing the way for Nasser to become Ford's top operating officer someday; Nasser, who had been group vice president in charge of vehicle developm...", "word_count": 694, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ford Places Top Designer On the Leadership Track", "print_headline": "Ford Places Top Designer On the Leadership Track", "body_text": " **********The Ford Motor Company today named Jacques A.

Hagenlocker, has worked from an office at the company's headquarters here, Mr. Nasser will remain at Ford's sprawling vehicle development campus several miles away.

''The job is his to lose right now.'' **********Mr. Nasser, a favorite of the Ford family, has long been expected to go farther than Mr. Hagenlocker, a  physicist who does not seem as comfortable as Mr. Nasser at making speeches and other public appearances. While Mr. Hagenlocker has received some of the credit for the highly successful redesign last winter of the F-series pickup trucks, the nation's best-selling vehicle, he has also taken some of the blame for the less successful redesign last year of the Ford Taurus sedan. **********Mr. Trotman hinted today that he would be interested in staying on as chairman of Ford beyond his 65th birthday if the board will let him. ''You'd like to live to be 100 years old and work in the auto business, it's just not realistic,'' he said. **********If the automotive operations run into trouble, Mr. Nasser could easily run into competition for the top job. **********John M. Devine, the 52-year-old chief financial officer and a favorite of Wall Street because of his consistent candor, was also picked today to become an executive vice president. He gave up his responsibility over land development to Mr. Hagenlocker but kept his position as chief financial officer. **********W. Wayne Booker, the 62-year-old executive vice president who oversees Ford's operations in emerging markets, was also chosen today to become a vice chairman. But neither Mr. Hagenlocker nor Mr. Booker will become members of the board.

Rather than buy a personal computer costing $2,000 to $3,000, he said, people could pay as little as $500 for a device with a microprocessor and good picture and sound capabilities but little memory. Such a machine would connect to big server computers where programs and data would be stored.

Earlier this week, Dataquest, a market research  firm, released a report that concluded the home market for PC's is rapidly maturing; Dataquest forecast just 8 percent growth in 1996, down from 22 percent in 1995 and 42 percent in 1994. **********Digital's shares dropped $11.25, to close at $56, on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares in the Hewlett-Packard Company dropped $3.625 to $97.625; those of I.B.M. fell $4.75, to $117; Compaq fell $2, to $38.125, and the Dell Computer Corporation fell $1.125 a share, to $32.50. **********Related stocks also took a hit, with declines at the Intel Corporation, Micron Technology Inc. and Microsoft. The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 52 points in the session before rebounding to close at 5,655.42, down 14.09 points. **********John Jones, an analyst with Salomon Brothers in San Francisco, recommended caution about the entire information-science sector, citing a broad shift in economic factors that does not bode well. **********\"We've had the wind at our back in this group for two years,\" he said. \"We've seen now collectively, enough indications -- softness in certain markets, the PC market getting ugly, currency shifts, memory prices under pressure -- and yet the stocks until a few days ago were trading at two-year highs.\" **********Mr. Jones has downgraded Digital, I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and several smaller companies, and sees no hurry to begin buying the stocks again. \"Is this a long-term downturn or a speed bump in the road? I think it's a speed bump,\" he said. \"The fundamentals of these companies are better than in years, but it doesn't mean their earnings aren't going to get hit. It's going to take a couple of quarters to settle out, so we think it's better to be cautious for a while.\" **********Other analysts argued that while sales of personal computers had clearly slowed, there was little indication that work stations, servers and larger systems had followed suit. Driving down the share price of a diversified technology company like Hewlett-Packard or I.B.M. because of weakness in PC sales, they said, has created an opportunity. **********\"We're saying buy I.B.M. and H-P,\"said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. But even he downgraded Digital Equipment to neutral. \"I would return to the stock, but right now I don't think it's going to go anywhere,\" he  explained. **********Digital's problem is that PC's account for nearly 20 percent of the company's revenue; while sales of servers based on the company's Alpha chip are strong, they are not enough to compensate for such a big hit, Mr. Milunovich said. \"My guess is the PC slowdown will cost them 25 to 30 cents a share and they just can't offset that with other business,\" he said. **********But Stephen Smith, an analyst with Paine Webber, said the rest of Digital's businesses were performing well enough that investors should stay with the stock. \"Everything else at D.E.C. is above plan; to get bitten in the leg by the PC business like this is a real tragedy,\" he said. \"I think it's a major overreaction.\" He said Paine Webber has had a buy on Digital shares since they were at $18, and it was keeping that recommendation. **********A positive indicator for Digital today was a Microsoft report that sales of its more powerful operating system, Windows NT, have accelerated. \"Windows NT is really beginning to kick into high gear, and D.E.C. is aggressively serving that market,\" Mr. Smith said. **********On the other hand, he said, Digital's advisory that price cuts have not stimulated corporate PC sales is worrisome -- and not just for Digital. \"I'm concerned about I.B.M.'s exposure, Hewlett's exposure,\" he said. \"It does not look to me like a D.E.C.-specific problem.\" **********One reason for the divergence of views is that some indicators can be read in many ways. The steep drop in memory prices is widely believed to reflect excess  inventories at PC manufacturers, created by the drop in demand. But cheaper memory lowers the manufacturing cost for computers, which should lead to lower prices, higher margins or both. **********\"Demand may be slowing on the PC side, but we can't see that there's any slowing on the work station side,\" said Doug van Dorsten, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist. \"The upshot of all this is the tea leaves are a mess right now.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/04/business/worldbusiness/IHT-why-a-strong-yen-could-hurt-european-bonds.html": {"writer_name": "Carl Gewirtz", "pub_date": "1996-11-04", "snippet": "Transition is never easy, and usually it is painful.

So a stretch of discomfort probably is in store as financial markets prepare to move away from an extended period of yen weakness \u2014 which, in turn, could have far-reaching effects on European bond markets. **********What makes the change especially charged is the uncertainty about the upcoming dominant trend: Will it be dollar strength, giving the yen room to fall a bit more, or dollar weakness? **********Analysts are cautious about identifying the next big trend, but they agree that, because of trade concerns in Tokyo and Washington, the leading role of the yen is just about over. \"We're nearing the end of the yen's decline,\" said Brendan Brown at Tokyo-Mitsubishi International. \"Further weakness of the yen makes no sense,\" said Jim O'Neill at Goldman, Sachs & Co. **********The end of the yen's weakness undoubtedly will spill over onto other currencies \u2014 just as the yen's weakness, which pushed the dollar up in Japan, contributed to pushing up the dollar against the Deutsche mark. Over the past three months the dollar has risen 5.8 percent against the yen and 2.5 percent against the mark. **********In turn, the weak performance of the mark, aided by German interest rate cuts, greatly reduced strains within Europe's fixed exchange-rate system and fueled optimism that the planned monetary union would occur as scheduled in 1999 \u2014 possibly with a larger number of participants than initially thought. This, in turn, fueled a massive rally in European bond markets, pulling long-term bond yields close to levels in the benchmark German market. **********If the mark were to strengthen on the basis of a stronger-than-expected economic upturn, and if the Bundesbank were obliged to raise interest rates before recovery in the rest of Europe could support such a move, convergence toward monetary union could be blown apart. **********Alternatively, expansion in the United States could force Federal Reserve Board policymakers to raise rates and add to the dollar's attractiveness for international investors. Unfortunately for this theory, the latest U.S. economic data do not warrant expectations of a move by the Fed. **********J.P. Morgan & Co., which has been the most insistent on the need for an interest rate increase, now puts a low probability on such a move before early February. Salomon Brothers Inc., which is also bearish on the rate outlook, thinks the latest economic data put a Fed policy shift \"off the table for the next few months,\" said John Lipsky, a Salomon analyst. **********Mr. Brown is putting his money on a strong fourth-quarter bounce in the U.S. economy, leading to an early increase by the Fed and a rising dollar. **********Mr. O'Neill of Goldman is looking to the Dublin summit of European leaders in December to produce agreement on a so-called \"stability pact\" to adhere to sound budget policies. That, in turn, would open the way for Germany to reduce interest rates further. By that scenario, DM weakness could replace the current yen weakness, supporting the dollar and enhancing the outlook for monetary union. **********For Mr. O'Neill, the recent tough talk on the German rate outlook from various members of the Bundesbank is a \"scare tactic\" to assure agreement on the stability pact. **********John Llewellyn at Lehman Brothers agreed that German rates probably were not headed down, unless economic activity is much stronger than now forecast. \"But given that fiscal policy is tightening \u2014 a combination of spending cuts and tax hikes \u2014 and inflation is no worry, there certainly won't be any increase in interest rates, and more likely rates will be cut further.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/29/world/3-britons-believed-killed-by-bosnia-mine.html": {"writer_name": "Kit Roane", "pub_date": "1996-01-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 527, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "3 Britons Believed Killed by Bosnia Mine", "print_headline": "3 Britons Believed Killed by Bosnia Mine", "body_text": " **********Three British soldiers on a routine patrol in western Bosnia were presumed dead today after their vehicle was blown up in an unmarked minefield, and a 28-year-old American officer was shot in the neck and slightly wounded in the Serb-held Sarajevo suburb of Ilidza.    NATO spokesmen said the American officer, Second Lieut. Shawn H. Watts, 28, of Greenwood, Miss., was back on duty after being grazed by a sniper at 6 A.M. today. **********The bullet struck him as he walked in the hotel complex used by NATO as its  ground force headquarters in Bosnia. Soldiers did not return fire. **********Lieutenant Watts, a member of the 66th Military Intelligence Group based at Augsburg, Germany, is the first American soldier in Bosnia to be wounded under fire. **********Sniping incidents are by no means rare in the Serb-held suburbs around Sarajevo. French troops there reported being fired on twice on Saturday during routine patrols, and an Italian soldier was wounded in a similar shooting this month. **********Ilidza, which under the Dayton peace accord is to come under Muslim and Croatian rule in March, has been the site of several protests by residents angered that they must give up Serb-held land around the Bosnian capital. **********\"Unfortunately, this shooting is not an isolated incident,\" said a NATO spokesman, Lieut. Col. Brien Hoey. \"In a city like this it would be difficult to establish trends, but this is one of a series of recent incidents that have put  soldiers at risk.\" **********Another NATO spokesman, Lieut. Chuck Merlo, said: \"At this point we don't know whether this was a ricochet, an accident or direct fire. But the investigation is under way.\" **********The compound where Lieutenant Watts was hit is ringed by razor wire, and all  troops on duty must wear Kevlar helmets and flack jackets. **********Later in the day, a vehicle carrying three British soldiers hit an unmarked minefield west of Mrkonjic Grad, in the fourth mine accident to befall the 10,000-member British contingent. Bad weather and more mines have prevented rescue crews from learning the condition of the soldiers, who were on patrol in  central Bosnia. **********There are an estimated three million mines in the former Yugoslavia, with the rival factions submitting plans that account for 1,500 in the area now under British control. Under to the terms of the Dayton agreement, all sides were required to provide maps of minefields by Jan. 19. But a NATO spokesman, Maj. Steven Kilpatrick, said his troops, \"were not given any records of any minefield in the area of this incident.\" **********He added that it would be difficult to place blame for the uncharted minefield because the area changed hands repeatedly over the course of Bosnia's  nearly four years of war. The stretch of land -- now under the control of the Muslim-Croatian federation -- is to be handed back to the Bosnian Serbs in March. **********In a separate accident, one Swedish soldier was killed and another injured when their armored personnel carrier ran off a road and landed in a river northwest of Tuzla. As in the case of the British soldiers, their names have not been released by NATO pending notification of their families."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/20/business/small-travel-agencies-face-hard-times-under-fee-cap.html": {"writer_name": "Edwin McDowell", "pub_date": "1996-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Small Travel Agencies Face Hard Times Under Fee Cap", "print_headline": "Small Travel Agencies Face Hard Times Under Fee Cap", "body_text": " **********Mary Hogan, the owner of a tiny three-person travel agency in Cambridge, Mass., thought she was ready for anything in the notoriously fickle travel business. \"I survived the gulf war,\" she said, \"when not a soul was traveling anywhere.\" **********But she did not survive the decision made a year ago by the airline industry  to limit the normal 10 percent commissions on domestic travel to no more than $50 a ticket. She closed up shop last April, shortly after the cap went into effect. **********When my income went down and my overhead didn't, I had the business sense to know to get out,\" Ms. Hogan said. \"As we speak today I know five other people who are closing their agencies. The small, independent agency is an endangered species.\" **********That may be an exaggeration, but clearly something is amiss. Last year, even  though overall travel revenues were up and the number of agents grew, 1,550 full-service travel agencies went out of business. That is 53 percent more than  in 1994, according to figures compiled by the Airlines Reporting Corporation, the clearinghouse for funds between airlines and travel agencies. Many of those  were replaced by new agencies springing up elsewhere, for a total of 33,600. But single-office locations -- most of them the traditional mom-and-pop shops that have long been the mainstay of the industry -- fell by 1.3 percent. **********Moreover, the longer the cap has been in effect, the more agencies are going  out of business. Travel Weekly magazine reported 484 full-service agency closings in the fourth quarter of last year, compared with 407 such closings in  the third quarter of 1995 and 340 in the second quarter. There were only 290 closings during the fourth quarter of 1994. **********\"Many small agencies struggled all year to hang on,\" said Lauraday Kelley, president of the Association of Retail Travel Agents. \"When you'll really see closings and mergers is later this year, when leases and contracts with customers expire.\" **********Others echoed that view. \"Lots of people in the industry think we'll see a drastic number of people calling it quits in the next few months,\" said Paul Rudin, senior vice president of industry affairs for the American Society of Travel Agents. **********The majority of agencies do less than $2 million in business annually. Most of them see themselves as under siege from almost every side: from the imminent  opening of a prototype Wal-Mart Travel agency in Roanoke, Va., to the spread of  travel and reservation services onto the Internet. And with the savings airlines already achieved last year by capping domestic flights -- commissions fell 3 percent to $3.69 billion -- carriers are now talking about whether they can get  away with capping commissions on international flights as well. **********No wonder, travel agents say, that so many smaller agencies have decided to call it quits. **********Stephen and Ruthie Dukkony of Annapolis, Md., were travel agents for 17 years before recently concluding there was little future as an independent agency for  their Annapolis Travel. Three months ago, they sold it to Travelogue, a small chain based in Washington, although they continue to run the agency. **********\"In the past we used the 10 percent commission we made on fares over $500 to  offset the money we lost writing low-priced fares,\" Mr. Dukkony said. The caps \"pushed us over the edge.\" **********Although about one-third of agencies charge service fees or say they plan to  do so, small agencies fear that fees will drive away customers. Even giant American Express withdrew its $20 fee on airline tickets priced less than $300. **********When Delta Air Lines began the stampede by airlines to cap agency commissions last February, the driving force was clearly economics. Delta, in its bid to cut a total of $2 billion in operating costs in little more than two years, argued it had little choice but to seek savings from commissions, its third-biggest expense after salaries and fuel. Delta's commissions to travel agents fell $157 million last year, or 12.5 percent, to $1.1 billion. During the fourth quarter of last year, Delta's commission payments plummeted 17 percent compared  with the comparable period a year earlier. **********The only hope for the agencies of lifting the cap is to win a class-action lawsuit against AMR's American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta, Northwest  Airlines, UAL's United Airlines and USAir. The suit contends that the carriers conspired to impose the caps. The jury trial -- from which Trans World Airlines  was dropped as a defendant last spring when it restored the full 10 percent commission -- is tentatively scheduled for the fall in the United States District Court in Minneapolis. **********\"Because it's in litigation, we don't have any comment on the cap,\" said Jackie Pate, a Delta spokeswoman. **********To blunt the impact of commission caps, many agents have diversified into specialty markets and into booking more tours, hotels, rental cars and cruises.  Results appear mixed. **********Hotel commissions more than doubled last year, to $74 million. But only about 300 agencies out of an estimated 10,000 responded to an offer by Carnival Cruises to increase commissions for bookings from those who had not done business with the cruise line before. That was \"far fewer than we expected,\" said Tim Gallagher, a Carnival spokesman. **********Still, many surviving travel agencies are optimistic. Northwestern Travel Service, a large Minneapolis agency, spent a good part of last year renegotiating contracts with its commercial accounts, at a cost to its bottom line. \"But our clients are now paying more attention to what services we offer them, and finding them worth the price,\" said Arthur I. Dahl, Northwestern's president. **********While acknowledging that the commission caps hurt, Mark Mancini, an industry  consultant in Los Angeles, also sees vast opportunities for travel agents as opinion brokers. **********\"You can access the best fare from New York to Paris, but try finding how far it is to Monet's gardens at Giverny,\" he said. \"What travel agents can do best is tell you what planes have more legroom and what airline has better food.\" **********Meanwhile, newcomers are still coming into the business, although at a slower pace than before. **********Faye DiGirolamo opened Paradise Travel Ltd. in Kansas City, Mo., after having worked as an independent agent for a dozen years. \"Even with all the drawbacks,  I love the business,\" he said, \"I never intend to be in another one the rest of  my life.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/22/business/a-mini-van-on-a-diet.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-09-22", "snippet": "Photo of a 'Smart' mini-car built by Mercedes and Swatch on test track in France", "word_count": 43, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Mini-Van on a Diet?", "print_headline": "A Mini-Van on a Diet?", "body_text": " **********Or perhaps a giant bug on wheels?

He took a few steps outside the prison gate, but fans who had been anticipating his release swarmed around him. **********The leader of Niche -- one of the world's hottest salsa bands -- and the suspected songster of drug traffickers ducked back inside the prison walls. **********He tried again, calling for his white Lexus to be brought to him. This time the parade of admirers followed Mr. Varela in cars, scooters and bicycles to his studio in the southern part of town. His mother was waiting there for him. **********So was his recording equipment, including the ''Rolls-Royce of recording consoles,'' as he called it, which had helped to get him into so much trouble in the first place. **********Along with Mr. Varela's large investments in a discotheque and a modeling agency, it was this $250,000, 48-track British-made Solid State Logic recording console -- one of only two in South America -- that made the Colombian authorities wonder whether all his money was coming from his music. **********Mr. Varela, 47, returned to Colombia from Miami last December to face charges of illicit enrichment, conspiracy and money laundering. **********The charges stemmed from business dealings that Mr. Varela was alleged to have had with Helmer Herrera Buitrago, a confessed drug trafficker, and Jose Santacruz Londono, another major drug trafficker, who was killed in a storm of gunfire a month after he escaped from prison in January. **********Mr. Varela was released on a technicality. The investigating magistrate in Cali improperly ignored statements from his Miami bank, where Sony, the group's record company, deposited royalties and other payments, Mr. Varelas said. **********But he was released on a $50,000 bond, with orders that he not leave the country without permission. The investigation continues. **********''I've been working in music for 17 years,'' Mr. Varela said in an interview here the day after his release, while his band was on tour in the United States without him. ''We're the best-paid salsa band in the world. They're saying I can't show where my money comes from.'' **********He denied having any ties with drug traffickers and said it was a coincidence that a song he wrote some years back happened to be an anagram of Jose Santacruz Londono's name. **********''I wrote the song at the request of a mother for her child who had the same name,'' Mr. Varela said. Besides, he said, he wrote the song in 1986, when Mr. Santacruz ''was still recognized as someone worthy of respect.'' **********He insisted that Niche never performed at the private parties the drug cartel leaders threw, and he said the group had not realized that drug dealers had paid for a public concert the group once gave. **********He also contended that Colombian prosecutors were willing to believe that his income was ill-gotten because he is black in a country where few black residents have that kind of income. In the complicated lexicon of race in Colombia, the band's name, Niche, describes the darkest-skinned black people. **********In Cali, his fans bristled at his imprisonment, contending that many entertainers had performed at the drug cartel leaders' private bashes without being charged with anything. **********''His popularity hasn't suffered,'' said Jorge Valencia, who invited Mr. Varela to appear on his live television program, where former members of his band performed boleros in Mr. Varela's honor. The show, ''Noche de Luna,'' is broadcast on Spanish-language stations from Peru to Canada. ''People are absolutely convinced of his innocence,'' Mr. Valencia said. **********Like most salsa bands, Niche sings of the trials of love and beauty and bruised hearts. Umberto Valverde, editor of a cultural newspaper here called The Word and the author of a book about the Cuban salsa star Celia Cruz, said Niche was the first salsa group to gain a wide international following. **********Mr. Varela ''took the salsa tradition of Puerto Rico, Cuba and New York and mixed in his own musical history'' from his Chocuano region of Colombia and his experiences in Cali,'' Mr. Valverde said. **********Before Mr. Varela's legal trouble began, Mr. Valverde, a musicologist, had been faulting him for not being daring enough artistically, sticking to a commercially successful formula of a salsa that was lively, yet suave. In a 1992 interview, Mr. Varela had promised that his next record would include pachanga, a salsa from Cuba that uses instruments not traditionally associated with salsa music like flute, saxophone and piano. **********And in his recording studio after his release, the composer said he had been thinking in new directions while he was in jail. **********Though as a jailhouse celebrity, Mr. Varela enjoyed a private cell and the latitude to manage his band, the isolation and public opprobrium affected him deeply. It started him thinking about justice and racism -- subjects that had never preoccupied him before, he said. **********In addition to losing a year of freedom, he has lost his $2 million discotheque, which the authorities shut down. **********In prison, he worried about his family, his band, his finances and his fate. He wrote some 30 songs, about a rebellious black slave, prison and justice. His next album is provisionally titled ''Trial by Fire.'' **********He said he supported the chief prosecutor, Alfonso Valdivieso, who has been trying to search out the tentacles of the drug trade. **********''They simply made a mistake in my case,'' Mr. Varela said. **********He sat before his recording console, with its dizzying array of dials, switches, slides and meters, adjusting a recording that Niche made of his song ''The Jail.'' **********It was not the first time the songwriter was hearing it performed -- he had advised on the recording by cellular telephone from jail -- but taking over the control panel once again was something else. ''I could spend the rest of my life here,'' he said, his eyes filling with tears. **********From speakers as tall as a man, surrounding him, sang the chorus: ''Freedom, freedom is a treasure whose value you don't know until you've lost it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/07/business/company-news-broderbund-stock-down-after-earnings-report.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;BRODERBUND STOCK DOWN AFTER EARNINGS REPORT", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;BRODERBUND STOCK DOWN AFTER EARNINGS REPORT", "body_text": " **********The shares of Broderbund Software Inc., which makes educational software, slumped yesterday, one day after the company warned that second-quarter results  would be less than forecasts because of slower product sales.

Chip users found themselves with stockpiles of unused chips, and chip makers faced falling prices just as they had increased investment in manufacturing capacity. **********The Semiconductor Industry Association, an industry group in the United States, expects the world chip market to grow only 6.7 percent this year, with sales of D-RAM's declining 2.3 percent. **********The Japanese will thus be looking to other products. \"We are too dependent on memory chips, but rather than cut down, we should increase output of more profitable logic chips,\" said Mitsubishi's managing director, Masatoshi Umeda."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/02/business/deal-confirmed-for-blue-cross-of-connecticut.html": {"writer_name": "Milt Freudenheim", "pub_date": "1996-10-02", "snippet": "Anthem Inc, big insurance company based in Indiana, confirms it plans to add Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Connecticut to its Anthem East unit; says Anthem and Blue Cross will merge, subject to approval by Anthem board and insurance commissioners ...", "word_count": 610, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Deal Confirmed for Blue Cross of Connecticut", "print_headline": "Deal Confirmed for Blue Cross of Connecticut", "body_text": " **********In the latest salvo in the battle for the growing New York-area health care market, Anthem Inc., a big insurance holding company based in the Midwest, confirmed yesterday that it planned to add Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Connecticut to its Anthem East unit. **********Anthem and the Blue Cross plan said yesterday they had agreed in principle to merge, subject to approval by the Anthem board at a meeting this week and by insurance commissioners in Connecticut and Indiana, Anthem's home state. Since the partners are mutual insurance companies, the deal is also subject to approval by their policyholders. **********The deal, in which no cash changes hands, will unite Anthem, a growing and thriving company based in Indianapolis, with a Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan which is rich in customers, if not in profits. **********The Anthem East unit, based in Newark, would also include Blue Cross and Blue Shield in New Jersey and Delaware, plans that Anthem is in the process of acquiring. The unit would have at least three million enrollees. **********Health care experts said that Anthem would eventually compete head-on in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut with Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the New York giant, which last week said it planned to become a for-profit enterprise. **********''They've got New York surrounded,'' said Richard Sinni, a health-benefits analyst in Secaucus, N.J., with Buck Consultants. ''The next step may be an acquisition in New York itself.'' **********Assuming that all its planned mergers are approved, Anthem said, it would have $11.5 billion in consolidated annual revenue, assets exceeding $7.5 billion and policyholders' equity of more than $1.8 billion, making it one of the nation's five biggest health care management companies. **********Empire has more than four million enrollees, of whom 523,000 are in managed care, and people familiar with the New Jersey market said that Empire had taken steps to do business there as part of a plan to expand into Connecticut as well. **********The moves by Anthem and Empire should provide new strength for Blue Cross plans in the three-state region as they struggle against managed-care companies like Aetna, which recently combined with U.S. Healthcare for a subscriber base of about 1.4 million people in New York area networks, and Oxford Health Plans, which has close to one million. **********Employers welcomed the announcement, which could mean better buys and improved products.

Bernstein & Company, said that the wave of Blue Cross mergers was 10 years late but ''still welcome.''

Telenovelas are soap operas, except that they have a definite beginning and end, typically portraying 120 hours of stormy deceit and thwarted love. **********Now, much like the spurned bride of a soap opera, Latin American television itself is plotting a comeback. After languishing last year in the doldrums of the \"tequila effect,\" the regional economic slowdown brought on by the devaluation of the Mexican peso, Latin America is once again a hot media market \u2014 both for importing and for exporting TV programs. **********From Amman to Beijing and Warsaw, Latin American telenovelas have captured hundreds of millions of devoted fans. The global telenovela industry is worth more than $1 billion, according to industry figures. **********U.S. and other foreign operators, meanwhile, are poised for an invasion going the other way. Although about 83 million households in Latin America have television, fewer than 10 percent currently subscribe to some form of pay television.

Rival consortiums led by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and the satellite communications operator Hughes Electronics Corp. are vying for the emerging regional market for television delivered by direct-to-home satellites. **********Discovery Communications Inc., the cable documentary network, has doubled its subscribers in two years, to 5 million households across 23 countries, and Walt Disney Co.'s cable sports network ESPN reaches 6.8 million viewers with service in English, Spanish and Portuguese. **********Growth in Viacom's MTV has been so rapid in the region that the music network is spinning off a third channel alongside its MTV Latin America and MTV Brasil services. Turner's Cable News Network International recently launched a Spanish-language service based in Argentina. **********\"The conventional wisdom used to be that Asia would be the next boom television market and Latin America would follow, but now it appears that Asia will follow Latin America,\" said Piper Parry, a spokeswoman for Nickelodeon networks, a Viacom subsidiary. The children's network is conducting research in the region before entering an already crowded children's programming market. **********Ms. Parry joined 10,500 television executives gathered here last week for an international television market that drew a large contingent of buyers and sellers from Latin America. **********Shaky currencies still cripple the region's media industry. Investors in Venezuela and Mexico in particular continue to encounter difficulties withdrawing profits. But U.S. investors remain optimistic. **********\"Once the effects of devaluation have run their course, Mexico and other Latin American countries will turn into an exceptionally strong market,\" said Charlotte Leonard, general manager for Turner's TNT and Cartoon Network Latin America. **********Piracy has also proven to be a major stumbling block to opening up the region. In Colombia, where there are no effective laws against program piracy, ersatz neighborhood broadcasters pull television signals from a satellite, unscramble them with a cheap decoder and beam them back out to subscribers, who are typically charged $25 a month to receive the pirated programs. **********In contrast to France, where American television programming faces stiff quotas and continues to be branded as a cultural invasion, producers in Latin America see little threat from such U.S. standards as \"Baywatch\" and \"Beavis and Butthead.\" **********\"Local production continues to dominate the schedules across the region, particularly in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and the larger countries,\" said Alberto Peceguiero, chief executive of the Brazilian network Globosat Programadora Ltda. \"So far, it doesn't look like exposure to international programs harms local production.

For millions of ordinary Japanese, who for two decades watched American movies on Japanese television, she is the sweet and syrupy falsetto of  Marilyn Monroe. **********Marilyn Monroe with a high-pitched voice? **********That's what happens when movie stars are brought to TV screens in Japan, where thousands of American movies have been dubbed into Japanese for years. Feminine allure, manly courage and the glamour of film idols take on an entirely new timbre in Japan, as Japanese directors and agents try to match American heroes and heroines with Japanese voices that will most appeal to audiences here. **********In Japanese theaters, as in American ones, foreign films tend to use subtitles. But for television -- where most Japanese see foreign films -- dubbing is considered essential, and must be accomplished with a fine ear for society's unspoken expectations. **********\"We have our own Japanese image of Marilyn Monroe, which fits exactly with Mukai -- Mukai's soft, cute voice,\" said Takashi Fujii, Mrs. Mukai's agent. \"When Japanese people think of Marilyn, we think of Mukai's voice. It's almost as if Japanese audiences have been brainwashed.\" **********Whitney Houston, Lauren Bacall and other movie actresses also get sky-high voice lifts by female Japanese dubbers, who are aiming for wide audiences with the traditional pitch of feminine charm. **********Such personal touches sometimes give dubbed movies an edge over subtitled films, which are common in the theaters (with the exception of popular dubbed cartoons). At least three Oscar-nominated films have been dubbed for video rentals. **********There are about 1,000 professional dubbers, but only about 300 are used for the voices of major movie roles. So famous American actors begin literally to sound alike. **********The results are sometimes surprising to an American ear. The lines of Kevin Costner, Robert Redford and even Danny DeVito, for example, are all rendered in  the rich, booming baritone voice of 52-year-old Masane Tsukayama. **********In the corner of a tiny basement room, crowded on a recent day with more than a dozen other dubbers sitting on metal chairs, Mr. Tsukayama held his helmet-like earphones with one hand as he bellowed his lines into a microphone. **********In gray tweed trousers, a white shirt and glasses, Mr. Tsukayama looked more  like a professor, with his eyes flitting back and forth between a script and a small TV screen, than the football coach he was portraying as the voice of James Caan in \"The Program.\" **********In Japan, however, Mr. Tsukayama is well known as the voice of Mr. Costner, whose lines he has spoken in such movies as \"Dances with Wolves,\" \"Bodyguard,\" \"Robin Hood\" and \"JFK.\" He says he is generally comfortable with Mr. Costner's acting style -- except when Mr. Costner laughs and sings. **********\"Kevin is not a great singer and sometimes he misses notes,\" Mr. Tsukayama said. \"I had to miss notes, too. It's hard to miss notes.\" **********Still, Mr. Costner is generally easier to dub than Robert DeNiro was as Frankenstein's monster, who curled his tongue and distorted his mouth when he spoke. Aside from trying to incorporate the sounds of those contortions into his lines, he had to accommodate the reality that a strict translation of English comes out about twice as long in Japanese. **********Thus, when Frankenstein's monster said \"I LOVE YOU\" in three slow, monster-like syllables, Mr. Tsukayama had to deftly work in eight syllables in a monstrous drawl. **********Some Japanese directors and agents say they try to match both the looks and the voice of actor and dubber. \"For example, overweight people have overweight voices because the vocal chords are different, while skinny people have skinny voices, which tend not to be so deep,\" said Satoshi Kato, head director of the movie production division at Tohoku Shinsha, a production company in Tokyo. **********\"It's hard to find a person to fit Schwarzenegger,\" Mr. Kato said. \"The dubber must have a voice that is strong, manly and wild.\" **********Looks and attitude seemed to have helped Mrs. Mukai get her first Marilyn Monroe role. When she started dubbing 30 years ago, her manager told her that she would not get very far in her career unless she could act sexy. **********But Japan was a prudish society back then and even kissing scenes in American movies were faded-out, so there were no movies to learn from. **********When Mrs. Mukai's manager landed her a role as Monroe in \"How to Marry a Millionaire,\" even though she had never dubbed before, Mrs. Mukai decided she had to determine what sounds were sexy on her own.  One quiet night, she heard her neighbor's baby crying and thought it sounded sexy, and she recorded it. Then a puppy whined, and she recorded that, too. **********She ended up imitating the sounds, inserting coos and whines in between her lines for Monroe. **********\"The director told me I didn't have to really pay attention to Marilyn's original voice, but to just copy Marilyn's heart,\" Mrs. Mukai said. \"So I created my own Marilyn Monroe voice.\" **********\"I whispered a lot, almost half my lines,\" she said. \"People expected the atmosphere of a soft, tender-like marshmallow, so I exhaled a lot.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/25/business/business-digest-496189.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 532, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Fed Leaves Rates Steady, Cheering Administration **********After weeks of speculation that the Federal Reserve would take a pre-emptive strike against inflation, its monetary policy officials decided not to raise interest rates, apparently believing the economy is cooling enough. **********The inaction cheered the Clinton Administration, which had feared that a rate rise just weeks before the election could undercut the Administration's claim of success in handling the economy, creating record employment. $(Page A1.$) **********Treasury prices moved higher.

Earlier this year, the Samsung Group paid $60 million for 7.4 percent of New Regency Productions of Burbank, Calif., an independent company that made \"JFK\" and \"Pretty Woman.\" **********The Hyundai Group's Diamond Ad Ltd. unit recently formed an alliance with Canal Plus of France involving joint film production. Kolon Industries says it is negotiating with the Walt Disney Company in the areas of cartoons and character licensing. And Daewoo is making a big push into movie-making and theaters. **********The companies are, among other things, seeking films and other material to distribute in the theaters, video stores and cable systems that are sprouting in South Korea now that people here can finally afford more leisure. **********Multiplexes are going up throughout Asia, which should mean growing markets for the movies made by Dreamworks and distributed by Cheil. Pay television, home video and movie revenues rose 7 percent in Korea and 27 percent in Asia as  a whole last year, according to the Motion Picture Association of America. **********Korea's family-owned conglomerates, known as chaebol, have no qualms about diversifying, and perhaps Ms. Lee's daring is in her genes. **********Her grandfather, Lee Byung Chull, a commodities trader, set up Cheil, a sugar refinery, in 1953. He kept on diversifying, building today's Samsung Group, South Korea's largest chaebol, with revenues of more than $80 billion and businesses ranging from ship building to semiconductors. **********Ms. Lee's father, Lee Maeng Hee, the founder's eldest son, was expected to inherit control, but he was passed over in favor of his younger brother, Lee Kun Hee. Ms. Lee's branch of the family was given control of Cheil, once the core of the empire but until recently an unglamorous outpost. Ms. Lee's younger brother, Lee Jai Hyun, 36, called Jay, effectively runs the company. **********Cheil had revenues of $1.8 billion in 1995 but recurring profits of only $12.5 million. Its real wealth, which allowed it to borrow to invest in Dreamworks, is its more than $2 billion in assets, much of it in stock it owns in other Samsung companies. **********Relations between the branches of the family are said to be strained, and Cheil has been trying to break free of Samsung, but disagreements with Samsung have slowed the divorce process. **********Hence the latest investment was all the more satisfying: Samsung itself had the first shot at Dreamworks, but its deal fell apart. **********Ms. Lee grew up in Korea watching Disney shows on television in black and white. In 1983, after getting her undergraduate degree from a university in Seoul, she earned a master's degree in East Asian languages at Harvard. From there she went to Taiwan and then Hong Kong, where she worked on a doctoral thesis. **********\"I always wanted to be a professor,\" she said. \"I really didn't even imagine  that I would be working in the company.\" **********But Ms. Lee never quite finished her Ph.D., in 1994 going to work for a Samsung subsidiary in America. She helped set up the Samsung Art and Design Institute in Korea, a joint venture with the Parsons School of Design in New York. Then one day an American lawyer friend called to ask if Samsung would be interested in investing in Dreamworks. **********A $900 million investment was discussed at a dinner at Mr. Spielberg's house. But Samsung officials, led by the president, Lee Kun Hee, spent a bit too much time talking about semiconductors to please the Dreamworks founders. \"I kept on  saying to them,\" Mr. Geffen recalled, that \"if we were only interested in making money we'd also build semiconductor plants.\" **********Dreamworks' founders were also uncomfortable with Samsung's insistence that it be the only outside investor and have effective control. **********For whatever reason, the two groups parted ways. Then Paul Allen invested $500 million, reducing the amount Dreamworks needed. Ms. Lee asked her brother,  and the two won the deal for Cheil. **********\"They were enthusiastic about what we were doing,\" Mr. Geffen said. \"Their determination was particularly impressive to Steven, who responds well to enthusiasm.\" **********But enthusiasm can go only so far. **********The Cheil multimedia division, headed by Ms. Lee, consists of 33 people, 23 of them recruited from within Cheil. **********Ms. Lee, diminutive but energetic, runs things informally. \"She is not like Korean men, giving orders and expecting them to be followed,\" said Steven J. Searle, Ms. Lee's high school English teacher, who now works for the multimedia  division. \"To do anything creative, you have to have a soft touch.\" **********To get help in distribution, Cheil turned to Raymond Chow, the founder of Hong Kong's Golden Harvest Entertainment Ltd., a big movie producer and distributor known for bringing the world Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan, not to mention the Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles. **********Cheil and Golden Harvest have a joint venture to distribute movies throughout Asia, and another venture, with an Australian company, to build multiplexes in Korea. **********Cheil has also set up a division to make movies in partnership with the director Kim Jong Hak and the screenwriter Song Ji Na, who collaborated on a searing television drama about the 1980 massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators  in the Korean city of Kwangju. **********In making movies, Cheil is supposed to get help from Dreamworks. Miky Lee organized a field trip to watch Dreamworks work on \"The Prince of Egypt,\" its first animated film. And Cheil hopes to send interns to work in California. **********But Mr. Kim said the gap between Cheil and Dreamworks was so huge that it might be difficult for Cheil to apply what it learned. \"It's like talking about  a relationship between a kindergarten child and a university student,\" he said.  \"We don't know what we need, and they don't know what to give.\" **********Mr. Kim said Mr. Spielberg would have been frustrated trying to make movies in Korea. At a reception, Mr. Kim once shocked Mr. Spielberg by telling him: \"If you had been born in Korea, you would have ended up in a mental hospital.\" **********But Ms. Lee said Cheil's work would help Korea's poorly developed movie industry. \"Our investment in Dreamworks is not a destination,\" she said. \"It's the departing point.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/29/business/brazil-to-auction-rail-concession.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Brazil to Auction Rail Concession", "print_headline": "Brazil to Auction Rail Concession", "body_text": " **********Brazil will auction a concession to run a stretch of its federal rail system  on June 14 for a minimum price of 316.9 million reais ($323.4 million), officials said today. **********The center-east stretch of the rail system is the second of six lines the Government plans to auction as part of an improvement program.

Survey Finds World Rich-Poor Gap Widening", "body_text": " **********In the wake of reports that gaps between rich and poor in the United States are wider than they have been in half a century, a United Nations survey to be published on Wednesday finds that the phenomenon is worldwide, and that the wealthiest and poorest people -- both within and among countries -- are living in increasingly separate worlds. **********Moreover, the United States is slipping into a category of countries -- among them Brazil, Britain and Guatemala -- where economic stratification is most pronounced, with the national per capita income four times or more higher than the average income of the poor, according to the survey, the Human Development Report 1996, compiled by the United Nations Development Program. **********The ratio of the top 20 percent of American incomes to the poorest 20 percent is now 9 to 1, the study shows. **********\"An emerging global elite, mostly urban-based and interconnected in a variety of ways, is amassing great wealth and power, while more than half of humanity is left out,\" said James Gustave Speth, an American who is administrator of the Development Program. **********\"We still have more than half the people on the planet with incomes of less than $2 a day -- more than 3 billion people,\" Mr. Speth said in an interview on  Thursday. \"For poor people in this two-class world, it is a breeding ground for  hopelessness, for anger, for frustration.\" **********The Human Development report will be released officially in Tokyo on Wednesday by Richard Jolly, its principal author. **********A nation's total wealth is not an adequate guide to how its people live, the  survey says. In nations as diverse as the Netherlands, Japan, Bangladesh and Nepal, the gap between average incomes and those of the poorest 20 percent of the population is half that of the United States. **********The distribution of private economic assets, in property and investments, widen American differences even more. **********Many of the most equitable societies are now in East and Southeast Asia, where economic growth has been fastest but where at the same time the division of national wealth has been the fairest, the report says. **********The annual Human Development Report was first published in 1990 as a new way  to measure countries' progress by going beyond gross national product to factor  in life expectancy, education and adjusted real incomes. The report's Human Development Index ranks countries by health, sanitation, the treatment of women  and other aspects of life that give what the authors believe is a truer picture  of day-to-day existence. **********This year, Canada leads the index with the most advanced overall human development, followed by the United States, Japan, the Netherlands and Norway. On a list of 174 countries, Russia ranks 57th, China 108th and India 135th. Africa south of the Sahara dominates the bottom. **********When the list is adjusted to reflect the status of women, the United States drops to fourth place among 137 countries, behind Sweden, Canada and Norway. Japan drops to 12th place, while China rises to 79th. **********The 1996 report introduces another new measure of national growth -- or lack  of it. Called a \"capability poverty measure,\" this index tries to find hidden or potential poverty by looking at factors like the percentage of children under 5  who are underweight, the proportion of unattended births, the number of children in school and rate of female illiteracy. In other words, is a nation programming poverty and disadvantage into coming generations? **********For example, in South Asia -- India and its neighbors, except Sri Lanka -- 29 percent of the people are living in severe poverty when income alone is measured, but more than 62 percent are living in conditions that can negatively  affect their futures. **********John Sewell, president of the Overseas Development Council, a private policy  research organization in Washington, said in an interview that social indicators can no longer be overlooked by any country focused on national economic growth. The era of choosing between a welfare state or a bigger G.N.P.  is over; social and economic factors work together, he said. **********\"It is clear by now in the developing world that the prime responsibility for progress has to fall to those governments and societies themselves,\" he said. \"Nothing much is going to change until countries take the steps to invest in people, educate women and create a health care system that works while also adopting policies that are going to lead to economic growth.\" **********In Asia, as in the Scandinavian countries a generation or more ago, a number  of countries -- among them Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore -- have spent significant sums on health, education, the advancement of women and the provision of credit to low-income families and small-scale entrepreneurs. But they also focused simultaneously on national economic growth, and this two-track policy led to \"the most sustained and widespread development miracle of the 20th century, perhaps all history,\" the report says. **********At the independent Cato Institute in Washington, Ian Vasquez, director of the Project on Global Economic Liberty, is skeptical about more foreign aid and about reports by agencies with an interest in continuing or expanding assistance programs. **********\"The evidence over the past 30 to 40 years shows quite clearly that economic  reforms, especially of the market-oriented type, help raise the standards of living dramatically more than traditional programs supported by foreign aid agencies like the U.N.D.P.,\" Mr. Vasquez said in an interview. **********\"The real story is that the conditions of people around the world have vastly improved over the last 50 or so years,\" he said. Progress rests with liberalizing economic policies, not outside support, he added. **********Among the 1996 Human Development report's other findings are these: ***********Worldwide, 358 billionaires control assets greater than the combined annual  incomes of countries with 45 percent of the world's people. ***********Eighty-nine countries are worse off economically than they were a decade or  more ago. In 70 developing countries, incomes are lower than they were in the 1960's or 1970's. In 19 countries, including Ghana, Haiti, Liberia, Nicaragua, Rwanda and Venezuela, per capita income is below the 1960 level. **********The Human Development Report 1996 is published by Oxford University Press at  $18.95 in paperback and $29.95 in hard cover."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/20/business/gm-to-merge-gmc-division-with-pontiac.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1996-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 767, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.M. to Merge GMC Division With Pontiac", "print_headline": "G.M. to Merge GMC Division With Pontiac", "body_text": " **********The General Motors Corporation plans to announce on Tuesday the merger of its Pontiac and GMC divisions, a sign that G.M. management is moving to consolidate  the conflicting brands and corporate fiefs that have hampered the auto maker for decades. **********General Motors will announce that it is combining the staffs and dealer networks of the two divisions into a single marketing unit headed by Roy S. Roberts, now the general manager of the highly successful GMC truck division, company officials said today. **********The division will sell a full range of Pontiac cars and GMC sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. General Motors's marketers will try to give the combined division a brand image projecting physical power and outdoor activity,  all aimed at attracting youthful middle-income buyers. **********John G. Middlebrook, the general manager of Pontiac, will become the general  manager of the Chevrolet division, while Jimmy C. Perkins, the general manager of Chevrolet who is close to retirement, will be put on special assignment, according to the G.M. officials, who spoke on the condition that they not be identified. The details of Mr. Perkins's new assignment were not clear tonight.  Nor was it clear what would become of lower-level managers with duplicative responsibilities. **********A spokesman for General Motors declined to comment on the company officials'  disclosure. **********The combination of GMC and Pontiac represents a bureaucratic victory for Ronald L. Zarrella, the vice president for North American marketing at General Motors. Unlike most General Motors executives, Mr. Zarrella is a newcomer to the auto industry, having been brought into the company 15 months ago after serving  as president of Bausch & Lomb Inc., the Rochester-based maker of contact lenses  and sunglasses. **********Mr. Zarrella is a specialist in managing brands, and has already taken an active role in designing the marketing campaigns for the midsize sedans that Chevrolet, Pontiac, Buick and Oldsmobile plan to introduce over the next two years. The new cars, which were displayed at the North American International Auto Show here last month, resemble each other in many ways. But General Motors  plans to promote separate brand images for each of them. **********Mr. Zarrella is the protege of John G. Smale, an outside director of General  Motors who took over as chairman from 1992 until the end of last year. Mr. Smale is a former chairman of the Procter & Gamble Company and a consumer goods marketing specialist like Mr. Zarrella. **********David L. Lewis, a professor of business history at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, said a merger of Pontiac and GMC would represent the first time since the creation of General Motors in 1908 that the company has reduced the number of its car divisions. While the Cadillac division dropped its LaSalle line on the eve of World War II, and the Buick division dropped its Marquette line a few years earlier, the divisions themselves have been remarkably durable, he said. **********Within months of being formed in 1908, General Motors acquired the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company and renamed it the General Motors Truck Company, the corporate ancestor of the GMC division today. The current Pontiac division is the direct descendant of General Motors' Oakland division, which the company acquired in 1909. **********The company's Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick and Cadillac divisions were shaped by Alfred P. Sloan Jr., the legendary marketer and chairman of General Motors, to each pursue customers of a different income range. Buyers were expected to start with a Chevrolet and work up to a Cadillac as they became more prosperous. **********Mr. Sloan's slogan was, \"A car for every purse and purpose.\" But over the years, the lines between the brands became blurred, as each division began pursuing a broad range of customers and competing ever more directly with other General Motors divisions. **********Combining the Pontiac and GMC units is the easiest step for General Motors to take in consolidating divisions because they have the least overlap. Pontiac mostly produces fairly sporty cars and GMC mostly produces sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. **********Opposition from car dealers, as well as corporate resistance within General Motors, has slowed past efforts to consolidate brands. But while General Motors  has separate Buick, Oldsmobile and Chevrolet dealers in some towns, all competing bitterly with each other, about two-thirds of its Pontiac and GMC dealers sell vehicles from both divisions. **********Jim Bradley, owner of a Cadillac, Pontiac and GMC dealership in Ann Arbor, Mich., said tonight that he favored the combination. **********\"I can see some significant savings for G.M.,\" Mr. Bradley said. \"You don't need to have two different people from two different organizations calling on\" each dealership."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/02/business/key-rates-020389.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 44, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": " **********In percent **********Previous      Year                               Yesterday       Day       Ago **********PRIME RATE                         8.25      8.25      9.00 DISCOUNT RATE                      5.00      5.00      5.25 FEDERAL FUNDS*                     6.00      6.05      5.93 3-MO.

Nearly one-quarter of the country has been set aside for national parks, biosphere reserves or other protected areas, and Costa Rica has also led the way in innovative experiments like carbon offset agreements, which relax emission requirements for utilities that agree to protect tropical forests. **********''What they have done in Costa Rica is just great,'' said James Nations, a Latin America specialist at Conservation International, a Washington-based environmental group. ''As conservationists, we want to send the message that tourism can be a great ecological tool, and Costa Rica has done that and prospered by protecting so much of its natural ecosystems.'' **********But the experience of Manuel Antonio National Park suggests that ecologically oriented tourism can create its own problems. Established a quarter of a century ago, after the land was expropriated from a retired American Navy officer who planned to build beach-front condominiums, the park began to boom in the mid-1980's, when word of its unspoiled beauty spread among nature lovers in North America and Western Europe. **********By the early 1990's, the park was being visited by 200,000 people a year, far beyond its capacity to absorb. To dampen the appeal, park officials have limited visitors to 600 a day, raised the entrance fee tenfold to nearly $15, and now close the park altogether on Mondays. By last year, the measures resulted in a decrease in the number of visitors of nearly 50 percent, to 110,000. **********''We have gained some relief for the park with that decline,'' said Jose  Antonio Salazar, a park service official who supervises Manuel Antonio and other Pacific Coast reserves. ''But the whole tourist infrastructure has suffered as a result, and all the hotel and restaurant owners are complaining now, with some having to sell their businesses.'' **********Outside the park there are more than 100 hotels, ranging from small bed-and-breakfast establishments to the inevitable Hotel California. To build one luxury, Dutch-owned hotel called El Parador, rangers at the national park said, a hillside on a peninsula overlooking the sea was flattened with dynamite, which so frightened monkeys and other animals that some jumped onto power lines and were electrocuted. **********Along with the many restaurants, bars and nightclubs that have also sprung up, the hotels produce large amounts of waste. But the area still lacks a sewage system, so the refuse is dumped directly into the sea. **********''That is something we have needed from the time Quepos first exploded as a tourist destination a decade ago,'' said Carlos Munoz Vazquez, the municipal administrator here. ''But sewers are an extremely expensive investment that the municipality cannot confront, costing perhaps $10 million, so we have been reduced to taking palliative measures.'' **********Manuel Antonio National Park also has a 212-square-mile maritime component, which has been so successful in attracting marine life that schools of tuna, sailfish, dorado, wahoo and roosterfish now flourish in the surrounding unprotected waters. As a result, the area just outside the park's boundaries has become a favorite place for sport fishermen from around the world, who pay up to $800 a day to charter boats. **********But the fishermen do not seem quite as enthusiastic as ecotourists about spending their free time hiking the jungle trails or attending nature discussion groups. So three small casinos have recently opened here, where visitors with big bankrolls can gamble to their hearts' content. That, in turn, appears to have attracted a few prostitutes. **********''The backpackers aren't the kind of people who spend a lot of money,'' the owner of one casino, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said with some disdain. ''We much prefer the fishermen, and we hope that more of them will be coming.'' **********Mr. Kaye, whose company operates three hotels here that have turned to alternative sources of energy like solar power for half their electricity, argues that ''the situation is definitely salvageable.'' But he also said that he has begun ''looking to Panama'' as an alternative destination for clients. **********''Ecotourists want to feel like they are in an area that is pristine, and as an area gets too much attention, they will go looking for other places they feel are still pristine,'' Mr. Nations said. ''So we need to extend the benefits of ecotourism to areas that are receiving no visitors and in that way defuse the dangers to places that are being overused.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/01/world/world-news-briefs-de-klerk-s-party-wins-voting-in-cape-town.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-06-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 169, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs;De Klerk's Party Wins Voting in Cape Town", "print_headline": "World News Briefs;De Klerk's Party Wins Voting in Cape Town", "body_text": " **********Defying speculation that South Africa's white-led National Party would quickly pass from the national scene, it has romped to victory in local elections in the Cape Town area. **********With most of the votes counted after elections on Wednesday, it was clear that the National Party had won in almost all the rural areas at stake and at least four of six metropolitan areas. **********The African National Congress, the party of President Nelson Mandela, did make some gains, but party officials said they were disappointed. **********National Party leaders, trying to remold their image in the new South Africa, were jubilant about the results.

And although the late British media mogul did not heed his own words in making deals, his motto is timely for today's frenzied deal-makers. **********In the media and telecommunications industries, where much of this year's merger activity has taken place, slumping stock prices have recently eroded the value of several landmark deals. **********Worldcom's takeover of MFS Communications, which was worth $14 billion when it was announced on Aug. 26, is now worth only $11.8 billion. That is because Worldcom's shares have dropped 15 percent on fears that the long-distance carrier paid too much for MFS. **********U S West and Continental Cablevision, which announced a $10.8 billion merger in February, said yesterday they had agreed to a reduced price for the U S West stock that is being used to acquire Continental. **********Shares of the U S West Media Group, which tracks the performance of the phone company's cable properties and which is being used to finance the deal, has fallen 20 percent since it was announced -- a decline so precipitous that it threatened to derail the merger. But Continental agreed yesterday to value U S West Media Group's shares at $21, a 16 percent premium to their market price at yesterday's close, which will let the two companies finish the deal by the end of November. **********The MFS-Worldcom deal also seems likely to go through, analysts said. Still, several Wall Street bankers said the weakness in the shares of telephone companies could stanch -- at least temporarily -- the flood of deals that has transformed these industries in recent months. **********''Worldcom has spooked people about making these bold-stroke deals,'' said one leading banker, who spoke on condition of anonymity. **********In addition, phone companies are still struggling to make sense of the profound regulatory changes unleashed by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Until the new rules are set, analysts said, even deal-minded executives may hold back. **********''It's almost like you've just run a marathon, and you need a couple of days off before you can run it again,'' said Daniel Reingold, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. **********With telephone companies' reliable earnings and cash flow, their shares are a ready currency for huge acquisitions. This year alone, Bell Atlantic agreed to merge with Nynex in a stock deal worth $22.1 billion, while SBC Communications agreed to acquire Pacific Telesis for $16 billion in stock. **********But those deals involved companies in similar businesses and with similar stock market values. So after initial deal-related swings, the declines in shares of the acquiring companies have been mirrored by declines in the prices of the companies being bought, reflecting general sentiment about the industry. The troubles have arisen in deals involving dissimilar companies with divergent stock market values. **********In the case of U S West and Continental, for example, the regional Bell is acquiring the nation's third-largest cable operator. Complicating matters, U S West Media Group shares track the performance of the company's other cable assets, which include, among other things, a 25 percent stake in Time Warner Cable. **********Like other major cable operators, the U S West Media Group has seen its shares languish in recent months. But as a tracking stock issued by a phone company, analysts said, U S West Media Group carries two extra burdens: the regulatory uncertainty of the phone industry and Wall Street's traditional ambivalence for these so-called letter stocks because of their hybrid quality. **********Executives at U S West and Continental sought to put the best face on matters in a telephone conference call yesterday. **********''We are solidly committed to this deal,'' said Amos B. Hostetter, the chairman and founder of Continental, ''We'll survive any short-term ups and downs in the stock market.'' **********U S West executives noted that the deal contained a mix of stock and cash -- and that they had the discretion to pay anywhere from $1 billion to $1.5 billion in cash, and to issue anywhere from $2.8 billion to $3.3 billion in Continental stock. **********But people familiar with Continental said that Mr. Hostetter felt pressured to accept a fixed -- and relatively low -- per-share price for U S West stock, because the deal was structured so that U S West could have scuttled it. Given the weakness of the cable industry, Mr. Hostetter may not have wanted to start peddling his company from scratch. **********In the case of Worldcom, the nation's fourth-largest long-distance carrier acquired MFS, a provider of alternative local phone access. While analysts applauded the strategic advantages of the combination, they questioned why Worldcom, based in Jackson, Miss., agreed to pay a 37 percent premium for MFS, which had negative net earnings in 1995. **********Worldcom shareholders were doubly surprised because the deal will dilute the company's per-share earnings for three years. Bernard J. Ebbers, the company's president and chief executive, had promised he would not do a dilutive deal. **********Executives at Worldcom acknowledged that Mr. Ebbers caught his shareholders off guard, but they defended the deal itself. **********''The reaction to the announcement was more dramatic than it probably should have been,'' said Charles Cannada, senior vice president of corporate development. ''This is a transaction that creates shareholder value over the long term.'' Mr. Cannada added that he believed that Worldcom's share price had ''bottomed out.'' **********Despite these troubled deals, some investment bankers said that telephone companies' appetite for blockbuster deals was far from slaked. The industry's deregulation, they said, was simply too strong a force to be stymied by oscillating share prices. **********Some bankers even predicted a fresh round of deals, involving long-distance carriers like AT&T and MCI, and alternative local-access providers like the Teleport Communications Group. **********''I think all the factors that are causing people to combine are still there,'' said Jack Roberts, an investment banker at Bear, Stearns & Company, who advised Nynex on its merger with Bell Atlantic.

The centerpiece of a slew of new television spots will be ads for the Expedition, a giant sport utility vehicle. All ads are by J. Walter Thompson Detroit, a unit of WPP Group and Ford's longtime advertising agency. **********Ford's most important ad campaign this fall takes aim at sporty yuppies who are willing to pay at least $28,000 to impress their friends while driving a sport utility vehicle that seats up to nine people. **********Like the Expedition itself, the ads are oversized and bold. **********One TV spot begins with a helicopter hovering low over a snow-covered mountain. It drops off two skiers who have come to schuss down the untouched powder. The skiers are surprised to come across a Ford Expedition, which carries a 30-something couple dressed in expensive ski gear. **********The couple are disgusted by the idea that they don't have the mountain entirely to themselves. ''It is getting so crowded around here,'' the man says impatiently. ''We're outta here,'' the woman replies. They toss their skis in the back of the Expedition and drive on to commune more privately with the great outdoors. **********Another ad opens with two men who look to be in their early 40's riding on a small pontoon plane as it flies over beautiful summertime mountain scenery. As they get ready to land on a remote lake, near where they are to spend a week fishing, they gossip about their friend Peter, who did not join them because he is afraid of flying. ''Peter's a wimp,'' one of his friends says. **********Meanwhile, music reminiscent of that found in the Indiana Jones movies begins to play, and we see the rugged-looking Peter driving his Ford Expedition over seemingly impassable dirt roads. The Expedition makes it to the lake's edge just before the plane lands, to the amazement of those flying in, who had thought their fishing spot accessible only by air. **********''The new Ford Expedition. The only way to get there,'' is the tag line for both ads. **********Gerry L. Donnelly, national advertising manager for Ford vehicles,  said his division was trying to avoid selling Expeditions mostly to owners of its popular Explorer. The ads are designed to woo buyers trading in luxury cars or large sport utility vehicles made by the General Motors Corporation -- the Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe or GMC Yukon. **********The upscale tone of the ads is designed to ''separate Expedition from the Explorer,'' said Mr. Donnelly, who added that Ford hoped to sell about 150,000 Expeditions each year. ''We obviously want to sell those and maintain our Explorer sales,'' he said. **********Expedition ads are aimed at 40-  to 50-year-old professionals with median incomes above $82,000, he said. **********Ford is expected to spend far more advertising the Expedition than the $74 million it spent last year advertising the Explorer. For its entire 1997 lineup, it has bolstered ad spending 8 percent above last year's levels, Mr. Donnelly said. **********Ford spent $470 million last year advertising its various Ford models and another $258 million on its Lincoln and Mercury brands, according to Competitive Media Reporting, which tracks advertising spending. Ford spent $251 million the first six months of this year on its Ford models and spent another $167 million on its Lincoln and Mercury models, according to Competitive Media. **********While Ford has the most riding on its Expedition ads, ads for other 1997 models will begin showing Sunday. One of the latest Explorer ads shows parents insisting their young children turn off the Bullwinkle cartoons so the family can go for a drive together through a nearby wilderness. The two children whine until the Explorer comes across a real moose grazing, then they are thrilled. **********Other ads in the campaign include some tired customer testimonials for  Ford's 1997 Taurus. They emphasize the car's safety features and roominess, as well as the starting price of $18,545. **********But perhaps the most notable spot this fall is a fresh Mustang ad likely to appeal to the MTV generation because of its fast-paced music and its off-center images of urban scenes. It is designed to woo women as well as men, and has shots of a woman running and another practicing her boxing, along with the tag line ''It's your race,'' which recalls the successful ''Just do it'' campaign for Nike shoes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/10/business/market-watch-anybody-want-to-buy-a-bond.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1996-03-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 604, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MARKET WATCH;Anybody Want To Buy A Bond?", "print_headline": "MARKET WATCH;Anybody Want To Buy A Bond?", "body_text": " **********Sometimes, it matters who has been doing the buying. **********Never has that been more important than in the Treasury bond market, circa 1996. The buyers of late have been foreign central banks and a bunch of international speculators who have been seeking a sure thing through a clever trade involving Japanese yen. (More on that later.) **********Notably absent from the mix have been genuine investors. Mutual funds that invest primarily in Treasuries have not seen net cash inflows since late 1993, notwithstanding last year's rally in bond prices. **********It was after the markets closed on Thursday that the Federal Reserve provided the evidence of just how big that swing had been. It said foreign central banks  had purchased a record $17.7 billion in Treasuries in the week ended Wednesday.  That brought their holdings to $547 billion, also a record. **********Then on Friday came the worst day for the bond market in at least 10 years, after a report showing that more people were working than had been expected. In  the upside-down world of bonds, that was bad news because it reduces the probability that the Fed will push down short-term rates. But that hardly explains the brutality of the bond plunge, which drove the yield on 30-year Treasuries up a quarter of a percentage point in a single day, to above 6.7 percent. **********\"This is what happens when the lenders of last resort and the speculators get long the same thing,\" observed Mike Rouzee, a money manager at the Friends Vilas Fischer Trust Company. **********The central bank buying, says James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, has largely been a case of the Bank of Japan buying bucks to keep the yen from rising. It then invests the dollars in Treasury securities. **********The Japanese central bank has been trying to keep the yen from rising to avoid injuring Japanese exporters.  It has also tried to jump-start the ailing economy by keeping short-term rates very low, at about one-half of 1 percent. **********That is where the speculators came in. They borrowed billions of yen, paying  that low rate, and put the money into Treasuries. It was a sure thing, so long as the yen did not rise or Treasuries crash. **********At the Chicago Board of Trade, where they have been trading bond futures for  almost 20 years, Friday was the worst day ever. Prices fell so far that the exchange wouldn't let trading go on. It will resume tonight, and it will be interesting to see if buying materializes. Mutual fund investors have a history  of buying stock funds on weakness, but of selling bond funds when they plunge. And highly leveraged speculators may have to sell Treasuries, putting more pressure on prices. **********There is no good reason for the bond market's woes to have clipped 171 points off the Dow Jones industrial average. A strong economy is not bad for corporate  profits, which is what stock prices are supposed to be about. But it would be   easier to be confident if stock prices were not so high, and valuations so extended. **********In 1987, mutual fund investors ran for the hills after the first-ever 100-point down day for the Dow, on Friday, Oct. 16. Fidelity Investments dumped  American shares in London Monday morning, and the rout was on. That selling was  not the only reason the Dow fell 508 points that day, but it helped. **********But since 1987, mutual fund investors have regarded every 100-point down day  as a buying opportunity, and the market has quickly rebounded. Tomorrow morning, a lot of traders will be watching to see what Fidelity is doing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/15/business/diary-331708.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-09-15", "snippet": "Diary of week's events in financial and economic worlds; photos (S)", "word_count": 1264, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DIARY", "print_headline": "DIARY", "body_text": " **********WELFARE PROTEST **********Goodbye, Mr. Clinton **********The welfare bill that the President signed a few weeks ago hasn't been too popular at the Department of Health and Human Services. But reactions have varied. Donna E. Shalala, the department's Secretary, has joined those who seem to be saying that Bill Clinton needs to be re-elected to undo the welfare damage done by Bill Clinton. ''This bill will be changed,'' she vowed, ''until we get it right.'' Others at the agency, though, are not buying this Mobius-strip logic. Last week two top welfare officials -- Mary Jo Bane and Peter B. Edelman -- resigned in protest. For Mr. Clinton, the departure of Mr. Edelman had to sting. He and his wife, Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund, had started as staunch members of the Friends-of-Bill club, but as Mr. Clinton was washed to the right by the conservative tide, the Edelmans receded in the liberal distance. Last week Mr. Edelman was simply waving goodbye. **********WALL STREET **********What Goes Up Must Go Up **********In July the party seemed to be over on Wall Street, as the Dow industrials took some scary drops. But the resounding message last week was: Never mind. The Dow piled gain on top of gain, soaring to a new record of tktktktk. Does it make any sense? Not really. After that summer scare, money is flowing back into mutual funds -- the market's lifeblood -- but it isn't the flood it was earlier in the year. And higher interest rates -- the market's mortal enemy -- seem highly possible when the Federal Reserve next tinkers with them in a week or so. The explanation seems to be that investors have it fixed in their minds that this is a bull market that won't die. By that logic, a market dip means ''buy.'' Period. **********TERRORISM **********Can Air Travel Be Perfect? **********If everyone at an airport, whether traveler or employee, faced the scrutiny accorded, say, a Supreme Court nominee, you can bet there would be no terrorism. But perhaps three or four people would fly a day, having each spent a week at the airport. So what's needed is the right balance between reward (everyone flies) and risk (getting blown up). Some would say that balance had been found, considering how vastly safer it is to fly than to drive or do a lot of other things. But the bottomless mystery of the T.W.A. crash created a vacuum that demanded to be filled by action (especially -- dare one say it? -- in an election year). Last week, sure enough, President Clinton proposed sweeping changes, from criminal background checks on workers to searching the luggage of ''suspicious'' passengers (is that you, Big Brother?). Airlines and airport operators, though, raising the specter of three-hour airport check-ins, quickly questioned whether such steps were practical. **********IMAGE INSURANCE **********Bad News, Spin Away **********It doesn't matter what you do, Henry Higgins said, as long as you pronounce it properly. What a sadly outdated notion. For one thing, E-mail means never having to pronounce anything. Now it doesn't matter what you do; it's how it looks. Image is all. Say a corporation gets bad news, be it a defective product or a defecting executive. Given the speed of communications today, that news will hit the streets in no time. You need spin control, fast. Miss a beat and the egg gets imbedded on your face. Enter National Union Fire Insurance, the first insurer to cover the hiring, if the need arises, of a public-relations firm for ''crisis management.'' Spin the bad news fast enough, the theory goes, and it will just fly away. **********SECOND THOUGHTS **********Tax-Cut Memories **********It was 1981. Ronald Reagan was smiling, taxes were falling, all was Republican with the world. To Bob Dole, it was the good old days, and now he wants to revive that tax-cut crusade. A survivor of those good old days, though, has distinct second thoughts. Murray Weidenbaum, who as Mr. Reagan's chief economic adviser applauded the 1981 cuts, warned last week against copying them. It is easy to cut taxes, he said at a gathering of business economists, but far harder to cut spending -- a lesson he ''learned the hard way.'' Simply cutting taxes, he said, is like pumping air into a flat tire without patching up the holes first. Easy for him to say. He isn't running for office. **********TAKEOVERS **********Smiling at Duracell **********It was hard to tell whether it was a lovefest or a merger announcement. Analysts and executives fell all over themselves in applauding Gillette's deal last week to buy Duracell for $7 billion in stock. A perfect fit, they all cried. Few acquisitions ''could be better for Gillette.'' ''Duracell absolutely fits their core competencies.'' But as often happens, the big winner is not Duracell or Gillette, but a deal maker in the wings. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts -- sound familiar in these billion-dollar windfalls? -- put up just $350 million to buy Duracell in 1988, and now stands to make billions on its controlling stake. But do those billions emerge from thin air, or come out of someone's pocket? An enduring capitalist mystery. **********HEALTH INSURANCE **********The Mighty A.A.R.P. **********If the A.A.R.P. speaks, the elderly listen. So it's clearly a big deal when the group bestows its seal of approval on a health insurer -- roughly a $4 billion deal. That's the amount of business Prudential will lose yearly after the A.A.R.P. switched its blessing last week to United Healthcare. There is not much of a profit margin in this business as it stands, of course -- the lure for United Healthcare will be the shot it will get at persuading elderly policyholders to switch to H.M.O.'s. That's where it can make some money. And though 3,500 jobs will be lost at Prudential, United Healthcare has committed itself to hiring many of them. **********SOCIAL POLICY **********Depressed? Build a Prison **********Whenever America has a bad day, it seems, it cheers itself up by building a few prisons. Keep locking people up, we say, and our problems will evaporate. The trouble is, it costs such vast sums to build and run prisons that there is less left for society's other needs. Usually that trade-off is hard to see up close, obscured in the shifting billions in Government checkbooks. But in Los Angeles last week the choice was stark: whether to take $19 million away from poverty relief so a new high-tech prison could open. An advocate for the homeless estimated that it would cost the same to support 10 people on relief as to support one prisoner. And another predicted that crime would rise by a third if relief was cut. This time, Los Angeles stuck with poverty relief. But the prison industry keeps booming. **********TRADE POLITICS **********Too Many Best Friends **********Imagine calling everyone you know, wife-beater and model citizen alike, your dearest friend. Sounds silly, doesn't it? Yet the United States has done exactly that, using the gushy phrase ''most-favored nation'' for, well, any country we trade with. This relic of some long-forgotten tariff wars is not just linguistic nonsense, though, that can be easily ignored. Every time the topic of, say, China comes up, indignation erupts. How can we give special treatment to such a nation? Take heart. An elegant solution is at hand: Since we obviously can't change China, we'll just change the words. The Senate voted last week to scrap ''most-favored'' and make it ''normal'' trade relations. ''It's a victory for clarity,'' said Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a co-sponsor of the bill. True, China still won't be a model world citizen -- but is anyone really?"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/30/business/kirshenbaum-gets-apparel-account.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-09-30", "snippet": "Emanuel/Emanuel Ungaro, the apparel company, selects Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners in New York to handle its national account; billings estimated at $12 million to $15 million; Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits names Hill, Holliday/Altschiller to handle ...", "word_count": 185, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kirshenbaum Gets Apparel Account", "print_headline": "Kirshenbaum Gets Apparel Account", "body_text": " **********Two marketers have made decisions on their accounts. **********Emanuel/Emanuel Ungaro, the apparel company, has selected Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners in New York to handle its national account, which had been handled in-house.

Yet for major players like Mars, Coca-Cola and Nabisco, getting goods to the shops is an even bigger struggle than persuading the public to buy them. Time and again, the ambitious sales plans of such producers has been thwarted by China's antiquated, bureaucratic retail distribution network. **********Just how serious the problem is now regarded by consumer goods manufacturers was revealed by an Economist Intelligence Unit survey earlier this year. Asked what they would do if given the chance to relaunch their least successful brand, almost 60 percent of respondents said they would invest more in distribution. A majority also identified distribution problems as the most important brake on further expansion in China. **********At one level, the difficulty of shifting goods around China is simply a function of the country's dilapidated, overstretched transport system. At Cadbury-Schweppes, which operates a confectionery plant in Beijing, the preferred distribution channel is by rail. **********On average, however, freight space needs to be booked at least six weeks in advance, and even then there is insufficient capacity. As a result, Cadbury's \u2014 like its competitors \u2014 is forced to use trucks, which are much slower and far more expensive, especially once myriad illegal \"toll fees\" and provincial \"customs duties\" have been paid. **********That illustrates the second obstacle; intrusive, avaricious bureaucrats, who are determined to keep control of retail distribution channels, which they use to raise dubious \"tax\" revenues. **********In practice, however, the old state-controlled system is breaking down, under the weight of its own inefficiency and the rapidly growing demands of both Chinese and overseas manufacturers. An increasing number of producers are now bending the rules, as they seek ever more ingenious means to get their goods to the customer. **********A recent report by the Australian Trade Commission identified some of these channels. For exporters of goods into China, who areforbidden from operating their own distribution network, a favored route in recent years has been through trading companies in Hong Kong. These Hong Kong middlemen sell on the shipment to importers in the Special Economic Zones across the border, who \u2014 by claiming the goods are really Chinese \u2014 can use the many informal transport networks favored by mainland producers. **********According to the Australian Trade Commission, about 80 percent of all imported foods are now distributed on the mainland through the Hong Kong-South China connection. The main drawback is that the subterfuge, though tolerated, is strictly illegal: no major food exporter to China will admit to using the connection, for fear of penalties from Beijing. **********In addition, products entering China through the Special Economic Zones may be handled by as many as 10 different distributors before they reach theirdestination. That raises handling costs and puts a premium on secure, durable packaging, with the extra price passed on to the customer. **********For international food companies with production bases in China, it is also a case of testing the possibilities of a half-reformed distribution system. The good news is that the China National Council of Light Industry, which regulates the food and beverages industry, appears to have tacitly accepted that the old, state-dominated system is no longer viable. **********Since foreign-invested enterprises, unlike foreign exporters, are theoretically allowed to participate in their own distribution networks, there is now greater leeway to find do-it-yourself solutions. **********In Beijing, for example, the British Unilever Walls company, which opened an ice cream plant in 1994, is widely regarded as having one of the most effective delivery systems. At the outset, Walls recruited its own effective distributors, trained them, and then provided a fleet of trucks to transport ice cream from the Beijing factory's cold storage plant to six distribution points around the city. From there, the ice cream is shifted to more than 2,500 shops and street vendors,the latter provided, under a licensing arrangement, with Walls's name-brand refrigerators. **********One minor problem for Walls in Beijing has been the public's slightly shaky brand awareness. \"Walls? That's an American ice cream,\" said one, nonetheless satisfied, customer, who reported that she kept cool during the summer with her favorite Magnum bars. **********A more serious difficulty, encountered by all bigfood producers, is that local arrangements, by definition, do not travel. When Walls moved into Shanghai last year, the company found a new set of obstacles, including the city's much narrower streets \u2014 making distribution by van more problematic \u2014 and the hostility of Shanghai ice cream producers, who had heard about the British company's success in Beijing. As a result, Walls has had to build a second distribution network in Shanghai from scratch. **********In such an environment, even the biggest players have yet to develop the food and drink manufacturers' dream \u2014 a dedicated, national distribution network capable of delivering goods to retailers from Harbin in the northeast to Ghangzou in the south. Nestle, the Swiss confectionery giant, has its eyes on this goal, having just opened a major manufacturing plant in the coastal city of Tianjin. \"The whole [of China] distribution system is not developed enough for the needs of a modern sales and distribution network,\" said Helmut Maucher, the chairman of Nestle, at a Beijing press launch in October. **********Mr. Maucher reported that his company was tackling the problem head-on via Nestle China Investment Services (NCIS), a liaison company with branches in 13 Chinese cities and a staff of 500. **********The function of the company is to ensure efficient local sales and distribution for Nestle products, leading ultimately to an interconnecting network as the company's target market expands across the country. Whether Nestle achieves this goal will be the subject of much attention from its chief competitors in China, Mars and Cadbury's, both of which have concentrated on less ambitious local distribution schemes. **********As for the cost, Nestle's strategy is certainly an expensive one. On the other hand, if NCIS eventually delivers the national distribution network that Mr. Maucher wants it will be a small price to pay for a company that expects sales in China and Hong Kong this year to reach $370 million"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/23/business/vulcan-deal-in-chemicals.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-01-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Vulcan Deal in Chemicals", "print_headline": "Vulcan Deal in Chemicals", "body_text": " **********The Vulcan Materials Company said today that it had agreed to buy the Mayo Chemical Company, a maker of specialty chemicals, for an undisclosed price.

Investors have now turned their attention to tomorrow's June employment data, which are expected to help determine the Fed's next move on interest rates. **********The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 2/32 , to 8812/32 , leaving its  yield unchanged from Tuesday at 6.93 percent. **********Prices were weaker before the Fed's policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, ended a two day meeting without raising short-term interest rates. **********Bond prices bounced off their lows on news of the Fed's inaction. **********Gary Thayer, senior economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, said that by not raising rates the Fed was telling the market that the economy was fine and that it was willing to wait and see if growth would begin to accelerate inflation. Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said the Fed's decision not to raise rates gave the board another seven weeks to analyze  more data. \"But unless the upcoming data shows a significant weakening of the economy, the Fed is very likely to tighten by Aug. 20,\" he said. **********\"The market will now focus on the Friday employment data, which is simply the first of many important pieces of information that the Fed will receive by the next F.O.M.C. meeting.\" **********The employment numbers, if they come in stronger than expected, could have a  volatile impact on the market because trading is expected to be thin tomorrow. The Treasury market is closed today in observance of the Fourth of July and will close early tomorrow, at 2 P.M., on the recommendation of the Public Securities  Association, a trade group. **********Mr. Thayer of A. G. Edwards said he did not expect that the employment numbers would be a surprise. **********\"But traders are reluctant to risk being surprised nonetheless,\" he said. \"We're hearing a gain of 150,000, which is far less than 348,000 gained reported last month.\" Employment reports earlier this year have shown unexpected strength, roiling the bond and stock markets. **********Before the end of the Federal Reserve policy-making meeting yesterday, few investors were willing to do much trading. As a result, the economic reports released in the morning had only a mild impact on prices. May factory orders rose 1.9 percent, driven by a 3.4 percent increase in durables, previously reported up 3.3 percent, and from a one-tenth of 1 percent gain in nondurables. The weekly initial claims for unemployment for the period ended last Saturday fell by 4,000, to 351,000, lower than the expected 355,000. It brought the four-week moving average down slightly to 356,000, keeping the trend intact. **********In another move expected by the market, the Treasury announced plans to to sell $10 billion of 10-year notes Tuesday. In when-issued trading yesterday, the notes were being offered to yield 6.77 percent. **********Hamilton Davis, a vice president of government trading at Everen Securities Inc., in Chicago, said the bond market was relieved, with the yield spread between the two-year and long-dated paper increasing as some of the fear of a Fed move has been removed. He added: \"However, there are some market participants who feel a move on Friday, while out of the normal pattern of Fed action, is not impossible. If for instance the nonfarm growth was above a 200,000 increase, the talk of Fed tightening would be back on the front burner.\" He said that looking at the previous data, and given National Association of Purchasing Managementemployment statistics on Monday, it raised that possibility. **********\"In the last seven years, when the employment component of the N.A.P.M. survey is above 49, nonfarm payroll gains have always been above 199,000,\" Mr. Thayer said. \"The latest N.A.P.M. on Monday had the employment component at 49.2.\" The market he says, has another hoop it must jump through on Friday.

And in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the United States set forth the intentionally  vague commitment that now applies. **********The law asserted Washington's right to help Taiwan defend itself and declared Taiwan to be within the American sphere of interests. And it said the United States would consider \"any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States.\" It said the United States would \"maintain its capacity to resist\" any act that jeopardized the security or the social and economic system of Taiwan. **********But the act does not require any particular response. **********\"The act is an important framework whereby China knows that the use of force  will have consequences,\" a senior Administration official said. \"Without pre-committing or allowing Taiwan to dictate our China policy, it's very important that China knows it cannot act with impunity, and that we have options and can use them.\" **********[Speaking to reporters in Chile, Defense Secretary William J. Perry declined  to say if Washington was planning for any eventual Chinese attack on Taiwan, Reuters reported.  But Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord said tonight on \"The News Hour with Jim Lehrer\" that the naval build-up was meant to \"reassure our friends in the area that we have a big stake in the stability and peace of that region.\" **********[\"At the same time,\" he added, \"we are not on the brink of war.\"] **********By sending more American ships to patrol near Taiwan, officials say, the United States is insuring that China does not underestimate American resolve, while stopping short of an explicit challenge that could lead to a confrontation. **********\"We want to make clear, against indications of some in Beijing who are thinking of using force, that we are committed to a one-China policy, but in the context of peaceful unification,\" one official said. **********But the Administration is also trying, by this ambiguous show of force, to head off more drastic measures in an election-minded Congress. Some proposals now alive in Congress could infuriate China: providing more advanced arms to Taiwan, supporting United Nations membership for Taiwan or issuing invitations to high-ranking Taiwan officials to visit the United States after Taiwan's presidential elections March 23. **********\"What the Administration has done in the last two or three days has been a measured, prudent but necessary step,\" Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, said in an interview. \"But by emphasizing only one side and emphasizing military force, China is making it harder for the United States to maintain bipartisan support for the policy,\" Mr. Nunn said. **********Senator Dole has been circumspect on China, criticizing the Administration for being weak on Chinese violations of human rights and arms accords and calling for more American forces to be sent to back up Taiwan, but stopping short of a promise to go to war over the island. **********The United States should make it clear to China that Washington has strong ties to Taiwan and \"if necessary, we would protect them\" from any Chinese military action, Mr. Dole said over the weekend, without saying how. He suggested China was testing Mr. Clinton because of a wavering foreign policy. **********Senior Administration officials accuse Mr. Dole of playing politics and say a Dole Administration policy would be no different. **********\"It's a campaign year, and they will very likely play for any advantage they  can get,\" one official said -- including using Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign promises to get tough on China against him. **********Mr. Nunn said: \"The unfortunate thing about presidential candidates in both parties is that they focus so much on getting elected they don't focus on what foreign policy commitments they've made. Dole will have a lot of pressure on him not to be responsible about China.\" **********Stanley O. Roth, of the United States Institute of Peace, says that while it  is vital that China understand that Washington would react, \"if it becomes a formal defense commitment, we may rue the day it is made.\" **********To defend Taiwan against unprovoked aggression is one thing, he says, but if  Taiwan should declare independence, \"it's quite another thing if you're really intervening in a 50-year-old Chinese civil war.\" **********\"That's why the ambiguity makes sense,\" Mr. Roth added. **********Too strong a confrontational policy, he said, frightens American allies in Asia, while too soft a reaction undermines American credibility as Asia's \"great balancer.\" **********A senior Asian diplomat applauds Washington's show of force but says: \"If you get into a direct confrontation with China, you'll probably be alone,\" given China's importance to the region. \"No one expects a war, but everyone is worried that given the political, domestic dynamic in America, Taiwan and China, it could somehow get out of hand.\" **********But there is pressure in Con,ress to alter the terms of the Taiwan Relations  Act to recognize that while Taiwan has moved toward democracy since 1979, China  remains Communist and is not respecting its commitments, says Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California. **********\"I Taiwan is now a democracy, and that makes all the difference in the world.\" **********Many in Congress \"want to see Taiwan's rights respected,\" she added, including free elections. **********\"It could mean peaceful reunification or self-determination,\" she said. \"Fundamentally, there's a commitment to one China, but now there are two economic and political systems, and it increases the challenge.\" **********The article also misstated the change that took place when President Nixon visited China in 1972. He did not recognize Beijing as the government of a single China; rather he began the process of establishing diplomatic relations with the mainland and left open the question of which government was the rightful ruler of a single China."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/07/business/hoechst-to-revamp-seek-big-board-listing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-11-07", "snippet": "Hoechst AG reports higher third-quarter pretax profits, and says it will reorganize as holding company with operating units and seek listing on New York Stock Exchange (S)", "word_count": 68, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hoechst to Revamp, Seek Big Board Listing", "print_headline": "Hoechst to Revamp, Seek Big Board Listing", "body_text": " **********Hoechst A.G. reported higher third-quarter pretax profits yesterday, and said it would reorganize as a holding company with operating units and seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.

After agreeing with Hobbes that \"covenants without the sword are but words,\" she called for the merger of the North American free trade area of the United States, Canada and Mexico with the European Union. **********But those who stayed for the panels organized by the conservative American Enterprise Institute, Center for the New Europe and National Review Institute were exposed to one distinctly downbeat theme: The drive to create an economic superstate in Western Europe, specifically the plan for monetary union beginning in 1999, could unhinge the Atlantic alliance and leave Central Europe out in the cold. **********\"If a monetary union is launched on schedule,\" predicted Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, the former Prime Minister of Poland, \"it will touch off a chain reaction that will halt integration.\" **********This is not an entirely new thought, but it is particularly relevant as the deadline for locking together at least a handful of Europe's currencies nears. Economists of varying ideological stripe have long worried that the transition to monetary union may trap some less-advanced nations into chronic recession, much the way single currencies handcuffed efforts to develop Canada's Maritime Provinces and Italy's poor southern region. **********A common currency makes it impossible to adjust currency rates to reflect differences in productivity within the currency zone. That is eased for those born in Newfoundland and Calabria, though, because they are free to migrate within their countries. **********But multilingual, multinational Europe is an entirely different matter. How many Europeans would be comfortable with tens of millions of jobless citizens crossing national borders to find work? Certainly no more than the number of western Germans who welcomed eastern Germans heading for Munich and Stuttgart after reunification -- and probably a lot fewer. **********What does all this have to do with Central Europe, particularly the leading candidates for future membership in the European Union -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic? Back up for a minute. The primary barrier today to their admission to the 15-nation European Union is the costly subsidy policy now used  to help bind the economies of Western Europe. **********Brian Hindley of the London School of Economics notes that the European Union's payments to the less affluent members -- Portugal, Spain and Greece -- along with price supports for virtually all farmers, already cost more than $60  billion a year. Most of the cash comes out of the coffers of Germany, Britain, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Mr. Hindley estimates that adding Central Europe would raise the bill by an additional $50 billion. **********But there is a way out of this quandary, Mr. Hindley argues. If farm subsidies were converted from price supports to income supplements unrelated to  production -- and new entrants to the European Union were declared ineligible -- the cost of integrating the three new countries would be modest. Indeed, Mr. Hindley sees the incorporation of Central Europe as an opportunity to deep-six a scandalously wasteful farm policy that now generates enormous agricultural surpluses. **********Whatever the outcome of that debate, all bets are off, Mr. Bielecki says, if  plans go forward for monetary union before the end of the decade. For one thing, he points out, that would distract political energies from what is bound to be a traumatic transition for the union's weaker economies. **********For that and other reasons, Mr. Bielecki expects that Western Europe -- preoccupied with its own situation -- will postpone formal integration with Central Europe for many years. That may or may not be a disaster. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are all recovering from the collapse of central planning and beginning to grow again. But both Poland and Hungary have found the going so hard that their voters have turned to governments of former Communists, whose commitments to completing the transition to free markets would probably not survive a serious recession. **********Most of those assembled in the glitter of the Hapsburg Palace in Prague probably do not agree with Lady Thatcher that European monetary union is \"in truth a nightmare.\" But as 1999 approaches, they are finding it ever harder to ignore the risks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/10/business/a-new-proxy-strategy-upgrading-the-dissident-slate.html": {"writer_name": "Reed Abelson", "pub_date": "1996-12-10", "snippet": "Arbitrager Guy P Wyser-Pratte, seeking to press Rexene Corp to consider being sold, has joined with Spear, Leeds & Kellogg to nominate four candidates to Rexene's board; nominees, in marked departure from typical dissident slate, were recruited by...", "word_count": 644, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A new proxy strategy: Upgrading the dissident slate.", "print_headline": "A new proxy strategy: Upgrading the dissident slate.", "body_text": " **********GUY P. WYSER-PRATTE, the New York arbitrager best known for his willingness to wage proxy fights against what he considers recalcitrant managements and boards, has another company in his sights: the Rexene Corporation, which recently rebuffed several takeover bids from the Huntsman Corporation. **********In an unusual strategy to try to force Rexene to consider being sold, Mr. Wyser-Pratte and Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, a New York-based investment firm, have nominated four candidates for Rexene's board -- all recruited by an executive search firm. Mr. Wyser-Pratte's firm and Spear Leeds, which together own about 10 percent of Rexene's shares outstanding, are pushing for a special shareholders' meeting to consider the nominees. **********The nominees represent a marked departure from the typical slate of dissident directors, who are often friends or colleagues of the shareholders seeking change. Three have extensive business experience and the fourth is a law professor. **********The idea, Mr. Wyser-Pratte said, is to find ''Grade A directors'' who make large investors feel comfortable. Their priority would be to consider the sale of Rexene, Mr. Wyser-Pratte said, but they are also capable of running the company. **********A strategy of creating this kind of interim board could make takeover players like Mr. Wyser-Pratte more successful, said John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia University. By nominating directors who can take their time in negotiating for the best deal, these shareholders may be able to put more pressure on corporations to consider unsolicited offers. ''If it works, I would predict it would be emulated,'' Mr. Coffee said. **********Without such a strategy, large investors are frequently reluctant to vote for a dissident slate. When Mr. Wyser-Pratte tried to force Wallace Computer Services to drop its ''just say no'' defense last month, for example, the three board nominees -- Mr. Wyser-Pratte and two lawyers he has worked with -- received the least shareholder support of all his proposals. **********Finding executives comfortable in the role of dissident director remains a challenge. Many executives still see the director's job as defending management, said Steven A. Seiden, the president of the New York firm of Seiden Krieger Associates, which conducted the search. One executive he approached, Mr. Seiden said, called dissident directors ''disloyal to corporate America.'' **********For Rexene's shareholders, however, the question is why Rexene, a Dallas-based manufacturer of resins and petrochemicals, rejected the takeover bid from Huntsman, a privately held chemical producer in Salt Lake City. Huntsman offered $16 a share, or about $300 million, in October and agreed to assume some $175 million in debt. Before Huntsman made its first bid in July, the stock had been trading around $9. It closed yesterday at $13.875, down 12.5 cents. **********''Based on our recent experiences with Rexene and its advisers, we believe that Rexene does not have a sincere and serious intent to sell the company and maximize shareholder value,'' said Jon M. Huntsman, the chairman and chief executive of Huntsman, in a recent statement. Rexene, on the other hand, contends that it had serious objections to the deal's structure and that Huntsman refused to modify it. **********Mr. Wyser-Pratte said that only a board in which his four nominees were a majority could accomplish a sale. ''It is our impression that these directors, if they can, will scuttle any deal that comes along,'' he said of the Rexene board. **********And as impressive as Mr. Wyser-Pratte's slate may be, shareholders must still decide on whose vision -- Rexene's or Mr. Wyser-Pratte's -- is most compelling. ''Unless the company's going to be sold, it's not in the best interest to support a dissident board,'' said one shareholder, Steven Stokes, a manager of the Kemper-Dremen Small Cap Value Fund. **********David Drake of Institutional Shareholder Services, a firm that advises large investors, agreed. ''You can put together a squeaky clean, top-notch board of directors,'' he said, ''but if the shareholders are not supportive of the underlying action, it isn't going to make much of a difference.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/20/business/important-french-rate-is-trimmed-0.10-point.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-09-20", "snippet": "Bank of France lowers its intervention interest rate to 3.25 percent from 3.35 percent in apparent sign of its approval of Government's 1997 budget (S)", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Important French Rate Is Trimmed 0.10 Point", "print_headline": "Important French Rate Is Trimmed 0.10 Point", "body_text": " **********The Bank of France trimmed a significant interest rate yesterday in an apparent sign of its approval of the Government's 1997 budget. **********The bank said it was lowering its intervention rate to 3.25 percent from 3.35 percent.

Almost a year ago it bought Century 21  Real Estate for $200 million in cash and stock, and recently purchased the Coldwell Banker Corporation, the real estate brokerage company, for $740 million. Together with ERA, the real estate brands of HFS have more than 11,000  franchised offices worldwide and about 160,000 brokers. **********In setting his sights on Avis, with its 13,500 employees, 1,200 locations nationwide and annual revenues of about $2 billion, Mr. Silverman intends to pursue a familiar strategy: HFS will spin off Avis Rent a Car to HFS shareholders, while Avis Inc., will become a subsidiary of HFS and license its name to Avis Rent a Car. **********HFS stock closed yesterday at $69.50, down 50 cents a share. **********\"Investors probably expected all cash, and the $300 million in stock makes it a little less additive to earning per share, although I expect the transaction to be highly additive next year,\" said Mark Mutkoski, an analyst with BT Securities. He added that by receiving HFS stock, Avis stockholders would be able to benefit from the value that HFS was likely to create as it continued to  build the business. **********Mr. Silverman said the synergies from the Avis acquisition included renting hotel guests Avis cars, renting Avis cars to Coldwell Banker and Century 21 agents who typically buy new cars every three years, and renting cars to relocated executives. **********\"We are the largest company in the corporate relocation business,\" Mr. Silverman said, speaking of Coldwell Banker and Century 21. \"We relocate 50,000  executives a year, who when they get to L.A. or wherever they're going typically have to wait for their cars to arrive. Now we could offer them a rental car.\" **********Michael Keeling, the president of the ESOP Association in Washington, a nonprofit association for employee-owned companies, said the proposed acquisition would \"dwarf all previous purchases\" of employee-owned companies. Even though his association will lose an important member, he added, \"From what  I know of the deal the employees can expect a good return.\" **********David Johanson, a lawyer in San Francisco with a practice that deals mostly with employee stock-ownership plans, said he was disappointed that Avis decided  to sell after putting together a successful employee buyout, and paying off the  purchase price, of $785 million. **********\"I admit that from the employee perspective, it's great,\" Mr. Johanson said.  \"But it's inconsistent and disappointing, after they made it work so well.\" **********Joseph V. Vittoria, chief executive of Avis, said he was also \"a little sad\"  about selling the company. \"But when somebody comes along and offers a very attractive deal, it's hard to pass it up,\" he said. **********Avis stock does not trade publicly, but under the rules of an employee-owned  company, a value is placed on its shares each year. Mr. Vittoria said Avis stock fell from $22.21 in 1990 to $9.04 in 1994, \"because manufacturers changed the deals with all rental car companies.\" The stock ended 1995 at $12.51, the most recent valuation. While the deal with HFS is not complete, Mr. Vittoria said, Avis stockholders would probably get about $25 a share. **********Bill Patterson, corporate affairs director of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents some 3,200 Avis corporate stockholders, said that while the proposed deal \"looks like a good starting price,\" the sticking point is what will happen to 14 million unallocated shares. **********\"Our position is that this money belongs to the employees,\" he said. \"So we're going to make sure the ESOP trustee serves the shareholder, not just enriches management.\" **********Mr. Vittoria said, \"The trustee is looking out only for the interest of employees, and on price per share they'll come out better than management will.\" **********The trustee is U.S. Trust, which recently replaced Nationsbank.

After all, the new rules are designed to meet the letter and spirit of the Clean Air Act, which requires the agency to ''protect public health with an ample margin of safety.'' But they are raising eyebrows among economists inclined to look much more critically at the costs of regulation as well as the benefits. **********Lumping together standards for the two pollutants, these economists say, uses the strong case for reducing particulates to mask the relatively weak case against ozone. More important, the tighter standard for ozone pushes regulation into little-explored territory where the costs of pollution control are large and obvious, while the likely benefits are ephemeral. **********So how will the Government reconcile the stern dictates of the law with the cool realities of economics and politics? Good question. ''Los Angeles never had a prayer of meeting the old ozone standard,'' Lester Lave, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University, said, ''let alone the new one.'' **********The good news here is that the E.P.A. is updating particulate standards to mesh with scientific findings that very small particles (2.5 microns, or millionths of a meter, in diameter) are as damaging to health as larger ones. It is still not clear, however, that all new particles being regulated are equally dangerous. Exposure to nitrogen compounds (from car exhausts and power plants) may be less risky than contact with sulfur compounds (mostly from burning coal). **********Even less clear is the logic in linking the regulation of soot and ozone. Killer smog, still a phenomenon in the third world, is typically loaded with both particulates and ozone. And reducing emissions of one often reduces emissions of the other. But those rationalizations mask big differences. **********The epidemiological case against ozone is weak. For example, a study of the horrific air pollution in Mexico City by the widely respected Health Effects Institute found that particulates rather than ozone did most of the medical damage. And while researchers have been looking for the smoking gun on ozone for decades, Paul Portney, president of the economically aware environmental group Resources for the Future, says that ''all they've been able to prove is that exposure causes short-term reversible effects,'' like bronchial irritation and watery eyes. **********Above all, what the E.P.A. ruling will do is raise the bar for meeting air pollution standards to a qualitatively higher level. Under the old ozone standard of 120 parts per billion, some 70 urban areas fail to make the cut. But only Houston, New York, Philadelphia and a few cities in California were under pressure to make radical changes in order to meet the standard. And only Los Angeles was hopelessly out of compliance. **********By ratcheting down to 80 parts per billion, Los Angeles will have plenty of company in the E.P.A.'s dog house. Mr. Lave expects that ''much of the Eastern Seaboard'' will fall into this category. **********In a society that could cope rationally with these issues, Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, suggests, the appropriate response would be to change the law. Rather than an absolute Federal health standard, Congress may create a test in which the value of lives lengthened (along with other benefits) are weighed against the cost of compliance. Cities that want to pay for cleaner air -- resorts, say, or places catering to retirees -- ought to be allowed to find ''local solutions for local problems,'' he argues. But no one is going to force Cleveland or Baltimore to abandon the internal combustion engine. **********That is not how Washington works, of course. It has dealt with the Los Angeles compliance problem in the past, for example, through a process of endless delay. That has led to significant progress but has also allowed everyone involved to avoid confronting the serious trade-offs involved. The region has repeatedly been given more time to comply as long as it was making a good faith effort -- electric cars, reformulated charcoal lighting fluid and the like. **********In the end, though, the only way around the impossible is to fudge the health standards. Today, noncompliance means the failure to keep the average ozone level below 120 parts per billion for more than one hour on more than one day a year. Raising the averaging period to a full day, along with allowing four or five noncompliance days a year, would effectively double the permissible level of ozone. **********This approach is untidy and a bit cynical. But, then, democracy has always been untidy. And unless you can imagine members of Congress publicly debating whether asthmatics should be asked to stay indoors on heavy smog days, cynicism is probably the order of the day."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/31/business/credit-markets-bonds-slip-on-housing-data-then-recover.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1996-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 645, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS;Bonds Slip on Housing Data, Then Recover", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS;Bonds Slip on Housing Data, Then Recover", "body_text": " **********After faltering in the wake of a strong housing report yesterday, Treasury bonds rallied from session lows to end mixed. Contributing to the rebound was the Government's sale of five-year notes, which was surprisingly robust despite  recent comments by Fed officials that have suggested an upsurge in inflation. **********The price of the 30-year issue rose 7/32 , to 8813/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, dropped to 6.92 percent, from 6.94 percent on Wednesday. **********Government bond prices had been weighed down early as dealers tried to get ready for the Treasury's auction of $12.5 billion in notes, amid investor apprehension about the economy and its implications for Fed monetary policy. **********Market participants first had to deal with a Commerce Department report that  sales of new homes leaped 6.7 percent in April, far more than expected; additionally, it revised its estimate of home sales for each of the preceding three months. **********In addition to the new-home sales report, data were issued yesterday on weekly jobless claims, and the first-quarter gross domestic product was revised  downward to a 2.3 percent growth rate from the previously estimated rate of 2.8  percent. **********Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, noted that a sharp drop in business inventories accounted for the entire G.D.P. revision; all other major components showed slight pickups in their first-quarter rates of growth. **********\"Indeed, this bodes well for second-quarter G.D.P. growth,\" Mr. Fine said, \"as these inventories are in the process of being replenished. But despite the implication for strong second-quarter production, the bond market reacted favorably to the G.D.P. data.\" **********This proved to be rather temporary, he added, as the reported surge in new-home sales immediately raised concerns about inflation. \"While many expect the housing sector to slow as the year progresses because of the recent lift in  bond yields,\" he said, \"it is clear from the data that this has not happened yet.\" **********Among the main indicators the bond market will consider in the next week, Mr. Fine said, will be the May National Association of Purchasing Management index scheduled to be released on Monday, automoile sales statistics to be released on both Monday and Tuesday and labor-market data due next Friday. **********Yesterday Fed officials continued to issue warning flags about rates, making  it difficult for the market to regain its balance.

Bethune took over as president of Continental Airlines, he discovered the company had a remarkable knack for angering both customers and employees. **********To bolster revenue, Continental charged workers $1 to direct-deposit each paycheck. To save $10,000, it removed packets of aspirin from its aircraft, giving travelers with headaches another reason, besides Continental's propensity to lose bags and arrive late, never to fly the airline again. Some employees were so embarrassed to work at Continental that they removed its logo from their work clothes. **********So Mr. Bethune was not surprised when he was confronted at an employee meeting by a pilot who questioned his ability to make a difference. Mr. Bethune, a licensed jet pilot himself, shot back that it was his turn at the controls. ''The jetway is still attached for you, buddy,'' he told the pilot. ''You can get off, or you can get on and shut up.'' **********Almost three years later, the skeptics have largely been quieted; Mr. Bethune has shown he is an able pilot. With a bluff management style captured in corny sayings that touch on everything from piloting to proctology, he has demonstrated that even the most dismal of companies can be brought back to life. And he has done it by investing in better service and employee morale, instead of single-mindedly cutting costs. **********''You can make a pizza so cheap, nobody will buy it,'' he said. ''Have you ever seen a successful company that doesn't have a good product and where people don't like coming to work every day?'' **********This year Continental Airlines Inc. won the J. D. Power award for best domestic airline for long flights. After  finishing last in the Transportation Department's 1994 rankings for late flights, lost baggage and customer complaints, it now often finishes in the top third. **********And while these are relatively good times for airlines, as a good economy and full planes have enabled them to raise fares, Continental has benefited more than most. Since January 1995, its class B shares have risen from about $5 to yesterday's close of $24.375, up 50 cents. With business travelers returning, it is earning record profits and has built up a cash cushion of more than $800 million. **********Perhaps as telling, sales of T-shirts and other paraphernalia bearing the corporate logo are up at the company store, and many Continental employees now worry about Mr. Bethune's leaving. **********''He's the kind of guy you want to work with, not for,'' said Steve Zavitz, a pilot who said that the airline is run more competently now than in his previous 32 years with Continental. ''He deserves a lot of the credit.'' **********Big Continental customers said they have also seen a difference. ''Under its previous leadership, they actually had an arrogance at a time when they had no right,'' said Hal F. Rosenbluth, president of Rosenbluth International, a large travel-management company. ''Now their attitude is one of humble confidence.'' **********Clearly Mr. Bethune, who last month was named chairman in addition to the title of chief executive he was given in November 1994, did not single-handedly help Continental shake off its status as a favorite punch line for late-night television hosts. But in an age when management advice comes in strange packages -- including books with leadership lessons from ''Star Trek,'' Attila the Hun and Winnie-the-Pooh -- his record at Continental shows that basic ideas conveyed with simple words are often reliable tools. **********''If you say three things in a row that make sense, people will vote for you,'' he said. **********Not everyone is applauding Mr. Bethune's efforts. Some former Continental executives, insisting that they not be named, said he was getting credit for many initiatives that were put in place before he arrived. They also said he had benefited immeasurably from a good economy. **********Mr. Bethune, 55, counters that cutting costs, Continental's previous strategy, is easy compared with improving the airline, a task that needs the support of most of Continental's 37,500 employees. **********''We all know what needed to be done,'' he said. ''But the difference between those guys and me is that I got enough people to help me get it done.'' **********Mr. Bethune acknowledged that his frequent references to the work of previous managers as ''brain damaged'' makes him sound less than gracious. But, he added in the same breath, ''The facts are the facts.'' **********Those facts include Continental's history of two tours through bankruptcy court, and a record of losing money in 12 of the 18 years since the industry was deregulated. Several current executives said that until recently, Continental did not keep track of many financial and operational measures, and that it lacked some of the trappings, like internal E-mail, of businesses a fraction of its size. **********''Everything imaginable was wrong,'' said the general counsel, Jeffery A. Smisek, a former partner of a Houston law firm who joined Continental last year. ''It was the world's largest start-up.'' **********One of Mr. Bethune's first moves was to join forces with Gregory D. Brenneman, a 34-year-old consultant from Bain & Company who is now president of the airline. At Mr. Bethune's kitchen table one evening, they hatched their ''Go Forward Plan'': ''Fly to Win, Fund the Future, Make Reliability a Reality, and Working Together.'' **********The plan may have sounded hokey, but its goals were sensible -- such as repairing the balance sheet and running an on-time airline. **********While Mr. Bethune and Mr. Brenneman preached the plan at employee meetings, they also set up toll-free numbers for workers to leave messages about problems that needed fixing. Mr. Bethune also insisted that more than 100 planes be painted quickly to eliminate the fleet's rag-tag appearance. **********Mr. Bethune started incentive programs that more than paid for themselves: Continental rewards all employees when the airline finishes in the top three in on-time performance; $65 checks are mailed home each month Continental places second or third, $100 checks when it finishes first. **********Continental also spruced up break rooms for pilots, flight attendants and other airport employees. ''It has a lot to do with dignity and a little more respect,'' said Fred McGullam, who loads cargo at Newark Airport and, until recently, had to take breaks in the passenger terminal. **********For all the changes, however, employees continued to voice skepticism at meetings. Why, they would ask, are top executives paid so much? Mr. Bethune, who earned $1.1 million last year in salary and bonus and was paid $1.5 million in 1994 to turn down an offer from United Airlines, gives his short answer -- that the sickest patients need the best doctors. **********He then adds that before he took over, Continental was like a patient with few vital signs and a huge brain aneurysm. ''Now you can hire a brain surgeon,'' he said, ''or you can hire a proctologist at half-price who wants to learn.'' **********Such frankness helped him attract a new team of executives, many of whom, when first approached, had no intention of working at Continental, an airline they had avoided as travelers. **********''I was definitely leaning back at the start of the first meeting with Gordon,'' said Lawrence W. Kellner, Continental's chief financial officer, who left a similar position at American Savings Bank. ''But by the end of the meeting, I said that this guy's checking all the right boxes.'' **********Several executives said in interviews that they felt considerable freedom to make decisions and act on them quickly. Management meetings, they added, are often sprinkled with such Gordonisms as ''Next to breathing, this is the most important thing you can do,'' and, ''The first step in problem-solving is, who's got the problem?'' **********Meetings are also interrupted occasionally by someone uttering ''banana.'' The word is a shorthand way -- introduced by Mr. Bethune -- for someone to signal that the train of logic in the discussion just ran off the track. **********Mr. Bethune, who left a vice president's job at Boeing for a chance to call the shots at Continental, said he had learned most of his lessons about management while fixing aircraft engines in the Navy. He worked better and faster, he said, when he felt appreciated. **********''If you take anyone for granted, you'll lose them,'' he said. **********Mr. Bethune said that he was adept at picking two problems out of 100 that, when fixed, would make the other 98 irrelevant. That skill, he added, was particularly important when choosing measures for rewarding performance. **********''What you measure is what gets accomplished,'' Mr. Bethune said. ''Most businesses fail because they want the right things but measure the wrong things, and they get the wrong results.'' **********Continental still has room to improve its results. Among large airlines, it has the greatest potential for increasing traffic at its hubs, said Brian Harris, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. Its local traffic in and out of its Newark, Houston and Cleveland hubs, he said, averages just 7 percent of the population in those metropolitan areas, compared with an average of 12.6 percent for all large airlines at their hubs. **********Considering Continental's quick turnaround, Mr. Bethune may have to work at keeping his executive team from leaving to run companies of their own, though Mr. Brenneman, for one, said that was not a problem; his stock options provide plenty of incentive to stay. **********He added that he was also enjoying seeing his efforts pay off. ''This is not a part of my life I'm looking to rush,'' he said. ''It was too hard to do it.'' **********Keeping Continental's work force motivated will perhaps be Mr. Bethune's greatest challenge. While many employees are still enjoying the incentive awards and rarely seen payouts from profit-sharing programs, the unusual inevitably becomes the expected. Many of its labor groups would like to see larger and more frequent raises, for example. **********The answer, he said, lies in managing expectations and keeping people focused on the broader goals of the company. That will require quick answers to the kind of tough questions that airline employees love to ask. **********But Mr. Bethune rarely appears to lack a quick answer. When one worker asked at a meeting why reservations agents shared in the awards for on-time performance, Mr. Bethune tapped his watch. **********''What part of this watch,'' he asked, ''don't you think we need?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/25/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-accounts-011495.html": {"writer_name": "David Barboza", "pub_date": "1996-07-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 273, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Accounts", "body_text": " **********Goldwin Golf Inc., Carlsbad, Calif., to Foote, Cone & Belding, San Francisco, a  unit of True North Communications, as the first agency to handle advertising for the maker of golf clubs.

But the next public-policy tangle will be about what we're allowed to keep secret. **********Earlier this month, a bipartisan group from both houses of Congress introduced versions of legislation called the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996. This bill, which outlines the proper use of encryption technologies for privacy and security, is by far the most critical piece of Internet legislation yet introduced. **********Encryption uses a mathematical key to scramble and unscramble digital messages so they can be read only by their intended recipients and not by human  or electronic snoopers. Legislation about this powerful technology is especially important when viewed in light of two laws already on the books. **********One of these, the Digital Telephony Act, signed into law in 1994, allows Federal law-enforcement agencies to update the telephone network with the most pervasive surveillance equipment in history. **********The other, the freshly signed Communications Decency Act, bans \"indecent\" material from the Internet. It is a law that many legislators seemed to feel was on shaky ground even as Congress was passing it. A constitutional challenge to the law is currently being heard in Federal District Court in Philadelphia. **********Though the encryption bill as written is receiving qualified support from industry and civil libertarians, some worry that changes made in committee could make the bill too restrictive, completing a triumvirate of Big Brother legislation that would give law enforcement the ability and rationale to monitor all the electronic messages of citizens, leaving little or no recourse for private or secure communication. **********Such restrictions threaten to suffocate the Internet. As new users and businesses flock daily to the Internet, their need to protect confidential business data and messages becomes a key issue in making the Net safe enough to  be useful. Computer security experts say that many of today's problems on the Net -- minors getting access to pornography, security breaches of corporate data, the need to prove one's identity -- could be solved by using encryption. **********Today, using encryption of any kind is still perfectly legal inside the United States. Historically, it was mostly used to protect secret military communications, so the technology is still classified as munitions -- the same threat to national security as a boatload of artillery shells. Thus any products containing encryption are subject to strict export controls. **********Law-enforcement and national security officials say that widespread use of strong encryption would enable terrorists and organized-crime syndicates to communicate with impunity. They say export control is the only way to keep this  genie in its bottle, at least when it comes to foreign, not domestic crime. **********In addition, security experts have persuaded the Clinton Administration to propose an encryption method called \"key escrow\" that would give the Government  access to information even after it had been encrypted. Key-escrow systems generate a decrypting key that is held by a trusted third party. When law-enforcement agents show up with a court warrant, the trustee hands over the  key to unlock the message. **********So far, the Clinton Administration's proposals, which include a key-escrow system called Clipper, have been universally reviled by both civil libertarians  and the computer industry, which claims it stands to be deprived of up to $60 billion annually by the year 2000 because of export controls. They argue that any country today can make and sell encryption products stronger than what can be legally exported from the United States, and that people won't use a system like key escrow because it has a built-in security compromise. **********One defender of key-escrow policy is Dorothy Denning, a professor of computer science at Georgetown University and a consultant to the military industry. She  argued in a letter to Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont -- one of the sponsors of the new legislation -- that such a system was vital to public safety and security. **********James Barksdale, president of the Netscape Communications Corporation, whose  popular Web-browser software has built-in encryption capabilities, called Ms. Denning's solution a \"stopgap measure.\" **********\"Key escrow is an unworkable idea, and we do not support it,\" Mr. Barksdale said. \"Key escrow will be defeated just like Prohibition was defeated by bathtub gin -- all it took was a big bag of sugar and a long weekend.\" **********Policy watchdogs like the Center for Democracy and Technology and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, both outspoken advocates for privacy rights and  due process, agree that the bill is headed in the right direction. It does not dictate the use of a key escrow system, eases export controls for \"mass market\"  products (like Netscape's), prohibits any restriction on the domestic use or sale of encryption, and provides a \"personal use\" policy for American travelers  who use encryption while outside the country. **********But the bill is sure to face a fight as it moves through the House and the Senate, and the key-escrow and export-control proponents marshal their experts. **********David Farber, a professor of computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and a board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says encryption policy always turns into \"a religious discussion\" between those who fear terrorism and those who want to live without fear of constant surveillance. **********But, he adds, if you take privacy discussions to the people, their attitudes  are pretty clear. \"If you ask the American public what they think of national I.D. cards, for example, a huge percentage are opposed to them,\" he said. \"Why?  They're not hiding anything. They just don't want the Government to have that type of power.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/16/world/a-surreal-day-on-afghans-eisenhower-highway.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1996-11-16", "snippet": "American-built paved highway in Afghanistan linking Kabul with Kandahar is now nothing but rubble; road surface was broken by Soviet tanks during military occupation in 1980's; lack of maintenance and pounding of heavy truck traffic also contribut...", "word_count": 979, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Surreal Day on Afghans' Eisenhower Highway", "print_headline": "A Surreal Day on Afghans' Eisenhower Highway", "body_text": " **********Thirty years ago this summer, the grandest of all American aid projects in Afghanistan was completed with the official opening of a paved highway linking Kabul, the capital, with Kandahar, the country's second biggest city. **********More than just 305 miles of crushed gravel and asphalt, it was an accomplishment filled with historical and political resonance, for along this route have advanced, and retreated, some of the greatest marauders Central Asia has seen. **********To a traveler passing down the highway now, the building of the road seems like a monument to the largess of the United States in the 1950's, when the project was begun, or to cold-war folly, or perhaps both.

These included a paved road from Kandahar westward to Herat, close to what was then Soviet Turkmenistan, that is in only slightly less catastrophic shape than the American-built road. **********Soviet tanks rolled down the Eisenhower Highway during the Soviet military occupation of the 1980's, breaking up the road surface, and lack of maintenance and the pounding of heavy truck traffic did the rest. **********Ultimately, the Soviet forces were driven out by Muslim guerrillas, leaving the road a rolling kaleidoscope of the war -- thousands of rusting tanks and artillery guns, hundreds of blasted forts where the Russians made military camps, scores of wrecked and deserted villages, numberless bridges blasted into riverbeds and uncleared minefields everywhere, some marked with rows of red-painted rocks. **********If there is a quality in the journey that might have been missing three decades ago, it is the encounters travelers make as they struggle to recover their vehicles from floods, or flat tires, or 40-degree inclines where the sand can swallow a car up to its doors. **********Like all great journeys, the experience is a leveling one, breeding camaraderie among travelers of widely differing backgrounds. And because the war that produced this nightmarish vista goes on, some encounters have a character that is surreal. **********Ahmad Shah, 12, was sitting on a prayer rug beside a wrecked bridge near the ancient town of Qalat-i-Ghilzai, 85 miles east of Kandahar. Alone in a plunging gully beside the bridge, he was minding a cargo that had toppled from an overturned truck. **********About 20 paces away lay an 1,100-pound unexploded bomb, steel-gray, with menacing-looking tail fins and Soviet markings from 1986. A second glance showed that there were at least 40 similar bombs scattered about, most inside wooden crates. **********The boy's story was that he had been hired, for the equivalent of less than $7, to accompany the driver from Kandahar to Kabul, where the forces of the Taliban religious movement, defending the capital they captured in late September, have been bombing two besieging armies. **********When the truck drove off the road to bypass the wrecked bridge, it toppled off the steep gradient, spewing its cargo. The driver hitched a ride eastward toward Qalat, to seek help, leaving the boy to mind the bombs. **********A dozen hours later, still alone, Ahmad Shah seemed irritated that anybody might think his stewardship dangerous. ''They're only bombs,'' he said, ''ZIO-20's, and they are not armed. I've carried lots of them.'' **********With that, he wandered off to his rug for his evening prayers, prostrating himself toward the huge red sun settling into the desert floor. Other Afghans there were unastonished. **********''Our children know them all,'' said Ferozan, a Kabul professor traveling on the road. ''Bombs, shells, mines, they've lived with them all their lives.'' **********Because the road is now controlled by the Taliban, the trip is also a journey into the heart of their Afghanistan, where a harsh puritanism has been ordained. Under Taliban decrees, vehicles must stop at the roadside five times a day, for Muslim prayers. At ubiquitous Taliban checkpoints, young fighters pull laggards roughly from vehicles toward open ground for still more prayers. **********At Ghazni, 90 miles from Kabul, the Taliban are only the latest conquerors to sweep through, but unlike the Arab armies of 1,100 years ago, Genghis Khan in 1221 and a British  force that ordered the town razed in 1841, the Taliban have left it unmarked, except for the physical and emotional scars their harsh new order has inflicted on its residents. People have been stoned for adultery in recent months, and thieves have had hands amputated. Women, barred from work and school, are virtually invisible. **********Having breakfast with local men at dawn in a traditional Afghan teahouse heated by flues from a bakery below was like soliciting views in an Intourist hotel in Russia during the cold war. Asked about the Taliban, the men stared fixedly at the floor and said nothing. **********When one man spoke up, he identified himself as a former colonel in the army of the Afghan Communists who were driven from power in 1992, hardly the sort of man to approve of the Taliban. But asked if he liked the stoning and the amputating, he grinned, then replied, ''Why not?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/14/business/lotus-wins-software-case.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 49, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lotus Wins Software Case", "print_headline": "Lotus Wins Software Case", "body_text": " **********A court has ordered a Singaporean accountant to pay the Lotus Development Corporation $2.3 million for selling pirated copies of the company's software.

Soglo has gone the last few days, whether pressing the flesh in roadside campaign stops or dancing briefly during a festival in the coastal city of Ouidah, he has been eagerly greeted by supporters with cries of \"five more years.\" **********But what makes Mr. Soglo's run for re-election extraordinary in a continent where 18 or more national elections will be held this year -- the most since the dawn of African independence from European colonialism nearly 40 years ago -- is not its infectious, feel-good atmosphere. **********Instead, in contrast to scores of rigged presidential votes on this continent since the late 1950's, no one here is sure what the final outcome of Sunday's election will be. In fact, no one knows whether the incumbent, who faces six rival candidates, will even survive the first round. **********If Mr. Soglo were to lose, it would be virtually the first time a sitting president has lost power at the ballot box in sub-Saharan Africa, other than the historic election that ended white minority rule in South Africa in 1994. **********In countries like Central African Republic, Madagascar and Congo, sitting presidents lost elections only after being stripped of most of their powers. **********That power is truly at stake is not the only novelty here either. In a continent long bedeviled by ethnic rivalries, Benin has been able to put them aside. **********Instead, the campaign has focused to a great degree on issues that would seem more familiar to Westerners: The candidates have debated the role of the state in shaping the economy, how much should be spent for social services, and the appropriate role for the president's family in the life of the nation. **********\"They are all running on fairly straightforward questions,\" one Western diplomat said. \"Privatize, don't privatize, more of this, less of that. It is really rather remarkably about the issues.\" **********For its size, this tiny country of 5.5 million people has had a striking record of setting examples for its far larger neighbors. And many observers from both the outside world and elsewhere in West Africa, where a wave of democratization that began at the start of the decade appears to be petering out, are eagerly watching how Sunday's vote will turn out. **********In the past 30 years, Benin seems to have been near the head of the political curve for Africa. A military coup here in 1963, led by one of Mr. Soglo's uncles, was one of the first of many army takeovers that transformed Africa's political landscape in the early independence years and for years made Benin one of the continent's most unstable states. **********A Marxist-Leninist dictatorship was established in 1972 by Mr. Soglo's principal electoral opponent, the retired general Matthieu Kerekou. That made Benin one of the continent's first communist states. **********Benin set its latest precedent in 1990 when it organized the so-called National Conference, which peacefully stripped General Kerekou of his powers after 17 years of ruinous, repressive rule. It appointed Mr. Soglo, a veteran World Bank official, as interim Prime Minister, and set the stage for the country's first democratic, multiparty elections in 1991, which Mr. Soglo won. **********One by one, this country's neighbors -- Mali, Niger, Congo and Central Africa Republic -- began organizing democratic transitions modeled on Benin's experience. **********Longtime dictatorships were swept from power in all of these countries. However, the reform process began faltering when governments that were strong allies of France in countries like Gabon and Ivory Coast pre-empted calls for national conferences by holding multiparty elections that international observers widely regarded as rigged. **********Since then, many of Africa's elections -- like one last week in Equatorial Guinea that President Obiang Nguema won with 99 percent of the vote -- have been cynical affairs. These votes are intended to give entrenched dictators a veneer  of respectability while exposing the leadership to little or no political risk. **********Other elections, like one just held in Sierra Leone, have taken place in the  midst of long-running civil wars and have been watched over by armies reluctant  to surrender power to civilians. **********\"In Benin we have democratic institutions that have been functioning for five years, including a Constitutional Court that has already proven its autonomy and an independent electoral commission that is unique in francophone Africa,\" said  Christopher Fomunyoh, director for West Africa of the National Democratic Institute, a private American organization that promotes democracy. **********\"This is going to be a true test of whether these institutions can survive and grow, encouraging other countries to take the democratic path established by Benin, or whether there will be a rollback,\" said Mr. Fomunyoh, who is leading a delegation of 17 observers here. \"Whatever happens, Benin will be a determining  factor in the intellectual discussion that is already under way about whether democracy can survive in Africa.\" **********Since a military coup overthrew an elected Government in Niger last month, Benin has been surrounded by undemocratic neighbors -- from military-ruled Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, to even smaller Togo, where President Gnassingbe Eyadema has ruled with an iron fist and the sympathies of France for  three decades. **********In an editorial this week, L'Horizon, a newspaper here, said of this situation, \"The Atlantic Ocean is our only sure neighbor now.\" **********For his part, Mr. Soglo acknowledges the enmity his country's democratic turn has earned him. \"When I went to Japan for the coronation of the Emperor, another African leader, who I will not name, said to me: 'You are Soglo, the one who is  creating so much disorder for Africa.' \" **********In an interview today in the National Palace here, Mr. Soglo, 62, said: \"I have grown used to the insults.\" What is more, the President contended, neighboring countries that he would not name have been arming and training troublemakers and sending them to Benin in the last year. He said that he suspects it was such outside agitators who fired an anti-tank weapon at a newly  built international conference center in November, just days before Benin was to hold a biannual summit of French-speaking nations there. **********Rather than back down, Mr. Soglo has made a campaign theme both of the country's democratization under his leadership and -- an even greater novelty -- his record in implementing a classic program of World Bank-style economic reforms. **********In many other countries where such reforms have been carried out, come election time, the leaders -- from Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe to Jerry Rawlings of Ghana -- have sought to distance themselves from the liberalizing prescriptions of international lenders and to renew their nationalist credentials. **********Road-building and other new construction have taken off during Mr. Soglo's tenure, transforming Cotonou, which had been a desolately sandy and potholed place. **********\"Soglo paid the functionaries and the functionaries, for once have been doing their work,\" said Francois Agbodo, a restaurant-owner in Ouidah. \"Before, nobody got paid and nobody worked.\" **********But Mr. Soglo's critics have also seized upon economic issues in their campaigns. Mr. Kerekou, for example, whose socialist model during his years in office was widely considered here to have been an economic failure, has nonetheless gone on the attack, appealing to national pride to say that Mr. Soglo's privatization of bankrupt state companies has gone too far. **********To many observers, it appears that Mr. Kerekou's popularity derives mostly from the respect he earned for gracefully retiring from power at the demand of the 1990 National Conference and living modestly ever since. Mr. Kerekou is believed to enjoy strong support in his native northern Benin. **********Mr. Soglo's other main rivals, like Adrien Houngbedji, a former National Assembly president, have concentrated their criticisms on the need for social services, which these candidates say have been forgotten in the pursuit of an economic growth rate that is officially estimated at about 6 percent. **********Others have harped effectively on the high profile of Mr. Solgo's wife, Rosine, who enjoys a degree of influence that many compare to Hillary Rodham Clinton, and of other members of the President's family, who are often seen at official functions or who frequently do business with the state. **********Mr. and Mrs. Soglo often appear at state functions wearing twin outfits. The  President raised eyebrows, diplomats say, at the Francophone Summit here, when he introduced his wife to 40 heads of state and government before mentioning the French leader, Jacques Chirac, whose country financed the gathering. **********Along with Mr. Kerekou, Mr. Houngbedji is widely considered among the most likely candidates to survive the first round and to face Mr. Soglo in a runoff two weeks later. **********For some observers, however, the combination of Mr. Kerekou's high name recognition and regional support and Mr. Houngbedji's effective introduction of  social issues as a campaign theme make it uncertain that the President himself can survive the first round. **********The President's party, Benin Renaissance, lost control of the National Assembly last year. **********\"What is so refreshing here is that anything can happen in this election,\" said one European diplomat of Sunday's vote."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/15/your-money/IHT-are-there-bargains-left-in-hungary.html": {"writer_name": "Conrad De Aenlle", "pub_date": "1996-06-15", "snippet": "HUNGARY ranks last among the three big Central European states in several key measures of economic health, including inflation and growth in gross domestic product and industrial production.

Yet its stock market shows a robustness unequaled in the region this year, having risen by about 80 percent, when expressed in dollars. **********The adage \"no pain, no gain\" applies well to Hungary. After the Soviet Union released its grip on the country at the turn of the decade, people in this most Western of the former Soviet satellites reacted to their freedom in a very Western way: They bought things, foreign things. **********The nation's current-account deficit expanded to whopping proportions as acquisitive Hungarians sent money out of the country to pay for foreign goods. The fledgling democratic government, eager to please, ran up a big deficit in its budget to help finance the consumption. Fiscally, Hungary was a mess. **********\"They were borrowing from themselves and foreigners, mounting twin deficits,\" explained Roger Monson, chief equity strategist at Daiwa Europe, who noted that Hungary's current-account deficit had reached an alarming 10 percent of GDP in the first quarter last year. **********\"Things had gotten out of control,\" he said. \"Without an austerity program, Hungary could be another Mexico, as people were speculating at the time.\" **********The indulgence of Hungarian authorities in the early post-Soviet days was an effort to ease gently into economic liberalization rather than plunge headlong into it, as the Poles and others did, Isabel Knight, a fund manager at Foreign & Colonial Emerging Markets, said. **********This idiosyncratic approach, jokingly called \"goulash capitalism,\" was deemed necessary because the way Hungary was governed in the Soviet era \u2014 known, unsurprisingly, as \"goulash communism\" \u2014 was also uncommon in the East bloc. **********\"Hungary didn't really undertake communism the way others did,\" Miss Knight said. \"It was more Westernized, so it was the first market for foreigners.\" **********Because privatization has been carried out slowly, keeping the market much smaller than others in the region, foreign dominance has been exaggerated; foreigners own 80 percent of Hungarian shares, compared with 20 percent in Poland. The foreign multitudes that had first poured into Hungary got spooked and fled the market when the crisis in the economy deepened last year. **********It was then that the government, whose policies had driven the economy to the brink of ruin, or at least abetted the public's self-destruction, had a damascene conversion. The currency was devalued, making foreign imports more expensive and Hungarian exports cheaper, tariffs were imposed to ensure that foreign consumption would diminish and civil service employment was reduced by 10 percent to slash government spending. **********\"It was a case of do this or melt down,\" Mr. Monson said. \"They held to the course.\" The austerity measures resulted first in a surge in exports in 1995 and, this year, sharp reductions in the budget and current-account deficits. **********Hungary did not become another Mexico and share prices suddenly looked cheap at the start of this year, a time when, quite handily, a number of investment funds targeting Eastern Europe were starting up and spraying money around. **********But after that 80 percent advance this year, prices look a lot less cheap, and people who follow Hungary are urging caution. Susanne Hallergard, at ING Barings, said in a report that there is still much more reforming to be done. Social security costs eat up too much of the state budget, she said, wages are too high, keeping consumer prices high, and domestic savings continue to be low. **********\"The recent rally in share prices already reflects the positive economic reforms achieved in 1995,\" she wrote, adding: \"Any further upside will come only if the present government gathers enough support to tackle politically unpopular social security reform.\" **********Mr. Monson has adopted a neutral stance on Hungary because of his own reservations about the economy, which he forecasts to grow by 2.5 percent this year, a revision from a previous forecast of 4 percent. Besides, he said, after such a stirring advance, the easy money has been made and returns, if any, will be much harder to come by. **********\"This is a time for stock selection,\" he said. \"In December you could have thrown a dart and picked 10 stocks, closed your eyes and enjoyed the ride.\" **********He reckons the ride will still be pleasant for shareholders of certain companies, including Zwack Unicom, a beverage company; Graboplast, a fiber producer, and Richter Gedeon, a leading drug maker. **********Irfan Janmohamed, who manages money in Eastern Europe for Mercury Asset Management, said that he, too, was \"still concerned on the macroeconomic front.

There is to be no Palestinian state, the drafts say, emphasizing that Jerusalem is to be Israel's capital \"one and indivisible and under Israel's sovereignty.\" Jewish settlements, Likud leaders say, are to be expanded. The Oslo negotiations that produced the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement is never specifically mentioned. **********\"I don't believe this is peace,\" said Ahmed Qreia, the chief Palestinian negotiator at Oslo and speaker of the Palestinian Council. \"It is one party with power imposing its position on the other side.\" **********Using up political capital with his own supporters in the period leading up to the Israeli election, Mr. Arafat made a number of gestures intended to bolster the chances of Shimon Peres, the departing Prime Minister and Israel's \"peace\" candidate, by seeking to reassure Israelis about the peace negotiations. **********He orchestrated a change in the P.L.O. charter to remove passages calling for the destruction of Israel. He urged patience with the border closure on Palestinian workers -- each one of whom, in Gaza, supports about 10 people. Under pressure from the Israelis and Americans, his police rounded up hundreds of suspected Hamas sympathizers after a wave of suicide bombers spread terror inside Israel. **********\"He is the biggest loser in all of this,\" said Prof. Rashid Khaladi of the University of Chicago, a Palestinian-American specialist on the Middle East. \"The Labor Party will come back, Clinton will still be President, but I think this is the worst blow possible to Arafat.\" **********\"The Palestinians put up with an enormous amount before the elections, including Israeli noncompliance with the accord,\" Professor Khaladi said. \"Arafat made not a peep about the attack on Lebanon, and he made himself into Israel's policeman. I don't see what is going to save Arafat.\" **********But Mr. Arafat has been counted out many times before. **********\"Arafat is a survivor,\" said Danny Rubinstein, an Israeli journalist who has  written a biography of Mr. Arafat and follows him closely for the newspaper Haaretz. \"He has survived six Israeli Prime Ministers. The paradox is that his   very weakness is his strength.\" **********Mr. Rubinstein is among those here arguing that Mr. Arafat may actually be in a stronger position -- Daoud Kuttab, a Palestinian journalist, is another -- because a Likud Government will be watched much more closely than its predecessor by the international community and Israeli liberals, and hence be more circumscribed in its actions. A key part of this argument is that, in many  practical ways, the Palestinians have fared badly under Labor. **********\"Arafat's strategy now will be to try to maximize international support to try to set a backfire against Likud,\" a Western official involved in the peace negotiations said. \"But it's going to be extremely difficult to keep the process on track. International and Arab support is a pretty thin reed to lean on to keep the new Government from doing things it is ideologically committed to doing.\" **********An immediate problem for Mr. Arafat is an ebbing of Palestinian support because of the sharply increasing poverty, resentment over the arrests of Palestinians by their own police, and what is widely seen as the corruption and  cronyism among those Mr. Arafat brought with him from exile in Tunis and who now dominate the hierarchy. **********\"The Palestinian Authority is very weak now because there is a growing gap between the people and the Authority,\" said Suha Draghouti, a member of the Palestine National Council. **********Since Mr. Arafat is not only an icon of the Palestinian struggle, but in full control of a large and efficient security apparatus, there has been little in the way of public denunciation. **********Nevertheless, within Palestinian councils, members of the negotiating team like Hannan Ashrawi and Dr. Haidar Abdel Shafi have been critical of the Palestinian president. And, Professor Khalidi noted, many of the local leaders prominent in the days of the uprising have been quietly distancing themselves from the Palestinian Authority and turning to other tasks. **********\"Everybody's in the lifeboats,\" he said. **********\"There is a fairly bleak picture out there,\" the Western official said. \"There is a popular backlash against the Palestinian Authority and against Arafat. Sooner or later Hamas has got to do something. And if there is an   Israeli land grab or a reaction to a terrorist attack, you've got an unpredictable situation. He's out of the frying pan and into the fire.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/27/business/company-news-united-dominion-is-allowed-meeting-on-hostile-bid.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;UNITED DOMINION IS ALLOWED MEETING ON HOSTILE BID", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;UNITED DOMINION IS ALLOWED MEETING ON HOSTILE BID", "body_text": " **********United Dominion Industries Ltd. said yesterday that a Federal court had ruled it could call a special meeting of Commercial Intertech shareholders about Dominion's $465 million hostile bid.

Others had knapsacks bulging with guns and makeshift weapons, including clubs fashioned from umbrella handles. Some of these discharged soldiers loitered in front of a  \"safe house\" established by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees -- a place only one or two people a night dare to enter -- eyeing all those who come. Others move stealthily through the sniper shields and tightly packed apartment complexes, setting fires and threatening old people. **********\"It's getting worse,\" said one of the 95 international police monitors patrolling the city, as he stood outside a burning building on Friday. \"This is  the second one already today.

No, have other building. Two families inside. Over.\" **********At 5:45, three fires burned simultaneously in different parts of the city. The Snoopy Cafe, a wartime hangout for soldiers that was gutted several days ago, has been lit again; across the street stands an often-seen Serbian nationalist in a Waylon Jennings-style cowboy hat and beard, smiling. Nearby, another apartment burns for a second time in a day.

On Friday, some men pulled a truck up to the entrance and looted one of the apartments above. **********Nearby, a middle-aged Serbian woman sat scribbling English phrases on scraps  and smoking the few remaining cigarettes in her apartment. Smoking kept her calm. The phrases were there to rattle off when NATO staff members respond to the attack she fears will come. **********\"I am afraid . . .

Over the last several days, as their apartment buildings have been set afire and young Serbs have harassed them, stalwarts have banded together to try to curb the violence and save their neighbors' homes.

The reasoning goes that since about half the world's stocks are outside the United States, American investors should be more diversified. **********More recently, with a growing chorus of experts predicting a downturn in the bull market at home, investing some cash out of harm's way is seen as prudent. **********Americans appear to be taking the advice. January saw a staggering $8.04 billion flow into funds that invest abroad, the biggest monthly sum in two years. That compares with $747 million for the same period a year earlier, according to the Investment Company Institute, the fund trade association. **********It comes as no surprise that most U.S. investors chose to invest overseas via a fund, given the difficulties of judging the prospects of investments from a French supermarket chain to a shipbuilder in Hong Kong, and compounded by unfamiliar economies and currencies. **********The most popular funds are diversified and fall into one of two categories: international funds, which invest only outside the United States, or global funds, which buy a mix of U.S. and foreign stocks. A growing number of money managers offer both types. **********T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore fund group that runs a $7.8 billion international fund through Flemings, its British affiliate, recently launched a global version. \"We focused for many years on strictly international, but we thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to offer both,\" said Steve Norwitz, a company spokesman. **********Most investment professionals favor international funds. \"I prefer to separate moneys into domestic and international components, and international is so broad there's plenty of room to diversify,\" says Lewis Altfest, a New York financial adviser, who suggests a 25 percent commitment to overseas equities. **********But many investors get skittish about investing exclusively in companies with strange names in faraway places, and they feel more comfortable in a global fund that keeps a foot in the United States. \"If they're dipping a toe in the water and a global fund with some American stocks is the only way to get them started, then it has some validity,\" Mr. Altfest acknowledges. **********Global funds have outperformed their international competitors by a wide margin in the past year. The reason: a big boost from the U.S. stock market's record-breaking climb. At AIM Management in Houston, global and international funds held many of the same foreign stocks, but the global fund, which had a 40 percent stake in U.S. equities, leaped 30.76 percent for the year to March 31, while its international counterpart gained only 23.48 percent. The story was repeated at other money managers who offer both kinds of funds. **********The heady days in U.S. stocks may be nearing an end, however. In the first quarter of this year, the performance gap between the average global fund and its international competitor narrowed from roughly six percentage points to just over one percentage point, according to Lipper Analytical Services, the fund research group. **********European analysts are predicting that the recent cut in German interest rates signals robust stock markets ahead, while in Asia, Japan is looking healthier after a prolonged economic downturn. That, in Mr. Altfest's view, makes the prospects for international funds much rosier. \"The U.S. market is near its high, and if it corrects, why be in a global fund?\" he asks. **********In the end, there is probably no single correct answer to making a choice between global and international, says Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services. \"It's more a function of where you are in your development as an investor,\" he says. **********He suggests that relatively new investors who own a limited number of U.S. funds will probably find that a global fund makes sense because the manager can decide how much to put where around the world, including the United States. \"But if you're experienced and feel you can make the decision of how much you want invested outside the U.S., then use an international fund,\" he says."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/23/business/international-business-german-economy-recovers-fueled-by-a-cheaper-mark.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-07-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 315, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;German Economy Recovers, Fueled by a Cheaper Mark", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;German Economy Recovers, Fueled by a Cheaper Mark", "body_text": " **********Germany's economy rebounded in the second quarter, as a cheaper mark stimulated exports and warmer weather spurred construction, the Economics Ministry said today. **********But the ministry did not estimate a specific growth rate for the quarter and  warned that growth would not create many jobs. **********The labor market always reacts hesitantly to a recovery,\" the ministry report said.

The sector's range and volatility are a challenge to fund managers, and a wide disparity in investment philosophy among the funds makes picking the right one vital-- no easy task as their ranks continue to swell. **********The top fund managers, however, have one thing in common: They are now plowing their cash reserves back into the market after a hiatus of several months, signaling that the sector's \"crisis of confidence,\" as one manager puts it, may be over and that now may be a good time to invest. **********Unlike many sectors, which give investors a broad global exposure, technology funds are overwhelmingly American. Lipper Analytical Services Inc. in New York tracks 44 U.S.-domiciled science and technology funds with total assets of $16 billion and 41 offshore funds with another $1 billion in assets **********Even the funds domiciled outside the United States are heavily weighted toward U.S. companies: \"About 65 percent of our funds are invested in the U.S. because that is where the companies we want to invest are,\" said John Ions, sales manager of the Technology Unit Trust, based in London, and the Dublin-based Prolific Technology Fund. **********The concentration on one region can leave investors especially vulnerable to market volatility. Fund performance so far this year has been lackluster, as spring gains in the spring rapidly turned into summer losses from which some funds have just started to recover. **********\"One of the hardest things about the technology market is predicting the short-term swings,\" says Kevin Landis, co-manager of the Interactive Investments' Technical Value fund, the No. 1 fund on Lipper's performance chart. **********The fund, managed by Mr. Landis and Ken Kam in Milpitas, California, near Silicon Valley, has only $12 million under management and has gained 33 percent since January \u2014 a performance the managers attribute to the fund's small size and their maverick approach. **********Mr. Landis lists the fund's trend-busting criteria: \"We don't invest in more than 30 companies at a time, we keep our holdings for two or three years, and we don't focus on small-cap stocks.\" The fund currently invests in 28 companies, heavily weighted toward semiconductor stocks and medical technology, but it has no Internet holdings \u2014 another approach that puts the fund at odds with many other top-performing technology funds. **********The No. 2 Lipper fund, the $200 million PBHG Technology and Communications Fund, has a turnover rate of 126 percent \u2014 that is, it changes its holdings completely in less than a year \u2014 compared with an industry average of about 95 percent. The fund, which is managed by John Force at Pilgrim Baxter & Associates in Wayne, Pennsylvania, is up 22 percent so far this year. **********Mr. Force's investment criteria are traditional: \"We focus on the fast-growing companies with revenues and earnings growth that are exceeding industry expectations,\" he said. \"And we have a small-cap bias: Half of our portfolio is made up of companies capitalized at under $500 million.\" The fund also is broadly diversified, with 80 stocks, none of which accounts for more than 2 percent of the portfolio. **********Mr. Force copes with the market's volatility by taking the long view: \"People forget that it is fairly normal for technology stocks to decline 20 percent at a time and that corrections mostly take place in June and July,\" he said. \"Shares always go up by September when people come back to work.\" And, indeed, the Soundview Financial Group Index of technology funds has tracked an average correction of 23 percent in each of the past 10 years, with most of the drop taking place in early summer. **********Ron Elijah, manager of the Information Age fund for Robertson Stephens Investment Trust in San Francisco, practices a similar approach. His fund is up almost 7 percent this year, a relatively modest gain but enough for Lipper to rank it third among technology funds. The fund invests 35 percent of its $62 million in computer software, 12 percent in data communications, 10 percent in semiconductor makers, and 9 percent each in computer hardware, health care and telecommunications. **********Mr. Kam and Mr. Landis currently have about a third of their portfolio in cash, a level they say is high for the fund.

She added that it could be months before the investigation yielded any results. **********The revelations Thursday of Sumitomo's losses over a 10-year span were the third in 16 months in which markets have been rocked by news of traders punching holes in their company's accounts. It comes just eight months after another Japanese giant, Daiwa Bank, admitted that a senior trader in its New York office had caused $1.1 billion in losses over an 11-year period through unauthorized trades in the bond markets. **********What sets the Sumitomo case apart from either that of Daiwa Bank, or the $1.4 billion in losses run up by Nicholas Leeson at Barings Plc last year, is both the size of the losses and the profile of the man who has now acknowledged doing the unauthorized trading. **********By all accounts, Mr. Hamanaka, the ousted chief copper trader, had long ranked not only as the pivotal player in the huge world copper market, but also as one of its most controversial figures. In 1993, for instance, Mr. Hamanaka denied that he had been involved in price manipulations that had claimed numerous victims. Among those was Codelco, a Chilean company that is the world's biggest copper producer. It reported losses of $170 million in the episode. **********Traders say that Mr. Hamanaka, as the biggest fish in the pond, used Sumitomo's size to maximum advantage, periodically punishing those who had sold the metal short by buying up copper and sending its price higher. Many in the market, for instance, saw Mr. Hamanaka's hand in just such a squeeze put on several big investment funds this March, which produced large losses for them. **********In spite of Mr. Hamanaka's tactics, few traders ever doubted his worth to Sumitomo. \"The general feeling was always that Hamanaka was a successful trader who sometimes lost his shirt but on balance did well for Sumitomo,\" said a London copper analyst. **********What nonetheless struck many as odd about Mr. Hamanaka was the contrast between his huge trading volumes and the fact that Sumitomo's own rules prohibit the company from speculating in the market. Questioned about that over the years, both the company and its head copper trader insisted that their activities in the markets were necessary to ensure a steady supply of metal to their customers, who bought as much as a total of 750,000 tons from Sumitomo a year. **********For regulators, this latest financial scandal holds at least some consolation. For once, the regulators did bark and bark together, although admittedly tardily. **********A senior British regulator said early this year that both the Securities and Investments Board as well as the London Metals Exchange, the world's dominant copper market, had begun an investigation into copper trading. \"What was going on just didn't make sense,\" he said, recalling that in contrast to the established norm, the price of copper had soared well above its price for future delivery. **********Not surprisingly, given Sumitomo's leading role in the market, regulators quickly turned their attention in its direction. Working with the U.S. regulator, the Commodities Futures Trading Corporation, they ultimately passed news of their concern to Sumitomo. Finally, on June 5, Mr. Hamanaka reportedly confessed to years of unauthorized off-the-books trading. **********It was three weeks earlier, though, that the market had gotten its first hints that something was amiss. Rumors that Mr. Hamanaka, copper's leading bull, had been dismissed from his post at Sumitomo were widely blamed for a 15 percent fall in the metal's price in just four days in mid-May. On May 17, the company denied the dismissal but admitted that Mr. Hamanaka had been reassigned. **********According to Sumitomo, their first indication of serious problems came in early May, when the company received notice of a $200,000 bank credit in its copper trading activities that it could not account for. Company officials then transferred Mr. Hamanaka away from trading and began a full investigation. **********What made Mr. Hamanaka's fate especially important to the markets was that in recent months traders had become increasingly convinced that a long-running undersupply of copper had been reversed at last. With new mines coming into production in Chile, Australia and New Zealand, many traders had become convinced that the only thing standing between the price of copper and the floor was Mr. Hamanaka and his conviction that prices need not fall. **********What surprised many observers was that in spite of Sumitomo's announced losses, the metal's price proved remarkably stable on Friday. Following a steep overnight selloff, copper regained much of its lost ground in trading Friday. **********Some attributed the performance to pledges from Sumitomo that it would not sell off its huge positions and thus do further damage to copper prices, which have now lost 30 percent of their value since early May. Others suggested that Sumitomo had already sold off many of its positions, a move they say may account for the huge volatility in copper prices over a 10 day period."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/09/world/a-gathering-by-burmese-defies-junta.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-06-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 339, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Gathering By Burmese Defies Junta", "print_headline": "A Gathering By Burmese Defies Junta", "body_text": " **********Defying Burmese Government threats of harsh punishment, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of a pro-democracy campaign, addressed more than 5,000 supporters who gathered in front of her house today. **********The gathering lasted an hour, and there was no interference from the authorities. **********The crowd cheered and shouted \"Long live Aung San Suu Kyi!\" and \"Let the cause for democracy be successful!\" when she appeared at the gate to her compound. **********Myanmar's military Government announced a new law on Friday that calls for prison sentences of 5 to 20 years for anyone who acts to undermine the stability of the state. **********The law's immediate target appeared to be Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to bring democracy to Myanmar.

They are believed to be running short of food and clean water. **********Aid officials fear a calamity from epidemics and famine if medicine, food and clean water do not arrive soon, and they were hoping that the United Nations and the countries that are debating whether to take part in a relief force to aid the refugees will reach a decision quickly. **********The United Nations officials who entered Goma today were acting in defiance of the Zairian Government, which has insisted that all aid to the refugees go through Kinshasa, the capital, which is 900 miles away. United Nations officials said the decision to go ahead with the mission had been made by Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. **********Mugunga, a sprawling tent city, lies about nine miles west of Goma. The rebels hold the town, but only up to a checkpoint about a half-mile from the camp. Beyond that, most of the territory is still under the control of Rwandan Hutu militias, who have joined the Zairian Army in fighting the rebels. **********These Hutu armed forces fled Rwanda in 1994 along with more than a million refugees as Tutsi-led forces won control of the country. **********The Hutu forces have been rearming. Many fled Rwanda to escape reprisals for mass killings of Tutsi civilians. They have fought hard to keep the mass of innocent Hutu refugees from going home, using them as a human shield and a bargaining chip in negotiations with the United Nations and aid agencies, United Nations officials said. The militias are known as the interhamwe, which means ''those who fight together'' in the Rwandan language. **********Thousands of the Rwandan refugees in the camps around Goma have been cut off from sources of food and other aid in recent weeks as a rebel alliance of Tutsi and other ethnic groups opposed to Zaire's Government has captured three major eastern Zairian cities, including Goma. **********''The big hole in all of this is that no one is talking to the other guys with the guns,'' said one aid official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ''We can make any agreement we want with all these parties in Goma, but there is one party missing.'' **********After meeting with the rebel leader in Goma, Laurent Desire Kabila, United Nations officials said it had become clear that the rebels alone could not open a path to the vast majority of refugees. Either an agreement with the Hutu guerrillas or military intervention of some kind would be needed, they said. **********''We can't get to the majority of the affected population from Goma,'' said Paul Stromberg, a United Nations spokesman. **********For his part, Mr. Kabila said today that he could guarantee the aid agencies' safe passage only as far as the camp's edge, not beyond. **********He said at a news conference that the Hutu forces in the Mugunga camp had shelled the town indiscriminately in recent days, killing at least two people. He said he was willing to allow United Nations food supplies to flow through his territory to the refugees, but he warned that if the shelling continued, he would be forced to attack the camp. **********''We must stop the killing of innocent people on our side by any means,'' Mr. Kabila said. ''We hope that before it is too late the international community can do something to stop this problem.'' **********He suggested, though, that the United Nations or ''other regional countries'' should ''send troops through us to go and neutralize the camp.'' **********''If we attack the refugee camp to push out these killers, the international community will start crying again,'' he said. **********The United Nations officials who accompanied the shipment to Goma not only met with Mr. Kabila, but also surveyed the damage to their organization's buildings and equipment after 10 days of looting by local Zairians. **********A similar United Nations team went into Bukavu, a rebel-held town about 150 miles to the south, in an area where about a half-million refugees from the fighting are believed to be sprinkled in the hills. ''They went over to make contact with the rebels, look at the offices, make an assessment how quickly we could get back in and get our offices up again,'' said Ray Wilkinson, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. **********The aid shipment today by the World Food Program and the United Nations refugee agency included about seven tons of high-protein biscuits and eight tons of beans and corn, enough to feed 2,500 people for a week, along with kits containing basic medical supplies, enough for about 10,000 people for a month. **********Catherine Bertini, executive director of the World Food Program, told The Associated Press that 15 more trucks were waiting to cross the border if the situation stayed calm. ''We have two months' worth of food pre-positioned all around Zaire,'' she was quoted as saying. ''It's just a question of how we will be able to get it in.'' **********In addition to the United Nations, a number of nonprofit aid agencies crossed the border in all-terrain vehicles, taking in small amounts of food and medical supplies, along with about 100 bales of blankets. Among the agencies are the United Nations Children's Fund; Concern; Save the Children; Doctors Without Borders; Merlin, a British medical relief organization, and Trocaire, an Irish aid group. **********It was not easy. The aid workers were delayed for nearly four hours at the border by Rwandan health officials. After crossing, the aid workers spent most of the afternoon gathered in a sports stadium, waiting for their representatives to gain permission from Mr. Kabila and other rebel leaders to distribute their goods. **********Some aid workers said they hoped to re-establish their operations in Goma right away and thus shame the United Nations into moving more quickly to supply the refugees out in the countryside. **********Peter Sinclair, a worker for Trocaire, told National Public Radio, ''If we are here supplying very small quantities of food, then it would put pressure on the international community to say, 'Listen, what is the U.N. doing about this?' '' **********There is a consensus among many aid workers that refugees are already dying of thirst and disease while proposals for military intervention have become bogged down at the United Nations Security Council in disputes over whose troops would constitute the force and what its mission would be. **********Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman, said today: ''The United States believes there will be a need for a humanitarian force to go into Zaire. Given the level of fighting, there is a need for a security force.'' **********But Mr. Burns, speaking to reporters traveling to Cairo with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, repeated that the shape, purpose and size of such a force remained unclear. ''You can't go rushing in with troops without knowing what the mission is, the scope of responsibility and who's going to pay for it,'' he said. **********Several conflicting plans are being considered, he said. ''The United States is not trying to block that force,'' Mr. Burns said. ''We are trying to help that force take shape.'' **********In Washington, Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told CNN television that ''we should not exclude that possibility'' of sending American troops. But ''it is not so clear that throwing troops in'' is the solution, he said, adding, ''I would feel much more comfortable if it were confined to humanitarian assistance.'' **********--------------------        Strike Paralyzes Kinshasa **********KINSHASA, Zaire, Nov. 11 (AP) -- Zaire's capital was paralyzed today as shop owners and public transportation workers honored a strike called by university students demanding the Prime Minister's resignation. **********The students lined the main road to the airport, seized cars and trucks and blocked many roads into the capital by setting tires on fire. **********Soldiers lobbed tear gas at young men who threw rocks at the motorcade of a departing European Union delegation.

But his party may not win a majority, meaning that he would have to form a new coalition that could help set off a political realignment. **********These elections are regarded as particularly important because they will be the first under a new voting system that is expected to mean the extinction of some small parties and a reduction in the importance of conservative rural voters. Under the new system, for the first time since 1924 Japanese will elect a single legislator from each district, as in the United States. **********''The time has come to ask for the people's support in determining how to guide Japan into the future,'' Mr. Hashimoto declared. **********''The battle is at hand,'' he added, ''and I want to give our every effort to win.'' **********Mr. Hashimoto could have waited until next summer to call an election, but the opposition is now in disarray and his Liberal Democratic Party is doing relatively well in the polls. It is benefiting from a slowly reviving economy and a sense that Mr. Hashimoto has moved to resolve problems with American bases in Okinawa. **********To be sure, Mr. Hashimoto has not lived up to the enthusiasm that greeted him when he took office in January, seeming young and dynamic by the standards of Japanese politics. But if voter attitudes toward the 59-year-old Mr. Hashimoto are lukewarm, they are positively cool to the main opposition leader, Ichiro Ozawa, head of the New Frontier Party. **********''This is an election on which we are staking the very existence of the New Frontier Party,'' Mr. Ozawa told party members today. ''More important, this is also an election on which we are staking the possibility of securing Japan's future and public happiness for the new generation.'' **********A recent poll by the Nihon Keizai newspaper found 22 percent support for the Liberal Democrats and only 7 percent for New Frontier. A full 49 percent were undecided, and a surprising 8 percent said they would support a new party, the Democrats. **********The Democratic Party, which is to be formally introduced on Saturday, is trying to emerge as the leading force for change in Japan, appealing to voters who are weary of corrupt and tired politicians who seem to be manipulated by the bureaucracy. It is led by Yukio Hatoyama, the scion of a wealthy political family who is sometimes compared to President Kennedy, and Naoto Kan, the energetic Health Minister and perhaps the most popular politician in Japan. **********Because it is so new, the Democratic Party is a wild card in the election, and it could emerge with the balance of power in a coalition. It is conceivable, though unlikely, that it could win enough seats to insist on the prime minister's job in a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. **********Politicians say that the new electoral system makes the outcome difficult to forecast, but that the most likely outcome is that the Liberal Democrats will dominate a coalition.  This would probably mean policies similar to the present ones. **********''I think it's going to be a coalition very much along the lines of what we have now,'' said John F. Neuffer, a specialist on Japanese politics at Mitsui Marine Research Institute in Tokyo. In any case, he noted, there are few major differences among the political parties. **********''Basically, everybody agrees on all of the issues,'' he said. ''This is a largely issue-less campaign.'' **********The one topic that has aroused some interest is whether the national sales tax should be raised as scheduled in April from 3 percent to 5 percent. Voters are opposed to the tax increase, and so the opposition is trying to make an issue of it. **********The opposition is also calling for major administrative reform, including a dramatic reduction in the number of government ministries. But since all the major parties are calling for this, even the governing Liberal Democrats, voters seem skeptical of all the proposals. **********In the old electoral system, Japanese elected several legislators from each district. But now 300 legislators will be chosen in single-seat constituencies, with just one member of Parliament for each district. An additional 200 legislators will be chosen by proportional representation based on votes for each party. **********The combination of the new system and the surly voter mood is expected to be nearly fatal for the Social Democratic Party, which recently changed its name from the Socialist Party in a desperate attempt to broaden its appeal. The Socialists were the main opposition party for most of postwar Japanese history, but they seem to be fragmenting and may not survive much longer. **********''Our identity as an independent party has not become clear, and we have provoked criticism and distrust,'' the Social Democrats' leader, Tomiichi Murayama, said today. ''But we've had some calls of support just now, and we've got to win in this election at all cost.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/06/business/currency-markets-dollar-soars-in-thin-trading-as-higher-us-rates-are-seen.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 345, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CURRENCY MARKETS;Dollar Soars in Thin Trading As Higher U.S. Rates Are Seen", "print_headline": "CURRENCY MARKETS;Dollar Soars in Thin Trading As Higher U.S. Rates Are Seen", "body_text": " **********The dollar surged in thin, volatile trading yesterday, as a surprisingly strong United States employment report buoyed hopes for higher United States interest rates. **********The dollar initially fell in New York trading, dragged down by tumbles in the United States bond and stock markets, after the Labor Department reported that 239,000 jobs were added to the nation's payrolls last month.

He was 93. **********A longtime senior officer whose posts included the last British command of the Pakistani Air Force, Sir Arthur, who retired in 1961, was also a noted amateur sailor who represented England in the 1948 Olympics and won his last race at the age of 92. **********London newspapers that reported his death gave no details. **********It was in June 1937 that a civilian airliner took off from the Netherlands and flew across the North Sea on a flight of such uneventful routine that when the plane landed safely in London, the Dutch pilot had no idea that he had unwittingly become a footnote to military history or that Squadron Leader Arthur McDonald had tracked him all the way. **********For although there had been earlier tests with cooperating R.A.F. target planes, the Dutch airliner was the first foreign plane in history to be detected and tracked by a new system based on reflected radio waves. **********It was called R.D.F., for radio detection finding, but in a gesture of noblesse oblige after sharing the technology with the United States, whose scientists called it radio aid for directionfinding and ranging, once the Battle of Britain had been won, the British adopted the American terminology and called it radar. **********It was Robert Watson-Watt, the British scientist who discovered and developed radar, who tipped the technological scales in favor of Britain in the air battles of World War II. **********But it was Sir Arthur who led the effort to adopt the technology for military use. **********The son of a British Army doctor who had served in the Boer War, Sir Arthur, who was born in South Africa and grew up on St. Kitts and Antigua, where his family had lived for generations, was the logical choice. **********After graduating from Epsom College in England and joining the air force in 1924, he had studied engineering at Cambridge, becoming one of the first R.A.F. officers to receive advanced technical training. **********It was to come in handy in 1936 when he was summoned back from his post in Singapore to take command of a secret experiental project to incorporate radar into the air force structure. **********Although it had been known since 1930 that reflected radio waves could theoretically be used to detect the position of distant planes, the technology was so rudimentary that German scientists who spent the 1930's working on it, were stunned in 1940 when they learned how rapidly and how well the British had perfected the system and incorporated it into their air defense. **********The British, of course, had the advantage of desperation. With no place in the country more than 20 minutes by air from the nearest coastal point, they knew that without an advance detection system it would take thousands and thousands of planes and antiaircraft guns scattered all over the country to mount more than a token defense against a mighty German Air Force that could pick the time and point of attack at will. **********And the British didn't have thousands of planes. They had only 650 Hurricanes and Spitfires, and were outnumbered by more than three to one by a German force of 900 German Messerschmitt fighters and 1,300 bombers. **********But by the time the air assault began as a prelude to a German invasion, the British also had chain of radar beacons and the techniques Sir Arthur had designed to use them for the rapid, accurate and efficient deployment of defending planes. **********For while it was Watson-Watt, who had been working with radar since 1919, who won the technological race, it was Sir Arthur who gave it its military sting, and not, coincidentally, created the familiar icons of countless movies about the Battle of Britain. **********It was he who designed the familiar war rooms with airmen pushing contrasting symbols of attacking and defending aircraft across a map table and it was he who invented the cryptic radio jargon of angels and bandits. **********He is survived by his wife, Mary; two sons and two daughters."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/17/business/compaq-computer-s-net-income-rises-by-43-but-stock-dips.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-10-17", "snippet": "Compaq Computer Corp reports strong gains in revenues, earnings and profit margins, which it attributes to successful new products, cost-cutting efforts and an increase in its share of personal computer market; for third quarter, Compaq reports ea...", "word_count": 526, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Compaq Computer's Net Income Rises by 43%, But Stock Dips", "print_headline": "Compaq Computer's Net Income Rises by 43%, But Stock Dips", "body_text": " **********The Compaq Computer Corporation reported strong gains yesterday in revenues, earnings and profit margins, which it attributed to successful new products, cost-saving efforts and an increase in its share of the personal computer market. **********Compaq's earnings comfortably exceeded Wall Street analysts' estimates for the quarter, and the announcement was taken by many as another sign of the industry's renewed vigor. **********But like the Intel Corporation's earnings report, which beat analysts' estimates on Monday, the good fortune of Compaq owes much to the company's dominant position in the industry. As the world's leading supplier of PC's, Compaq benefits from any broad pickup in demand, but also reaps proportionately greater savings from a higher volume of components purchases. **********Shares of Compaq fell $1.125, to $73.625. Analysts said some investors were selling on Compaq's good news, taking advantage of the increase in the stock, which has risen 12 percent in the last week and on Tuesday had reached a high of $74.75. **********''This was a very good quarter,'' Todd Bakar, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist, said. ''The overall industry health is good, but for those companies gaining share it's extremely good,'' he said, naming Compaq, Gateway 2000 Inc., the Dell Computer Corporation and the personal computer division of the Hewlett-Packard Company. For companies losing market share, such as AST Research Inc., these have been tough times. **********The stock market has also been ruthless to companies it perceived as underperforming or facing future troubles. Despite strong earnings, shares of Sun Microsystems Inc. fell nearly 10 percent yesterday, to $63.125, on fears that other companies including Compaq are entering the work station market that is dominated by Sun. **********For the third quarter, Compaq reported earnings of $350 million, or $1.26 a share, a 43 percent gain from $245 million, or 89 cents a share, in the comparable period last year. Revenues grew 25 percent, to $4.5 billion, compared with $3.6 billion reported in the third quarter of 1995. **********Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of $1.07 a share, according to First Call. **********Compaq's sales growth of 25 percent indicated the company was taking market share from competitors, Earl L. Mason, Compaq's senior vice president and chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview. Gross profit margin improvement ''was fueled not only by good products, but by cost reduction activities in our main business,'' he said. ''We have people focused on trying to move raw materials to finished products as fast as possible,'' he said. Compaq reduced inventory and increased its cash, he said. **********Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's president and chief executive, said in a statement: ''Our outlook continues to call for a strong second half. We're confident that Compaq's business model enables us to gain market share and improve profitability.'' **********But one longtime industry consultant said Compaq's third-quarter gains could be fleeting. Seymour Merrin of Merrin Information Services in Mountain View, Calif., said that the entry of the Sony Corporation and the Toshiba Corporation into the desktop computer business, coupled with strong new products from I.B.M., would challenge Compaq. **********''Compared to Toshiba and I.B.M., their product design is not as enticing and their merchandising, especially packaging, has really gone back a number of steps, and will probably cost them share,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/16/business/a-widow-s-pique.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Landler", "pub_date": "1996-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 3116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Widow's Pique", "print_headline": "A Widow's Pique", "body_text": " **********Milio Azcarraga Milmo usually travels with an entourage befitting the most powerful media mogul in Mexico. With his baronial bearing and distinctive appearance -- a stripe of white hair bisects his jet-black mane -- Mr. Azcarraga lives up to his nickname, \"El Tigre.\" **********On a bright, cold morning in January, however, Mr. Azcarraga turned up alone  at the home of Mary Anselmo in Greenwich, Conn. And on that day at least, the tiger acted more like a tabby. **********Mr. Azcarraga had known Mrs. Anselmo and her late husband, Rene V. Anselmo,  over four turbulent decades. Through his company, Grupo Televisa S.A., he had backed Mr. Anselmo's bold effort to break into the satellite business. Now, though, Mr. Azcarraga wanted Mrs. Anselmo to sell her husband's creation, PanAmSat, which had become the world's largest private satellite network, so he  could liquidate his investment. **********After a brief, subdued conversation in front of a crackling fireplace, Mrs. Anselmo acquiesced. She has been in agony ever since. **********\"I'm not sure Rene would have approved,\" Mrs. Amselmo said in an interview at her home, an elegant chateau modeled on the Petit Trianon at Versailles. \"I think he would have thought this was precipitate.\" **********Indeed, the 66-year-old widow's reluctant decision has set off an emotionally charged drama involving her family, Mr. Azcarraga and PanAmSat's 188 employees.  Behind everything hovers her late husband, a charismatic but combative man who seemed to spy an enemy behind every satellite dish. Though Mr. Anselmo died of heart failure in September at 69, his tangled legacy looms large over the family and the family business. **********So great were his passions and so fierce his feuds that Mr. Anselmo still seems to be pulling strings from the peaceful grotto behind his home where he is buried. **********\"Rene was a fighter and a scrapper,\" said Mark Fowler, who, as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission under President Ronald Reagan, helped Mr.  Anselmo pierce the monopoly in satellites. \"He was crazy like a fox.\" **********Mrs. Anselmo has retained Morgan, Stanley & Company to solicit offers for PanAmSat. People familiar with the process said Morgan had already attracted a blue-chip list of potential buyers: Hughes Electronics, General Electric, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, Loral, Lockheed Martin, and SES, a European satellite company. Morgan hopes to present a menu of options to the family in mid-July. **********With its necklace of four satellites that float in stationary orbit 22,300 miles above the equator and beam channels like CNN, HBO, and MTV to more than 100 countries, PanAmSat is a crown jewel in the rarefied world of global satellite networks. It now has a market capitalization of $2.9 billion, and several investment bankers estimate that it could command a price between $3 billion and $4 billion. **********Mrs. Anselmo, however, frets that a new owner may sunder the close-knit team  of sales executives and engineers that her husband gathered around him in the 12 tumultuous years that he built PanAmSat from a far-fetched concept into a public company that trades at a gravity-defying multiple of 25 times 1995 revenues. **********Prominent among these executives is Frederick A. Landman, president and chief executive, who began working for Mr. Anselmo fresh out of college in 1973 and married his only daughter, Pier, four years later. Mr. Landman, 48, and Pier Anselmo were recently divorced, but he retains close ties to Mary Anselmo. The couple have two daughters, Rissa and Chloe. **********\"My husband was very paternalistic, and I've inherited that,\" said Mrs. Anselmo, whose sad eyes and weary tone bespeak a woman struggling with the pressures of settling her husband's estate. \"It makes this really tough.\" **********If Mrs. Anselmo does not receive an attractive offer for PanAmSat, she has the option of doing a secondary stock offering instead. Under the company's shareholder structure, she is all but guaranteed to have the final say on any deal. And if Televisa tries to sell its stake without her consent, the stock would lose its special PanAmSat voting rights. **********But a stock offering would raise less money than an outright sale. That may not suit Televisa, which needs to fix a balance sheet battered by the collapse of the Mexican peso in 1995. Televisa's $200 million investment in PanAmSat now  has a market value of $1.17 billion. **********Although Televisa recently raised $700 million through a private debt placement, the company has not wavered from its desire to cash out of PanAmSat.  \"The refinancing does not in any way change our position,\" said Guillermo Caneda White, chief financial officer of Televisa and Mr. Azcarraga's principal representative on the PanAmSat board. **********Though Mrs. Anselmo says she, too, wants a premium price for PanAmSat, an attractive offer clearly means more than cold cash. She said she would also like to honor the memory of her husband. **********And that's where things get sticky. Mr. Anselmo, the son of a Massachusetts postal superintendent of Italian descent, served as a young Marine tail-gunner in World War II. Throughout his life, he relished a good fight and nursed old grudges -- against competitors, suppliers, partners, even his neighbors in Greenwich. \"When I get mad, I just never give up,\" he said in a 1990 interview. **********Now, the battles Mr. Anselmo fought during his life could ensnare the sale of PanAmSat after his death. **********For example, Hughes is perhaps the most logical buyer. The company is starting a direct-to-home satellite service in Latin America that could be folded into a rival Latin American service being started by PanAmSat, Televisa and several media companies. Hughes is also no stranger to PanAmSat; it built three of its satellites. **********The catch? Hughes deeply offended Mr. Anselmo when it opted to go head-to-head with PanAmSat and Televisa in Latin America. He told Hughes executives he would never buy another satellite from them and promptly switched  his contract to Loral. **********The bitterness persists. Shortly after her husband's death, Mrs. Anselmo got  a condolence letter from C. Michael Armstrong, the chairman of Hughes. After expressing his regrets, however, Mr. Armstrong segued into business -- offering  to buy the company if Mrs. Anselmo put it up for sale. \"It was a clumsy move,\" she said. **********Reverge C. Anselmo, her 33-year-old son, who used to work for PanAmSat and is now one of its five directors, is more frank. \"We don't like Hughes,\" he said. \"They betrayed my dad, and they betrayed Azcarraga.\" **********A spokesman for Hughes declined to comment on Mr. Armstrong's letter or on whether Hughes planned to bid for PanAmSat. One top Hughes executive, who declined to be identified, acknowledged that \"it makes for a strained relationship when your satellite manufacturer is also competing with you as an operator.\" But he added that Mr. Anselmo's past clashes with the company would not influence its decision to bid. **********NOTHING dramatizes the late Mr. Anselmo's mix of vision and vitriol more than his roller-coaster relationship with Mr. Azcarraga. **********The two men met in Mexico in 1954, where Mr. Anselmo settled after graduating from the Great Books program at the University of Chicago in 1951. Mr. Anselmo was directing theatrical productions while Mr. Azcarraga was dabbling as a theatrical financier. Mrs. Anselmo, who married Mr. Anselmo soon after he moved  to Mexico, remembers the young Mr. Azcarraga as a \"playboy,\" though she said he worked hard and had the drive of a locomotive. **********Mr. Azcarraga prodded his father to recruit Mr. Anselmo to build a television network that would cater to the mushrooming Hispanic population in the United States. The company he created, Spanish International Network, eventually strung together more than 300 affiliates. Together, Mr. Azcarraga and Mr. Anselmo also  acquired five stations. **********In 1985, though, the F.C.C. refused to renew the station licenses after ruling that their foreign parent company, Televisa, exercised too much control over them. Over Mr. Anselmo's strident objections, the younger Mr. Azcarraga agreed to sell the stations and the network. Mr. Anselmo pocketed $80 million, but he broke off relations with the younger Mr. Azcarraga. **********From broadcasting, it was a small leap for Mr. Anselmo to satellites. His debut as a satellite executive has already passed into lore -- as celebrated in  this tight-knit industry as Ted Turner's risky foray into round-the-clock news is among cable programmers. **********In 1988, Mr. Anselmo gambled the bulk of his fortune, more than $60 million,  to buy a used satellite and launch it with inadequate insurance and no clients on an unproven Ariane rocket. A three-pack-a-day smoker, Mr. Anselmo missed the  launching in French Guiana because he was in Greenwich recovering from quintuple bypass surgery. **********While Mr. Anselmo scrambled to sign up clients -- his first coup was a contract to transmit CNN to Latin America -- he waged an epic and victorious battle against Intelsat, a consortium owned by more than 100 governments that dominated the global satellite business. **********President Reagan had declared in 1984 that private operators ought to be allowed to compete with Intelsat in global satellite communications. But Intelsat lobbied long and furiously, both at home and abroad, to keep PanAmSat out of the business. Mr. Anselmo retaliated with a blizzard of letters to F.C.C. officials and lawmakers that lampooned Intelsat's monopoly with humor that sometimes bordered on the scatological. **********\"We were all amused to read those letters,\" said Mr. Fowler. \"They were either the product of a very clever mind or a very demented one.\" **********Alfred C. Sikes, one of Mr. Fowler's successors as F.C.C. chairman, said there was a method to the madness. \"Discussing satellite policy is like watching paint dry. He took it out of the abstract.\" **********In Congressional testimony, Mr. Anselmo played to the hilt the role of scrappy underdog. Bernard L. Schwartz, the chairman of Loral, recalls sitting next to Mr. Anselmo at a 1994 House hearing. Asked what he thought of a treaty restricting overseas satellite transmission, Mr. Anselmo ripped up a piece of paper with a flourish. **********Mr. Anselmo created a cartoon dog named Spot as a mascot for his crusade. Spot was usually pictured lifting his hind leg -- a less-than-subtle metaphor for Mr. Anselmo's contempt for monopolies. Spot showed up in letters, newspaper  advertisements, even emblazoned on the nose cone of the Ariane rockets that carried PanAmSat's satellites aloft. Even today, the company's stock trades on Nasdaq under the symbol SPOT. **********Emboldened by his early success, Mr. Anselmo agreed to pay $721 million in 1991 to build, insure, and launch three more satellites. After a fruitless search for investors, Mr. Anselmo went back to Mr. Azcarraga with an offer to sell Televisa 50 percent of PanAmSat for $200 million. Despite the six-year rupture in their friendship, Mr. Azcarraga agreed. **********With Mr. Azcarraga's money in his pocket, Mr. Anselmo set off on a wild ride  to turn PanAmSat, which then had one satellite, into a global network able to sign up a wide array of clients and beam their programming virtually anywhere in the world. Over the next three years, Mr. Anselmo kept expanding despite a failed satellite launching, an initial public offering that was pulled at the last minute and ever-worsening health problems that led to another major operation in 1994. **********By the time of Mr. Anselmo's death -- the day before the company's shares began trading on Nasdaq -- PanAmSat had become a genuinely global player. The company had expanded beyond its core clientele of American cable networks to sign up foreign broadcasters like China Central Television, Doordarshan of India, and NHK of Japan. **********\"They came at a time when there was no good alternative,\" said Robert M. Zitter, the senior vice president of technology operations at HBO. \"And they developed a system that meets the needs of the television market.\" HBO leases capacity on three PanAmSat satellites to beam its channel to Latin America, Asia, and, soon, India. **********In 1995, PanAmSat's revenue rose to $116.1 million, almost twice the $63.7 million it recorded in 1994. More than half of last year's revenue, $66.1 million, is operating cash flow -- money the company can theoretically reinvest  in the business. In the first quarter of 1996, PanAmSat's results continued to soar: revenues hit $50.4 million, while cash flow jumped to $36.6 million. **********PanAmSat's horizon is not completely cloud-free. With the explosion of satellite communications, private companies are sprouting here and abroad to challenge its cozy franchise. And Mr. Anselmo's pell-mell expansion saddled the  company with $575 million in long-term debt. **********But Andrew Hornick, a media and communications analyst at Citicorp Securities Inc., said the debt load was manageable because the company would generate a reliable flow of revenue from long-term contracts worth a total of $3.2 billion. Once airborne, he pointed out, satellites are inexpensive to maintain. **********These unusual economics -- large starting costs offset by low operating expenses and lofty margins -- have made PanAmSat's stock buoyant.  After going public in September at $17, the company's shares slipped briefly and then rose to a high of $33.25 in April. Since then, they have settled in the high 20's; on Friday, the company's stock closed at $29. **********PanAmSat's four satellites already reach 98 percent of the world's population. But Mr. Landman, the chief executive, said PanAmSat intends to launch two more satellites next year and a third by 1998 to expand its capacity  to carry TV programming, plus some telephone and data traffic. When finished, PanAmSat will have eight satellites aloft -- four over the Atlantic and two each over the Pacific and Indian oceans. **********WHILE Mr. Landman talks excitedly about these plans, his mood darkens when the conversation switches to a potential sale. Like other senior executives, Mr. Landman owes his career to Mr. Anselmo. While Mr. Landman's seven million shares are worth $203 million, there is no other job he wants aside from running his former father-in-law's company. **********\"This has been a very emotional time for me,\" he said, \"Rene Anselmo was my mentor in every sense of the word.\" **********For Mrs. Anselmo, the potential payoff from a sale is even greater. But so, too, is the emotional strain of worrying about employees like Mr. Landman. The Anselmo family together controls a 40.5 percent stake in PanAmSat, which is worth $1.17 billion, and elects three of the company's five directors. Although  Televisa also owns 40.5 percent, it elects only two directors. And in the event of a split among the Anselmos, Mrs. Anselmo alone gets to cast the tie-breaking vote. **********Two of Mrs. Anselmo's three children -- Pier and Rayce, a son who has worked  in television and lives in California -- profess not to be interested in the business. But Reverge Anselmo, who attended the decisive meeting with Mr. Azcarraga in Greenwich, is keen on diversifying his family's holdings. **********\"My family has a lot of talent, and there are a lot of other things we could  do,\" Reverge Anselmo said in an interview from his home in Capitan, N.M. \"Let's  get our noses out of the solar panels for a while.\" **********Reverge Anselmo worked as a sales executive for PanAmSat in Miami for several years, and Mrs. Anselmo said her husband harbored hopes that he would make a career in the family business. But Mr. Anselmo quit abruptly 18 months ago, after clashing with Mr. Landman, then his brother-in-law. Though Mrs. Anselmo said her husband was chagrined, he was not willing to side with his son over Mr. Landman. **********\"It was a case of the heir apparent coming up against the heir,\" said Mrs. Anselmo with palpable regret. **********Mr. Anselmo is now completing a novel that grew out of his experience as a Marine in Beirut during the 1982 terrorist bombing. **********Edward J. Landau, Mrs. Anselmo's lawyer, is also gently prodding her to consider a sale. \"No matter how good a company is, to have 95 percent of your net worth in one stock is not a good thing,\" he said. **********People familiar with the process said that at least one company, Loral, had made a preliminary offer for PanAmSat and had indicated it might negotiate. As Mrs. Anselmo watches the players maneuver, she is doing her best to soothe the fears of PanAmSat's employees. After saying she would consider a sale, Mrs. Anselmo reassured employees in a conference call that she would try to take care of them. **********In a rare break from her husband's practices, she threw a companywide Christmas party last December at her home, which employees jokingly refer to as  the \"big house.\" (Rene Anselmo always hated Christmas parties, according to employees.) **********\"A lot of us viewed Rene as a father figure,\" said Lourdes Saralegui, a 34-year-old executive vice president, who joined PanAmSat only 12 years ago as a temporary secretary. \"Now, Mary is taking on the role of a maternal figure.\" **********That's no easy task. Just as Katharine Graham struggled to take the reins of  the Washington Post and Loida Lewis grappled with the job of running TLC Beatrice International after the deaths of their husbands, Mary Anselmo has found it daunting to step into the breach. \"My mother has never had anything other than being Mrs. Anselmo,\" Reverge Anselmo said. **********Smoking one cigarette after another just as her husband had done, Mrs. Anselmo said the other day that she had rarely been involved in her husband's business and that she knows precious little about satellites. Asked how she was  handling all the pressure, she responded, \"Not too well, obviously.\" **********For example, she expressed surprise in the interview that Morgan Stanley, PanAmSat's financial adviser, was also playing a big role in Televisa's efforts  to raise some quick cash. Given her ambivalence about a sale, some of Morgan Stanley's rivals say the bank may be wearing too many hats. **********Yet Mr. Landman said Mrs. Anselmo was being too modest. They said she kept well-informed about the financial mechanics. \"Don't let her fool you with the I-don't-know-anything-about-business line,\" he said. And Mrs. Anselmo has continued her vocation: the upkeep of her chateau in suburbia. The Anselmos bought the house in 1967, and she and her husband supervised a never-ending series of landscaping and construction projects dreamed up by Mr. Anselmo. **********MR. ANSELMO'S drive to beautify his surroundings extended beyond his front gates. For years, he paid to plant thousands of daffodils and tulips along North Street, where his house is located. In 1990, he was arrested for spray painting  over a neighbor's \"For Sale\" sign that he contended was unsightly.

What grabbed most of the headlines was the announcement that Patty Stonesifer, senior vice president of the interactive media division and Microsoft's only top-ranking female executive, was leaving the company. **********But the organizational shift also moved Nathan Myhrvold, one of the company's best-known technical visionaries, out of his role as group vice president of Microsoft's ''applications and content'' business. As the  executive in charge of ''content,'' Mr. Myhrvold approved most of Microsoft's media projects. But he has now been pulled back into research as  chief technology officer. **********Perhaps most noteworthy is that the company, for the first time, has broken out interactive media into its own business group -- and tapped a highly regarded Microsoft executive, Pete Higgins, to run it. **********Sharing management duties in the applications and content group with Mr. Myhrvold, Mr. Higgins ran the company's cash-cow software applications business, which includes the company's flagship Word and Excel products. Now, under his leadership, the interactive media business will have its own entry on Microsoft's balance sheet. Until last week, its finances were never public because they were reported as part of the applications and content group. **********These are radical moves that speak volumes about the strategic importance Microsoft is now placing on the interactive media market. **********Because it already dominates the PC software industry, Microsoft cannot grow much more simply by increasing market share. Instead, the company measures its growth by increasing ''dollars spent per PC,'' as Ms. Stonesifer once said. Once customers have bought word processors, spreadsheets and data bases, most of what they continue to buy are inexpensive upgrades. **********But media is an addictive, hit-driven business. Unlike buying a spreadsheet and using it for years, buying one video game is likely to inspire the buying of another. The media opportunities are not only in software titles: PC users, on average, now spend between $10 and $200 a month for on-line services and Internet connections. **********And if consumers buy lots of Microsoft Windows-based interactive media, they are increasingly bonded to the Windows PC platform itself -- meaning, in theory, that they will continue to spend more and more dollars per PC. **********Industry watchers estimate Microsoft's media investments are now between $800 million and $1.5 billion, embracing everything from giant reference works on CD-ROM to television's MSNBC cable channel (on which this writer appears as a commentator). The company has ensconced more than 2,000 workers in a new Redmond, Wash., campus for its interactive media division. In addition to MSNBC, its joint venture with NBC News, Microsoft has partnership deals with Dreamworks SKG, Paramount Television, Black Entertainment Television and others. **********Earlier this month, moreover, the company transformed its Microsoft Network, known as MSN, from a proprietary on-line service to a giant Web site of information and entertainment ''channels,'' much of which is created by independent producers financed by Microsoft. **********In fact, one on-line developer said Microsoft is courting these producers so intensely that ''no one in the New York interactive media world has bought themselves dinner in more than a month.'' **********But as any company can tell you, making deals and spending money does not insure success. And even though both businesses involve PC's, the process of creating and selling PC software, Microsoft-style, could not be more different than creating  and selling interactive media. **********Hit media properties, especially in entertainment, are the result of a winnowing of thousands of creative visions made manifest in the market. If the public does not like one vision, it will simply go somewhere else. **********But Microsoft is not known for creative vision. Instead, it is legendary for taking the visions of others, pushing its own version into the market, and reiterating it until the company  gets it right. **********The difference between software applications and media properties is so fundamental that many people believe Microsoft cannot be successful in interactive media until it puts someone in charge of the division who knows and understands both media and creative vision. **********Ms. Stonesifer's move out of the company was under way for a year, and Mr. Higgins had been attending meetings with her for more than eight months, according to people familiar with the situation. During this transition, the company presumably had the opportunity to find someone with vision and the skills to make it a reality. It chose not to. **********Why not remains a mystery. Any analysis of Microsoft's success focuses on the acumen of its chairman, Bill Gates, whose intimate knowledge of software is inextricably linked to his business skills, making him a formidable competitor. **********Mr. Gates said Mr. Higgins was right for his new job because of his success with applications, as well as his considerable management skills. **********But that represents only half of the equation that Mr. Gates has long brought to the making and marketing of software. What is missing in this case is a fundamental understanding of interactive media. **********With such sizable investments on the line, Microsoft's failure to apply its own success formula to interactive media is an apparent lapse in logic -- from a company where logic is a stock in trade."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/17/business/worldbusiness/IHT-eu-is-primed-for-asia-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Tom Buerkle", "pub_date": "1996-01-17", "snippet": "The European Union hopes to establish a broad partnership on trade and investment with Asia to gain a bigger share of the region's explosive growth and strike a fresh blow against U.S. trade unilateralism, officials said..The economic partnership ...", "word_count": 2470, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EU Is Primed for Asia Talks", "print_headline": "EU Is Primed for Asia Talks", "body_text": " **********The European Union hopes to establish a broad partnership on trade and investment with Asia to gain a bigger share of the region's explosive growth and strike a fresh blow against U.S. trade unilateralism, officials said. **********The economic partnership will be the centerpiece of discussions when EU leaders hold their first summit meeting with the heads of 10 Asian governments in Bangkok on March 1 and 2. **********One primary aim of the partnership is to bolster the World Trade Organization as an effective arbiter of global trade rules and to hammer out common positions on extending those rules to new areas such as telecommunications, EU and Asian officials said. **********That goal amounts to an implicit criticism of Americantrade policy, which many European and Asian officials believe seeks to gain an unfair advantage by threatening to impose unilateral trade sanctions. **********It also underlines the improvement in relations between the EU and Asia since the two sides made common cause against Washington in trade disputes over cars and financial services last year, officials said. **********The meeting \"should make a strong pledge for multilateralism and open regionalism,\" said an EU position paper adopted by the European Commission on Tuesday.

That brought Canada's travel trade imbalance down from $4.2 billion (United States) in 1994, but the deficit was still a worrisome $3.55 billion. . **********Hoping to bring those numbers into some sort of balance, Canada recently began a two-pronged advertising campaign developed by Vickers & Benson in Toronto, one of the country's biggest ad agencies. The first prong is aimed at persuading Canadians to vacation at home; the second at coaxing Americans to discover their northern neighbor. **********National pride is partly involved, for Canada is indeed a diverse land, as its ads proclaim, with modern cities, majestic canyons, seafaring provinces and  the Yukon territory. Yet many vacationing Canadians -- too many, in the opinion  of the Canadian Tourism Commission -- head for the sights of the United States,  while Americans are unaware of Canada's tourist attractions. **********Still, the main motivation for the ad campaign is not pride but the deficit.  Hoping to reduce or eliminate it altogether, the ads seek to persuade 600,000 Canadians to curb their wanderlust and vacation in Canada this year and to entice 130,000 Americans to visit Canada. **********The portion of the campaign directed at Canadians is underwritten in part by  the provinces, most of which have tourism marketing programs, and by the Canadian Tourism Commission, which was recently transformed from a government bureau (Tourism Canada) with a staff of 110 into a public-private agency with a  staff half that size. Its 26-member board includes corporate officials as well as federal, provincial and government members from throughout the nation. **********The ad campaign in the United States, which costs about $24 million, is financed by the commission and in part by hotels, airlines and other private businesses. Its theme is \"The World Needs More Canada.\" **********The campaign includes three television commercials, broadcast earlier this year in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and a 24-page brochure of events, which appeared in the March 17 issues of The New York Times, Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, then in The New Yorker, Travel & Leisure, Gourmet and Food &  Wine magazine. **********Last month, half-page four-color ads promoting Canada appeared in The New York Times and USA Today, along with black-and-white ads in The Wall Street Journal. The ads, which will run every other week through next March, will focus on specific destinations, products and festivals tailored to the season and publication. **********A 24-page brochure on so-called soft adventure travel recently appeared in the National Geographic Traveler, Conde Nast Traveler and Travel & Leisure magazines. And a 56-page travel planning guide, aimed largely at first-time visitors who respond to the television ads, has a section about each of Canada's five regions, as well as helpful hints for traveling in Canada and a section on  festivals. **********In all the ads and commercials, \"the same look, the same feel are all working together to build the Canada brand and get people to experience our products,\" said Sylvie Lafleur, a manager in Ottawa of the Canadian leisure marketing program. **********Thomas C. Penney, director of tourism for the Americas, said the campaign would continue next year, with almost $14 million from the Canadian Government and expectations of at least that much from the private sector. \"We believe there is tremendous potential in the American market, if we market strategically,\" Mr. Penney said. \"But remember, we're in effect using weaker dollars.\" **********The weakness of the Canadian dollar, which is worth about 73 United States cents, should encourage more Americans to travel to Canada, but it has not yet worked that way, according to Terrence Leblanc, a Canadian Tourist Commission analyst. **********\"The dollar appears to be a more effective deterrent for Canadians than it is a motivator for Americans,\" Mr. Leblanc said. \"Canadians are very aware of the unfavorable exchange rate of the American dollar.

It was originally a Shakespeare festival, intended to celebrate the \"endangered\" English language and protect the traditions the founders ascribed to the 1820 settlers: free speech and public debate. **********In the 1980's, it was transformed into an anti-apartheid forum. It declared war on racism, but the authorities largely ignored it, feeling that those white  liberals and hippies could not hurt anyone if they were off in a tiny university town 90 minutes from the nearest airport. The festival was one of very few places in the country where there was no censorship, and no one was arrested for having blacks and whites together in the audience or on stage. **********Now the wars are over. A Xhosa is President. Afrikaans is in retreat, at least on television and in Government utterances. (It even has its own defensive festival, in nearby Oudtshoorn.) So the question before the festival's artists is: Now what? **********This being a festival with 184 main events and 344 fringe ones, there are a lot of answers. One is: Forget politics. Do art. Terrence McNally's Broadway hit \"Love! Valour! Compassion!\" -- about seven gay men in a summer cottage -- is one of the main events. **********But others are more in keeping with the festival's quasi-political history. A second answer is: Celebrate Africa. Promote fusion. A third: Look for new things to fight about. **********Mike van Graan, a playwright and sometimes consultant to the country's arts and culture ministry, is from the last camp. His three one-acts, collectively titled \"Dinner Talk,\" are all on topics hot in post-apartheid South Africa: crime -- a human rights lawyer guns down the men who killed his wife; the Truth  Commission -- a white woman discovers in bed that her Indian one-night stand may have planted the bomb that killed her sister; and the Government gravy train --  an artist-turned-Culture Ministry official argues with his former best friend, a still-struggling artist who accuses him of being an elitist sellout. **********Considering Mr. van Graan's part-time job, the third was pretty self-lacerating. But one of his funniest lines, a crack at the new Government, was: \"Oh, but now every politician has fallen in love with opera.  One trip to the Nico Theater and a cocktail afterward with the fat stars, and every ex-comrade is conscripted into the fight to save opera and ballet.\" **********(That is, unless they get mugged.  Many artists at the festival lamented that rising crime is keeping people home at night, stifling live theater.) **********His point, Mr. van Graan says, is that there is still plenty to write about.  And if the world isn't watching the way it was before, that is good.  Writers and actors here, he said, need less praise and more training. **********\"For a while, everyone who came out of apartheid became a big hit overseas,\"  he said. \"They wanted to be big here too, and get big salaries. How does a director tell someone who thinks he's an international star to take notes?\" **********South Africa's art world is still small and rather isolated, and the pitfalls of instant stardom are obvious here. **********Vincent Matsoe, a 25-year-old choreographer whose best-known dances echo bird life, Bali and Peru, and Trevor Makhoba, a 39-year-old socialist realist painter who tackles township problems like incest and violence as harshly as he attacks  racism, both won the coveted Young Artist of the Year awards from Standard Bank, the festival's sponsor. Some critics said fame had put them in such demand that they are churning out work so fast that their techniques are becoming more  naive, not less. **********Celebrating Africa, and fusing it with the festival's former Eurocentric focus, was tried in many venues. **********Janet Suzman, a South African who spent years on the London stage, directed an all-black cast in \"The Good Woman of Sharkville,\" transposing Bertolt Brecht's drama \"The Good Woman of Szechuan\" from China to a township with the theme intact: it is hard for a prostitute to keep her heart of gold when she is  surrounded by greed and crime. **********Boerqanga, a jazz group led by an Afrikaner accordionist and an African saxophonist, melded two kinds of rhythms. The racially mixed audience cheered and danced to the result, although it had airs of polka in a Chicago jazz club.  And Alistair Andrews, a bass player and music archivist from Cape Town, grumbled that \"we blacks are further from whites than Americans are from Japanese, and it sounds like that.\" **********And one of the sleeper hits of the festival was an integrated Zimbabwean dance troupe, Tumbuka, which did pieces about the genocide in Rwanda, and about  going for the gold in the Olympics and in South African mines. **********Attracting more talent from the rest of Africa is one of the goals of Prof. Alan Crump, chairman of the festival committee, who thinks that is what sets his festival apart from rivals like Edinburgh's. **********He brought in Mozambican dance troupes and Swazi crafts, \"but it's tough,\" he said. \"You can't pick up the phone -- they may not have one.  They sure don't have agents. If you want to do business, you spend twice as much because you must go there and get them.\" **********Outside the fortress -- the 1820 Settler's Monument, which houses theaters rather than statues -- the festival spills into the streets, with everything from frantic Zulu dancing to serene landscapes of Namibia on display.

Giuliani may best be known for toughness and zeal, however, Mayor Xu is striking for his affability and self-deprecation, revealed in an engaging smile and a hearty laugh. **********''I'm not very good-looking,'' said Mr. Xu (whose name is pronounced shoo kwahng-dee), laughing again as a reporter prepared to take his picture. ''I look even worse in a photograph.'' **********Mr. Xu, 58, is a refreshing contrast to most government officials in China, who typically follow a strict, dour Communist Party line when appearing in public. Mr. Xu speaks with a disarming openness about problems and challenges, and easily sprinkles historical references into his conversation. **********The careful listener will find that Mr. Xu's comments on government policy do not vary in substance from those made by his more impassive fellow officials. And he is not exactly accessible. An interview, his first with an American publication since he became Mayor, came 20 months after he took office. **********But Mr. Xu's manner is so friendly and direct that he is easily one of China's best ambassadors to the West, routinely charming businessmen and diplomats, and even journalists. **********As China and the United States work to mend relations, Beijing is sending Mr. Xu on a 10-day visit to New York, Washington and Los Angeles, starting on Friday. **********When he glad-hands business executives and members of Congress, and makes a scheduled stop at the White House, Mr. Xu will be able to speak a language Americans understand. His English is fluent. **********Even more than that, Mr. Xu has a worldly perspective that allows him to describe China's concerns in a context that is comprehensible to non-Chinese. It comes, in part, from spending nearly two years in Sweden and Britain as a visiting scholar in the 1980's, a time that also nourished his devotion to classical music. **********''I like Mozart and Tchaikovsky,''  Mr. Xu said with a grin. ''Civil servants are not allowed to listen to music in their offices, to keep them quiet. But I can be more efficient if I have music.'' **********''When I want to get pepped up, I put on Mozart,'' Mr. Xu went on, breaking into a bar from ''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik'': ''dum, dah-dum, dah-dum-DUM-DUM-DUM-DUM!'' **********If he doesn't seem like an ordinary Chinese politician, it may be because Mr. Xu came to politics late in life. Originally a college professor, Mr. Xu joined an advisory group to Mayor Zhu Rongji of Shanghai on how to develop the city into an international business center, and got to know Mr. Zhu, now a Deputy Prime Minister and China's economic czar. **********As Mr. Xu has told the story, the two men were on a trip to Europe when Mr. Zhu asked him over breakfast to head Shanghai's Planning Commission, a producer of thick, arguably useless documents. **********''But I don't believe in planning,'' Mr. Xu replied. **********''That's what we need, someone with new ideas,'' said Mr. Zhu, who became his political mentor. **********As Mr. Zhu was promoted, moving to Beijing as a Politburo member, so was Mr. Xu. He became Mayor in February 1995. Though he runs the city government, he is still subordinate to Huang Ju, the Communist Party chief here. **********At a news conference last year, Mr. Xu was asked to talk about his private life, ordinarily taboo for a politician in China. **********''For Chinese leaders, this is a tricky question,'' he said. ''We don't usually talk about this.'' **********Then he smiled and proceeded to talk about it anyway. **********Mr. Xu volunteered that his wife is a professor at Shanghai University. ''We have an agreement: she doesn't participate in my work -- not like that Mrs. Clinton -- and I don't interfere in hers.'' **********He was also unexpectedly honest about why he joined the Communist Party so late, at age 45. **********''They wouldn't let me in,'' he said with a chuckle. ''I did not come from a family of workers or farmers. My parents were intellectuals.'' **********Mr. Xu has not lost his taste for academia. Despite a hectic schedule, he still tutors a few graduate students, and prefers his closest aides to call him Teacher Xu rather than Mayor Xu. **********Teacher Xu inevitably drops historical references into conversation, whether it is about the growth of an American securities market a century ago or Germany's postwar recovery. There is no easy historical precedent, however, for the transition under way in Shanghai, a city of 14 million residents, plus 3 million or so transient workers. **********''In America, a mayor is essentially responsible for public safety and public service,'' Mr. Xu said. ''A mayor in China has to take care of these things, and much more.'' **********There is a vast construction agenda: a subway, a cross-harbor tunnel, an airport and a rash of skyscrapers and highways are all being built, requiring 1.2 million people to move. There is a constant campaign to win domestic and foreign investment. And on top of that, Mr. Xu has to supervise the shift from a planned to a market economy in Shanghai. **********''I don't have any time to play golf or tennis,'' Mr. Xu said, laughing again.

Now he or she can walk into a store with head held high and demand a tanuron. **********That, according to the latest decree of the august Academy of the Hebrew Language, is what a toaster-oven shall hereafter be in Hebrew -- literally, a \"little oven.\" **********The word tanuron may not be as indispensable as the new word for rating, \"midrug,\" as in Prime Minister Shimon Peres's political midrug as he heads for an early election, or as exciting as \"galgiliot lahav,\" for in-line skates, or even as practical as \"mifrat,\" for the ledge where a bus driver keeps change. **********Yet \"tanuron\" was hardly an easy achievement for the academy, which is charged by the Israeli Parliament with updating and monitoring a language that was effectively unspoken for 1,700 years before it was revived as Israel's official language. **********To begin with, said Dr. Gabriel Birnbaum, the secretary of the academy, some  members questioned whether there was a real need to devote an entire word to a gadget that was fast being supplanted by the microwave oven, which already had a word -- \"mikrogal.\" **********But people had written letters asking for a word, so the academy's committee  on new household words concluded there was still a demand. **********Then the question became what root to use. The problem was that two words had already been tried for toaster and both were swept aside by the public, which insisted on calling it a toaster. **********So the academy reached into ancient Hebrew for \"tanur,\" the word Moses himself might have used when he spoke of an oven. To that it added a diminutive  ending, and presto! -- the toaster-oven had its own niche. **********It is another matter altogether when, or whether, the store clerks of Tel Aviv will actually bring out a toaster-oven when someone demands a tanuron. **********Though the academy is charged with coining new words, it has little power to  assure their use beyond putting out the word, so to speak. After the plenum of the academy meets and authorizes new words, they are printed up and sent out to  schools, universities, libraries and radio and television stations. Then it is a question of taste and time. **********\"It's very easy to invent a word, but difficult to prophesy whether it will be accepted by the public,\" Dr. Birnbaum said. \"It's still a riddle to us why one word catches on and another doesn't.\" **********Some words have been an instant hit, he said, like \"kaletet\" for cassette, video or audio. It was introduced just in time for a big political scandal involving a compromising video cassette, so \"kaletet\" was put into quick and lively use. **********But video remained \"video,\" with the reluctant blessing of the academy. The linguists came up with what they thought was a fine word, Dr. Birnbaum said -- \"khozi,\" from the same root used in \"see\" -- but it evidently was too close to the Yiddish word \"khoisik,\" to make fun of something, so \"video\" it was. **********Much of the academy's work these days is to provide words for specialized fields. **********Recent additions range from medical terms (\"seger\" for occlusion); a lexicon  for the advertising industry (a teaser is \"garyan\" and a television prompter is  \"makreat ezer\") and terms for party politics (primaries are \"behirot makdimot\"). **********But there is always some common thing that the ancients evidently did not have, and pioneering Zionists forgot to name -- like pajamas, which recently became \"namnemet,\" from a root that means to doze. **********The preparatory work is done by committees of experts, which currently include, in addition to one on general words, specialized panels on banking, biology, botany, diplomacy, medicine, law and folklore. **********The full academy, 45 distinguished writers and linguists under Moshe Bar-Asher, a professor of linguistics at Hebrew University, meets six or seven times a year to pass final judgment on the proposals. **********The very fact that the process has become routine and almost obscure is testimony to the success of a pioneering Zionist, Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, in actually reviving ancient Hebrew as a living language. Ben-Yehuda became convinced early on in his native Lithuania that the creation of a Jewish state required the revival of a national language. **********On arriving in Palestine in 1881, he declared to his wife that they would henceforth converse only in Hebrew. Until then, the language had been used almost exclusively for prayer and Talmudic studies. **********Ben-Yehuda also pioneered systematically coining Hebrew words. The Academy of the Hebrew Language, formed in 1953, was a successor to the Hebrew Language Committee, which he formed to establish Hebrew words for daily use. **********Today, Dr. Birnbaum said, the biggest Hebrew dictionary lists about 71,000 words, far fewer than an English dictionary, but with \"no shortage of words for  me to express myself.\" Internationally renowned writers like Amos Oz and David Grossman work in Hebrew, Israeli universities produce a high level of scholarship in all fields in the language, and rock stars do a fierce Hebrew rap. **********\"Hebrew was not spoken for 1,700 years, except in very special conditions,\" Dr. Birnbaum said. \"The problems of reviving it were different from anything in  any other language. In English, nobody thinks to use some term from King Alfred's time, while in Hebrew all strata of the language are open -- biblical,  medieval, ancient. The public needs guidance. That's why the academy is a very vital instrument.\" **********Life moves on, introducing things like park-and-ride, speed trap, speed bumps, ghost images on TV, smog and radioactive fallout -- things of which not only the ancient Israelites, but also Ben-Yehuda, had no inkling. **********Of course, English words could simply be adopted for new things, as they often are the world over, to the dismay of purists like members of the French Academy, who inveigh against the invasion of Anglicisms. **********The Israeli academy is \"not so puritanical and zealous\" as the French, Dr. Birnbaum said, but it does try to limit imported words to those with a certified international usage, like \"universita,\" \"democratia,\" \"shokolat\" and, to the dissatisfaction of some academy purists, \"academia\" for their own institution. **********In addition to coining new words, Dr. Birnbaum's staff spends four hours every day taking calls from the public. During an interview in his office, one assistant came in to ask about the proper spelling of words to be used on the tombstone of a Cohen, a member of a priestly clan. **********Then someone asked what a pediatric clinic should be called in Hebrew. \"Tachana l'briyut hamishpacha\" (\"family health care center\") was the usual term, Dr. Birnbaum said, but \"tipat halav\" (a name for mother-and-child health centers that literally means \"drop of milk\") was also O.K."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/20/business/credit-markets-strong-start-but-bonds-back-down.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 618, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS;Strong Start, But Bonds Back Down", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS;Strong Start, But Bonds Back Down", "body_text": " **********Bonds gave up an initial gain and were little changed yesterday as investors  debated whether a jump in oil prices and signs of stronger economic growth would bring about an increase in inflation. **********The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 5/32, to 90 28/32.

The prices of consumer goods last year climbed 2.5 percent, after 2.7 percent increases in both 1994 and 1993. **********In one sign that economic growth and inflation could soon pick up speed, the  price of oil jumped $1.07 a barrel yesterday, to $24.34, the highest since January 1991, when the Persian Gulf war began. **********Recent signs of growth also include the jump in employment last month.

They also maintained their own customs, building synagogues, libraries and cultural centers, including a Yiddish theater where groups from Europe and the United States performed. **********Today, few if any Jewish gauchos ride the range, and most of the land surrounding Moises Ville and other Argentine Jewish communities has been sold to non-Jews, and gentiles do the farming on land still owned by Jews. **********But nowhere is the legacy of the Jewish gaucho so deeply entrenched as it is  in Moises Ville, which still shuts down for Jewish holidays even though few residents celebrate them. The library is filled with volumes in Yiddish and Hebrew, and some elderly non-Jewish residents still remember prayers and blessings they learned as youths. **********\"Years after the last Jewish resident dies, the people of Moises Ville will still be eating gefilte fish and taking Yom Kippur as a holiday,\" said Pablo Trumper, 76, a retired schoolteacher whose grandfather was one of the original Jewish settlers. **********Omar del Beno, Moises Ville's first non-Jewish Mayor, said that although most residents are Roman Catholic, like a majority of Argentines, the town observes many Jewish cultural traditions because \"they are what we grew up with and have  become accustomed to.\" **********\"We are such a close-knit community that people here don't even think about what's Jewish and what isn't,\" Mr. del Beno said. \"We just live.\" **********While Argentina is well known for having opened its doors to Nazis after World War II, at the turn of the century it welcomed large numbers of Jews, who  formed colonies like Moises Ville in the interior of Argentina. **********Moises Ville was founded in 1889 by Russian Jews who were fleeing the pogroms. With the help of a French philanthropist, the Jewish colonists bought land in Santa Fe Province and named their new settlement \"town of Moses.\" **********Ana Weinstein, director of the Mark Turkow Center for Information and Documentation of Argentine Judaism, based in Buenos Aires, said that while gauchos taught the Jewish colonists how to survive in the wild and how to work the land, the settlers in turn introduced new crops like rice and sunflowers and Argentina's first farming cooperatives. **********\"Jews who founded Moises Ville and other agrarian colonies came from Russia and brought with them progressive socialist ideas that led them to establish agrarian cooperatives,\" Mrs. Weinstein said. \"These were different from the Israeli kibbutz because here people didn't share the earnings of production in equal parts.\" **********Instead, the colonists pooled their resources to buy seed and tools or to sell grain or cattle. But individuals earned according to their production, Mrs. Weinstein said. **********Moises Ville's cooperative caught the attention of neighboring communities. In the Moises Ville museum, there are letters from nearby towns seeking information about the cooperative. **********Today, Argentina has some 300,000 Jews, the largest population in Latin America. In recent years, after the bombing of Israeli Embassy and a Jewish cultural center in Buenos Aires, many Argentine Jews have started making annual  pilgrimages here to celebrate their roots. **********\"Coming here is like going to Israel except it's a lot less expensive and much closer to home,\" said Pablo Barenboim, a pharmaceutical salesman who drove  seven hours from Buenos Aires to visit the town's museum and historic buildings. \"I feel renewed and will definitely come back.\" **********Martha Levisman de Clusellas, a renowned architect whose grandparents were among the founders of Moises Ville, said the town has always provided her with a sense of relief and comfort from Argentina's big cities, where she said there is anti-Semitism. **********\"For me Moises Ville is a place where I go to heal myself,\" she said. \"It's like a treasure chest that once opened is unending because there is a part of us all in there.\" **********But as Moises Ville's Jewish population dwindles, many worry that the traditions will not be maintained. Dr. Juan Kazneietz, director of the hospital, said that most Jewish residents are over 50 and that there is about one Jewish birth in Moises Ville only every three or four months. **********\"Demographics are not on our side,\" Dr. Kazneietz said. **********Indeed, only one of the town's four synagogues is open, and it has not had a  full-time rabbi for years.

He also said the holding company had only drawn down a small part of the 135 billion-franc loan it had been given to buy Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais assets. **********Mr. Rouger dismissed fears that the sale of other Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais real-estate assets would cause an already depressed market to collapse. **********\"Clearly it didn't drag the market down, as nobody seems to have noticed that we were able to sell so many properties,\" he said. **********But analysts said Mr. Rouger may have been trying to put the best face possible on the real-estate portfolio and may have only been selling the holding company's choicest assets. **********\"I'm surprised and skeptical,\" said Daniel Oudin, a real-estate analyst at Massonnaud-Fontenay-Kervern. \"But if they've only sold 15 percent and these are their best assets, there still could be problems ahead.\" **********Regarding the sale of MGM, Mr. Rouger said the holding company would seek a deal that assured the studio of a \"long and fruitful life.\" **********According to U.S. law, Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais was supposed to dispose of the studio by 1997, but Mr. Rouger said that if a satisfactory deal were not struck by the fall of 1996, the holding company may seek to extend its ownership of the studio by pointing out to U.S. authorities that it, and not Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, is the current owner of the studio. **********Several potential bidders are said to be interested in purchasing MGM, which has had a string of successful films in the past year. Potential bidders include Polygram, Chargeurs, Canal Plus and a group led by Frank Mancuso, the studio's current chairman. **********According to published reports, the studio could be sold for as much as $2 billion, which would allow the holding company to come close to recouping the 12 billion francs Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais spent in acquiring and maintaining it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/08/business/dollar-gains-as-fears-fade-about-japanese-rate-increase.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-08-08", "snippet": "Dollar surges against Japanese yen (M)", "word_count": 367, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dollar Gains as Fears Fade About Japanese Rate Increase", "print_headline": "Dollar Gains as Fears Fade About Japanese Rate Increase", "body_text": " **********The dollar surged against the yen yesterday after the head of the Bank of Japan eased concern that Japan would soon raise interest rates. **********The governor of the Bank of Japan,  Yasuo Matsushita, said the bank would try to keep the country's interest rates at historic lows to foster an economic recovery.

So when Savina Mukacyibibi was beaten and strangled to death recently, it sent chills through the few Tutsi survivors left in this hilly commune of banana groves, coffee trees and neat brick houses. **********The killing was the first in Taba Commune since thousands of Hutu refugees, some of them war criminals, began pouring back into Rwanda from camps in Zaire in November. The local authorities say the killing was probably the work of Hutu militants who wanted to silence Mrs. Mukacyibibi, 50, and prevent her from identifying those who killed her husband and five children. **********The next day, Tutsi soldiers arrested five local Hutu men who had been at the social club with her before the killing. But the police acknowledge they have no hard evidence against the men. **********The killing of Mrs. Mukacyibibi and the arbitrary arrests afterward reflect an ugly reality of life in Rwanda as Hutu refugees begin to arrive home. Behind the facade of pastoral peace, there is an uneasy balance of terror in the countryside. **********Members of Rwanda's Tutsi minority say they are terrified Hutu militants will kill them, especially now that militiamen from the Hutu majority who carried out the mass killings of Tutsi in 1994 are drifting back home. Some Tutsi have abandoned their houses and are banding together in trading centers. **********''We fear tomorrow it could be us,'' said Steria Mukankusi, 60. ''We are very worried about the returnees.'' **********On the other side of the ethnic divide, Hutu people, who dominated the Government here for three decades before losing power to a Tutsi rebel army, say they are now living in what amounts to a police state. Hundreds of Hutu men have been hauled off in the night by Tutsi soldiers and locked up in overcrowded jails without ever facing their accusers or having a chance to defend themselves. Their wives are often left floundering in poverty. **********''Wherever a Hutu is, he thinks he's going to be thrown in prison,'' said Peragia Mukantabiera, whose husband was jailed in March. **********None of this bodes well for Rwanda's attempts to knit itself back together after the massacres of 1994, in which 500,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed by Hutu militiamen and soldiers. Hundreds of thousands of Hutu who fled the country after the Tutsi rebel army defeated the Hutu-led Government are coming home now, having been ejected from Zaire by Tutsi-led rebels and from Tanzania by Tanzanian troops. But they are entering a society polarized by fear and vengefulness. **********All along the dirt roads and paths of the Taba Commune, in its bars and stores and butcher shops, Hutu and Tutsi treat each other with brittle civility. But in private, many say the hatred that led to the events of 1994 has only deepened since the refugees began to return. Some say it is only a matter of time before that enmity will erupt again. **********''I am living with the Hutu and we talk when we are together,'' said Gatalina Mukafurere, a 53-year-old Tutsi woman whose husband and three children were slain. ''When you live with someone, you have to talk to them. But at night I start thinking about my family, thinking about how I'm living by myself, when I had a wonderful family, and that is when I start hating them. Myself, I think it's going to take a while before we have peace.'' **********Closed Community **********A Rolling Farmland Monitored by Spies **********Set in rolling hills of banana and coffee about 11 miles west of Rwanda's capital, Taba is a sprawling green and fertile agricultural community. Along its red-dirt roads, women in colorful kerchiefs shell piles of runner beans in front of small brick houses with tin roofs. Ground coffee, peas and cassava are spread on grass mats to dry in the bright sun. **********Rwandans do not live in the tightly clustered villages that dot much of Africa. Instead, they are fanned out across the countryside in hundreds of tiny farms, linked by dirt paths and gravel roads. **********Every inch of available land is cultivated, and each family enjoys a relatively private domain -- a house, a garden, a couple of acres of farmland. In some ways, the commune is an African version of American suburbia, with banana groves and beanfields replacing the lawns and pools. **********But despite its rustic character, the Taba Commune is meticulously organized, with a rigid hierarchy of state officials reaching down to every level. **********The commune is broken down into nine sectors, each headed by a councilor. The sectors are in turn broken down into dozens of cells, presided over by officials known as responsibles, who report up the line to the councilors and the Mayor. Each cell leader also employs a network of local volunteers to keep an eye on crime. **********Even in the most remote parts of the Taba Commune, a stranger is likely to be stopped and asked for his credentials by one of these so-called security officials, who then follow the intruder around and eavesdrop on his conversations. **********Today nothing can be done in a commune without permission from the Mayor's office, which has a garrison of Tutsi soldiers to enforce its edicts. **********Sometimes this insistence on following rules can reach a Kafkaesque absurdity. A journalist to whom Mayor Ephrem Karangwa had given blanket permission to work in the commune was hustled off by security officials when he tried to listen to a public speech on the massacres that Mayor Karangwa gave in one of the sectors. The reason, Mr. Karangwa explained, was that the journalist had not sought specific permission in advance to cover the speech and consequently was not authorized to be there. **********It was this extensive hierarchical system of control, when it was in the hands of militant Hutu politicians in 1994, that made the genocide possible in the first place, historians say. **********At Taba the former Mayor, Jean-Paul Akayesu, mobilized the entire system to hunt down Tutsi and kill them, witnesses and prosecutors say. At least 5,000 Tutsi and Hutu moderates who advocated racial tolerance and democracy were hacked and bludgeoned to death in Taba in 1994. More than 2,000 died right outside the commune headquarters, where they had come to seek protection. **********One Victim's Story **********A Genocide Survivor Marked for Death **********By all accounts, Mrs. Mukacyibibi was a peaceful woman who had never done much to antagonize her neighbors. Though she had lived through the horrors of the genocide and lost her husband and five children in the massacres, the police say she never came to them to accuse the killers. **********When the war ended in 1994, she kept to herself and went back to running her husband's farm, a few acres of banana trees and runner beans on a hillside in Murehe, about four miles from the commune headquarters. **********It was not an easy place for a lone Tutsi woman to live, recalled her last living son, Emmanuel Yakaremye. She was surrounded by Hutu neighbors, and the countryside grew wild just beyond her place, plunging into a deep ravine and rising in rugged hills on the other side. Hutu militiamen were believed to be hiding in those hills, Mr. Yakaremye said. **********''They killed her for the land,'' he said. ''Nothing else.'' **********On Dec. 3, Mrs. Mukacyibibi accepted an invitation from some Hutu neighbors to have a cup of banana beer at a local social club. She left the club a few minutes before 7 P.M. The next morning, she was discovered beaten and strangled to death in a cornfield just 60 yards from the club's door. **********The five men who were taken into custody were arrested because they all had been in the bar the night of the murder, the police said. Though there was not a scrap of evidence against them, they were marched single-file to the commune headquarters and thrown into the overcrowded jail. **********Emmanuel Tuisenge, the 23-year-old investigator for the commune, said the arrests were necessary to pressure the men to turn in whoever is responsible. He thinks the Hutu in the neighborhood know the answer, but none have come forward. **********Two days after Mrs. Mukacyibibi was killed, several of her neighbors brought food and fresh fruit to her son, Mr. Yakaremye. He received them in his mother's cramped brick house. The day before, he had buried his mother in a banana grove near the back door. **********The neighbors were all Hutu, and Mr. Yakaremye said he did not feel comfortable with them, but he accepted the food anyway and ate it in silence. It would have been impolite not to, he said. ''I don't trust them,'' he said. ''They don't trust me.'' **********He added he has decided to give up on the family farm and move to the capital, Kigali, to find a job, perhaps as a taxi driver. He said he cannot live cope with the fear anymore. ''I can't keep living here,'' he said. ''I can't survive like this.'' **********On almost any road or path in Murehe, it is hard to find a Hutu family who does not have at least one member in jail. There are about 920 men in the local lock-up at the commune headquarters alone, not to mention hundreds of local residents who have been sent to regional prisons. **********''The problem we have now is that so many people have their husbands in jail,'' said Virpa Mukanzigiye, who runs a general store in Murehe. Her husband was arrested in September 1995. ''They came and they just took him. They didn't ask him anything. I haven't seen him since.'' **********Most of the wives of the arrested men in Murehe blame their Tutsi neighbors for their troubles. ''The survivors are in good hands,'' said Marigarita Nyirabarera, a resident of Murehe who claims a Tutsi neighbor was behind her husband's detention 10 months ago. ''Whatever they say the Government believes them, and if they point a finger at someone, that person will be beaten and taken away to jail before they even prove what they did.'' **********Many of the women left alone are having trouble making ends meet. Some are living in abject poverty, hiring themselves out as day laborers to farmers. **********Every afternoon, they must walk three miles to the commune headquarters to bring food and water to their husbands in jail. **********Unlike some communes, the Hutu refugees who have recently returned from Zaire have had no trouble finding housing. Most found their farms neglected but unoccupied. Still many are now walking on eggshells because of the mass arrests. A few men even avoid going out during the day. **********So far, the authorities have been restrained. Despite receiving more than 20 complaints from survivors, the Taba police have only arrested six returnees. One is an influential former member of Parliament, Cyrille Ruvugama, who prosecutors say was one of the architects of the massacre in the commune. **********Still, young men who have come back from the camps say they are looking over their shoulders all the time, waiting for the Government to come after them. **********''Maybe if there is a political change in the future, I will be comfortable, but not now,'' said Protazi Ntamaganyiro, 19, who returned  recently. ''I eat. I sleep. I wake up in the morning. I don't know what's going to happen the next day.'' **********Intimidated Witnesses **********Known Killers Walk Among the Returnees **********For survivors of the genocide, the trickle of returning refugees is a terrifying event. Several Tutsi residents say they have spotted people in recent weeks who they know took part in the massacres but have been afraid to report them. **********''I'm scared,'' said Beatrice Musabyeo, 24, a Tutsi woman in Murehe who says she saw two former militiamen on the street the other day. ''I think someone is going to come and knock on my door and kill me. A lot of the returnees were involved. There are even some soldiers who left before and are now coming back.'' **********The fear of the militia's return is so great that many Tutsi in Taba have abandoned their farms and moved into empty houses at a trading center called Gachuragengi, less than two miles from the commune headquarters. There are about 270 Tutsi people living in the center, the vast majority of them women with children. They till their land only during daylight and then flee back to the trading center at night. **********Speciose Mukarugambwa, a 39-year-old mother who heads a survivor's association at the center, said she decided to move because living among other Tutsi provided some protection. During the genocide, she said, her husband was killed and she was beaten and left for dead in a mass grave. This month she thought she saw one of the men who killed her husband, coming back from Zaire with a bundle on his head. **********''When I saw him, my hair stood on end,'' she said. ''I was so afraid. I couldn't believe my eyes. I wasn't sure if it was him or not.'' **********''I think justice must be done soon,'' she added. ''They have to be punished. If you are not going to punish them, the genocide will happen again. They will be able to continue this genocide ideology.'' **********Daring to Speak **********Making Accusations Brings New Risks **********Speaking out against the killers has made life even more dangerous for people like Beatrice Nyirasengimana, a Hutu who was married to Mrs. Mukacyibibi's brother. Though Mrs. Nyirasengimana is a Hutu, her Tutsi husband and five children were killed during the massacre and thrown in a latrine. **********Mrs. Nyirasengimana has denounced Hutu members of her own family to the Tutsi police, including one of her other brothers-in-law as one of the killers. As a result, she says she has been ostracized by her parents and her life has been threatened on at least two occasions. ''They want to kill the survivors before the trials start,'' she said. **********While a few Hutu like Mrs. Nyirasengimana are brave enough to speak out, most people in Taba never talk openly about the killings. **********Teachers in the Murehe school say they steer away from the massacres in class and never raise the issue of ethnic rivalry. One reason is there are so few Tutsi students; another is a deep-seeded reluctance among Rwandans to discuss unpleasant topics. **********''I try to avoid the topic,'' said Emerita Mukagihana, a 30-year-old teacher. ''I have no way to start talking about it. When you start talking about it, the kids think you are bringing back what happened in the past.'' **********The silence is all the more remarkable because many students are still suffering mental and social problems stemming from the violence. Absenteeism is very high. Dozens of Hutu children have fathers in jail and have dropped out because they can no longer afford the school fees. Some Tutsi children have also dropped out, apparently fearing harassment from Hutu children. **********Still, the teachers say they want to wait until more time passes before they begin addressing the issue. ''There is nothing new we can teach these kids about the genocide,'' one teacher, Martin Munyankindi, said. ''They saw it all. Everything happened in front of their eyes. All we can do is wait until they become more stable, then try to teach them what was evil about it.'' **********On a recent afternoon, the jail at the commune headquarters was overflowing with desperate people, mostly sullen Hutu who peered through the window bars with worried eyes. **********The men said they had no idea what they were charged with. They maintained that they were innocent of any crimes and insisted that they were the victims of fabricated evidence, vengeful police or false confessions coerced by torture. **********''I came home from the bar one night and they just arrested me,'' said Savare Zabamwita, a 28-year-old from Murehe who has been in jail since September 1995. ''They still haven't told me the charges. They just put you in prison. They don't ask you what happened.'' **********Among the inmates here are several former police investigators, teachers, school inspectors, and other civil servants. The Government asserts that they are all killers, but they maintain they have been arrested simply because they are Hutu who worked in the previous Government. They point out that the people in charge in the commune headquarters across a parking lot from their cells are all Tutsi now. **********It is not clear how many of the people in the Taba jail are guilty. No trials have been held yet, and most of the arrests are made on the basis of a single accusation. Often the investigation is cursory at best, since the police are stretched thin. Still, there are undoubtedly some in jail who deserve to be there, United Nations human rights investigators say. Tens of thousands took part in the massacres. **********One man prosecutors say is probably not innocent is Cyrille Ruvugama, the former member of Parliament. Prosecutors and survivors say Mr. Ruvugama and the former Mayor, Jean-Paul Akayesu orchestrated and personally oversaw the killings in Taba. **********Like everyone else in the jail, Mr. Ruvugama denies the charges. He says he did nothing but attend a meeting the morning the massacres started. Mr. Akayesu held the meeting, he maintains, to call for peace, not to urge Hutu to kill Tutsi. His account contradicts the accounts of dozens of witnesses who were at the meeting. **********''I am innocent,'' he said, his eyes narrowing, his hand stroking his chin. ''I didn't take any part in what happened. I am accused just because I attended a meeting called by the mayor.'' **********Mr. Ruvugama, who is facing the death penalty if convicted, warned that the new Government's policy of arrests would backfire. A Hutu uprising is inevitable if the Government does not do more to share power, he said. **********''As far as I can see, this Government has a long-term program of politics to intimidate the Hutu and, little by little, to make sure they have no say, no power,'' he said. **********Denying the Past **********A Church Service With No Repentance **********On the Sunday after Mrs. Mukacyibibi's death, the main church in Murehe was filled with joyous song. About 700 people crowded into the Mwirute Presbyterian Church, only half a mile from where the body was found. **********For two and a half hours, the churchgoers danced and clapped to music from three separate gospel choirs. Accompanied with homemade rattles and guitars, they prayed and sang about the glory of God, their reedy voices rising in harmony. They acted out a pantomime of the Last Judgment, holding a baby aloft as a symbol of Jesus, or perhaps a symbol of their own lost innocence. **********Mrs. Mukacyibibi's name was never mentioned during the service. **********The pastor, Alphonse Munyakazi, said later he believed it would have done no good to bring up the murder. Instead, he chose to read a section of Romans I, urging people to stop making war against one another. He also brought in a pastor from another commune, who delivered a scathing sermon aimed at people who took part in the killing. **********''God is very angry about what happened here,'' the visiting pastor, Eriel Karangwa, railed. ''People who did the killing are the people who need the Bible. People cannot forget it. People cannot forgive it.'' **********''There are many among us here who think they are very clever,'' he went on. ''They pretend to be innocent. What if God does the same thing to us, gets very angry and does the same thing we did.'' **********There were no tears after the sermon. Most people stared placidly up at the visiting pastor and then went on to the next hymn in the book. **********Later, when it was time for churchgoers to repent their sins before the congregation, only two small boys came forward. One said that he had been disrespectful to his parents and had beaten up his brother. The second said he had thrown rocks at some elderly people. **********There were a few Tutsi in the congregation, but they were lost in the sea of Hutu worshipers. Many Tutsi no longer attend church, since many of Rwanda's clergymen, especially Roman Catholic priests, collaborated with the former Government during the killings. **********Later, when the service was over, Pastor Munyakazi said he often looks out over his congregation and wonders who is guilty and who is innocent. **********''I feel very bad that some of the killers are in this church, but I can't say so and so did this or that -- I don't who did what,'' he said. ''God cannot forgive them before they repent. All they have to do is come in front of all of us in the church and seek forgiveness in front of God.

But for people who own telephone calling cards from AT&T, this new era is starting not with a bang, but a busy signal. **********Over the last three months, thousands of cardholders from New York City to Oklahoma City have been unable to place local or toll calls using their AT&T calling cards. The reason: The AT&T Corporation has been dissolving agreements with the regional Bell operating companies and the GTE Corporation that provided for these companies to carry some of AT&T's calls over their local networks. **********Now, if you place a call from Manhattan to Westchester County using an AT&T card, you are referred to a Nynex operator who informs you that ''AT&T no longer allows its cardholders to use the Nynex network.'' To complete the call, you must dial an 11-digit prefix, 1-800-CALL-ATT, which transfers the call from the Nynex Corporation's wires to AT&T's wires. **********It is all part of the untrammeled competition introduced by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Under the old rules, AT&T was not permitted to carry local or toll calls. So it agreed to transfer those calls to the Baby Bells and GTE. Now AT&T can compete for these calls -- if cardholders dial the magic 11-digit access code. **********Such fine distinctions may not matter to the harried businessman who suddenly finds he can no longer call home from a distant airport. Industry executives admit that the chaos over calling cards illustrates the dark side of what was supposed to be a consumer-friendly law. **********''This just makes life more confusing in a world that's confusing enough,'' Eric Rabe, a spokesman for the Bell Atlantic Corporation, said. **********Even officials at the Federal Communications Commission, which has championed telephone competition, acknowledged the problem. ''There's going to be a lot of confusion over things like this,'' Mary Beth Richards, the deputy chief of the F.C.C.'s Common Carrier Bureau, said. ''But the benefits of competition outweigh the confusion.'' **********As in most telephone skirmishes, this battle pits the seven Baby Bells and GTE against their familiar nemesis, AT&T. Mr. Rabe and executives at other Baby Bells said that AT&T asked them to block local calls and short-haul long-distance, or toll, calls made by AT&T cardholders. **********AT&T's rationale was logical: Why should it pay the Baby Bells for calls that it could legally carry itself? The trouble, according to the Bells, occurred when AT&T allowed its customers to believe that the Bells had blocked the calls. **********In the days after AT&T's ''mutual card-honoring'' agreement with Nynex expired in April, AT&T even ran commercials implying that Nynex was blocking the calls of AT&T cardholders, according to Gary Scarano, the product director of Nynex's calling-card division. **********That prompted Nynex to file a complaint with the F.C.C., in which it coined a new word to describe AT&T's action: jamming. Mr. Scarano said that ''jamming'' was a variation on ''slamming,'' the industry's slang for the illegal practice in which a long-distance carrier switches a customer's service without his knowledge or consent. **********''Jamming means they block the call, then blame us, and then blur the line about who was carrying the call,'' Mr. Scarano said. **********For its part, AT&T denied that it had misled customers. ''At no time were we trying to imply, or did we imply, that the Baby Bells made the decision,'' Kelly Statmore, a spokeswoman for AT&T, said. **********Ms. Statmore said AT&T's advertising merely educated customers about the benefits of the access code -- namely, that the cardholder's call would travel exclusively on AT&T's reliable network. This reduces the danger of a call being routed to another long-distance carrier -- which could charge higher rates -- without the caller's knowledge. **********Ms. Statmore said this situation often occurred when an AT&T cardholder made a call from a pay phone leased by another long-distance carrier. **********AT&T, which has issued about 80 million corporate and consumer cards, has been introducing its new card policy in a wave across the United States. Starting with Nynex in April, it has dissolved agreements with Bell Atlantic, GTE, the Ameritech Corporation, and last Friday, with SBC Communications Inc. In November, AT&T plans to cancel its agreement with the BellSouth Corporation. And it expects to complete the process with the Pacific Telesis Group early next year. **********Though AT&T's policy has provoked testy responses from the Baby Bells -- which are, after all, losing a stream of revenue -- the companies have responded with various marketing strategies. **********Ameritech, which serves five states in the Great Lakes region, has told its customers that its card was easier to use than AT&T's. To place a local, toll, or long-distance call with Ameritech's card, one has only to dial ''0'' plus the number. **********''It's not good customer service to make life harder for your customers,'' Thomas Hester, the general counsel of Ameritech, said. **********Ameritech is not simply being altruistic. Under the new telecommunications law, the Baby Bells cannot carry long-distance calls until the long-distance carriers begin competing in the local market. So Ameritech and most of the Bells still must use AT&T or another carrier for long-distance calls by their cardholders. **********But Nynex has added a twist. The company recently came up with its own 11-digit access code. Now, a Nynex cardholder can either dial ''0'' plus the number, or 1-800-54-NYNEX. Dialing the access code insures that a cardholder's long-distance call will be carried over the Sprint Corporation's network, rather than AT&T's. **********Nynex has been promoting the access code in radio ads with the tag line ''Card 54,'' a none-too-subtle play on the vintage television series, ''Car 54, Where Are You?'' Like AT&T, Nynex has been trying to reassure cardholders who feared that their long-distance calls might be routed to an unauthorized carrier. **********Calling-card fraud and 11-digit prefixes are not the only complications that flow from open competition. AT&T also recently stopped tucking its monthly service bills into the same envelopes that carry the local phone bills. AT&T promised its new bills will be more informative, but for customers, it just means more paper. **********Given all this, Ms. Richards of the F.C.C. conceded that some people may yearn for the days of regulation. But she contended that prices for calling-card services will drop as the competition escalates. **********Bradley Stillman, the director of telecommunications policy at the Consumer Federation of America, puts it another way: ''Choice is more difficult than monopoly, but the benefits are greater.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/22/business/british-petroleum-in-china-venture.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-10-22", "snippet": "British Petroleum Co and Shanghai Petrochemical Co agree to form $2.5 billion joint venture to build ethylene plant in Shanghai (S)", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Petroleum In China Venture", "print_headline": "British Petroleum In China Venture", "body_text": " **********The British Petroleum Company  and the Shanghai Petrochemical Company have agreed to form a $2.5 billion joint venture to build an ethylene plant in Shanghai, the companies said yesterday.

They have painted \"House of the People\" on the imposing wooden doors, but they still find themselves ogling such luxuries as the artificial lake just inside the gates and the mounted bison head on the warehouse wall. **********The only thing that one can feel is embittered,\" said Guillermo Noriega Garcia, 56, a farmer who took part in the assault on the 20-acre estate that stands in the middle of parched subsistence farms. \"How can it be that one man has everything and others don't even have water?\" **********The episode is just one sign of how the current economic crisis has deepened  already serious divisions in Mexico. It has exaggerated the gap not only between rich and poor, but also between the industrialized north and the rural south, between Spanish-speaking Mexicans and the 10 million who are Indians and between those whose lives are increasingly tied to the United States economy and those who are entirely dependent on the fortunes of Mexico. **********The degree of income disparity in Mexico is among the worst in the world and  is steadily growing more extreme. Excluding African countries, Mexico has the largest gap between rich and poor of all but six nations in the world, United Nations and World Bank figures show. **********Today the richest 10 percent of Mexicans earn 41 percent of the country's income, while the bottom half of the population receives only 16 percent of all  national income. The Government admits that the number of Mexicans living in extreme poverty has grown to 22 million, an increase over the last 15 months of  5 million people. **********The growing gap has given rise to many clashes and to startling contrasts throughout Mexico. On the outskirts of the wealthy northern city of Monterrey, residents of a shantytown recently stopped a freight train in the dead of night. Officials say the train was disabled when it slowed down to go through the area. When word got out that the train carried tons of corn, whole families rushed out to fill pots and sacks full of grain. **********On the other hand, as the Mexican market for bargain-priced Volkswagen Beetles dried up in 1995, Mercedes-Benz sales actually rose. This year, as the worst economic crisis in 60 years continues, the car maker is on target to sell  50 percent more cars in Mexico than last year. **********A few large Mexican companies benefited handsomely when Mexico entered the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 and when the devaluation of the peso in December of that year made Mexican exports cheaper. But business leaders say 17,000 companies have folded since the crisis began. While a second Gucci boutique recently opened in the swank Polanco section of Mexico City, a United Nations report said the number of children who live and work on the streets of the capital has doubled in three years. **********The polarization between classes in Mexico is a \"historic problem that is always present but never resolved,\" the historian Lorenzo Meyer wrote. Mexico now faces severe political and economic problems, but the most serious crisis, he wrote, \"is the enormous distance and antagonism between the classes and groups that form the Mexican social fabric.\" **********One factor aggravating the tensions is the insistence by the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo, like the Governments of his two predecessors, on pursuing an economic policy of privatizations, free markets and integration into the global economy. Such a policy is endorsed by the United States and the International Monetary Fund, but it has failed to raise the standard of living for most Mexicans. **********Big gains in real wages and economic growth from 1963 to 1984 were wiped out  as the previous two presidents religiously followed their open-market policies.  Real wages today are below what they were in 1981. The debacle of Mr. Zedillo's first 18 months in office only worsens that record. **********Criticism of the economic model is widespread. \"An absolute and total disaster,\" said Vicente Fox, an opposition-party Governor from the central state of Guanajuato. Even Mr. Zedillo has called for a public debate about Mexico's economic direction. **********But alternatives are scarce. Beyond some technical tinkering, the only consensus so far has been that the economic modernization of Mexico should be more humane -- which in most cases means more direct Government intervention to  help small- and medium-sized manufacturers stand up to the competition. **********Although the class gap in Mexico has deepened, the political scientist Jorge  G. Castaneda believes that there is little danger of social conflict. The reason is the substantial and growing number of Mexicans whose lives are tied to the United States economy. **********Those Mexicans, Mr. Castaneda says, include both rich exporters and the poor  farmhands who cross the border and send home their earnings. What they have in common is dependence on the American economy, which buffers the shocks of Mexico's economic problems. **********\"A nationwide social explosion, such as the Revolution of 1910, is virtually  impossible while such a large, regionally well-distributed, broadly based segment of the population is thriving,\" Mr. Castaneda wrote recently in Foreign  Affairs magazine. **********Others believe that the danger of a spark to set off social revolt is actually much greater. Manuel Camacho Solis, the former Mayor of Mexico City who broke ranks with the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party and is now part of a developing alternative political force, said in an interview that recent polls showed 22 percent of the capital's residents believe that violence is justified to correct social imbalances -- a figure far higher than at any time in the last decade. Recently, public schoolteachers demanding a living wage paralyzed the city with demonstrations that at times turned violent. **********\"It doesn't take 50 percent of the population to make the country ungovernable,\" Mr. Camacho said. \"If just 5 percent take to the streets, that could be enough.\" **********It was a comparatively small band of guerrillas in Chiapas who in January 1994 shocked Mexico with an insurrection that is still not resolved. And in June, as few as 50 masked men, and perhaps a few women, declared themselves another revolutionary army. That was enough to send shivers down the spines of many Government officials. **********Recent incidents have worried many in Mexico because they seem to reflect a loss of respect for the rule of law and a frightening lack of Government control. The train robbery near Monterrey was reminiscent of the 1910 Revolution, when peasants routinely assaulted trains. **********But in the modern version, the attackers included children and housewives like Argelia Espinosa, who was almost arrested for trying to bring home a bushel of corn. \"We would have milled the corn and used it to make tamales and tortillas,\" said the 37-year-old woman, whose husband, Alberto, was arrested with a sack full of corn on his shoulder. \"It wouldn't have gone to waste.\" **********For the Rev. Rodolfo Reyes, a local priest, the assault was a manifestation of Mexico's smoldering economic and social crisis. \"I see it as a sign that says 'Hey, be careful,' \" he said. **********In June, in a similar episode, a train full of wheat was sacked in the state  of Durango. **********The assault on the Tepoztlan mansion roused fears that have haunted wealthy Mexicans since the Revolution, when peasants banged on the doors of big haciendas demanding the return of the land to the people. **********The mansion, called La Quinta Piedra, is owned by Guillermo de Jesus Occelli, the brother-in-law of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Mr. Occelli says he bought the 20 acres legitimately. But for the last five years, local people have insisted that the transactions were fraudulent and that the land, like much of the land in Mexico since the Revolution, belongs to the community. **********This is an old battle here, where Emiliano Zapata began his struggle for liberty and land at the beginning of this century. **********The peasants here finally decided this year that they had had enough. After meeting in a general assembly on May 12, they made their way to the huge front gate of the Occelli estate, peasant leaders said. Inside, the family was enjoying a Sunday brunch. Some peasants banged on the door with machetes. One may even have tried to start a fire, a newspaper account said. **********The gates eventually lumbered open, and the family and guests rushed off, peasant leaders said. For the first time, local peasants passed through the great doors and gawked at the splendor they had until then only imagined. People who lived four or six to a room wandered wide-eyed through the house and past a  dining room table large enough to accommodate a dozen people. Peasants who rely  on water from a tanker truck during the dry season stared at the hotel-sized pool and the fountains that seemed capriciously to splash water everywhere. **********The peasants say they now have a list of other property holders in the area who, they contend, also bought land illegally. What happened at La Quinta Piedra ought to be taken as a warning, they say. What started as a land dispute has turned into an open struggle between rich and poor. **********\"We tried to talk to the rich people, but they never paid attention to us,\" said Nicanor Demesa Ortiz, who took part in the takeover. \"But what we did here  was to show that no one, no matter how powerful or influential, is immune to the power of the people or to what is right.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/21/world/russia-says-170-chechens-died-in-attack-on-main-rebel-town.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "1996-02-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 569, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Russia Says 170 Chechens Died in Attack on Main Rebel Town", "print_headline": "Russia Says 170 Chechens Died in Attack on Main Rebel Town", "body_text": " **********In a move that raised new questions about President Boris N.

It has also become an increasing financial burden, spurring resentment from coal miners and other disgruntled workers, who  have seen their wages delayed for months. **********Just last month, for example, Mr. Yeltsin promised to spend $3.4 billion to rebuild the battle-damaged region. Along with other costly pre-election promises, that pledge has cast doubt on the Government's commitment to economic  discipline. **********Reflecting the budget squeeze, the financially pressed Government is now seeking a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, according to Sergei Dubinin, the head of the Central Bank.

The managing director of the fund, Michael Camdessus, is scheduled to begin a series of top-level meetings here on Wednesday. **********Acknowledging that a resolution of the conflict is vital to his chances for re-election in June, Mr. Yeltsin has assigned his loyal Prime Minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, and an adviser, Emil Pain, to head separate commissions to produce a peace plan.

So, in crisp, colonial  fashion, the Nationalists, their few possessions and their red, blue and white flags were shipped off to a barren hillside overlooking Junk Bay, a glittering inlet where the failed flour magnate A. H. Rennie drowned himself in 1906. The place became known as Rennie's Mill. **********\"There were never any people here,\" said Hsia Chiang-yun, a cramped twig of a man whose 79 years have gnarled his limbs but not his memory. \"When we came here, we just had tents.

In addition to conventional elements like television commercials and print advertisements, the campaign, created by the Arnell Group in New York, also features tie-ins between Hanes and the Virgin Records label of the EMI Group. **********Those tie-ins, timed to coincide with the release of Ms. Turner's album ''Wildest Dreams,'' include offering hosiery to buyers of the album and albums to buyers of the hosiery. **********Hanes will also sponsor the American leg (as it were) of Ms. Turner's concert tour in support of ''Wildest Dreams,'' which made its debut last week on the charts at No. 61. About the only step not being taken is asking Ms. Turner to re-record one of her biggest hits as ''What's Legs Got to Do With It.'' **********''It's synergies, synergies, synergies,'' said Peter Arnell, chairman at the Arnell Group, which was awarded the Hanes account in November, ''leveraging all toward one big strategic objective.'' **********''Advertising today has a role to be entertainment,'' he added. ''If we're selling hosiery, it should be fun. And music is a great way to express the beat, the mood, the tempo of what's going on.'' Indeed, the commercials, which begin running this week, take place as Ms. Turner shoots a music video clip for ''Missing You,'' the first single from ''Wildest Dreams.'' **********The Hanes hosiery campaign is indicative of efforts by some marketers to link themselves with celebrity endorsers who have rational, as well as emotional, connections with the products they peddle. Mr. Arnell, in fact, said the goal was a pitch ''not unlike Michael Jordan's for Nike.'' **********Another example is Sears, Roebuck & Company's hiring of Bob Vila, the home-repair specialist, to promote brands like Craftsman tools. And the M&M/Mars unit of Mars Inc. began a campaign for Snickers candy featuring Ken Caminiti, the popular third baseman for the San Diego Padres, only after he ate a Snickers bar before a game against the New York Mets last month -- and then hit two home runs. **********''It's not just going out to get a celebrity; this one makes sense,'' said Cathy Volker, president and chief executive at Sara Lee Hosiery in Winston-Salem, N.C., who was also recently named a vice president of the hosiery unit's parent, the Sara Lee Corporation. **********''We had done a survey asking women and men to tell us who they think of when they think of legs,'' she added, ''and the No. 1 response was Tina Turner. And when we spoke about getting Tina Turner as a spokeswoman, every single person said, 'Of course; why didn't anyone do this before?' It made us feel stupid for not doing it sooner.'' **********Ms. Volker called Ms. Turner ''a woman who epitomizes strength and beauty, and appeals to my 19-year-old niece as well as my 70-year-old mother. That's pretty cool.'' **********''We've been viewed possibly as a little stuffy,'' Ms. Volker said, referring to the Hanes brand image. ''It's fascinating we've been able to get a 56-year-old spokesperson who contemporizes us.'' **********Another task Ms. Turner is to tackle is to help ''bring together all the hosiery brands under the Hanes umbrella,'' Ms. Volker said, which are sold in department and specialty stores; their lower-priced siblings, bearing the L'Eggs name, are sold in discount stores and drugstores. **********''The Hanes brands had become somewhat fragmented into a group of subbrands,'' Ms. Volker said. ''Tina Turner is a superstar with the stature to handle the whole umbrella campaign.'' (Coincidentally, L'eggs has also introduced a spokeswoman, the actress Jamie Lee Curtis, in a broadcast and print campaign by the Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising unit of Cordiant P.L.C. in New York.) **********Ms. Turner's appeal has led to a decision to run the print part of the campaign in magazines that do not usually carry Hanes hosiery ads, Ms. Volker said, like Entertainment Weekly, Interview, Premiere and Rolling Stone, as well as in traditional titles like Elle, Harper's Bazaar and Vogue. The commercials will appear on broadcast, cable and syndicated series like ''Baywatch,'' ''Best of 'American Bandstand,' '' ''Inside Edition,'' ''Murphy Brown,'' ''Seinfeld'' and ''Silk Stalkings.'' **********Though Ms. Volker declined to discuss Ms. Turner's fee other than describing it as ''significant,'' she said there were ''options to extend the contract'' beyond its initial two-year term. **********Since signing Ms. Turner, she added, ''we've been getting calls from managers of other celebrities telling us they'd be interested in a similar campaign.'' Ms. Volker would identify the other celebrities only as ''big names.'' **********Actually, there may be only one star who stands as tall as Ms. Turner and on legs as stunningly shown off.

Christopher to visit here in less than two weeks, the promise to further restrict China's market from American exporters seemed timed to draw maximum attention. Mr. Christopher plans to leave office soon, and his successor appears likely to face a growing number of trade disputes with China. **********American textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks will be affected by the ban, effective Dec. 10, according to an announcement by China's Foreign Trade Ministry and customs office. **********A specific list of the affected items will be drawn up by then, said the trade authorities, who did not estimate how much trade would be affected or say how long the ban would last. ''The decision was made in response to the U.S. unilateral cut of import quotas of Chinese textiles,'' said the announcement, carried by the New China News Agency, referring to a move by Washington in September. **********Washington and Beijing have battled for years over how to count Chinese textile exports to the United States, but the problem has grown stickier in recent months as China has emerged as the country with the biggest trading surplus in American markets, expected to exceed $30 billion by the end of the year. **********On Sept. 6, Washington levied a $19 million penalty on China, saying Beijing had tried to evade textile quotas by transshipping goods through third countries, where garments are sometimes labeled to disguise their origin. American officials said they had detected repeated violations of a 1994 United States-China trade accord. **********Today, Chinese trade officials accused Washington of acting before it had fully consulted them and of acting without clear evidence, itself a violation of the bilateral textile agreement. **********''We wish to urge the United States to handle trade disputes in the spirit of advancing bilateral trade and refrain from taking any actions harmful to bilateral trade in the future,'' the announcement said. It added that China ''opposes any practice intended to impose the will of one side on others in trade dealings.'' **********Beijing and Washington narrowly avoided a trade war in June, when a dispute over how to enforce copyright protection of American music, computer software and movies threatened to provoke sanctions in each direction that would have totaled $2 billion. **********The dispute over textiles looks minor and symbolic in comparison, with China expected to target American imports worth about the same as the $19 million worth of goods excluded by Washington. Yet an American official said there was a danger that China's reaction would provoke retaliation from Washington. **********''We're probably going to have to respond with something else,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''You're never sure where it will lead.'' **********The official said the trade dispute would certainly be on Mr. Christopher's agenda when he visited Beijing and Shanghai this month. **********China's exports are increasing sharply, as it produces toys and footwear and clothing that American consumers want, and are expected to push up China's trade surplus with the United States by more than 10 percent this year. **********On top of political differences over Taiwan and human rights, trade disputes make China a popular target in Congress."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/12/business/fed-report-finds-growth-still-modest.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1996-09-12", "snippet": "Federal Reserve Board reports wages are rising as economy across most of nation continues to grow at moderate pace; sees little evidence yet of inflation taking root; report, based on survey of businesses by 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, is l...", "word_count": 782, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fed Report Finds Growth Still Modest", "print_headline": "Fed Report Finds Growth Still Modest", "body_text": " **********Wages are rising as the economy across most of the nation continues to grow at a moderate pace, but there is little evidence yet of inflation taking root, the Federal Reserve Board reported today. **********The report, based on a survey of businesses by the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, was the latest to suggest that the economy remained finely balanced between a sustainable expansion and the onset of inflation. **********Although many economists still believe the Federal Reserve will nudge up interest rates when its policy-making body meets on Sept. 24, they said today's report did not provide the Fed with the unambiguous case for tightening monetary policy that it would like to have before raising rates, especially in the midst of a Presidential campaign. **********Signs of inflation ''were varied and generally inconclusive, although there appears to be greater upward pressure on wages than on prices,'' the Fed report said. ''Business activity in most districts is reported to be good and expanding moderately.'' **********Fed officials have indicated over the last week that while they are on heightened inflation alert, they are still uncertain whether the economy is slowing fast enough from its torrid pace in the first half to avert a destabilizing wage-price spiral. **********Both inside and outside the Fed, those economists who think the economy will keep growing at a strong pace see a substantial risk of inflation. Those who see the economy slowing, view inflation as less of a threat despite the low 5.1 percent unemployment rate and upward pressure on wages. **********After falling early in the day on fears that the Fed report, known as the beige book, would show rising inflationary pressures, the bond market bounced back when the report was made public, with the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ending the day about unchanged, at 7.11 percent. **********The Fed's stance since July has been to lean toward a tightening, and inflation hawks on the Fed's policy-making body have been agitating for a rate increase for several months, arguing that the time to move is before inflation infects the economy. Many economists think the Fed is likely to raise its Federal funds target rate by a quarter-point this month, to 5.5 percent. A rate increase would reverse a series of three cuts that began 14 months ago. The Fed's last move was to cut the Federal funds rate by a quarter-point on Jan. 31. **********''We continue to pick up early-warning signs on the inflation front coming through loud and clear in labor market conditions and rising wages,'' said Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley, who forecasts a continued strong growth rate of 3 percent for the second half. ''A failure to move at this juncture, with the unemployment rate as low as it is, and with the economy growing well in excess of the inflation-stable growth rate, would really be irresponsible on the Fed's part.'' **********The beige book is based on anecdotal reports from businesses replying to inquiries from researchers at the Federal Reserve Banks. **********''Reports of substantial price increases were notably absent'' from many areas of the country, the Fed said. In the regions around New York, Boston, Cleveland and Kansas City, consumer prices were reported to be stable or increasing only slightly. There were some price increases in industrial commodities, but they tended to be restricted to a few markets, the report said. Lumber prices, for example, were higher in the regions around Boston, Richmond, Dallas and Chicago. **********''Wage gains have tended to outstrip price increases, however,'' the report said. In Boston, wage and salary increases were running at 2 to 4 percent, while in Cleveland the increase was 2 to 3 percent. **********Companies normally try to pass on the cost of wage increases to consumers of their products through price increases. But intense competition has made it hard for companies to raise prices, forcing them to absorb higher wage rates by improving productivity or biting into their profits. The Clinton Administration's economists have been arguing that since corporate profits are robust, companies have plenty of leeway to absorb rising wages without spurring inflation. A number of outside economists dispute that contention. **********The report showed few signs that the economy was cooling off as rapidly as the Fed had expected in July when it forecast a growth rate for the full year of 2.6 percent. The economy grew at a 3.4 percent rate in the first half, and would have to slow to a rate of 1.8 percent in the second half to match the Fed's forecast. **********Today's report said the economy was expanding ''moderately'' in most places, with two exceptions being California and the Far West, where growth was characterized as strong, and in the St. Louis region, where it ''continued to moderate slightly.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/05/business/worldbusiness/IHT-de-benedetti-and-lieutenant-part-company.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Friedman", "pub_date": "1996-07-05", "snippet": "They were like father and son. .

Later, they gained control of the Mondadori publishing empire, then lost it to Silvio Berlusconi in a corporate and court battle. Since 1992, the pair have been entrenched in the painful process of trying to transform Olivetti from a loss-making personal computer company into a telecommunications business. **********But the two men officially parted company Thursday when the board of Olivetti accepted the resignation of Mr. Passera, 41, as co-chief executive and head of the personal computer division. **********Mr. Passera, a former McKinsey & Co. management consultant and banking expert with a master's degree from the Wharton School of Finance in Pennsylvania, apparently had a better offer. He will soon become chief executive of Banco Ambrosiano Veneto SpA, the largest private-sector bank in Italy. **********At the same time, Mr. De Benedetti fed speculation that he was quietly disengaging from Olivetti, which he controls with a 15 percent equity stake. He gave up his own title as co-chief executive, surrendering day-to-day involvement with the company, while retaining his role as chairman. He also made a point in an interview of denying rumors of a clash with Mr. Passera. **********Although some friends have said that Mr. De Benedetti is gradually retreating from the business world to enjoy his personal life more, he vigorously rejected the idea that he was really stepping back from Olivetti. **********\"After nearly 20 years of work here, I have the right to be just chairman and to let a 38-year-old run the company,\" Mr. De Benedetti said. \"I want to have more time to dedicate myself to forming alliances and to keeping in touch with the political authorities in Rome and in Brussels, because the next two years will be crucial as we move toward the liberalization of telecoms in Europe.\" **********Then, displaying resentment at reports that have suggested he is withdrawing from the business world, Mr. De Benedetti said: \"If I become the chairman only, they say I am stepping back. Well, Gianni Agnelli was only the Fiat chairman for 30 years, and nobody said he had stepped back.\" **********The parting of Mr. De Benedetti and Mr. Passera comes just as Olivetti claims it is poised to emerge this year from losses that have cost more than $2 billion over the past five years. Mr. De Benedetti bought into Olivetti in 1978 and rapidly transformed it from a loss-making typewriter company into a successful European computer business. But the sharp drop in personal computer prices in the early 1990s started the losses that resulted in a massive restructuring of the whole company. Olivetti has slashed its work force to 28,000 from nearly 60,000 in the late 1980s. **********Mr. De Benedetti said his top priority was \"to accelerate the transformation of Olivetti into a telecommunications company.\" **********He stressed that this aim was also implicit in the choice of Francesco Caio, another former McKinsey consultant, as the new chief executive. Mr. Caio has run Olivetti's new cellular phone unit, Omnitel. **********The PC division will be taken over by Bernhard Auer, a German-born veteran of Compaq Computer Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. **********Mr. Passera's reasons for leaving, although not announced, appear to be a mixture of professional and personal factors. In taking over Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, he will return to his first love \u2014 banking \u2014 with prospects of playing a part in reshaping the Italian financial system. He will also be closer to his family in Milan, rather than having to live in the remote Piedmont town of Ivrea, where Olivetti has its headquarters. **********The move to Ambrosiano is not without irony. An Italian appeals court in June upheld Mr. De Benedetti's conviction in connection with the fraudulent bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano, where he was briefly vice chairman in 1982. Mr. Passera will be running an institution built upon the ashes of that bank. **********The soft-spoken Mr. Passera had promised Mr. De Benedetti that he would remain at Olivetti until its personal computer unit returned to profit, which company sources say it did in the quarter ended June. **********Analysts remain unsure whether Olivetti will sell or merge the PC units, its office equipment division or its systems and services operations. Some are not sure Olivetti will break even this year. **********The only thing certain is that Mr. De Benedetti wants to change the company's identity one last time. **********He predicted Thursday that the Omnitel unit \u2014 which is 41.5 percent owned by Olivetti, with the rest held by partners Bell Atlantic Corp. and Airtouch Communications of the United States, Mannesmann AG of Germany and Telia AB of Sweden \u2014 would be profitable by 1997, one year ahead of schedule. **********The company signed up more than 300,000 subscribers in its first six months of operations, against a full-year target of 360,000. **********Mr. De Benedetti said Olivetti's future also lay in fixed-line telephone services."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/25/business/company-news-lynch-jones-buys-johnson-redbook-service.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;LYNCH JONES BUYS JOHNSON REDBOOK SERVICE", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;LYNCH JONES BUYS JOHNSON REDBOOK SERVICE", "body_text": " **********Lynch Jones & Ryan said yesterday that it had acquired the Johnson Redbook Service, a research organization that provides reports on sales by retailers.

Mr. Bucaram called the payments donations; the business people and the municipal council called them extortion. **********\"If his intelligence prevails over his temperament, we can have a great President,\" Mr. Duran said. \"If his temperament overtakes his intelligence, we can have a disaster.\" **********Mr. Bucaram, 44, says he has matured, and upon his election, he seemed intent on becoming a statesman. **********He says his mustache does not reflect an admiration of Hitler, but rather his ineptitude at shaving. He says now that his heroes are Christ, Gandhi, John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King. **********\"I don't like Hitler,\" he said. \"Hitler was a fascist with deep complexes. He killed five million Jews and started a world war.\" **********His post-victory speech was conciliatory, and for all his railing against politics as usual, he reappointed the Foreign Minister and the head of Ecuador's Central Bank in a bid for continuity. He proposed the outgoing President, Sixto  Duran-Ballen, to become Ecuador's next Ambassador to Washington. **********\"The previous Government has done some good things, and we have to move forward in these areas,\" he said. **********He also appointed three bankers who had supported his campaign to form an advisory economic council. Last week he announced plans to visit New York a week before his Aug. 10 inauguration to court foreign investors, whose cash he will need if he is to deliver on campaign promises to build 200,000 homes for the poor. Ecuador now faces a shortage of 1.2 million houses, Mr. Bucaram said. **********\"When the poor of a country have never been listened to, sometimes all they expect is a little love and nothing else,\" he said. \"Nevertheless, they need more: a basic breakfast, security, education, preventive medical care. It cannot be logical that in the 20th century people should be dying of diarrhea, parasites, cholera.\" **********He said there was no excuse for the thousands of street children when building shelters was so simple. \"These are the moral obligations of a society,\" he said. **********For the moment, Mr. Bucaram's moderation has somewhat relieved the jittery middle and upper classes, while the poor are accepting his emphasis on continuity. But he has worried business leaders and others with some of his appointments and recent actions. **********The weekend after his election, Mr. Bucaram was photographed in Panama hugging his sister Elsa, another former Mayor of Guayaquil who fled under charges that she stole millions before resigning in 1991. **********And on Wednesday, Mr. Bucaram's closest aide, Alfredo Adum, intervened forcibly to pry the President-elect's brother, Gustavo, free from a police station here, where he had been detained after being found in a stolen jeep outside the United States Consulate. The jeep had been used in the presidential  campaign. **********The President-elect said his brother did not know it had been stolen because  a friend had lent it to him. He said Mr. Adum's intervention did not signal that the law would not apply to the President and his entourage, because there had been no formal order for his brother's arrest. **********But in these days of intense scrutiny, business leaders are worried. Because  Ecuador lacks a strong, independent judiciary, Mr. Adum's move suggested that contacts could count for more than law over the next four years. That, they added, would scare away investors, particularly foreigners. **********Lacking political experience outside Guayaquil, the President-elect has filled his Cabinet with supporters, family and friends from this Pacific coast city. He appointed another brother, Adolfo, as Minister of Social Welfare. **********Some of his closest associates, like Mr. Adum, made their fortunes in La Bahia, a marketplace that avoids taxes by importing goods from Panama's Free Trade Zone. Other businesses complain that because of the tax break, sellers at  La Bahia can undercut them with low prices. **********Mr. Bucaram named Mr. Adum to the crucial post of Minister of Energy and Mining, responsible for privatizing Ecuador's petroleum industry.  The appointment was not taken well in business circles. **********For Ricardo Noboa, who ran against Mr. Bucaram, the candidate's triumph on his third run for the presidency reflected the desperation of a neglected populace rather than hope. **********Mr. Noboa, who had investigated Mr. Bucaram for the Congress, concluded that  he was the power behind his sister's notoriously corrupt administration. He quit the Social Christian Party in disgust when it ignored the evidence he uncovered  and made the latest of several political deals with Mr. Bucaram in 1994. **********\"Bucaram has surprised the entire country,\" he said. \"He's given us a real jab.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/19/world/gerry-adams-says-he-asks-for-a-truce-from-ira.html": {"writer_name": "James Clarity", "pub_date": "1996-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 587, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gerry Adams Says He Asks For a Truce From I.R.A.", "print_headline": "Gerry Adams Says He Asks For a Truce From I.R.A.", "body_text": " **********Gerry Adams, the head of the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, indicated today that he was trying to persuade the I.R.A. to restore its cease-fire after the bomb blast that wounded more than 200 people in Manchester, England, on Saturday. **********\"The question of what the I.R.A. can do or should do is one which obviously I'm working on,\" Mr. Adams said on the Irish radio. Mr. Adams's influence and prestige were severely shaken by the I.R.A.'s admitted killing of a policeman in the Irish Republic 12 days ago and by the bombing in Manchester, which the British police say was the work of the I.R.A., but which the I.R.A. has not acknowledged. **********Speaking in their separate Parliaments today, Prime Ministers John Bruton of Ireland and John Major of Britain continued to castigate the I.R.A. But they did not rule out the inclusion of Sinn Fein, the I.R.A.'s political wing, in the new broad-based peace talks that began in Belfast last week. Both Governments, however, insist that there must first be a new cease-fire. **********Both Prime Ministers have said the talks will go ahead with or without Sinn Fein, but few officials seem to believe that a permanent peace agreement can be  achieved without the I.R.A.'s representatives at the negotiating table. Mr. Major said that \"an unequivocal cease-fire\" was still necessary for Sinn Fein to be admitted to the talks. **********Mr. Bruton called the bombing in Manchester and the killing of the Irish policeman \"unpatriotic, contrary to a true sense of Irishness, anti-Irish.\" But the Irish Cabinet decided today not to cut off all contacts with Sinn Fein,  but to remain open to discuss \"matters of substance,\" which officials said means a new cease-fire. **********Despite the Manchester attack, officials and political experts said, a new cease-fire was still possible. The widespread speculatlion that the I.R.A. was severely split between hawks and doves, they said, was interesting but unconfirmed. Some experts suggested that the latest attack might have been a face-saving show of strength, which the I.R.A. has made in the past before making concessions. **********Others disagreed, saying that trying to anticipate the I.R.A. is futile. Mr.  Adams clearly sought to give the impression that a new cease-fire was still possible, paving the way for Sinn Fein to enter the broad-based peace talks in Belfast. **********\"Despite the setbacks, despite the difficulties, it is still my conviction that we will have a peace settlement,\" he said. \"It is my conviction that it will grow from inclusive dialogue and that Sinn Fein will be part of that inclusive dialogue. I may fail. All politics, I'm told, ends in tragedy. But it  won't be through any lack of trying.\" **********He suggested that Mr. Bruton's aides were disingenuous for publicly demanding to know whether he had asked the I.R.A. to restore a cease-fire. Irish officials are \"fully aware,\" Mr. Adams said, of his efforts to persuade the I.R.A. to resume the 17-month cease-fire they broke in February. The extent of Mr. Adams's influence on the I.R.A.'s military command, however, is questionable. **********Mr. Adams declined to answer for reporters the Irish Government's question as to whether he now condemned the I.R.A. for the violence it calls \"the armed struggle.\" **********\"Sinn Fein wants to see an end to the armed struggle,\" he said. \"We're not involved in it. We do not advocate it. We are a party which has suffered as a result of the armed action of others.\" He added, however, \"We understand how in  certain conditions armed actions are seen as legitimate.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/29/business/international-briefs-france-sells-total-stake.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;France Sells Total Stake", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;France Sells Total Stake", "body_text": " **********The French Government sold 9.5 million shares of the oil company Total yesterday for 3.1 billion francs, or $622.4 million.

These presentations to prospective investors have been closed to reporters at the insistence of the Russians. But participants have said the deal that is already substantially oversubscribed and that the maturity might be longer than the three to five years initially suggested. **********All this comes as the International Monetary Fund is withholding additional lending to Moscow because of its inability to meet its budget-deficit target. Russia also has yet to reschedule with international banks $25.5 billion of debts inherited from the Soviet Union or to settle with French holders of Russian imperial debt that was repudiated after the 1917 revolution, even though a settlement has been promised. **********Nonetheless, investor response to the proposed sale is enthusiastic, and the terms at which the paper will be sold are likely to widely exceed the expectations of even the Russians, who have been quoted as anticipating a coupon of between 10 percent and 11 percent. **********Most important, the deal serves as a metaphor for the bubble engulfing the bond market. **********The true nature of the excesses in asset markets \u2014 stocks as well as bonds \u2014 has been easy to overlook because the cover story has been so convincing: inflation tamed, corporate earnings on the rise \u2014 not least due to downsizing \u2014 and moderate growth. **********But there is no escaping the fact that the massive easing of monetary policy \u2014 starting in 1991 in the United States to recapitalize the injured banking system and fueled by the decade's unprecedented 88 percent growth in (mostly Asian) central bank foreign-exchange reserves and the subsequent injections of liquidity by Japan, Germany and Switzerland to stave off currency appreciation and spur domestic growth \u2014 has unleashed an inflation in asset prices that has yet to show up in wholesale or consumer price indexes. **********The fact that price indexes are well behaved \u2014 just as they were while the damaging bubble was building in Japan at the end of the 1980s \u2014 does not alter the fact that inflation is infecting financial asset markets. Too much money there chasing too few assets is driving prices to levels that appear unsustainable. **********For bond markets, there has been a double whammy: High-quality supply is declining. The major industrialized countries (excluding Japan) have been cutting budget deficits, and therefore borrowing less, while companies have been selling equity, using retained earnings or investing less as they too have cut borrowing. **********For example, net issuance in the international bond market in the first half of 1996 was up 53 percent from a year earlier. But net issuance by governments of developed countries was unchanged, while net corporate issuance was down 30 percent. In the major domestic markets, net bond sales this year are running 12 percent behind the year-ago pace. **********Faced with nearly record low yields on 10-year bonds of 2.7 percent in Japan, 5.8 percent in Germany and 6.18 percent in the United States, it is no wonder that investors seeking quality as well as income have stormed into what were once high-yielding peripheral markets in Europe, driving prices up and yields down. **********Those gains, in turn, are dwarfed by the performance of Brady bonds \u2014 restructured paper that enabled what were then called developing countries to walk away from the debt crisis of the 1980s. **********Although partly collateralized, these are high-risk, high-yielding instruments. Morgan's Brady bond index is up 3.5 percent this month and has gained almost 36 percent since January. **********Such massive growth has compressed the risk premium on these countries' noncollateralized debt, which has become the favored vehicle for those interested only in maximizing potential income. **********Which brings us back to Russia, whose credit rating places it between Mexico and Argentina. **********The yield on five-year Mexican paper ended the week at 287 basis points over U.S. government paper, down from a spread of 315 basis points at the start of the month. The spread on Argentine debt, 389 basis points at the end of last month, is 333 basis points. **********With five-year U.S. paper yielding 5.95 percent, Russia can expect to sell five-year notes with a coupon easily below 10 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/17/business/ocean-reef-withdraws-its-bid-to-buy-best-products.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-09-17", "snippet": "Best Products Co says Ocean Reef Management has withdrawn its unsolicited offer to buy company for total of $63.2 million, after concluding that takeover would require greater resources than originally thought (S)", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OCEAN REEF WITHDRAWS ITS BID TO BUY BEST PRODUCTS", "print_headline": "OCEAN REEF WITHDRAWS ITS BID TO BUY BEST PRODUCTS", "body_text": " **********The Best Products Company said yesterday that Ocean Reef Management had withdrawn its unsolicited offer to buy the company for $2 a share, or a total of $63.2 million.

Instead, as the airlines push for fare increases because of the soaring price of jet fuel, and as economists ponder the impact that high oil prices could have on global inflation, the blame for the explosion in oil prices has shifted increasingly to the major oil companies. **********Faced with the paradox of plentiful oil supplies and the absence of war in the Middle East on one hand, and the steepest oil price increase in years on the other, many industry analysts have begun to look at the behavior of the oil companies for answers. Specifically, their attention has been focused on a little-noticed decision taken last year by several oil companies to cut their stockpiles of refined petroleum products, such as heating oil. **********To many observers, that move set the stage for the subsequent explosion in oil prices that began late last winter. Leo Drollas, deputy director of the Center for Global Energy Studies in London, calls the decision to move to lower stocks \"crucial\" in explaining this year's increase in prices \u2014 a rise that for some grades of crude has reached nearly 50 percent over the past 12 months. By the beginning of this year, oil stocks, which are the cushion between the oil companies' ability to serve their customers and the vicissitudes of demand, stood at their lowest levels in 20 years. In the industrialized countries in January 1995 the oil companies had a 62-day supply of petroleum. One year later, those stocks had fallen to an average of 57 days, with stocks in the United States falling to slightly more than 50 days. **********Analysts say that an oil market already precariously off balance was then tipped into a panic by an unexpectedly cold winter in Europe and the United States. As demand for heating oil shot up, prices for the relatively thin supplies of refined products available soared. Then, as refiners scrambled to buy more crude oil to increase production in their refineries, pressure suddenly shifted to the crude market, driving up prices there. **********The oil companies themselves are reluctant to talk about the charges. Ian Stewart, a spokesman for British Petroleum Co. said that information about his company's oil inventories was \"commercially sensitive.\" **********In Washington, meanwhile, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group, conceded that the industry had cut its inventories, but denied the move had increased prices. **********\"The cushion is not as large as it was historically, but experience has shown that we can get by with less,\" said Joseph Lastelic, the institute's spokesman. Instead, he attributed the higher petroleum prices to global \"prosperity,\" which, in turn, lifted oil demand. **********For the oil companies, particularly those involved in exploration and production \u2014 the so-called upstream end of the business \u2014 this year has shown that not only can they get by with less, but that less is more. \"It has been a great year for oil companies and particularly for the upstream operators,\" an analyst said. \"They have got their costs down to where they can live comfortably\" with oil at $18 a barrel, \"and now they are getting $24 for it.' **********Most observers agree that the oil companies themselves were surprised by the volatility of petroleum prices this year. Low inventories may have laid the groundwork for those market conditions, but the companies' aim was not to squeeze more cash out of their customers but simply to attack their own costs. **********Faced with intense pressure on the profit margins of their downstream operations \u2014 refining and marketing \u2014 they decided to do what many other industries have done \u2014 cut costs, including their huge bills for holding unsold inventory. **********Even now oil companies in the United States still have 118 million barrels of petroleum distillate \u2014 heating oil and diesel fuel \u2014 on hand, down 15 million barrels from a year ago."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/04/world/rebels-new-cause-a-book-for-yankee-bashing.html": {"writer_name": "Patrick Tyler", "pub_date": "1996-09-04", "snippet": "Interview with Zhang Xiaobo, former Chinese pro-democracy rebel who has written The China That Can Say No, best-selling book that gives voice to anti-Americanism and has won praise from Communist party officials, all way up to Pres Jiang Zemin; ph...", "word_count": 1019, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rebels' New Cause: A Book for Yankee Bashing", "print_headline": "Rebels' New Cause: A Book for Yankee Bashing", "body_text": " **********To describe his feelings toward America, Zhang Xiaobo, 32, a poet, author and onetime pro-democracy rebel, told a reporter from a state-run press agency recently: ''I admire some things American.

The Chinese people should have a sense of their own identity.'' **********This is the season in which China is saying no to the United States -- over improving China's human rights record, trade issues and global agreements to stanch the flow of high technology and sophisticated weapons to rogue states. **********So Communist Party leaders seem to be celebrating the appearance of the book that Mr. Zhang and his colleagues wrote in just three weeks to popularize -- or cash in on -- a wave of anti-Western nationalism. **********The book's five authors admit to a certain lack of knowledge about the issues. Their book is not so much political analysis as a handbook for  anti-American and anti-British slogans, conspiracy theories and satire. **********''Some people abroad said we did this book because we are manipulated by the Government, or for commercial purpose, or that we are terrorists,'' Mr. Zhang said, seated this weekend in a small Beijing hotel convenient to his fruit stands -- his main source of income before he turned social commentator. **********''This is very unjust,'' Mr. Zhang continued. ''Our views may be radical, but they are from the heart.'' **********''What is important,'' interjected Song Qiang, one of the co-authors, ''is not that the book is being used by the Government, but what lesson the United States could draw from the public mood of China.'' **********What lesson? he was asked. **********''Don't think that the Chinese youth appreciate the sanctions by the United States against China,'' Mr. Song replied. ''You cannot divorce the individual from the state and when you hurt the Chinese Government, you hurt the Chinese people.'' **********At a time when drinking Coke, smoking Marlboros and eating at McDonald's is high fashion among Chinese youth, many now also have an ''attitude'' toward the United States. Seven years after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, Chinese young people may still be unhappy with their own Government, but with no available outlet for political expression, they are channeling their energy, and their frustrations, in other directions. **********Sports has become a national obsession. Sports and pride in China's athletes have unified the Chinese, despite deep political wounds that otherwise divide Chinese society. **********Su Shaozhi, one of the leading democratic thinkers within the Communist Party in the 1980's, who now lives in exile in the United States, observed, ''In mainland China and other leading post-Communist socialist countries, Marxism-Leninism has become a sham ideology causing a crisis of faith.'' Thus, he added, ''it is a common phenomenon that nationalists are taking advantage of this weak spot.'' **********Writing a review of the book in the dissident newsletter China Focus, Mr. Su said: ''Though sales of this book have been considerable, it has not really caused a stir among intellectuals. Rather, I would say that this book became popular overseas because foreign leaders paid more attention to it.'' **********In the book, Western countries are portrayed as stifling China's emergence as a great power, interfering in China's internal affairs over Taiwan and Tibet and practicing a repugnant brand of moral superiority in human rights. **********In one example, they assert that the Central Intelligence Agency, in contravention to the White House, is supporting pro-independence ''separatists'' on Taiwan to provoke a military confrontation with China. The goal, they say, is ''to make any action by China condemned by the world as a threat to regional and world peace.'' **********''When I read that book, it makes me feel good,'' said a young Chinese office worker named Wang Yanhong, through she conceded that she found much of the logic ''a little confusing.'' She still has plans to seek admission to an American university. **********The book idea may have been borrowed from a Japanese assault on the United States a few years ago titled ''The Japan That Can Say No,'' written by the former chairman of Sony Corporation, Akio Morita, and Shintaro Ishihara, a legislator. Both books could be called ''grievance literature,'' tapping a layer of Asian xenophobia, nationalism and, in China's case, a deep youthful patriotism. **********Mr. Zhang took part as a 22-year-old in the pro-democracy demonstrations that briefly broke out in 1986. Now he has concluded that China's democracy movements were ''a blind alley,'' and he has become ''ambivalent'' about the United States. **********When he recently found himself face to face with the British journalist Jasper Becker, who asked in an interview why it was wrong for foreign governments to put pressure on China to make it comply with international standards, Mr. Zhang fired back: ''Britain sold opium to China and waged the Opium Wars against China.

When she leaves the building or is in a meeting, the central computer will automatically transfer calls and take messages. **********Welcome to the virtual office: it exists only when the employee needs it and is transformed into space for others when the worker is out. Andersen Consulting, along with Digital Equipment Corp., Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and others, believes there is money to be saved and efficiency to be increased by eliminating individually assigned office space. **********Andersen's new Paris offices, unveiled in January, created work spaces available to employees through advance reservation, eliminating the traditional territorial element. David Andrews, managing partner for Andersen Consulting Western Europe, estimates that the system will save the Paris office about $1 million annually **********\"What we want to try to do is shift the emphasis from space costs to technology and infrastructure,\" Mr. Andrews said. **********Andersen has assigned about 40 full-time staff members to managing reservations and office space. Many of these logistics employees were new hires, but others were reassigned from other duties, so the overall number of jobs has not changed. **********The company spent about $4 million to renovate the 7,000-square-meter (22,967-square-foot) 1930s-era building. While Andersen has 1,150 Paris-based employees, the new virtual offices can accommodate only 600 at any given time. The space is organized to provide small cubical-like working areas for each manager, conference areas and open offices for visiting managers. **********The change required all of Andersen's managers to take the draconian step of destroying all but the most important documents \u2014 which amounted to about 150 tons of paper. **********Now, each Paris-based manager has a small filing cabinet with current files, which is moved into their reserved working space before they arrive. They each carry a portable computer, which connects to the company network from wherever they are working. **********Jean-Pierre Mercier, the director of communications for Andersen's Paris office, summed up the change as a move to a building structured for communication inside and out. \"It is a new vision of space and time,\" he said. **********For Ms. Millet-Cassin, the change has proven to be positive. 'The greatest advantage is that the virtual office environment permits a high level internal communication,\" she said. \"Mangers are working in close proximity and are able to communicate with an ease that the traditional office environment was not necessarily adapted to.\" **********But there are drawbacks. \"It gets noisy and one must sometimes seek out closed office spaces for privacy,\" she said. **********Mr. Andrews said the company realized that employees might have trouble giving up their personalized space. But he said the change was lead by management, which made the transition smooth. **********\"What we are hoping to put across is that we have a more egalitarian approach,\" he said. **********The Chadwick Group, which designed the space for Andersen, sees the development of the virtual office as \"a cumulating of all the business engineering projects going on everywhere which are about reducing head count, increasing efficiency, lowering responsibility through the levels of management and encouraging people to work in teams,\" said Andrew Chadwick, managing director of the company. **********Mr. Chadwick, who started experimenting with these ideas in 1990, said the concept was modeled on a university campus. **********\"In university work, you are encouraged to be independent, and it is the results that count,\" he said. \"In the traditional work force you go back to primary school being told what to do, where to do it and how to do it. What is really interesting is that by adopting the university structure you are also adopting the university moir\u00e9 \u2014 you have to be more independent and manage your time efficiently.\" **********The London-based company has a staff of 40 and sets up its own virtual offices when needed. **********While Andersen plans to expand the virtual-office concept to all of its offices in Western Europe by the end of 1997, the company is not the first to use technology to save space. **********Digital Equipment's Swedish unit eliminated territorial office space in January 1992. The Swedish office experimented by creating common working spaces for some consultants so they could work in an environment best suited to the job at hand. **********In the first six months, efficiency increased 68 percent. The company's lighting bills fell 70 percent, air conditioning costs dropped 60 percent and the cleaning bill was halved. **********The experiment worked so well that Digital Sweden was quickly mimicked by Digital in Britain and Finland. Indeed, Digital Sweden now works with 40 other companies to analyze their organizational needs. **********IBM has been experimenting with just-in-time offices for the past two years. The company's Beijing branch functions much like Andersen's Paris office, where telephone and mail messages follow employees to their assigned work cubicles. **********\"IBM finds that the open-work environment is very good for people that are mobile, such as the marketing staff that spends most of their time out with customers,\" said Fred McNeese, the company's director of international public relations. **********At Microsoft, personal offices have not been eliminated, but laptop computers serve as a virtual office for many employees on the road. **********\"Just about everyone has a laptop computer and has access to a remote access site, which allows anyone to plug their computer in anywhere and have total access to their files and the company's network,\" said Andrea Tevlin, manager of manager development. **********She said Microsoft saw an advantage to what Andersen was doing. \"It is great that a company can identify existing technology and then structures itself around it.\" **********Mr. Andrews of Andersen Consulting agreed. \"Historically business strategy has always driven technology,\" he said. \"What we are finding is that now you see technology driving and enabling business strategy, and that is a fascinating new trend.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/02/business/communications-reshaped-overhaul-congress-votes-reshape-communications-industry.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1996-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1272, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMMUNICATIONS RESHAPED: THE OVERHAUL;CONGRESS VOTES TO RESHAPE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY, ENDING A 4-YEAR STRUGGLE", "print_headline": "COMMUNICATIONS RESHAPED: THE OVERHAUL;CONGRESS VOTES TO RESHAPE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY, ENDING A 4-YEAR STRUGGLE", "body_text": " **********After four years of struggle and gridlock, Congress rewrote the nation's communications laws today, passing a bill that would transform television, telephones and the emerging frontiers of cyberspace. **********Voting within two hours of each other, both the House and Senate approved a final version of a bill that is broadly intended to promote a free-for-all rivalry between local telephone companies, long-distance carriers, cable television operators and even electric utilities. **********The House approved the bill first, by a vote of 414 to 16; the Senate's vote was 91 to 5. The bill now moves directly to President Clinton, who strongly supports it and has said he will sign it. **********\"Today, we have broken up two of the biggest government monopolies left: the  monopolies in local telephone service and in cable television,\" said the bill's  primary author in the House, Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., Republican of  Virginia, the chairman of the Commerce Committee. \"For the first time ever, Americans will be given choices. Besides lower rates and better service, the result will be innovative new products and services that will create thousands of new American jobs.\" **********Whether or not the bill lives up to the superlatives heaped on it today by its supporters, few dispute the sweeping impact of the new legislation, which leaves no corner of the industry unchanged. **********It would replace the historic antitrust consent decree that broke up the Bell telephone system in 1984, freeing the seven regional Baby Bell companies to offer long-distance services while forcing them to open the local telephone business to new rivals. **********The bill lets cable television and telephone companies attack each other's markets, as each industry races to offer a full menu of telephone, video and high-speed data communications. The bill also relaxes ownership restrictions in  broadcasting, allowing companies to greatly increase the number of radio and television stations a single company can own. **********And it contains provisions that make it a crime to transmit indecent sexual material over computer networks, and require television manufacturers to begin including the so-called V-chip to allow parents to block undesirable programming. **********Today's vote came after Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, dropped his objections to a provision that he attacked as a multibillion-dollar  giveaway for television broadcasters. That provision essentially reserves a segment of the nation's airwaves, estimated to be worth as much as $70 billion,  for television broadcasters to start new digital television services. **********Mr. Dole effectively blocked the bill several weeks ago, arguing that the provision amounted to corporate welfare for media companies at a time when Congress was cutting funds for social welfare programs. **********But today he let the bill proceed unchanged -- though not without being blasted by numerous Democrats for capitulating -- after he obtained assurances from Republicans and from the Federal Communications Commission that no licenses would be given until after Congress revisits the issue in a separate bill. **********Over all, however, today's votes drew a chorus of praise from almost every segment of the communications industry. But consumer groups complained that the  measure would lead to higher prices for telephone and cable customers, and civil liberties groups were furious about provisions aimed at blocking sexual material on computer networks. **********In industry, the biggest winners today were the seven regional Bell companies that have been prohibited from entering the $70 billion long-distance market since the companies were created 12 years ago. **********It remains unclear how quickly this will take place, but executives at AT&T predicted today that head-to-head rivalry from the Bells could arrive within two years. Under the new law, the Bell companies must open their local networks  to competition by satisfying a detailed checklist of requirements that aspiring  rivals have said are essential for entering the local phone business. **********\"This bill is a blueprint for the 21st century,\" said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. \"It breaks down all the old models of one  cable company and one telephone company. It is not perfect, but it is the best overall blueprint that any country in the world has ever come up with.\" **********Vice President Al Gore, who has spearheaded the Clinton Administration's efforts on communication issues, effusively praised today's votes. **********\"It's a bipartisan victory, a textbook example of how the White House and Congress can work together,\" he said tonight. \"Creativity that has been bottled  up for decades will be let out in a very constructive way.\" **********Today's votes mark the end of a four-year legislative struggle worthy of the  Perils of Pauline. Lobbying by the regional Bell companies helped kill a similar measure drafted by Democrats in 1994, with Bell companies complaining that the measure would not let them into the long-distance industry quickly enough. **********This year, with Republicans pushing a stronger deregulatory bill, AT&T and other long-distance carriers waged a lobbying campaign to defeat provisions that would free the Bells more quickly. They lost that battle last summer in both the House and Senate, but declared victory after winning a few modest concessions in December during a House-Senate conference committee. **********But that was hardly the end. Within hours after top Republicans and Democrats on the conference committee reached agreement on a final bill, rank-and-file House Republicans complained that their own leaders had made too many concessions to Democrats. Many Republicans were furious when Mr. Gore quickly declared his delight with the agreement, and their anger delayed passage for another six weeks. **********Mr. Dole then confounded almost every other lawmaker who had worked on the bill by attacking it as a \"giveaway\" to broadcasters. That issue only became resolved after Mr. Dole and the House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, agreed to a compromise on Wednesday morning. **********Despite the turmoil, virtually every segment of the communications industry has been pleading with Congressional leaders for weeks to simply pass the bill and be done with it. **********Gerald M. Levin, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner Inc., phoned Republican lawmakers to beg for an end to the bickering. Time Warner, the nation's second-largest cable television operator, will benefit from both cable  price deregulation and from rules to ease its entry into the telephone business. Cable companies were so eager for the bill that they agreed to delay full price  deregulation for three more years -- a retreat from the bills passed last summer. **********Consumer advocates continued to criticize the bill, particularly provisions that would immediately end most cable television price regulations in small markets and permit cable television and telephone companies to merge in markets  with fewer than 50,000 people. **********\"Cable rates are going to go up in small towns immediately and could rise significantly in three years across the country,\" said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Consumers Union's Washington office. **********Civil liberties groups quickly vowed a court battle over provisions that would block the transmission of smut over computer networks. \"The Internet has been give second-class speech rights, and we are going to take them to court over it,\" said Jerry Berman, director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit group in Washington focused on Internet issues. **********Numerous Democratic lawmakers took potshots over the provision that would reserve part of the airwaves for digital television. \"It is a huge charitable corporate gift,\" thundered Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan. **********But Mr. Dole, citing assurances from the F.C.C. that it would take no action  until Congress revisits the issue in a separate bill, said broadcasters would not get the valuable television frequencies without a fight in the months ahead. **********\"I am determined to turn the F.C.C.'s commitment to us into a victory for the American taxpayer,\" he said in a statement today. \"For those who think this is an idle threat, guess again.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/08/business/media-business-advertising-pep-boys-hires-cliff-freeman-enliven-its-image-sales.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-03-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 844, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;Pep Boys hires Cliff Freeman to enliven its image and sales.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;Pep Boys hires Cliff Freeman to enliven its image and sales.", "body_text": " **********THE agency that brought pizazz to peddling pizza and made buying office supplies seem like fun is facing perhaps its most challenging retail assignment: convincing consumers that shopping for automotive parts and repairs can be less  painful than a root canal without anesthesia or a double feature of \"Waterworld\" and \"Showgirls.\" **********Cliff Freeman & Partners, the New York shop known for campaigns that sell with a smile for the Little Caesars pizzerias and the Staples office-supply chain, is introducing television commercials for the Pep Boys -- Manny, Moe & Jack, the automotive parts and service retailer with 510 stores in 33 states and Puerto Rico. The campaign, which begins Monday, is the first from Freeman since  being named in December to handle the creative portion of the Pep Boys account,  with billings estimated at $25 million to $30 million. **********The commercials are Freemanesque in their deft blend of humor with hard-hitting, competitive claims. For instance, in one spot disparaging local garages that compete against Pep Boys, a woman confronts a mechanic who appears  to have wandered off the set of \"Deliverance.\" **********In another commercial, a gruff garage owner who has kept a man's car for five days without fixing it seeks to reassure him by declaring, \"I have three of my best guys on it right now.\" Indeed they are -- draped on it, eating. **********The campaign carries the theme \"Everything but gas,\" which is meant to play up the selection at Pep Boys superstores. Each averages 23,000 square feet, stocks 26,000 items and has 12 service bays. **********Pep Boys appeals to \"all automotive aftermarket customers, whether they are the 'do it for me's' who make no repairs on their cars or the 'do-it-yourselfers,' \" said Richard Hammill, vice president for advertising at Pep Boys in Philadelphia. **********\"We needed an agency to talk to each segment,\" he added. \"Others came up with cute scenarios, but you could have put the name of any company at the end of the spots. Freeman was head and shoulders above the others in how it wove in the Pep Boys advantages.\" **********Executives at Pep Boys hope the campaign will help reinvigorate sales, which  have been sluggish. \"A lot of retailers are glad 1995 is behind us,\" Mr. Hammill said. **********\"We're very enthused about 1996,\" he added, in part because of the weather. \"We had a very good winter is how I would put it. If it's miserable outside, we  do well.\" **********Peter Minnium, senior vice president and group account director at Freeman, which is owned by Cordiant P.L.C., said the campaign was based on data that included \"two forms of proprietary research we use with our sister agency, Saatchi & Saatchi, that involve sending clinical psychologists and anthropologists to observe our target markets in their natural habitat, if you will.\" **********\"It confirmed for us that because a consumer has such an emotional attachment to the car,\" he added, \"repairs and maintenance are hugely important.\" **********So in developing \"the strategic mosaic\" for Pep Boys, Mr. Minnium said, Freeman created \"a campaign that would accomplish two things: dramatizing in a highly emotional manner how Pep Boys will meet your needs, and conveying that Pep Boys will be able to meet those needs across a broad spectrum, whether it's  a horn relay for a 1989 Ford Taurus or a repair.\" **********Cliff Freeman, chairman and chief executive at the agency, said the humor provided a way to deliver a tough message, that \"people have had a lot of unsatisfactory experiences with this industry,\" suffering \"year after year of being ripped off and pandered to.\" **********The tone of two commercials is somewhat earthier than typical Freeman fare and marks a departure for Pep Boys. Mr. Hammill characterized the company's previous campaign, by N. W. Ayer & Partners in New York, as \"warm and fuzzy -- kids and that type of thing.\" **********In one of the two commercials, a gang of ninja-like thieves strips a man's truck while he is behind a tree answering a call of nature. In the other, a man  who paid \"too much for auto supplies\" compares himself to the back end of a horse. **********\"Is it a little bit more liberal for us?\" Mr. Hammill asked. \"Absolutely. But we felt it was memorable and it's targeted toward a male 25 to 49.\" Mr. Freeman  estimated that 70 percent of Pep Boys' customers are men, adding, \"There's a different mind-set in this category.\" **********The commercials will run on national cable networks like CNN and ESPN and on  local stations affiliated with the four broadcast networks. **********One aspect of the campaign is vintage Freeman: a sight-and-sound-bite at the  end of each commercial to reinforce the sales message. For Little Caesars, a toga-clad gnome barks \"Pizza! Pizza!\" For Staples, a stapler noisily races across the screen. **********For Pep Boys, it is an aerial view of a superstore as the roof slams shut with a loud thunk, not unlike the sound made by a car hood closing. The traditional characters of Manny, Moe and Jack, the Pep Boys founders, are not in the commercials but are to appear in print."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/23/business/with-gasoline-prices-steady-some-foresee-slide.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1996-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 643, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "With Gasoline Prices Steady, Some Foresee Slide", "print_headline": "With Gasoline Prices Steady, Some Foresee Slide", "body_text": " **********With Americans preparing to hit the road for the Memorial Day weekend, it appears that gasoline prices are stabilizing and the prospect for lower prices is improving as suppliers begin to rebuild their very low inventories. **********\"Retail prices have leveled off,\" said John H. Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, an industry consulting group. **********After rising by more than 20 cents a gallon from early February to mid-May,  the average price of regular gasoline has steadied, even dipping slightly from a peak of nearly $1.29 last Friday to just over $1.28 a gallon this week, according to a daily survey of retail gasoline prices around the country conducted by the Department of Energy. **********Some analysts predicted that gasoline prices could begin to retreat soon, but they warned that another increase at the pump was possible this summer if demand rose at the unexpectedly strong pace of the last couple of years. **********Frederick P. Leuffer, an oil analyst for Bear, Stearns, said that the recent  buildup of gasoline inventories was a sign that oil refiners were beginning to catch up with consumption, contributing to the fall in wholesale prices by roughly a dime since their peak in mid-April. Another factor helping to hold down wholesale prices has been an increase in gasoline imports, mostly from Europe to the East Coast. **********Pushing in the other direction, however, was the expectation that motorists this summer were likely to drive farther and faster in less fuel-efficient vehicles, sustaining demand at such high levels that many refiners will be straining to keep up. **********Given these competing forces, Mr. Leuffer said, \"It's hard to say what will happen at the pump.\" **********The partial lifting this week of the oil embargo against Iraq, allowing it to bring about 700,000 barrels of crude oil a day onto the world market, is not expected to have any near-term effect on retail prices. But Mr. Lichtblau predicted that gasoline prices could fall significantly two to three months from now as those additional barrels begin to work through the supply pipeline. **********One of the factors that helped to drive up prices earlier this year was the sharp squeeze at refineries that were unable to switch as much output to gasoline because they were forced by the cold weather to produce heating oil longer than normal. That drove gasoline inventories to very low levels. **********While still low compared with previous years, that squeeze on supplies appears to be easing, according to new figures released this week by the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's trade group. Gasoline supplies rose by 1.85 million barrels, or about 1 percent, to 204.9 million barrels for the week ending May 17. Energy Department statistics, while slightly different, point in the same direction. **********While the increase is small, the timing is critical because it comes at the start of the heavy summer driving season, which traditionally starts this weekend. **********\"We're in a stage where supplies are in excess of what is being consumed,\" said Edward H. Murphy, the director of finance, accounting and statistics at the petroleum institute. \"That inventories are now building up suggests that there could be downward pressure on prices.\" **********There was concern among some analysts that refineries would not be able to keep up with the surge in demand that typically begins at this time of year. **********For the moment, though, gasoline demand is running lower than many analysts had feared. The Energy Department predicted about a month ago that demand would  rise by more than 2 percent this summer because of faster speeds and a decline in gas mileage caused by the popularity of mini-vans and sport utility vehicles. **********But so far this year, Mr. Murphy said, gasoline demand is only about 1 percent above what it was during the corresponding period last year. That could  be due in part to the impact of higher prices on the driving habits of American  motorists."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/01/business/worldbusiness/IHT-governments-have-taken-control-back-from-markets.html": {"writer_name": "Erik Ipsen", "pub_date": "1996-07-01", "snippet": "After years of having their best-laid economic plans torn asunder by currency speculators, the leaders of the Group of Seven countries have ample reason for smugness..

The ban, part of a 40-year-old state law, is similar to bans on liquor-price advertising in Connecticut, Pennsylvania and eight other states. **********There was, however, no majority opinion on a rationale, indicating that the  Court's approach to commercial speech remains in flux 20 years after the Court first extended First Amendment protection to truthful, nonmisleading advertising of lawful products. But for the most part, the four separate opinions expressed  nuances of difference rather than the deep fissures that characterize other areas of constitutional doctrine in which the Justices have yet to find common ground. **********\"When the day is done and you add up all these crazy fragments, you come away with a strengthened test\" for First Amendment protection of commercial speech, one specialist in this area, P. Cameron DeVore of the Seattle law firm Davis Wright Tremaine, said today in an interview. **********In invalidating the Rhode Island law, the Court overturned a 1994 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, which found \"inherent merit\" in the state's argument that the advertising ban, by discouraging bargain-hunting, kept liquor prices high and thus served the state's goal of discouraging liquor consumption. **********The state had not demonstrated a close enough fit between means and ends, Justice John Paul Stevens said in the Court's principal opinion. \"The First Amendment directs us to be especially skeptical of regulations that seek to keep people in the dark for what the Government perceives to be their own good,\" Justice Stevens said in a portion of the opinion that Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg also signed. **********The case has been watched closely for clues to the Court's eventual response  to restrictions that the Food and Drug Administration is now considering on the  advertising and promotion of cigarettes. There were no definitive answers, but it is apparent that the Court will subject any new regulations to a searching examination. **********Among the proposed restrictions are a ban on outdoor displays of cigarette advertising within 1,000 yards of a school or playground, a ban on the use of color advertising in media likely to be seen by young people and restrictions on the use of cigarette brand names and logos on caps and other items. **********The proposed cigarette regulations focus on sales to minors, which are against Federal law; Rhode Island made no effort to defend its advertising ban as a way of restricting young people's access to liquor. It is unclear from today's opinions whether the explicit reference to young people in the anti-smoking regulations might be more persuasive to the Court than the broad-brush defense by Rhode Island of its advertising ban. **********One advertising executive said today that the decision offered useful ammunition against the Federal cigarette proposals. \"Alcohol is also a product that is off-limits to teen-agers,\" Wally Snyder, president and chief executive of the American Advertising Federation, said in an interview. \"This decision transfers the focus back to speech and the First Amendment and away from the product.\" **********In his opinion, Justice Stevens said one serious flaw in the Rhode Island law was that the state's goal of discouraging drinking could have been accomplished  by other means that did not restrict speech, like direct price regulation, higher taxes, limitations on purchases and education campaigns. **********Justices Kennedy and Ginsburg along with Justice David H. Souter joined this  portion of the opinion, which could have a fairly direct application to the cigarette situation. However, the question remains whether there would be a different outcome regarding cigarettes since the proposed regulations aim directly at illegal purchases by young people. **********A separate concurring opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas suggested that the difference might indeed be significant. While offering a strong First Amendment  analysis, in some respects more sweeping than that of Justice Stevens, he qualified his analysis by suggesting that it would be limited to products that are legally sold to their intended customers. A governmental interest in keeping \"legal users of a product or service ignorant in order to manipulate their choices in the marketplace\" can never be legitimate, Justice Thomas said. **********The Court may soon give a clue to its further thinking on these issues when it acts on two related cases it has been holding since early in the term while awaiting the outcome in the Rhode Island case. Both cases challenge restrictions imposed by the City of Baltimore on outdoor advertising of cigarettes and beer.  The restrictions were upheld by a Federal appeals court. The cigarette advertising restriction, adopted by the city in 1994, has the explicit purpose of discouraging smoking by teen-agers. **********The Rhode Island case, 44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island, No. 94-1140, began in 1991 when competitors complained about a liquor store's newspaper advertisement  that did not actually list prices, but showed pictures of liquor bottles with the word \"Wow\" in big letters. The Rhode Island Liquor Control Administrator imposed a $400 fine on the store, 44 Liquormart, which paid the fine and then challenged the law in Federal District Court in Providence, R.I. The store won at that level before losing in the appeals court. **********The Court's opinions today -- there were opinions by Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, as well as by Justices Stevens and Thomas -- contained discussions of the Court's numerous precedents in the area of commercial speech that were at times distinct and at times overlapping. **********It was clear from the opinions that a majority of the Court is no longer satisfied with several of these precedents but is uncertain how to replace them. **********Justices Stevens, Kennedy, Thomas and Ginsburg called for overruling a 1986 case, Posadas de Puerto Rico v. Tourism Company, which upheld a Puerto Rico law  that banned the advertising of casino gambling on the theory that if the activity itself could be prohibited, speech about it could be prohibited as well. Justice O'Connor's opinion, which was also signed by Justice Souter, Justice Stephen G. Breyer and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, did not advocate overruling that decision, but stated that subsequent decisions had, properly, ignored it. **********Justice Stevens did command a clear majority for a portion of his opinion holding that the 21st Amendment, which repealed Prohibition while leaving the states much leeway to regulate alcohol, could not outweigh the First Amendment and, therefore, could not save the Rhode Island law from the conclusion that it  violated the constitutional guarantee of free speech."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/14/business/senate-clears-way-for-vote-on-third-term-for-greenspan.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1996-06-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 912, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Senate Clears Way for Vote On Third Term For Greenspan", "print_headline": "Senate Clears Way for Vote On Third Term For Greenspan", "body_text": " **********Senate leaders broke the logjam holding up the confirmation of the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, to a third term today, with Republicans agreeing to Democratic requests for an extended debate on monetary policy over several days before the confirmation vote next Thursday. **********Within hours of the agreement, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, the Democrat whose demands for a debate have held up Mr. Greenspan's confirmation, began making his case on the Senate floor that an excessive focus by Mr. Greenspan on reducing inflation was keeping the economy from growing to its full potential. **********But even as the Senate undertook its most extensive arguments to date over the Fed chairman's record, both Republican and Democratic leaders said they expected Mr. Greenspan to win easy confirmation. **********President Clinton renominated Mr. Greenspan to the job in February, and the Administration has remained firmly behind the nomination despite opposition from a few Democrats, led by Mr. Harkin. The Fed chairman's term expired in March, and he has been serving in an acting capacity since then. His new four-year term begins when he is confirmed. **********The agreement also unfreezes the nominations of two other appointees to the seven-member Fed Board of Governors -- Alice M. Rivlin, the White House budget chief, whom Mr. Clinton named to be the central bank's vice chairman, and Laurence H. Meyer, a St. Louis economist. Both are expected to win confirmation, although some Republicans have criticized Ms. Rivlin in recent days for what they said were misleading statements to Congress about Mr. Clinton's proposed budget. **********Senator Christopher S. Bond, a Republican of Missouri, said he wanted to ask  Ms. Rivlin how the Administration could make public proposed long-term cuts in spending programs even as it \"quietly tells political interest groups we're not  going to make the cuts.\" **********Responding to Mr. Bond, a White House official said that while President Clinton might shift spending between programs in future years, he would retain his commitment to reaching a balanced budget by 2002, and that the budget fight  should not affect Ms. Rivlin's nomination to the Fed. **********\"We are confident that the Senate will confirm all the President's three nominees for the Federal Reserve, and we will work with Congress to answer any questions they may have,\" the official said. **********The agreement to proceed with the debate and separate recorded votes for each of the nominees was worked out early today between the new Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, and the Senate minority leader, Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota. The Republicans had previously been unwilling to grant  Mr. Harkin's demand for three days of debate, and were happy to have the Democrats fighting among themselves over the nominations. But there was increasing concern within the Administration and in the Senate that further delay could unsettle the financial markets, leading to higher interest rates. **********\"I hope we can have a good back and forth among those who believe we ought to have a much more aggressive monetary policy than we do,\" Senator Daschle said. \"Once the Greenspan nomination is gone, we may not have that chance again for some time.\" **********Mr. Harkin's argument that the Fed under Mr. Greenspan has taken its war against inflation too far has little support among economists. But it has been welcomed by some industrialists, who feel that high interest rates are cramping  growth rates and that Mr. Greenspan does not appreciate how few upward pressures on prices the economy faces in an era of global competition. **********\"This debate about Chairman Greenspan's policies and their impact on the economy, about how we can get our economy to grow faster, about how we can create jobs and raise incomes, zeroes in on the most important issues we face,\"  Mr. Harkin said. **********Mr. Harkin said that Mr. Greenspan's \"almost obsessive\" concern with inflation had led him to misread the state of the economy and had \"stifled economic growth and the income of average Americans.\" **********Mr. Harkin said there was still some risk of inflation. But he said that unless the Fed was willing to \"take a chance\" on higher growth rates, the nation would never get a chance to see how fast the economy can expand without igniting inflation. **********Defending Mr. Greenspan, Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, a Republican, said the Fed chairman \"has been pretty good at bringing confidence\" to the financial  system, and that the real economic debate should not be over monetary policy, but over balancing the budget. **********\"We ought to be putting our energy in this body not so much in fighting the reappointment of Chairman Greenspan, but in being more fiscally responsible,\" he said. **********Mr. Greenspan was in Sweden today giving a speech on banking regulation. He has long defended his focus on reducing inflation as the best way to give the economy a stable foundation for growth. Mr. Greenspan has always said that he has no preconceived notion of how fast the economy can grow, and that he tries to stamp out inflation before it takes root by watching carefully for early warning signals of rising wages and prices. **********With the economy growing at a robust pace this quarter and unemployment low,  many economists expect Mr. Greenspan to push the Fed to raise interest rates in  July or August. Mr. Clinton, clearly concerned that a rate increase could slow the economy heading into the Presidential election, said last week that the Fed  should not raise rates if there is an absence of any signs of inflation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/30/business/treasury-securities-fall-in-price.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1996-08-30", "snippet": "Prices of US Treasury securities tumble; 30-year bond drops 22/32, to price of 96 15/32; yield rises to 7.03 percent, from 6.98 percent; graph (L)", "word_count": 633, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasury Securities Fall in Price", "print_headline": "Treasury Securities Fall in Price", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury securities tumbled yesterday on the unexpected strength of the latest economic statistics, which heightened investor fears that inflation would accelerate, forcing the Fed to tighten monetary policy soon. **********The 30-year bond dropped 22/32 , to a price of 9615/32  ; the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 7.03 percent, from 6.98 percent on Wednesday.

He added, ''Initial claims for unemployment insurance are still relatively low despite recent modest increases in both the weekly numbers and the four-week averages, second-quarter G.D.P. growth proved to be even stronger than initially reported, and new-home sales noticeably exceeded even the highest expectations.'' **********Mr. Fine said that ''the downward revision to business inventories increases the chances that third-quarter G.D.P. growth, while more moderate than the April-to-June period, will also exceed the Federal Reserve's trend rate of maximum, noninflationary growth, which implies a continued bias toward tightening on the part of both the Federal Open Market Committee and the bond market.'' **********The open market committee, the Fed panel that sets interest rate policy, last met on Aug. 20 and chose not to raise rates. But its next meeting is set for Sept. 24, and it is possible, though highly unlikely, that the committee could opt to shift rates even before then if other data are strong enough to alarm the central bank. **********According to Maureen Mooney, a market analyst with Gov Px, a bond pricing service, activity was average after deducting the volume of trading in 14-day cash management bills that were auctioned yesterday. **********The Government was selling $30 billion of the short-term bills to bridge a brief shortfall in cash flow expected in September. Dealers said the average rate at auction was 5.24 percent and the bid-to-cover ratio, a low 2 to 1, which reflected the weakness in the market generated by fears that the Fed would raise rates soon. **********Selling did quicken in the afternoon, but some traders suspect that investors who held long positions took advantage of some index-fund buying by portfolio managers to get out on an uptick after the recent price declines in the market. And because of the thinness in volume, price movements were exaggerated. **********Today, the Treasury market will have an abbreviated session and close early. Thus, with a shortened session and long weekend ahead of next week's employment report, few traders yesterday were willing to be buyers. **********Mr. Fine said that perhaps the bigger surprise was the jump in July new-home sales, which nearly matches the high for the year that was seen in February. **********The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 14-day cash management bills: **********(000 omitted in dollar figures) **********Average Price . . .   99.796       Discounted Rate . . .   5.24%       Coupon Yield . . .   5.33%       High Price . . .   99.797       Discounted Rate . . .   5.21%       Coupon Yield . . .   5.30%       Low Price . . .   99.795       Discounted Rate . . .   5.26%       Coupon Yield . . .   5.36%       Accepted at low price . . .   32%       Total applied for . . .   $60,065,000       Accepted . . .   $30,010,400       Noncompetitive . . .   $1,000,000 **********The 14-day cash management bills mature Sept. 17, 1996."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/07/business/mutual-funds-quarterly-report-globe-trotting-check-your-exchange-rate.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 882, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;Globe-Trotting?

This is because buying foreign securities means converting your investment dollars into another currency, a process that very likely will magnify or nullify your gains or losses. **********The challenge is to pick not just a winning portfolio, but also to do so in  countries whose currencies are climbing against the dollar, increasing the value of an American investor's profits, or are at least holding their own so those profits will not be reduced. This seems a particularly formidable task now because the dollar, which like most currencies tends to benefit from rising interest rates, is looking fairly muscular. **********\"My own view is that the dollar is more likely to be flat or up than down over the next five years,\" said Jonathan H. Francis, chief global strategist for Putnam Investments in Boston. **********How, then, does the mutual fund investor -- and funds are seen as the best way for most people to operate in overseas markets -- appraise the currency factor, one of the main determinants of total return? **********First, specialists say, realize that the news isn't all bad if the dollar rises against, say, the yen. While an investor in a Japanese-oriented fund would probably suffer from this, at least in the short term, a declining yen means that Japanese companies that export to the United States would find their  products relatively cheaper. So the drag from unfavorable currency translation will tend to be offset by the enhanced competitiveness of Japanese business. **********\"A lot of countries are export-led economies, and currency devaluation can thus greatly help corporate earnings\" there, said William F. Wendler 2d of Rowe  Price-Fleming International in Baltimore. **********But while this implicit hedge is a welcome offset in a stock fund, an investor in a foreign bond fund, which generally requires more hedging than a stock fund, would probably see any such benefit as trivial. **********Ideally, of course, investors would like their funds to achieve double-barreled profits by being on the right side of both the stock and currency markets. And except for a sharp upward spike in the first half of the 1980's, the dollar has been in a gradual downward trend for the last 20 years or more, adding a percentage point or two each year to the typical international portfolio. **********Against the mark, the dollar has dropped some 55 percent from its peak in early 1985, producing an extra gain of that amount for American investors in Germany. **********But even if you can count on such long-term wind at your back, the short run  can be unpleasant if you remain highly exposed to the swings of foreign currency, especially if your fund concentrates on a particular part of the world. **********As a result, most international and global funds -- the latter can invest in  the United States as well as abroad -- hedge their currency risk with forward or options contracts, though very few seek to eliminate all currency exposure. **********Although some risks, like those in Latin America, can be too costly or virtually impossible to hedge, most managers aim to do enough hedging to keep currency swings from spoiling returns but without trying to enhance them, either. **********\"I use hedging as an insurance policy to protect the underlying stock from a  potential devaluation,\" said Helen Young Hayes, portfolio manager for the Janus  Worldwide and Janus Overseas funds, based in Denver. Both have posted gains of about 20 percent so far this year. **********\"I do not speculate in currencies,\" she added. \"I am a stock picker, not a currency trader.\" **********About 70 percent of Ms. Hayes's yen exposure is currently hedged back to the  dollar compared with 40 percent to 50 percent for her European holdings. **********Although fund prospectuses mention their approaches to currency risk, the discussions tend to be fairly vague, typically on the order of, \"Hedging techniques are used from time to time.\" It is a good idea to inquire further. **********Investors probably would be wise to avoid funds that are fully hedged and those, like index funds, that never hedge, said Richard C. Pell, chief investment officer at Bank Julius Baer in New York, sponsor of the BJB International Equity fund, up about 12 percent this year. **********An especially bad idea, added Denise Downey, a portfolio strategist for Julius Baer's individual clients, is for an American to buy into a foreign money-market fund. \"A short-term fund denominated in a nondollar currency is really nothing more than a foreign-exchange trading vehicle,\" Ms. Downey said. **********She also cautioned against what she called the widespread belief that there is no currency risk in buying American depository receipts, which represent foreign shares trading in this country and are found in various equity fund portfolios. **********She and other specialists also said investors should avoid the psychological  trap of thinking that the currencies of major European countries or Japan, for which trading markets are highly liquid, do not require much attention. **********\"People get wooed into situations like Germany and France, thinking they're safe,\" Ms. Downey said. \"But they can still lose money.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/16/business/roche-and-bayer-are-said-to-form-joint-venture.html": {"writer_name": "Milt Freudenheim", "pub_date": "1996-09-16", "snippet": "Bayer AG and Roche Holdings Ltd are said to form joint venture in United States to sell Roche's Aleve analgesic and several other nonprescription drugs; arrangement will give Roche access to Bayer's powerful sales force and customer relationships ...", "word_count": 301, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Roche and Bayer Are Said to Form Joint Venture", "print_headline": "Roche and Bayer Are Said to Form Joint Venture", "body_text": " **********Bayer A.G. and Roche Holding Ltd. are forming a joint venture in the United States to sell Roche's Aleve analgesic and several other nonprescription drugs, people with knowledge of the deal said last night. **********The arrangement gives Roche, which assumed full ownership of Aleve from the Procter & Gamble Company in June, access to Bayer's powerful sales force and customer relationships in the struggle for shelf space in drugstores, supermarkets, mass merchandisers and convenience stores. **********Though neither side had released United States over-the-counter sales figures before the announcement expected today, drug industry analysts said that the Roche and Bayer products involved had about $800 million in combined sales last year. **********P.& G. spent about $200 million promoting Aleve, which was introduced in June 1994.

It works like this: Rather than trading stocks or their derivatives, the new managers trade combinations of options and other derivatives against the underlying stock, bond or currency.Whether the market moves up or down, the trader makes money. **********The technique is not brand new:Options dealers at Wall Street banks have been doing this kind of trading for years, and many of the banks use their own systems to make money from it. **********But volatility trading, newly applied to hedge-fund management, is poised to capture the imagination of an investing public weary of listening to so-called experts telling them that Wall Street is about to soar by another 20 percent or collapse tomorrow. **********\"Our approach is to say that we don't know whether a market is about to rush up or rush down,\"says Desmond Fitzgerald, a managers at the forefront of the volatility movement.\"But we have a view on whether or nota market is going to be volatile.We will take bets on whether the market will bounce around less or more than the consensus.\" **********Volatility trading depends on events that will move markets, though it may not be certain the direction that movement will take.

The fund will be listed in Luxembourg and is being sponsored by Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais SA, the French bank. **********Some market participants wonder if the general public is ready for such an esoteric concept. Others, like Tony Glickman, senior managing director of CIBC in Toronto, say that complexity is what makes volatility trading so exciting: \"The more discipline and analytical details that you have to go through, the more likely you are to find mispricing, which is potential profit.\" **********-"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/31/business/l-persistence-pays-in-getting-a-loan-040037.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 536, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Persistence Pays In Getting a Loan", "print_headline": "Persistence Pays In Getting a Loan", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********In 1990, I earned a Ph.D. in English literature and started my first real teaching job: a one-year appointment as a visiting assistant professor of English literature at Vassar College. Like Valerie Foley (\"No Credit Where It Is Due,\" From the Desk Of, Feb. 25), I had no credit history. I had no credit cards and no debt except for student loans that had not yet fallen due for repayment. **********Because I was now earning real money for the first time, and my faculty apartment was incredibly cheap, I decided I could afford a first car. With this  purchase in mind, I joined the TEG Credit Union in Poughkeepsie. I spotted the car I wanted: a silver-and-black 1987 BMW convertible, a steal at $18,500. I put down a (supposedly refundable) deposit for it and applied for the loan. **********I was devastated when my request was turned down. But I was determined to have that car. **********I immediately wrote a letter to a credit union loan officer -- and I used every trick of the classical rhetoric I had studied in graduate school. With all the eloquence I could command, I painted a picture of myself as a person of impeccable honor, who had paid immediately every debt incurred. **********Was it right, I asked, that I should be penalized for being virtually debt-free? I appealed to reason, showing that my income, given my low living expenses, was more than sufficient to cover the monthly payments. I pointed out  that the car was such a steal that even in a worst-case scenario, the credit union could not lose; the car would always be worth a good deal more than the amount of the loan. **********But I believe my key stroke was to repeat the credit union's own message back to it. I remember that a brochure had said that, unlike most banks, the credit union had been founded on the principle that a member's character, and not just  his financial history, would be a determining factor in loan decisions. (Indeed, I suspect that character, not financial status, is what really separates the probable deadbeat from the good credit risk.) **********I respectfully suggested that it either reconsider my loan request or reconsider the role of its founding principles in its current operations. **********A few days later I had no savings, no credit history, a one-year job in an almost impossible market, and a car loan in the amount of $16,687. (I borrowed the difference from my parents.) **********You can be sure my Composition students came to appreciate the value of knowing how to write a good letter after I told them that story. Within the year, I sold the car and, with the proceeds paid off the loan in full, with some left over. My next loan request was approved by the credit union the first time  around. **********I can only hope that other worthy people in the position of seeking credit have the good luck that I had in meeting with a loan officer who had the sense,  the nerve and the character to know a good credit risk when she saw one, and to  act upon that knowledge to the benefit of all concerned. **********PATRICE HANNON Manhattan, Feb. 25"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/28/business/apple-expects-it-will-lose-700-million.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "1996-03-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1191, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Apple Expects It Will Lose $700 Million", "print_headline": "Apple Expects It Will Lose $700 Million", "body_text": " **********Apple Computer said today that it expected to report a $700 million after-tax loss for its fiscal second quarter, a sign that the nation's third-largest personal computer maker is in even deeper financial trouble than had previously  been recognized. **********The company said that more than half of the loss it was projecting for the quarter, which ends March 31, would come from write-downs against more than $1 billion in unsold products.

Shortly after, he asked reporters for a 100-day grace period while he studied Apple's problems and formulated a strategy that would allow the computer maker to survive in a market that is increasingly dominated by Intel hardware and Microsoft software. **********Mr. Amelio was not available for comment today, but he said in a statement that he saw a way for Apple to survive -- although he did not provide details. **********\"I'm confident at this point that I know what the problems are and that they  are fixable,\" he said. \"The strategic and operating plans we are currently developing will enable us to build upon Apple's fundamental strengths and competitive position.\" **********Wall Street had been expecting a large loss, and even though today's announcement dwarfed most analysts' expectations, the company's stock rose on the news. The increase apparently reflected sentiment that Apple was taking necessary steps. Having drifted lately in the $23 range that only weeks ago was  deemed an insult when Sun proposed it as a takeover price, Apple's shares gained $1.375 today to close at $25.25. **********People close to the merger negotiations said that Sun's bailout offer had been made after Sun executives looked at Apple's financial situation and discovered the extent of the company's problems. **********And many investors are still betting against Apple. The number of \"short\" contracts, taken by people who are betting the company's stock price will continue to fall, has soared in the last three days. **********On Monday, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said that it was downgrading Apple's $305 million of senior debt to junk bond status. And today the Standard  & Poor's Corporation's Creditwatch revised its assessment of Apple's i.o.u.'s from \"developing\" to \"negative.\" S. &P. explained that with today's loss forecast by Apple, there was now less chance the company would be acquired -- which would have led to a ratings upgrade. **********While Mr. Amelio said that Apple was on track for a turnaround, other industry executives said that the computer maker might have already passed the point of no return. **********A former Apple executive, who spoke on the ground that he not be named, said  that the company's financial situation was so dire that he believed Apple was likely to be in the hands of its bankers, Citibank and Bank of America, by the end of the year. **********Because the $700 million figure the company cited today was an after-tax estimate, this executive said, Apple was probably taking pretax write-downs of as much as $550 million in manufacturing inventory and taking a pretax restructuring charge of $275 million. **********Today's forecast, he continued, also indicates that the company may be preparing for an operating loss of as high as $275 million -- a number suggesting that gross profit margins, which had already plunged to 16.4 percent  from 30.1 percent a year ago, are still in freefall. That in turn suggests that  the company has continued to move too slowly to reduce its expenses, he said. **********Analysts and dealers said that the company's first challenge was to restore consumer confidence, which has dipped notably in the months since its aborted deal with Sun. Earlier this month an industry trade paper, Computer Reseller News, reported that Apple's inventory in the hands of dealers had ballooned to 75 days' worth of products, compared with normal inventory of 20 to 30 days in Apple's dealer pipeline. **********Several dealers said that Apple had recently been holding auctions among distributors and swallowing deep discounts to help reduce inventories. **********But not all signs are negative. Computerware, one of company's largest dealers, with a chain of stores surrounding Apple's home turf in Silicon Valley, said that business, in dollar terms, had been at record levels so far this quarter. **********\"Our sales are great,\" said Kenneth Krich, Computerware's president. \"We're up 60 percent year-over-year for March. Our experience does not match what we're reading.\" **********And some industry experts contend that while Apple has a serious image problem with customers, the affliction is not necessarily fatal. **********\"The challenge for Apple is to restore people's confidence,\" said Roger McNamee, president of Integral Partners, a Menlo Park, Calif., technology investment firm. \"This is like a shark at the beach: people eventually go back in the water, but you want to make sure you get rid of the shark.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/16/world/in-heavy-smoking-grim-portent-for-china.html": {"writer_name": "Patrick Tyler", "pub_date": "1996-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1368, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Heavy Smoking, Grim Portent for China", "print_headline": "In Heavy Smoking, Grim Portent for China", "body_text": " **********Rushing down a Beijing alleyway where a north wind was kicking up dust among  the vegetable stands and cigarette vendors, Huang Jinhui, 25, paused to explain  to a stranger why he smokes. **********\"Man must smoke,\" said Mr. Huang, a young barber from Sichuan Province in central China. **********I know that smoking is not a good habit, that it's harmful to your health,\" he added. \"But I have no choice. To carry on social relationships and to do business, I have to smoke.\" **********In a nearby alleyway restaurant, where the tables were littered with empty beer bottles and oily plates and the air was a gauze of tobacco smoke, Fu Li, a  young woman from Henan Province, fiddled self-consciously with her cigarette. **********\"In the very beginning, it was just for fun,\" she said of her habit. \"When you play mah-jongg with friends, if someone offers you one, you cannot refuse. I never really think about the consequences.\" **********Few Chinese do, but that may be changing. **********China today has the biggest smoking habit in the world, with an estimated 300 million smokers out of 900 million adults, accounting for 30 percent of the world's consumption of tobacco. **********The per-capita consumption of Chinese smokers still lags behind some industrial countries, where as many as 22 cigarettes a day is the norm among smokers, but China is rapidly catching up. The average Chinese smoker went from  12 cigarettes a day a decade ago to 16 today. **********The governing Communist Party, which has built its legitimacy on doing a better job for the social welfare of the 1.2 billion Chinese than all the emperors and dictators of old, will soon be confronted with an epidemic of lung  cancer and respiratory and heart diseases that threatens to overwhelm its health establishment. **********The Government has recently begun to mobilize a national campaign against smoking. But this effort runs against a powerful tide of interests vested in the vast state-owned tobacco monopoly, which has become the world's largest cigarette producer and whose tax revenues are the Government's single greatest income source -- $8.6 billion in 1995. **********\"The tobacco industry is the No. 1 pillar of China's economic development, and so it is going to be a little difficult for us to get the smoking levels down in the near future,\" said Zhou Wei, a Public Health Ministry official assigned to combat smoking. **********The Government has banned tobacco advertisements from television, magazines and newspapers, but sports events are festooned with the trappings of tobacco products, as are billboards throughout the country. Beijing, Shanghai and other  major cities will try to enforce a ban on all smoking in public places, but health advocates, not to mention ordinary Chinese, are skeptical. **********The consequences of China's growing fondness for tobacco appear to be staggering. **********The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta say lung cancer rates are increasing 4.5 percent a year in China and estimate that by 2025, two  million Chinese will die of smoking-related illnesses each year -- four times the number of deaths today. **********China's smoking explosion has come much later than the West's, and so too will the medical consequences. **********\"In the West, we didn't see the full male lung cancer epidemic until the 1980's,\" said Richard Peto, an epidemiologist at Oxford University. Those cancers, he said, were spawned by the postwar increase in smoking, between 1945  and 1965, and by the time the crisis hit, smoking rates already were in decline. In China, per-capita tobacco consumption continues to rise. **********\"In the mid-1980's, I predicted that the risks from smoking in China were rather less than among British or American smokers,\" said Dr. Peto, largely because daily consumption levels were only half what they were in Western countries. **********\"But with more detailed evidence now available,\" he continued, \"we are saying that the risk is not less than for British or American smokers, and therefore at least 50 million of the children now living in China will be killed by tobacco.\" **********When the Communists swept into power in Beijing in October 1949, China's male population represented about 10 percent of the adult population in the world and smoked about 10 percent of the cigarettes consumed. Today, Chinese men are still roughly 10 percent of the world population, but they consume nearly a third of the world's cigarettes. **********Some 61 percent of adult males smoke in China, but only 7 percent of the women, according to the World Health Organization. (By comparison, 28 percent of American men smoke, and 24 percent of women.) **********But that big disparity between the sexes, too, is changing. More and more college and high school-age girls are embracing Western notions of women's independence, and cigarettes, along with bright makeup and tight jeans, have become symbols of the modern Chinese woman. **********\"China is about at the stage where the United States was in the 1940's and 1950's, where you have got very high male smoking rates and very few women smokers,\" said Judith Mackay, a Hong Kong-based doctor. **********As young women take up the habit, it will only get worse. **********\"If the Chinese smoke like Americans, then they will die like Americans,\" Dr. Peto said. **********Xiping Xu, an expert on China at Harvard University's School of Public Health, said: \"My biggest concern is that more and more high school and college  students are smoking. There is a lot of social pressure, and even the girl students are smoking.\" **********It has not helped that many Chinese icons, including Deng Xiaoping, the country's 91-year-old paramount leader, are lifelong smokers. **********Mr. Deng, whose health has seriously declined since 1993, is believed to have finally given up the habit, but his public image as a hard-grit revolutionary who rolled his cigarettes in newspaper engenders more admiration in China than opprobrium. **********Prime Minister Li Peng, however, has adopted a higher anti-smoking profile. As 3,000 delegates to China's National People's Congress, or parliament, gathered in the Great Hall of the People last week, Mr. Li chastised 100 deputies from Shandong Province when he found cigarettes for sale in their meeting room. \"Selling cigarettes here?\" he asked, noting that Beijing was preparing to enforce a ban on smoking in all public places and that this year's  session of the parliament was supposed to be smoke free. **********Wang Jinquan, who works for Beijing's housing department, said: \"I started to smoke when I was in high school. My father died at that time, and I felt so bad, people told me to smoke and relax.\" **********Looking more harried than relaxed, Mr. Wang added: \"In our hometown almost every person smokes. You know, it is easier to make business, or to make friends, when you draw out a cigarette and offer it to others. Without cigarettes and drinks, you can't get anything done in our town.\" **********Even among doctors, smoking is on the increase in China. **********Li Chunjiu, 58, a surgeon at Beijing Hospital, says he got his smoking habit  from a fear of snakes. **********When a huge flood struck central China five years ago, Dr. Li joined a team of 10 doctors and nurses who rushed there to help. But news that the flood zone  was crawling with snakes set him shivering. **********\"I heard that snakes are scared of cigarette smoke and the local farmers even lay tobacco leaves on the paths to keep the snakes away, so that is why I started smoking at the time,\" he said. \"But I haven't been able to quit.\" **********A pack of Chinese cigarettes costs as little as a nickel in the Chinese countryside and in the cities the best brands are less than 50 cents. Foreign brands, like Marlboro and Winston, cost more than $1.50 a pack because of high tariffs, which in turn have given rise to a robust smuggling industry. **********For all their attraction, foreign brand cigarettes have only a tiny share of  the legal Chinese market, 2 percent or less, said Robert Fletcher, chairman of the Tobacco Institute in Hong Kong. Still, policy advocates fear the aggressive marketing and advertising schemes of Western tobacco giants. **********Should China drop its barriers to foreign tobacco to enter the World Trade Organization, American and British tobacco companies are prepared. **********\"It wouldn't matter if every single smoker in America quit tomorrow,\" Dr. Mackay said, \"because the tobacco companies would have found a much bigger market.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/22/news/embittered-garuzzo-is-credited-with-firms-return-to-profitability-fiat.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Friedman", "pub_date": "1996-02-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Embittered Garuzzo Is Credited With Firm's Return to Profitability : Fiat Fires No. 3 Officer Days Before Agnelli Goes", "print_headline": "Embittered Garuzzo Is Credited With Firm's Return to Profitability : Fiat Fires No. 3 Officer Days Before Agnelli Goes", "body_text": " **********PARIS\u2014                     In a bitter corporate shakeup at one of Europe's biggest car makers, the Fiat group is ousting a top executive who helped to bring it back to profitability in recent years. **********The removal of Giorgio Garuzzo, Fiat group chief operating officer and former chairman of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, comes just days before Gianni Agnelli, 74, is set to resign as chairman. **********Mr. Agnelli is expected to leaveon Feb. 28 and turn Fiat over to Cesare Romiti, the embattled 72-year-old chief executive whose indictment on fraud and other charges is being sought by prosecutors in Turin. **********\"I am leaving against my will,\"Mr. Garuzzo, 57,said in a telephone interview Wednesday. \"Romiti didn't want me here and Romiti had me fired.I was given no explanation for my removal.

Several analysts remember conference calls in 1993 in which Toys \"R\" Us executives promised gains of as much as 50 percent in the company's international business. But many of the stores have failed to deliver. \"We gave projections, and we didn't meet them,\" Mr. Goldstein said. **********Each foreign market threw its own curveball at Toys \"R\" Us: a sluggish economy in Germany, a Christmastime strike in France and strong local competition in Australia. **********But while those forces were beyond its control, the company also made some strategic missteps, like choosing poor locations, and failing to negotiate prices on merchandise and real estate.    WITH its fortunes sagging at home and abroad last year, the retailer desperately needed a hot Christmas. Instead, it got slammed when no new video or toy products arose to rival the phenomenal success the previous year of the Power Ranger action figures and the spinoffs from the Disney hit movie \"The Lion King.\" Worse, discount stores slashed prices, forcing everyone to sell toys at a loss. **********After the disappointing holiday season, Toys \"R\" Us announced that it would take an after-tax restructuring charge of $270 million, equivalent to $397 million pretax, to close 22 stores in the United States and Europe and to consolidate distribution and administrative offices. Company officials acknowledge that the charge includes other sundry expenses, like inventory write-downs.  While the restructuring announcement caused them embarrassment, the charge makes it much easier for the company to achieve its fiscal 1997 earnings targets. **********A disclosure in January that the Federal Trade Commission had targeted Toys \"R\" Us in an antitrust investigation only made matters worse. The inquiry stemmed from complaints by wholesale clubs that the big retailer unfairly used its marketing power to discourage manufacturers from selling popular toys to them. **********Mr. Goldstein neither confirmed nor denied the accusations. **********Most analysts scoff at the investigation as a Washington sideshow, but antitrust lawyers are less dismissive. \"It is quite serious,\" said Richard M. Steuer, a partner at the law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler in New York. \"There are few categories where you have a retailer with as much power as Toys is perceived to have, so however it comes out is likely to set a precedent for other categories.\" **********The F.T.C. is expected to conclude the investigation within a month. **********But Toys \"R\" Us has even larger themes to wrestle with. Like many retailers that enjoyed boom days a decade ago, it must find new ways to lure in 1990's shoppers who have become accustomed to price wars and their spoils, and who are  eager for fresh concepts and new merchandise. In the 80's, all a retailer had to be was big and omnipresent. Now, it really needs to be clever. **********This has sent the entire industry to the analyst's couch: Every retailer wants to know what it has done wrong, and how it can be better, more self-aware  and more of a participant in its relationships with shoppers. But seducing new shoppers does not come by tweaking existing concepts -- it comes from reinventing them. This is the challenge for Toys \"R\" Us. **********To fend off interlopers and make its stores more inviting, Toys \"R\" Us is fighting back in three ways. First, it plans to roll out new stores known as Concept 2000, in both new locations and existing sites. These stores will be an  aesthetic antidote to the current spaces, which have the charm of a tenement basement. **********The 45,000-square-foot stores will have wider aisles and lower racks, so shoppers can see where things are and reach the merchandise. Each store will have a skylight. Colored tiles will replace the current gray floors, and fixtures will be festooned with colorful toyland icons. Employees who assemble bikes will do so in an open space, Santa's-workshop style, in the back of the store. The first of 16 Concept 2000 stores will go up in Raritan, N.J., this year. **********Then there's Babies \"R\" Us, a superstore devoted to the needs of the under-5  set. There will be furniture, clothing, diapers and formula, complete room models in the back and the all-important baby registry. Eight to 10 of these stores will pop up in 1996, the first in Westbury, L.I. **********Plan C brings together various ideas. In 1996, the company will put up two yet-to-be-named megastores: 90,000 square feet of toys and baby offerings that marry all of the stores' concepts, including Kids \"R\" Us, under one roof. All Toys \"R\" Us stores are meant to have better customer service. **********In the front of the giant marts, there will be a food vendor, most likely a McDonald's; a party room; a haircut salon, and a photo studio, all leased to franchisers. Elsewhere, there will be entertainment centers, breast-feeding rooms and a \"castle\" containing little girls' fitting rooms smack next to traditional girls' toys, intended to encourage cross-shopping. **********\"This is a big change from what we have been doing,\" said Mr. Goldstein, standing next to models of the three stores that sit alone on a table in a conference room. \"We think it is going to be great for us.\" **********AS Mr. Goldstein tells it, the fix he has in mind doesn't have to tie up a lot of cash and wreck margins. But much as he would like, he can't have it both  ways. If the roll-out is so guarded and snail-like, how much good can it really  do and how long will it take? **********\"It is quite expensive,\" Mr. Goldstein said, looking into the model of the Concept 2000. \"We would like to remodel all of our stores this way, but it depends on sales increases.\" **********He declined to say exactly how much this will cost, but analysts estimate that the company's capital expenditure budget in the current fiscal year will run in the neighborhood of $650 million, well over the $586 million the company  spent last year.. **********How much the company ultimately spends on the overhaul \"is absolutely material,\" said Peter Kupferberg, a portfolio manager at Gofen & Glossberg in Chicago, whose firm has slowly unloaded much of its holdings in the stock. \"If they can't stick to their numbers, that will only push margins further.\" **********At $27 a share, or 15 times next year's estimated earnings, about equal to what the overall market fetches, Toys \"R\" Us stock is not worth buying unless the company's management can keep sales growing at about 11 percent a year -- and fatten net margins back over 5 percent, more than triple last year's dismal  performance. This will be no easy trick if the company is also paying for expensive make-overs. **********Many investors think that Toys \"R\" Us has gone about as far as it can in the  United States, where it has captured about 23 percent of the $23 billion toy-and-video market. **********In their view, it will need strong international growth to push earnings growth. **********\"They can put up these new stores, but they are pretty saturated,\" said Greg  Jackson, a portfolio manager at Yacktman Asset Management in Chicago, which has  invested about $1.3 million in Toys \"R\" Us. \"The tremendous growth potential is  international, particularly in Japan.\" **********He said Toys \"R\" Us did not have a Kmart or a Wal-Mart to do to it overseaswhat they did to it here. The company has 37 stores in Japan and will add 14 more this year, putting it in a dominant position in that market, too. **********ANOTHER drag on domestic growth could be shopper inertia. \"The perception of  bad customer service at Toys was built up over many years and I think even at places where you've seen improvement, shoppers may not see it right away,\" said  Sean P. McGowan, a retail analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison. **********Mr. Jackson said he was looking for the shares to increase by about $8 to about $35 over the next 18 months as the company's earnings growth rebounds. \"If you compare it historically, this stock is extremely cheap.\" he said. \"But we are looking at slower growth rates for the future.\" **********For investors, the questions remain: Why did Toys \"R\" Us wait so long to explore new opportunities, and can the same team that got them into this jam lead them out? \"We first started to think of making changes in late 1994,\" Mr. Goldstein said. \"We saw a number of things happening. The expansion of Baby Superstores, of educational stores and the price aggressiveness of discount stores. We looked at all that and said, 'To meet the challenge going forward, what should we do?' \" **********Yet it seems odd that it took the folks at corporate headquarters until the end of 1994 to turn their thoughts to these issues, given that the discount chains have been turning on the heat since the early 1990's, educational stores  have been rolling out since the beginning of the decade and the Baby Superstores concept was well under way by then, too. **********\"It is clear they should have done this five years ago,\" said Mr. Bryant of Rodman & Renshaw. **********What is more, plenty of other retailers who don't even sell toys figured out  long ago that parents needed a place to park tots. Ikea, the Swedish discount-furniture chain that invaded the United States a few years ago, has huge playrooms just waiting to be destroyed in its warehouse-like megastores. Barnes & Noble Jr. has live entertainment and readings for little shoppers. Even supermarkets often offer entertainment for kids, like rides for a quarter out front. **********EVEN smaller companies have figured out the lure of pure fun. Noodle Kidoodle, an educational toy store based on Long Island, has a big-screen television that shows children's videos, and offers in-store use of computers to try out software. No one accuses this company of being short on cash, given its  propensity for stock buybacks and its solid balance sheet. But Toys \"R\" Us is not used to pouring money into aesthetic improvements, and the addition of better and more workers on the floor will certainly take a bite out of the balance sheet. **********Clearly, keeping costs in check is no easy task. Toys \"R\" Us beefed up its advertising budget by 10 percent last year, and will do so the same in 1996. Selling, general and administrative costs crept up from 19 percent to 20 percent of sales last year. \"Mystery shoppers\" now visit stores and report back to management on customer service. **********And to help reduce the hopeless clutter of its stores, Toys \"R\" Us has also said it will reduce its store offerings from 15,000 to 11,000 items. **********In a nod to stores like Zany Brainy, Noodle Kidoodle and Learningsmith, all regional toy stores offering wholesome playthings, Toys \"R\" Us will throw more educational toys into the mix and make the current ones more visible. **********While Mr. Goldstein has always played down the threat factor of educational stores, shoppers seem to love them. In a recent visit to Natural Wonders, an educational store in Louisville, Doris Walker cruised the serene ailes with her  9-year-old granddaughter, Whitney Kelsey. **********\"I can see the appeal,\" said Mrs. Walker. \"Everything is touchable.\" **********Paring down the merchandise and rolling out new stores will take buying genius, and some spectators wonder if Mr. Goldstein and the president of his stores, Robert C. Nakasone, could use some help. **********Mr. Nakasone comes from the supermarket industry, a background that many analysts say has worked for Toys \"R\" Us, with its emphasis on keeping a tight cost structure, but also against it by perpetuating a warehouse mentality in the display of goods. \"They sell toys like cabbages,\" Mr. Bryant said. **********While executive-search firm executives tend to praise the entire Toys \"R\" Us  team, it is getting a little long in the tooth. True, to help start its expansion plan, it has called on outside consultants and even hired a new merchandising manager for Kids \"R\" Us. But all the top executives have been at the company for at least five years. Mr. Goldstein has been around for 13 years, and Mr. Nakasone for 11. **********\"The two senior people running this business are in finance and operations,\"  said a person who works closely with the company and spoke on condition of anonymity. \"What is essential now is that a strong merchandising acumen come into this.\" **********Mr. Goldstein said he felt that his company has \"the best merchandising team  around,\" and didt seemed moved by the idea of hiring new people for the executive suite. **********So what's the investor to make of all this? Given the maturity of the domestic business, the growing number of competitors breathing down the company's neck and the uncertainty abroad, investors are resigned to one fact: \"It's never going to be the growth stock it once was,\" said Marina Carlson, a portfolio manager at Strong Capital in Milwaukee, which holds around a million Toys \"R\" Us shares. Nonetheless, she thinks the stock has potential for growth. **********\"We'd be happy at 10 to 12 percent,\" she said. **********Several product introductions -- like new Star Wars figures, fresh Nintendo 64 videos and toys that spin off the films \"101 Dalmatians,\" \"Toy Story,\" and \"Space Jam\" -- should bolster Toys \"R\" Us this year. And the retailer is counting -- perhaps incorrectly -- on discounters to let up on the price wars, and for shoppers to catch on quickly to the store's operational changes. **********MR. GOLDSTEIN does not seemed fazed by hard times.  The company's headquarters in Paramus are just a few miles from one of the busiest Toys \"R\" Us stores in the country. Inside, Mr. Goldstein's office walls are plastered with framed comic strips and drawings that celebrate his company and its world-renowned name. **********\"This one is from the time we were really big,\" he said almost reverently, pulling at the corner of a framed old news clip. \"And we'll be there again.\" But for now, the models of his dreams sit on a table in a silent conference room, eerily alone."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/01/business/international-business-china-s-move-on-news-flow-worries-us.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1996-02-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 589, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;China's Move On News Flow Worries U.S.", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;China's Move On News Flow Worries U.S.", "body_text": " **********Two weeks after China announced a broad plan to restrict the flow of news and economic information into China, the Clinton Administration said today that it would raise the subject in trade talks next week, the first indication that China's efforts to control Western news operations may soon become a new source of friction between the two countries. **********\"This is, of course, an issue of free speech and censorship, but it is also at the heart of our trade relationship,\" said Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative. \"We don't know how China plans to implement its restrictions, but clearly it is a step in the wrong direction.\" **********While the Administration has chosen to treat China's restrictions, announced on Jan. 16, as an impediment to trade, Beijing clearly regards it as an issue of national security. The order was directed at the Reuters and Dow Jones news services, which are selling economic information and political news in China. They are now required to be supervised by the official New China News Agency, which will have control over the content of its news reports. The agency will also control their marketing to Chinese customers, which creates another trade problem: Dow Jones and Reuters are competing with the state press agency's own products. **********Mr. Kantor said today that the wording of the restriction was so broad that American officials were uncertain how they would be applied. The announcement of the new regulations included the warning that \"foreign economic information providers will be punished in accordance with the law if their released information to Chinese users contains anything forbidden by Chinese laws and regulations, or slanders or jeopardizes the national interests of China.\" **********China regards all sorts of economic statistics as property of the state, and  it has periodically prosecuted Chinese reporters for revealing classified economic data -- usually statistics considered routine in Japan, the United States and Europe. But it has never tried to do the same with foreign news organizations. **********China's usual model in controlling information -- and other economic machinery -- is Singapore, the tightly controlled city-state whose economy, led  by ethnic Chinese, has been one of the wonders of Asia. But even in Singapore, Western news is usually filtered for sexual or political content, not financial  data. **********Mr. Kantor said the restrictions would be raised next week in Beijing by Lee  Sands, who directs the China desk of the trade representative's office. Putting  the issue at Mr. Sands's level, a State Department official said today, \"keeps this from getting too political, too ideological. By treating it as a trade barrier, we hope to keep the issue somewhat contained.\" Mr. Sands's chief mission is to press China for compliance with an agreement signed last year to protect American software, movies and videos from piracy. **********The financial information business has been a booming one in China, with several news organizations attempting for the first time to sell data to Chinese securities houses, businesses and semigovernmental agencies. Some American officials have argued that the Chinese Government's restrictions will collapse of their own weight, once Chinese businesses begin to fall behind, because they  cannot get up-to-date information on economic conditions. **********But in the short term it could greatly limit trade with China, and it is particularly a threat to Hong Kong, over which China will regain control in July 1997. uHong Kong has always been the financial information center of Southeast Asia, and it is unclear whether the new Chinese restriction will apply there after it reverts to China's control."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/30/world/russia-given-a-deal-to-repay-40-billion-debt.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1996-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 536, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Russia Given a Deal to Repay $40 Billion Debt", "print_headline": "Russia Given a Deal to Repay $40 Billion Debt", "body_text": " **********Russia got up to seven years' more breathing space today on repaying more than $40 billion of the accumulated debt it owes to foreign governments, possibly giving another lift to President Boris N.

Until then, Russia would pay only interest, he said, explaining that it would now owe $2 billion this year, compared with $8 billion it would have owed without any rescheduling. The  amounts will increase as time passes and as the Russian economy makes a successful transition to the free market. **********\"The Russian delegation described the economic and financial difficulties faced by its country and its strong determination to reduce the economic and financial imbalances,\" the creditors' communique said after the talks ended early today.

But the practice among physicists of observing a phenomenon, creating a testable hypothesis, then sometimes elevating that hypothesis to a named law has become a popular hobby in other fields. For example, the laws of motion in physics have been joined by the laws of markets in economics. **********And as information technology and computer science have risen to prominence  in the economy, they have given rise to a few laws of their own. These lie somewhere between the laws of physics, which are not all exactly true, and the laws of economics, which are not all exactly false. Einstein showed that Newton's laws were false, except for practical purposes. As for the various laws of economics, we can expect one to prove true any day now, but don't hold your breath. **********In this day and age, one way to judge the importance of laws is by counting  references to them on the Internet's World Wide Web. (O.K., there are other ways, but we are talking about computer-related laws here.) The last time I checked, Grosch's Law, discredited for a decade now, is mentioned on today's Internet 58 times. There are 67 references to something I once said -- now known as Metcalfe's Law and some 500 references to Moore's Law. Brooks's Law gets 28 mentions; Wirth's Law, none. This probably means he never said it, not uncommon  in the laws business. **********By comparison, there are 700 references to Newton's Law and 2,000 references to Murphy's Law: if anything can go wrong, it will. Got to hand it to Murphy. You may be wondering about what law of computing comes next; I certainly am. I suspect the next big law will be something about commerce on the Web or parallelism or biological computing. Who knows, perhaps the next law of computing will be named after you. It won't be named after Microsoft's chief executive, the multibillionaire William H. Gates, who in computing is seen as a  law unto himself. **********But while you are waiting, here is a quick look at some computing laws; one  obsolete, one in its prime, one on the rise and three that are elegant expressions of pique computing's equivalent of Murphy's Law. **********GROSCH'S LAW Bigger Computers Are Better **********Grosch's Law was one of the first laws of computing. The computing pioneer Herbert R.J. Grosch first observed in 1953 that the cost of a computer grows only as the square root of its speed -- bigger computers are better. Mr. Grosch  says he was dismissed twice from I.B.M., which might have thought at the time that he was underpricing their larger mainframes. Mr. Grosch had the temerity to name his own law after himself. **********MOORE'S LAW Smaller Computers Are Better **********Moore's Law overthrew Grosch's Law. Gordon E. Moore, founder and now chairman of the Intel Corporation, projected in 1965 that the logic density of silicon integrated circuits -- their raw computing power -- would grow exponentially each year. With an annually compounded doubling of chip densities  since 1965, it has turned out that bigger computers are not better, smaller computers are. (Goodbye, mainframes. Hello, PC's.) This also means that if you can afford to put it off until next year, don't buy a computer this year. Moore's Law will reign in Silicon Valley until he retires. **********METCALFE'S LAW Connected Computers Are Better **********Metcalfe's Law is named after me, but not by me. In 1980, I promoted computer networking standards, like the Internet, by arguing that the value of a network can be measured by the square of its number of users. More simply: Connected computers are better. Having the only telephone in the world would be of zero value, but this value increases for each new telphone it can call. **********The author George Gilder elevated my arguments to the status of a law in a preview of his forthcoming book, \"Telecosm.\" Mr. Gilder says that Metcalfe's Law compounds Moore's and so Microsoft had better pay more attention to the Internet. **********GROVE'S LAW Monopolies Generally Slow Things Down **********Andrew S. Grove is Mr. Moore's longtime partner, now chief executive of Intel. Grove's Law, according to Mr. Moore, holds that the telecommunications bandwidth doubles every hundred years. This has become Mr. Grove's way of complaining about the underperformance of the telephone monopolies over the last 50 years as compared with the performance of the highly competitive computer industry. **********BROOKS'S LAW The More Workers, The Later It's Done **********Software is difficult to develop. In his classic book on the process, \"The Mythical Man-Month,\" Frederick P. Brooks, a former I.B.M. software developer and now a professor of computer science at the University of North Carolina, introduced what has come to be called Brooks's Law: Adding manpower to a late software project make it later. Mr. Brooks saw his law operating at I.B.M. in the 1960's, when the joke was that if I. B. M. asked its programmers to jump a 100-foot gorge, a hundred of them would each jump one foot. **********WIRTH'S LAW Machines May Leap, But Programs Creep **********Software consistently fails to make good use of the latest hardware. According to a law sometimes attributed to a software pioneer, Nicklaus Wirth, a professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, software gets  slower faster than hardware gets faster. Wirth's Law can be traced all the way back to Mr. Grosch and is often paraphrased today with the names of the chief executives of Intel and Microsoft: \"Grove giveth and Gates taketh away.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/16/business/company-reports-shift-by-company-will-bring-in-more-outsiders.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1996-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1080, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY REPORTS;Shift by Company Will Bring in More Outsiders", "print_headline": "COMPANY REPORTS;Shift by Company Will Bring in More Outsiders", "body_text": " **********Responding to widespread criticism of insider domination of the company's board, the directors of the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company yesterday unanimously approved a series of proposals that would turn majority control of the board over to a group of outside directors, according to company officers and a member of the board. **********Under the proposals, several of the 17 current directors would not be able to stand for re-election at the next annual meeting of Archer-Daniels in the fall. **********But some large investors said that such changes did not go far enough in addressing the problems at Archer-Daniels, the agribusiness giant. As a result,  at least one influential institutional investor said it would begin preparing its own proposals on revamping the board and seek a shareholder vote. **********The recommendations were presented in a report by a corporate governance committee formed at the last annual meeting in October. **********\"The board has accepted the report unanimously, and approved every proposal without exception,\" said Ray A. Goldberg, a professor of business at Harvard University who helped lead the governance committee. \"This makes A.D.M. consistent with the best governance procedures of all the major corporations in  the United States.\" **********Still, little change is expected anytime soon at the company, which is based  in Decatur, Ill. At yesterday's meeting, some current outside directors were named to board committees. But the composition of the full board is not expected to change until at least the October meeting. **********The governance committee was formed as Archer-Daniels faced a revolt by big investors that resulted in as much as 20 percent of the shares being voted against the company's slate of directors at the meeting last October. **********The investors said that the directors were failing to treat a Federal criminal investigation of the company's business practices seriously, in large part because of their close ties to management. The investigation concerns accusations that senior Archer-Daniels officers engineered a widespread price-fixing conspiracy with competitors. **********Three grand juries are investigating whether Archer-Daniels conspired to fix  prices for several food additives and animal feed, including lysine, high-fructose corn syrup and citric acid. The investigation was sparked by Mark  Whitacre, a former senior executive at Archer-Daniels who worked for several years as a secret informant for Government prosecutors. **********Despite the intended changes, some critics of the company remained unimpressed. **********\"What you have got here is a very minimal response,\" said Edward Durkin, director of special projects for the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, which owns about 775,000 shares of Archer-Daniels. \"And it's hard to tell at this point whether the response means anything.\" **********Mr. Durkin said the union had sent proposals to the committee a few weeks ago, including suggestions that all board committees be composed of independent  directors and that directors be held personally liable in instances of gross negligence. But the union received no response. As a result, Mr. Durkin said the union would bring its proposals before the shareholders at the next annual meeting. **********Still, some analysts praised Archer-Daniels for agreeing to any change, given its history under its strong-willed chairman, Dwayne O. Andreas. **********\"The fact that Dwayne Andreas and the board were willing to announce that they would do this was a surprise to some,\" said Leonard Teitelbaum, an analyst  at Merrill Lynch & Company. \"Clearly, the board has heard the message that was delivered at the last annual meeting.\" **********In the report, the governance committee recommends that the board be reduced  from its current size of 17 to a minimum of 9 members and a maximum of 15. And regardless of the board's size, the report says, most of the directors should have no other affiliations with the company. **********The report defines outside director as someone who is not a current or former Archer-Daniels executive, has no material business or professional relationship  with the company, has no close family relationship with the company's management and is not receiving compensation from the company other than as a director. **********On the board now, 10 directors are current or former Archer-Daniels executives, or are related to such executives. Several others have been criticized for what some shareholders contend are outside financial relationships with the company or its officers. **********Under the proposals, board members who are now younger than 70 would not be permitted to run for re-election once they reach that age. According to Mr. Goldberg, that means that at least two current directors would be forced to step down this year. They are Mr. Goldberg himself and Happy Rockefeller, a longtime  friend of Mr. Andreas and the widow of Nelson A. Rockefeller. **********While a number of other directors will also have to step aside under the proposals, Mr. Goldberg indicated that no decision had yet been made by anyone. **********\"Over the next few months, there will have to be a number of people who will  rethink what their appropriate role is on the board, and whether they should be  on the board,\" he said. \"It will be for each individual member, together with the nominating committee, to figure out what's best for the company and its shareholders.\" **********The report also suggested that the compensation of directors be reviewed to insure that it is in line with that of other large companies. It said that health and retirement benefits should not be provided to any nonmanagement directors. To tie the interests of the directors to those of the shareholders, the report recommends that half the compensation of directors be in some form of company stock. **********Despite what apparently was the unanimous acceptance of the proposals, the company was skittish about disclosing any action. In a statement yesterday, Mr.  Andreas said that the report had his \"strong support\" and that he had requested  that the recommendations \"be seriously reviewed and considered as the framework  for future implementation.\"He also said that the board would accept having more  outside directors. **********Also yesterday, Archer-Daniels said that its net income for the second quarter, which ended on Dec. 31, had risen 2.7 percent, to $226 million, or 43 cents a share. That compares with $220.1 million, or 41 cents a share, in the second quarter of last year. **********The company, which operates under a great deal of secrecy because many of its rivals are privately held, does not announce its revenue figures, but discloses  them later in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********Analysts were impressed by the financial performance. \"The numbers were surprisingly good,\" Mr. Teitelbaum of Merrill Lynch said. \"The company is proving that it can run a business even in the most difficult environment.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/30/world/kohl-is-an-iron-man-but-the-price-is-high.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1996-10-30", "snippet": "Helmut Kohl, who presided over Germany's reunification in 1990, will become country's longest serving Chancellor since Bismarck on October 30; will set record as postwar Germany's most durable leader, surpassing Konrad Adenauer's 14 years from 194...", "word_count": 1667, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kohl Is an Iron Man, but the Price Is High", "print_headline": "Kohl Is an Iron Man, but the Price Is High", "body_text": " **********Helmut Kohl, who presided triumphantly over Germany's reunification in 1990, is about to become his country's longest serving Chancellor since Bismarck, who first fused the land 125 years ago. **********On Oct. 31, Mr. Kohl is to set the record as postwar Germany's most durable leader, surpassing Konrad Adenauer's 14 years from 1949 to 1963, when Germany was rebuilt from the ruins of war into a European powerhouse. But even at this moment of tribute, his longevity is beginning to exact a price. **********A central gamble of Mr. Kohl's 14 years in office -- his decision to cushion the pain of reunification with unparalleled financial largess -- has produced at best mixed results from the staggering $600 billion in subsidies, incentives and aid that has poured into the former East Germany in the last six years. **********The spending proved politically expedient for Mr. Kohl's electoral fortunes, but many economic analysts now say it was half-baked, tying Bonn to years of taxes and budget commitments that conflict increasingly with his defining vision of European unity forged in fiscal restraint. **********Mr. Kohl himself disarmingly acknowledged at his Christian Democratic party congress in Hanover this month that adding up the sums is not his strongest suit. But in a speech earlier to mark the sixth anniversary of reunification, even he finally admitted that fusing the two Germanys would take much longer than the five years in which, he once predicted, eastern Germany would become a place of ''blossoming landscapes.'' **********''The picture that Mr. Kohl painted in 1990 was too colorful, and was not based on facts and figures,'' said Christian Jacke, Leipzig's Economics Director. ''The five years have gone, and people are asking: where are these beautiful landscapes?'' **********The approach of the 66-year-old Mr. Kohl's record-setting anniversary has inspired much musing about precisely how a provincial politician beloved of solid food, labored jollity and postponed decisions took his place among Germany's titans. **********Mr. Kohl has not publicly discussed his political longevity in great detail, and he declined to be interviewed for this article. Those who chart his success, including even his adversaries in eastern Germany, point to his political prowess, a weak opposition and Germans' general satisfaction with the stability that has followed the fall of Communism. **********''There's a conservative way of thinking,'' said Lothar Tippach, the leader in Leipzig of the Democratic Socialist Party, the successor to the East German Communists. ''So the people say: We want stability, peace, no huge changes. We've had enough huge changes here already.'' **********But when they contemplate the fruits of reunification, many Germans still find it hard to look beyond a curtain of increasing bitterness between easterners, who tend to see westerners as exploiters, and westerners, who regard the east as an unworthy sinkhole for their tax money. **********Up to 35 percent of eastern Germans in towns like Dessau, 40 miles north of here, are without real work. Eastern German productivity is only half of the western level. Most worrying of all, a culture has taken root that puts subsidies from Bonn at the center of political and economic life. **********''Without subsidies and incentives, there'd be no investment at all,'' said Hans-George Otto, the Mayor of Dessau. **********In 1990, Mr. Kohl acted with uncharacteristic boldness to reunify his country, welding the two uneven sides of Germany with his decision to swap worthless East German marks for rock-solid Deutsche marks at a rate of one to one. **********Overnight, eastern Germans living for three generations under dictatorship -- first Hitler's, then the Communists' -- were propelled into a competitive western society that few could absorb. **********Politically, the decision was seen as inevitable and adroit. Indeed, such was the eastern German clamor for the coveted currency that Mr. Kohl saw no other options. But economists shuddered at the implications of long-term commitment to an eastern economy distorted by huge injections of money that it could not earn. **********For all the advances that have been made in roads, telephones, wages and prosperity in eastern Germany, a visitor's primary impression is of landscapes blossoming with construction cranes -- emblems of a building industry that has peaked -- and of contradictions. **********True, wage levels in the east have risen to 75 percent of those in the west. And eastern Germans are slowly beginning to produce and buy their own goods instead of importing virtually everything from the west. **********But as Government leaders in Bonn have begun to acknowledge, Government spending in the east will continue for years to come in business subsidies, early retirement pensions and unemployment benefits -- precisely the outlays that Mr. Kohl wants to reduce in preparation for a single European currency, a major step toward his all-consuming dream of European unity. **********And for the foreseeable future, the German taxpayer will continue to foot an unwelcome bill. Just this month the Bonn Government faced the embarrassment of postponing yet again a promised reduction in the hated 7.5 percent income tax surcharge that finances eastern development -- the exact opposite of the painless transition that Mr. Kohl once promised. **********Some specialists make a telling comparison with those Central European economies with which East Germany was once inextricably linked in the Comecon trade bloc. **********There, in countries like Poland and the Czech Republic, Mr. Jacke said, ''they have lower living standards, lower labor costs, lower standards of social services.'' **********''But they have built step by step and they have built by themselves,'' he added, ''which is not something that's happened in eastern Germany.'' **********''We have to ask whether the way we did things makes people move forward,'' he said, referring to the huge amounts of Government support. ''That's really the question: why should people move?'' **********Between them, Jorg Hofmann and Ursula Finke provide some answers to that question. **********For many years in East Germany, they were colleagues in the research section of Leuchtenbau Leipzig, a state-owned lighting company that employed 1,100 people and shipped street lamps and other products to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe under market-defying rules that blended barter with distorted exchange rates to balance Comecon's books. **********He was the boss of the department; she was a draftswoman. ''It wasn't good pay, it wasn't bad,'' said Mrs. Finke, 40. But it was steady. **********Then came the collapse of Communism and with it the instant crumbling of the controlled Comecon marketplace on which East Germany was totally dependent. **********Companies like Leuchtenbau Leipzig, and untold others in eastern Germany, were left with huge wage bills in a currency they did not have and could not earn, no new orders and a product line that could not compete against the corporate raiders from what Germans call the pushy ''elbow society'' of the west. **********''The competition was completely uneven,'' Mr. Jacke said. Not only that, Mayor Otto of Dessau said, the whole process of selling off bankrupt and run-down eastern German companies to private buyers wrote another dark and resentful chapter. **********In his own town, for instance, he said, a western company bought the local brewery for knock-down prices, sold off its assets, moved the production center to Munich, in western Germany, and flooded the market with its own brands. Faced with this invasion of capital and expertise and an overwhelming urge to crush potential challengers, he said, the local brewery simply died. **********These days Dessau's unemployment is 20.1 percent, twice the national level. But if other elements are factored in -- people sent into early retirement, on re-retraining courses and in Government-sponsored job programs -- the true figure is 35 percent: one in three people without real work. **********At Leuchtenbau Leipzig, the story was different because Mr. Hofmann got there first -- with a little help from friends. **********By 1993 only 130 of the Communist-era work force of 1,100 remained. The company had run up $20 million of debt. It went bankrupt. And that is when Mr. Hofmann and Mrs. Finke went their different ways -- he to join the fledgling ranks of small-business men, she to the unemployment lines, a destination she shared (and still shares) with many other women and older men. **********But Mr. Hofmann secured $400,000 in seed money from the local state government to buy equipment from Leuchtenbau Leipzig and set up his own company, Leipziger Leuchten. Modeling himself a little on the ''elbow society'' of the west, he quickly learned to pull political strings to secure orders and to play the game of securing government subsidies. **********''No one tells you how to do it, but you find out,'' he said. **********This year Mr. Hofmann, 49, turned what he called a ''very good'' profit on a turnover of $3.3 million -- respectable productivity ratings for a staff of 16 full-time employees -- and won the ''Golden Saxon'' award from the state authorities for his spirit of enterprise. **********Mrs. Finke, his colleague, has different memories. **********''It was a dark moment,'' she said. ''Nineteen years, and the people you were working with, your friends, all had to go.'' She went, too: first to the unemployment lines, then to a Government-financed job training program to qualify as a saleswoman for office equipment. **********Materially, the suffering was not too bad: her husband still had a job, and she was drawing unemployment pay. But to this day she has not found another job. **********Across the landscape of eastern Germany, it is people like Mr. Hofmann, not Mrs. Finke, who provide what Chancellor Kohl sees as the hope of the future -- just as it is small-  to medium-sized businesses that provide the backbone of the western German economy. **********But the Hofmanns and Finkes are a minority: surveying a rain-swept industrial park on Leipzig's outskirts, where his modest factory is located, Mr. Hofmann reckoned that he could count on one hand the number of home-grown eastern businesses there. **********Anywhere else, such stories of stuttering progress and future perils might spell political ruin for their author. **********But at their congress this month, Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democrats gave him a standing ovation for an uneventful speech and re-elected him as their leader with 95 percent of the vote -- in effect endorsing him for the 1998 national election and thus an opportunity for a fifth four-year term, outstripping even Bismarck's 19 years from 1871 to 1890 in Germany's political longevity stakes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/20/business/jackson-deal-with-a-prince.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jackson Deal With a Prince", "print_headline": "Jackson Deal With a Prince", "body_text": " **********Michael Jackson, the American singer, and Prince Walid bin Talal, the Saudi investor, announced today that they had formed a venture, King Entertainment, to promote entertainment based on \"family values.\" **********A spokesman said the company was considering opening offices worldwide to develop projects including movies, books, hotels, recordings and theme parks.

Nau writes in a new book, \"Trade and Security,\" published by the American Enterprise Institute, \"trade policy has been increasingly isolated from other U.S. foreign-policy interests in a single-minded pursuit to capture exports and high-wage jobs for the American economy.\" **********As a result, Mr. Nau says, \"the standard of trade-policy success becomes a cellular-telephone agreement with Japan that benefits one American company (the 1993 agreement giving Motorola Inc. access to the Nagoya-Tokyo market), rather than a new post-Uruguay trade round that commits the United States, Japan and Europe to early integration with reforming countries in the former Communist and developing worlds.\" **********Instead of alienating its allies, Mr. Nau argues, Washington should make trade policy just one ingredient of a strategy to deal with potential threats to America's national security around the world and advance its overall political and economic interests. **********Mr. Nau ends up going too far with this. He suggests, for example, that the United States should allow China to join the World Trade Organization, as Japan and other Asian nations want, in exchange for Japanese and South Korean backing for efforts to rid North Korea of nuclear weapons. **********That loses sight of the main aim of the operation \u2014 to get China to accept the rules of the game in international trade \u2014 which has to be negotiated with China, not Japan. **********But Mr. Nau puts his finger on one key cause of Kantoritis. **********That is the widespread misconception that, with the Cold War over, the United States is at loggerheads with its industrial allies for a share of world trade and economic wealth, just as it was previously in military competition with the Soviet Union. **********That belief lies behind the \"strategic trade\" theories, so popular with President Bill Clinton's administration, which call for managed trade to carve up international markets, combined with interventionist domestic policies to protect and subsidize high-wage, advanced-technology industries, often patterned on the so-called Asian model. **********Although a conflicting, more free-trade-oriented strand of thinking led Mr. Clinton to support the North American Free Trade Agreement and the setting up of the World Trade Organization, that vision is increasingly losing out to special interests, Mr. Nau says. **********But trade rivalry among friends is not the same as military warfare. **********In an important sense, Mr. Nau writes, \"the industrial nations already constitute a single democratic civil society or community in which major political or geopolitical conflicts do not exist.\" **********The interventionist approach ignores the dramatic improvement in U.S. competitiveness since the 1980s, which was due to free trade, competition and flexible labor and capital markets, not to \"strategic trade\" weaponry. **********\"The American-British model of deregulation is at least a decade ahead of the Asian-German model of industrial policy in moving jobs and capital into the information economy,\" Mr. Nau writes. **********Rather than mimic the authoritarian Asian model, America should work with its allies to continue to liberalize world trade and bring more countries into the democratic, open-market fold.

Am I making a fool out of myself?\"' said Krajicek, 24, the first Dutchman to win a Grand Slam title. \"But nobody was laughing so I knew it was all right.\" **********Later, while posing for photographers, Krajicek was trying to hold the trophy as if it were a baby when the lid fell off. Meanwhile Washington was pretending to toss his runners-up plate like a Frisbee and flashing his chest like the streaker who four hours earlier had helped start their match on the right foot. **********Krajicek's parents had him registered with the Dutch tennis federation by the time he was 6. Between them, Krajicek and Washington had 13 career titles \u2014 one-third as many as Pete Sampras, the three-time defending champion knocked out by Krajicek last week \u2014 and neither had any prospects of winning when the world's greatest tennis tournament began two weeks ago. **********Krajicek joined Becker, who was 17 when he won in 1985, as the only unseeded Wimbledon titlists. Though Krajicek was ranked 13th in the world \u2014 and will move into the Top 10 this week \u2014 he was not seeded among the top 16 because he had lost his opening match at Wimbledon each of the last two years. **********Washington, who had lost six of his nine Wimbledon matches before this year, was the first African-American finalist at Wimbledon since Ashe beat Jimmy Connors in 1975. **********\"It's great when you can come into a tournament when everyone's there, all of the great players, and you're still standing at the end,\" said Washington, ranked 20th in the world when the tournament began. \"For the fortnight, I was the second-best player in the world.\" **********It took the 6-foot-5-inch (1.96-meter) Krajicek 93 minutes to apply the same formula he had used against the 1991 champion Michael Stich and Sampras in earlier rounds. Krajicek has always had a big serve, averaging 118 miles an hour (189 kilometers an hour) in the final with 14 aces, but recently he added a strong return and the patience to pass from the baseline. He earned 11 break points, while conceding just 17 points on serve overall to Washington. **********They had never played each other, had never contested a Grand Slam final and between them had won just one tournament this year. **********Washington had his debut on Center Court just two days before. A little self-consciously they appeared Sunday behind a short man in a long white coat carrying their bags. The players had the look of two contest winners trying not to gawk at their five-star hotel. **********THEY WERE standing at the net for photographers, awkwardly trying to recreate the casual poses of more famous players, when a naked woman came streaking along the length of the grass floor and turned them from cardboard cut-outs into two men with the giggles. **********She was the first streaker ever to play Center Court, and Krajicek, among others, was happy to see her. He opened with one big serve after another as if he had never wondered whether he could make it this far. **********\"I was a little bit tight,\" Krajicek said. \"Then she comes out, and at least for me she put a smile on my face. For me it broke the tension.\" **********Krajicek ran up a 3-0 lead on big serves, forehands and overheads. But Washington admitted nothing. His service improved steadily, until by the start of the second set he was holding without deuce, largely because he was playing his second serve to Krajicek's weaker backhand. Krajicek was seven inches (16 centimeters) taller, but in pace and rhythm Washington might have been holding down Krajicek by the shoulders as the first interruption of rain came early in the second set. **********By then Washington's play at the net seemed to be withstanding the Dutch cannons. Born in New York, he was raised and coached in Michigan by his father, William Washington. The crowd revealed its support for him every time Washington punched an overhead or a forehand back at the bigger man. **********But it was all he could do to stay even with Krajicek. Over the next 77 minutes, only five were spent playing. If Krajicek had seemed nervous early in the second set, Washington thereafter lost the laser focus he needed. He fought off two break points in the ninth game of the second set before conceding serve to a trio of Krajicek forehands. **********Play was suspended for the third time after the opening game of the third set. Then Krajicek pounced, conceding one point in the next four games. **********Washington recovered one of the breaks, and for a moment he was reminding everyone of his semifinal comeback the day before, from 5-1 down in the fifth set to fellow American Todd Martin, the No. 13 and last surviving seed. **********Washington may have been expressing the sameresilience and poise, but the opponent was completely different. Martin had double-faulted three times while helping Washington to draw level on his way to the decisive set in 10-8. Krajicek was of no such mind. **********When Washington threw him a scare with a terrific backhand pass that wove its way inside the line, Krajicek responded with an attribute borrowed from Sampras.

Led by Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney, the brokerage firms are negotiating exclusive contracts -- sometimes known as captive-broker arrangements -- with companies to handle the stock-plan transactions for employees. In the process, they hope to become the employees' broker of choice. **********The practice has been embraced by a number of companies, including GTE, Corning and Delta Air Lines. In many cases, the companies save time and money by having the brokerage firms take over much of the plans' administrative work. Whether the arrangements prove to be good deals for workers, though, depends in large part on the terms each company strikes with the brokerage firm. **********The most common type of plan is an employee stock purchase plan, which encourages workers to buy company stock, often with discounts of up to 15 percent off the market price. Employees decide what percentage of their salaries to invest in the plan, and the money is withheld from their paychecks. Traditionally, employers have mailed stock certificates to employees who have put them into safe-deposit boxes or sent them to the stockbrokers of their choice.

Just last week, Chase Manhattan Bank said it would make stock options available to all its 67,000 employees. **********Such programs give employees the right, say for a 10-year period, to buy a set number of shares at a specified price. If the stock rises, employees profit by exercising the option to buy it at the preset price and then reselling it at the higher market price. Participants usually receive a rule book on exercising options, then find a broker to execute the transaction. **********Brokerage firms offer to simplify the process. With stock purchase plans, employers funnel shares directly into brokerage accounts at the captive firm instead of mailing stock certificates to employees. With stock option plans, employers tell employees to get in touch with the captive firm, which then helps them exercise their options. As part of an exclusive arrangement, the broker usually lowers its commissions. **********For companies, the practice may eliminate a number of headaches. ''It's an administrative nightmare to try to operate a program where every employee could choose their own brokers,'' said Claude Johnston, managing director of Pearl Meyer & Partners, a New York consulting firm on compensation. **********Along with time and money saved by shifting the record-keeping to a brokerage firm, companies may get a tax benefit. Under current tax law, companies generally can deduct as a compensation expense the discount an employee gets on company stock, provided that he sells the stock within a year of purchase or within two years of becoming eligible to buy it. So if an employee pays $1,000 for stock with a market value of $3,000, and then sells it within a year for $3,000 or more, the company can deduct $2,000 as an expense. **********''If a company issues certificates to employees, it's very difficult for the company to track when people sell,'' said Paul Allen, director of equity plan services at Smith Barney in New York. ''Because we hold the shares and people have to call us to sell them, we can report that activity back to the company.'' **********The commissions that captive brokers charge to sell company stock can be much lower than those they charge ordinary customers. So, many employees may get a better deal than they would if they walked into a full-service brokerage firm to execute the transactions. **********BUT savvy investors may do even better by transferring their stock to a broker outside the system, especially with stock purchase plans. ''As with any other stock investment,'' said Martin Nissenbaum, a partner at Ernst & Young in New York, ''you want to minimize your costs and shop around.'' **********Captive brokers' rates tend to be most competitive in exercising stock options. While the fees vary, they often rival those of the deep-discount brokerage firms. Employees with many options and shares, though, may still be able to arrange better deals elsewhere. **********The captive brokers may be less competitive when it comes to a regular stock purchase plan. Employees at Cisco Systems, the high-technology company in San Jose, Calif., have reason to smile about their plan. They pay a flat administrative fee of $4 and no commission when they sell shares through their captive broker, Smith Barney. But employees of Earthgrains, a baking goods company in St. Louis, pay commissions to the plan's broker, Merrill Lynch, that are only about 20 percent lower than the firm's retail rates, according to the company's director of human resources. Transferring shares to a deep-discount brokerage firm, like Jack White or E*trade, and then selling them might be less expensive for its workers. **********THERE is almost always a way to transfer shares to another broker. But in some plans administered by Smith Barney, at least, transfers are discouraged. In those plans, Smith Barney requires employees to request stock certificates, perhaps at a $15 fee. This fee could wipe out the financial benefit of switching to another broker; moreover, losing one to four weeks for such a transaction could cause an employee to miss a market upturn. **********''It's not the $15 that irritates many people,'' said Peter Van Ness, president of Stock Plan Inc., a stock-benefits-plan management company based in Santa Clara, Calif. ''It's the idea that you have the hassle of making the transfer, and to add insult to injury you have to pay for it.'' **********To be sure, many employees are happy with the arrangement. ''Now employees can exercise their options or sell their shares with a single phone call,'' said Robert Salwen, a principal at the Executive Compensation Corporation, a management consulting firm in White Plains. **********Convenience and simplicity are  important for companies like Chase, Bank America and GTE that are starting option programs for lower-level employees -- many of whom are inexperienced investors. **********Some industry experts say employees' negative reactions to captive-broker arrangements have been similar to their reactions to managed health care. Roger Mastako, managing director of Options Link, a San Francisco firm that manages stock plans, said, ''Employees get grumpy when their choices are taken away from them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/06/business/ford-to-offer-cheaper-cars-as-sales-sag.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1996-02-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 909, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ford to Offer Cheaper Cars As Sales Sag", "print_headline": "Ford to Offer Cheaper Cars As Sales Sag", "body_text": " **********The Ford Motor Company said today that it would begin selling a lower-cost version of its redesigned Taurus sedan as it reported that its sales of cars and light trucks dropped in January, pushing the pace of total industry sales into negative territory, compared with levels a year ago. **********The cheaper Taurus -- which will be $605, or some 3 percent, less than the starting point for a Taurus now -- will be a new car called the Taurus G. It represents the latest retreat by Ford from its strategy of building ever-fancier cars and trucks and charging premium prices for them. Last month, as Taurus sales got off to a disappointing start for the year, Ford announced a $600 rebate through April 2. **********Ford has poured billions of dollars into developing sophisticated engines, transmissions and suspensions that are costly to manufacture, only to find that  it is introducing them when consumers are especially price sensitive. **********With sales of Taurus and its sibling, the Mercury Sable, down last month, Ford said that its total sales of cars and light trucks fell 3.4 percent in January from a year earlier. That follows a report on Friday by the Toyota Motor Corporation that its January sales plummeted 17.3 percent from a year earlier. Toyota attributed the decline to a decision to offer fewer discounts this year. **********But total-vehicle sales do seem to be holding up at the Chrysler Corporation  and, to a lesser extent, the General Motors Corporation. Indeed, G.M. provided another sign of its continuing recovery today as its board voted to increase the quarterly dividend on common stock to 40 cents a share from 30 cents, effective Feb. 15. [Page D9.] **********For the entire industry, the negative reports from Ford and Toyota mean that  the overall sales rate fell 1.6 percent in January from a year earlier. Percentage calculations are based on a daily selling rate because showrooms were open one more day last month than in January 1995. **********The latest data were a contrast to January reports from a dozen other auto makers last Thursday that showed a slight sales gain from a year earlier. Those  reports had prompted Wall Street analysts to declare that sales seemed to be relatively resilient despite signs of weakness in the economy. **********At Ford, the new Taurus G is scheduled for introduction on April 3, the day after the rebates are set to expire, and will have a base price of $18,545, including destination charges. That compares with $19,150 for the cheapest version of the Taurus GL, the best-selling car in the United States. Ford will also offer a less expensive version of the Mercury Sable, which is quite similar to the Taurus. **********Even in the G version, the Taurus will remain more expensive than a Chevrolet Lumina sedan, but less expensive than the Toyota Camry or the Honda Accord. G.M. officials quickly pointed out today that the Lumina price starts at $16,895, which is $1,650 less than the Taurus G. The Lumina is \"priced correctly for the marketplace,\" said William J. O'Neill Jr., a Chevrolet spokesman. **********Many car shoppers have said that the new, bubble-shaped Taurus, which went on sale in September, feels smaller inside than its predecessor although Ford engineers insist that the vehicle has slightly more room. **********Ford officials have scrambled in the last two months to come up with the Taurus G, which will be available only in white, red, gray, silver and green for the exterior, while all of the interiors will be gray, the most popular color. The mirrors and side moldings will be black only, instead of matching the paint  color as they do in other Taurus models. **********Some popular options will not be offered on the Taurus G, as a way to limit the number of buyers who choose the less expensive vehicle. Standard equipment will include an AM-FM stereo radio, air-conditioning, dual air bags and a 3.0 liter V-6 engine with automatic transmission. **********Robert Rewey, Ford's group vice president for marketing and sales, predicted  that the G version will account for only 5 to 10 percent of all Taurus cars sold. He said that the company had not overpriced the original vehicle but that  public reaction had produced considerable concern among Ford dealers. **********\"We're responding to a lot of coverage in the press and elsewhere about where the Taurus is positioned,\" he said in an interview today. Ford's overall pricing strategy remains in place, he said, adding that the decision to offer the Taurus G and the decision last month to offer discounts on half of Ford's product line  represented isolated responses to market needs. **********The daily rate of Taurus sales fell by 3.5 percent in January from the previous year, still a better showing than that of many other Ford models. But Christopher W. Cedergren, a consultant at AutoPacific Group, in Santa Ana, Calif., said the Taurus sales were unimpressive in light of the incentives being offered. **********\"Given the $600 rebate, they probably should have done more,\" he said. **********Mr. Rewey said that small-car sales were the weakest last month, while the F-150 pickup truck, the Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle and the Ford Contour sedan all sold well, as did the large Ford, Lincoln and Mercury cars. **********Ford dealers today played down the importance of the weak sales. January sales were \"maybe a little softer than we normally have,\" said Larry V. Sexton,  a dealer in St. Roberts, Mo. \"It's not like the bottom fell out.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/19/news/genetic-screening-an-unsettling-battle-is-joined.html": {"writer_name": "Erik Ipsen", "pub_date": "1996-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1920, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Genetic Screening: An Unsettling Battle Is Joined", "print_headline": "Genetic Screening: An Unsettling Battle Is Joined", "body_text": " **********LONDON\u2014                     Five years ago, Jamie Stephenson, a New Hampshire writer and her husband, Jonathan, a dentist, got a nasty shock. Their new health insurer suddenly dropped them after re-examining their file. **********\"They told us that they would not write health insurance for anyone who has a positive genetic test,\" said Mrs. Stephenson. Three years earlier, the Stephensons' 2-year-old son, David, had tested positive for \"fragile X\" syndrome, an inherited form of mental retardation. Never mind that David's three siblings and his parents had no known genetic problems, and that David's condition had no impact on his physical health. Never mind also that a family of six might actually need health insurance. **********The Stephensons had been stigmatized as untouchable bya positive genetic test. **********Inspired by the case of the Stephensons and others, in 1995, New Hampshire barred employers and health insurers from discriminating on the basis of genetic information. A dozen other American states have now followed suit. **********Yet even gene rights activists admit that such moves mark little more than isolated victories in what now looms as a long and fierce war over the control and use of genetic information. **********At issue are the individual's rights to genetic privacy, or at the very least the right to prevent others from using the secrets of one's genetic makeup to deny equal access to everything from a job to a mortgage. Insurers around the world are now fiercely contesting that right by increasingly demanding nothing less than full and open access to genetic information. **********Fueling the battle are the almost daily leaps in the understanding of scientists of the roles specific genes play in diseases along and the fact that obtaining genetic information can be as simple as analyzing a strand of human hair or a mouth swab. **********After four years of wrangling, a committee of the International Bar Association will examine this legal and ethical morass beginning Monday. After three days of meetings in Berlin's International Congress Center, the lawyers hope to emerge with the bare bones of a draft international treaty setting out minimum legal standards for the use of genetic information. And drafting meaningful legislation has proven devilishly difficult. \"After four years we do not agree on everything,\" said Martine Rothblatt, the Washington lawyer who chairs the International Bar's Bioethics Subcommittee. \"But we agree on a lot more than nothing.\" **********Broad agreement exists that genetic information sould enjoy the same legal protections as our sexual orientation or racial identity. In other words, that regardless of what their genes say, individuals should have an equal right to a job, a vote and health care coverage. **********But the consensus ends when it comes to the issue of life insurance. **********\"It is one of the points we do not agree on,\" said Ms. Rothblatt. **********Life insurance executives such as Robert Pakorski, a vice president for medical research at Swiss Re in Connecticut, are adamant that anything less than full access to genetic tests would be \"devastating\" for the industry. **********If, for instance, genetic tests reveal, as they now can, that a perfectly healthy young woman has an 80 percent chance of contracting breast cancer, she now has a right to keep her health insurance in many American states. But what about her life insurance? Can she keep what she has? Can she cushion the financial blow her premature death would cause her family by taking out a huge life policy and taking advantage of information her insurance company does not have? Or does her insurer have a right to see that information? **********Take the example of a 30 year-old male with no known health risks. Mr. Pakorski notes that a $100,000 life insurance policy would carry a premium of around $125 a month. If that person knew from genetic tests that he would only live another five to ten years, that policy would represent a tremendous risk to the insurer. **********Mr. Pakorski calculates that just to break even on the policy after ten years, the insurer would need to charge an annual premium of $5,704 a year. The insurer would have to charge three times as much, or $14,891 a year, if it knew their policy holder would die after five years. It is a danger insurers call \"adverse selection\" \u2014 a process whereby otherwise healthy people load up on life insurance after genetic tests tell them they face shortened lives. **********In Europe, where health costs are borne not by private insurers but by national entitlement plans, the debate over genetic discrimination has focused almost exclusively on life insurance. **********Unlike Americans, Europeans seem more willing, for the time being anyway, to strike a compromise. **********A prime example of this trend is the Netherlands. In 1990, Dutch life insurers agreed to a moratorium under which they excluded genetic information from their premium calculations for policies up to 200,000 guilders ($115,000). **********That compromise addresses both insurers' fears of being taken to the cleaners by their genetically tested policy holders, and growing government concerns over the adverse effects the discrimination controversy could have on public health. **********\"Governments fear that unless there is a workable compromise people will be put off from getting tests that could improve their health,\" said David Shapiro, executive secretary of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics in London. **********Individuals found to have a genetic predisposition to heart disease, for instance, could take that early warning, exercise more, eat less fatty foods, and thereby greatly extend their life expectancy. If on the other hand they worried that a bad genetic test result could cost them their life insurance, or possibly even their job, they might just skip the test. **********That may be an increasingly rare luxury, however. Some experts forecast that genetic tests will become as common as tests analyzing cholesterol levels are today. Already, donors at many in vitro fertilization clinics are routinely screened not just for human immuno-deficiency virus and venereal diseases, but for genetic conditions such as those leading to cystic fibrosis. **********\"It is up to the clinic to tell the donors the results and to offer counseling if necessary,\" said Barry Mellars, an executive with University Diagnostics, a London-based genetic testing firm that charges \u00a365 for its tests and uses a sample of mouthwash sloshed around a patient's mouth as raw material. **********In recent years, insurance companies have balked at asking would-be policy holders to have their genes screened, in large part because of the high cost and limited usefulness of such tests. Cheaper, more accurate tests may cause them to reassess that decision. **********Still, said Paul Smee, head of life insurance at the Association of British Insurers, \"It is tomorrow's problem not today's.\" But the speed with which tomorrow is now hurtling toward us all is frightening to many. **********\"Most disease has a genetic component,\" said Dr. Neil Holtzman a professor at Johns Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore, and the chairman of a high level U.S. government task force on genetic testing. \"The big question is how powerful are those genetic factors.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/18/world/with-little-fanfare-and-facing-crisis-un-starts-a-new-year.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1996-09-18", "snippet": "UN General Assembly begins 51st session without ceremony, in financial crisis and with uncertainty over who Secertary General will be when session ends on Dec 23 (M)", "word_count": 562, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "With Little Fanfare and Facing Crisis, U.N.

The law tightens the 34-year-old embargo against Cuba by trying to restrict non-American foreign investment here. **********Inside the 10-story phone company building are offices of Etecsa, a joint venture of the Cuban Government and a Mexican company called Grupo Domos, which  bought 49 percent of the decrepit national system in 1994 for $750 million. It is by far the biggest foreign investment in Cuba since the Communist Government  of Fidel Castro began courting investors. **********While company officials say they have no intention of pulling out, they admit that the uncertainty raised by the new law makes it far more difficult for them  to raise the $300 million they still need to go forward with their project, which is considered essential for Cuba's development. **********Cuba Coming to See Law's Chilling Effect **********Shaking confidence in Cuba is exactly what the law's drafters were after. The Cuban Government initially derided the law as powerless but later conceded the chilling effect it would have on foreign investment, while using it as provocation for a crackdown on economic reforms and political dissent. **********The Helms-Burton Act was written and passed after intense pressure from anti-Castro Cubans in Miami who hoped to undermine the Castro Government. But many of the most vocal supporters of the bill also operate businesses. They want to weaken rival businesses, raise the cost of investing in Cuba and scare off non-American investors so that they can rush in after Mr. Castro falls and pick  up the spoils. **********No foreign project has been canceled yet, but international investors are nervously waiting to see how the United States will enforce the law, which takes effect Aug. 1, or whether President Clinton will use his authority to suspend its implementation until after the November elections. **********\"We're still doing our evaluations,\" said Arturo Lopez, manager of the Havana Investment Fund, which had raised almost $35 million before the law was passed.  \"This law is going make an investment here a little more difficult perhaps, but  it will not stop it.\" **********Cuban officials say they have attracted $2 billion in foreign investments, although Western diplomats here estimate the true figure to be half that. Whatever the real figure, all investments has been thrown into question by the Helms-Burton Act, which was signed by President Clinton just weeks after Cuban pilots shot down two unarmed planes flown by anti-Castro Cuban-Americans on Feb. 24, killing four men. **********Many business executives here note that the law could hinder the kind of transition to a market economy that Washington seems to want. Since Cubans were  given the right to own dollars and foreign companies were allowed to invest in Cuban businesses, dollars have been buying everything in Havana, from extra food to a working telephone line. **********The 33 exchange at the start of most business telephone numbers here is now known as the money exchange because it means the holder pays the bill in dollars, and calls almost always get through. Not far from a sign in Havana proclaiming \"Socialism or Death\" is an outdoor billboard for Adidas shoes. **********Basically, the Helms-Burton Act gives American citizens the right to sue Domos and other foreign companies in a United States Federal court for profiting from property that was illegally confiscated during the Cuban Revolution. **********Javier Garza Calderon, president of Domos, said in an interview in Mexico that he does not believe that the law applies to his company because he simply rents space in the old phone company building. It is now owned by the Government but used to belong to the American company ITT and the Cuban Telephone Company,  which it ran, until the revolution. ITT has a $130 million claim outstanding for all the property it lost in Cuba. **********Domos is rapidly renovating alternate space -- in a building that never belonged to Americans -- just in case. But the new law so broadly interprets deriving benefit from confiscated property -- it uses the term \"trafficking\" --  that Mr. Garza Calderon concedes that Domos could have trouble because some equipment, telephone lines and even the heavy black rotary dial phones still in  use in some Cuban households once belonged to ITT. **********\"They could be considered to be deriving benefit if a call from Miami to some woman in Camaguey Province was made on the same old telephone her grandmother had,\" said a Western diplomat in Cuba. \"No matter what their lawyers say, can they be sure that a Federal court somewhere in the United States will feel the same way?\" **********Cuban-American leaders in Miami have already installed Domos into what they call their \"Hall of Shame.\" **********\"Here you have a foreign company buying at cut-rate prices property owned by  American citizens, intending to share profits with Fidel Castro and then laughing all the way to the bank,\" said Jorge Mas Canosa, head of the powerful Cuban American National Foundation. **********But Mr. Mas Canosa may have had more than politics in mind. His Florida-based telecommunications company, Mastec, has been expanding aggressively in Latin America, and the entrance of the Mexicans represents increased competition. **********Signs of Concern From Many Corners **********Domos faces other potential problems. Under the law, Mr. Garza Calderon and his family could be denied visas to enter the United States, where his children  now study. **********Canon, Bayer, Benetton and dozens of other corporations that occupy space in  confiscated Havana mansions also could face similar restrictions if former property owners have since become American citizens. **********The Canadian Government has been among the most vocal opponents of the new law, asserting that it violates the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Latinvest Securities reports that stock in the Canadian mining company Sherritt International, which operates a nickel mine in Cuba, dropped 24 percent after the two planes were downed. **********At first the Cuban Government minimized the effect of the law. Officials declared outright that there were no American properties in Cuba, and called the law \"Helms's dream,\" after its sponsor, Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative Republican from North Carolina. **********But as investors expressed their concerns, the Government was forced to reconsider. Roberto de Armas, an economist in the Foreign Ministry, now concedes that the flow of capital will probably slow until the United States makes clear  how it plans to enforce the law. But he said the Government's policies will not  change. **********\"The biggest blow to the Americans and their law will be when we give the figures for economic growth at the end of the year and they see that growth continues, albeit with problems in some sectors,\" Mr. de Armas said. The expected growth rate for 1996 is between 4 and 5 percent, depending on the sugar harvest, now under way. **********The stakes are high for Mexico, which has taken a lead in Cuban investments.  It was during a state visit by Carlos Salinas de Gortari, then the President, in June 1994 that the Domos deal was announced. A project to rebuild the Cienfuegos refinery was also announced then but it was suspended last September. **********An investment like Grupo Domos's was considered an important first step in strengthening both the Mexican and Cuban economies. **********Company Scrambles To Save Its Venture **********It turned out that the anchor of Cuba's economy that Domos bought was a rusting and battered one. For instance, Domos found that when the air conditioning in critical switching centers failed, workers had simply opened the windows, letting in dust and salt air that corroded contacts. Only 18 percent of the long distance calls made to Cuba were completed. **********Because Grupo Domos lacked operating experience, it sold 25 percent of its stake to the Italian phone company Stet last April for $291 million. **********Domos wanted an American partner. Since 1992, a change in American law allowed long distance companies like AT&T and MCI to provide direct service to Cuba. They are doing so well that on Feb. 26, two days after the planes were shot down, a record 43,000 calls were registered between the United States and Cuba. **********The signing of the Helms-Burton Act squelched any deal with an American company. The law specifically prohibits debt-for-equity swaps and bans any American company from investing in the domestic phone network in Cuba. **********Since Domos has already earmarked $180 million for direct investment in Cuba, it has little choice but to remain. The uncertainty caused by the Helms-Burton Act makes it virtually impossible for Domos to finance the $300 million it still owes the Cuban Government. But it now seems that the Mexican Government, which strongly opposes the new law, will find a way to help Domos, and Cuba, save face. Although it once turned down Domos, the Mexican Government's export bank,  Bancomext, is expected to come up with a loan for most of the $300 million. **********Mr. Garza Calderon said the Cuban-Americans in Miami who pressured President  Clinton to sign the law are confused. He would like to invite Mr. Mas Canosa, with whom he does not see eye-to-eye either economically or politically, to Monterrey to discuss the improvements already made in Cuba: higher salaries for  workers, new switching stations, better service and more lines. **********\"It is ridiculous that Mr. Mas Canosa opposes all those benefits for those Cubans living in Miami and those in Cuba as well,\" he said. \"He's just taking the negative point of view.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/31/business/the-media-business-mca-in-2.5-billion-sale-of-shows-to-german-tv.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Weinraub", "pub_date": "1996-07-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 645, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;MCA in $2.5 Billion Sale of Shows to German TV", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;MCA in $2.5 Billion Sale of Shows to German TV", "body_text": " **********MCA Inc. said today that it was selling the German rights to its television shows and movies in two long-term agreements that MCA valued at about $2.5 billion. **********In one 10-year, $1.5 billion contract, MCA sold to RTL, Germany's largest television network in terms of viewers, the broadcast rights to shows like \"Miami Vice\" and \"The Rockford Files\" and Universal Pictures films like \"Apollo  13\" and \"Out of Africa.\" **********In another deal, for $1 billion, MCA sold various pay-TV rights for 10 years to the Kirch Group, a German leader in production, broadcasting and distribution. **********MCA officials said the RTL deal also involved a co-production agreement that  would split the cost of producing as many as 25 television series in the next decade. **********Frank Biondi Jr., MCA's chairman, made it clear that the deals were part of a strategy by the company, which is controlled by the Seagram Company, to expand television operations aggressively overseas in hopes of rivaling such giant competitors as the Walt Disney Company, Viacom Inc. and Time Warner Inc. **********In the last year, these companies and others have focused on building strategic television alliances and selling programming to growing markets abroad. **********Time Warner announced last week a long-term licensing agreement with Kirch worth $800 million, providing Kirch with rights to Time Warner's feature films as well as its library of films for pay TV and pay-per-view showing in Germany. **********As the largest market in Europe -- with 37 million viewers -- Germany is especially prized by American entertainment companies. MCA executives described  Germany as a gateway for American entertainment properties, in Europe and beyond. **********\"Germany is the most desirable springboard for launching additional channels  throughout Western Europe and other markets, serving as an effective blueprint for the future,\" Mr. Biondi said in a statement. **********Later, in a telephone interview, Mr. Biondi said: \"We would hope this will happen again and again and again.

It will announce a profit, one estimated at more than \u00a31 billion ($1.55 billion), after reporting losses totaling \u00a38 billion since 1990. **********Those expected record earnings promise to set the groundwork for a series of crucial votes by the Lloyd's insurance market's 34,000 individual members, known as Names, in coming days. **********Beginning with Lloyd's annual meeting on Monday, and extending through the Aug. 28 deadline for members' acceptance of a settlement offer to end their years of litigation against the insurance market, the Names are widely expected to approve the radical restructuring of Lloyd's that will lift it from its deathbed. **********On Thursday, Lloyd's prospects got a critical boost. In Washington, the insurance market announced that it had agreed to what it termed a \"framework\" for the settlement of a series of disputes with regulators in several American states. **********U.S. regulators had threatened to block American Names from accepting the market's settlement on legal grounds. That dispute had widely been regarded as the biggest obstacle to Lloyd's reconstruction efforts. **********\"The light at the end of the tunnel is no longer the train rushing towards us,\" said William Lewis, a director at Minories Underwriting Agencies. \"People are optimistic that instead, we might now be seeing the end of the crisis.\" **********The first, and easier, test of the new optimism will come at the Monday annual meeting. **********At that point, Names who have been active in the market over the last three years will vote on whether to contribute \u00a3440 million from their profits in those three years to a massive \u00a33.1 billion out-of-court settlement offer, out of which Lloyd's will pay off some of the debts of Names who had lost money in earlier years. **********Approval of that contribution would then clear the way for Names to either accept or reject their individually tailored settlement plans. Those are to be mailed out next month. **********In return for accepting the market's offers, Names must pledge to abandon their legal suits and to pay what they owe as underwriters of thousands of money-losing insurance policies \u2014 most disastrously on those covering U.S. claims from pollution damage and asbestosis. **********In recent years, thousands of Names have balked at paying up on their losses and have instead sued the market as well as its agents, alleging everything from negligence to outright fraud. **********Faced with mounting claims against its insurance policies and huge legal bills on one side, and with the lack of payments from Names on the other, Lloyd's has found itself driven to the brink of insolvency. **********Now, after years of bitter disputes, even some of Lloyd's most virulent critics have thrown their weight behind what the market calls its final offer. **********Richard Platts, secretary of the Gooda Walker Action Group, one of the largest groups of litigating Names, predicts that 70 to 80 percent of his members will support the offer. **********\"And it could even go much higher,\" he said. **********The optimism is based on a lack of alternatives, and on the conviction that the deal is the best one Names are likely to get. If the offer fails, Lloyd's would face the threat of bankruptcy. **********\"I think people realize that there is just not any more money to be squeezed out of the litigation fruit,\" said Mr. Platts. **********\"For the first time in nearly a decade, Lloyd's faces the prospect of stability just around the corner,\" said Charles Sturge, aspecialist on the market. **********Meanwhile for those Lloyd's members, both individual and corporate, who remain active in the market, the future is now looking decidedly lucrative. **********Since Lloyd's reports its results with a three-year time lag, the expected record profits posted by Lloyd's on Friday cover only calendar year 1993.

She wants to have her genitals cut off. **********In the lament of pubescent girls everywhere, she says that all her friends are getting ahead of her. Their parents have sent them into the woods where village women ''cut what is down there,'' she said, gesturing to her lap. **********After the rite, the girls are showered with gifts of money, jewelry and cloth. Their families honor them with celebrations where hundreds of relatives and friends feast on goat, cow and chicken. **********''It is the custom, and I want to respect it,'' she said. **********The tradition of female genital cutting is woven into the everyday life of the Yacouba people here, just as it is for hundreds of ethnic groups in a wide band of 28 countries across Africa. In Man, it is part of a girl's dreams of womanhood, a father's desire to show off with a big party and a family's way of proving its conformity to social convention. **********The rising chorus of international condemnation of this age-old practice, voiced in recent years from the podiums of United Nations assemblies in Vienna, Cairo and Beijing, echoes only faintly in places like Man, a tourist town deep in the interior, surrounded by the craggy, cloud-shrouded Toura mountains. **********On the coast, in the cosmopolitan hubbub of Abidjan, and in other parts of Africa, the debate about female genital cutting is slowly moving into the public arena. Only in the last few years have African nations even begun measuring the prevalence of genital cutting as part of national health surveys or in other research. **********In the Ivory Coast and the Central African Republic, two out of  five women have been cut. In Togo, it is one in eight. In the Sudan -- the only country that already had reliable national estimates -- it is 9 out of 10. In Mali, it is 93 percent. **********''It looks like women in most countries are nearly as likely to undergo these procedures as their mothers and grandmothers,'' said Dara Carr, a researcher at Macro International Inc., the Maryland-based company that is assisting the countries in conducting the health surveys. ''But there are some seeds of change.'' **********In the Sudan, the prevalence of the practice has dropped from 96 percent to 89 percent over the course of a decade. And there has been a shift toward a less severe form of genital cutting. In Togo, a survey found that half of the mothers who had been cut wanted to spare their daughters. And while three-quarters of the women in Mali favor continuing the practice, a majority in the Central African Republic want to end it. **********But what women want and what they have the power to accomplish are very different things. In most of the countries where tens of millions of girls and women have been cut, organizations have sprung up to combat the practice. **********Like mosquitoes attacking an elephant, the small, ill-financed groups are struggling within societies where men rule women's lives, and old people, including old women, rule the young. There are, for example, Ivoirian laws against physical violence that could be used to stop the cutting, said Idrissa Fofana, a high-ranking official in the Justice Ministry. **********But the Government has no interest in imposing them on unwilling families, antagonizing village chiefs and family elders who are pillars of society and guardians of tradition. **********''If there was a complaint from parents that their child had been excised against their wishes, the Justice Ministry could pursue the case,'' Mr. Fofana said. ''But if there is no complaint, we cannot disturb the peace of the family and the village.'' **********Like most Yacouba girls in Man, Marthe Bleu is an eager initiate. But even if she resisted, her father, Jean-Baptiste Bleu, a trim, genial, neatly dressed waiter at a local hotel, would insist on her cutting. **********''If your daughter has not been excised, the father is not allowed to speak at village meetings,'' he said. ''No man in the village will marry her. It is an obligation. We have done it, we do it and we will continue to do it.'' **********''She has no choice. I decide. Her viewpoint is not important.'' **********The Bleus have not yet chosen who will cut Marthe, but not far from their home, through a maze of dirt pathways, lives Madeleine Douan, 47, one of the local excisers. **********The tall, sinewy woman refused to show the ceremonial knife she uses, but brought out other accouterments of her calling: a long strand of metal bells and cloth sacks filled with bottle caps.

Mrs. Douan herself sings traditional songs. **********She introduced several of the girls she had recently cut. Natalie Sahi, 15, sat on the side of her thigh outside Mrs. Douan's windowless mud hut to avoid putting direct pressure on the wound. ''I wanted it to happen,'' she said. ''It's natural.'' **********Patricia Vehgolou, 13, her hair neatly braided in corn rows, buried her face in her hands and would only giggle when asked if the cutting hurt. Mrs. Douan explained that the girls must swear before leaving the forest that they will not share the secrets of the rite with the uninitiated. **********The purpose of the cutting, Mrs. Douan said, is to help insure a woman's fidelity to her husband and her family. ''It's a tradition from antiquity,'' she said. A woman's role in life is to care for her children, keep house and cook. If she has not been cut, Mrs. Douan said, a woman might think instead about her own sexual pleasure. **********The Origins **********Pride, Tradition And Ignored Risks **********It is not known when, where or why the practice of female genital cutting originated. Scholars believe that it started in Egypt or the Horn of Africa more than 2,000 years ago, before the advent of Christianity or Islam. It then spread west across the continent, all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, with the migration of dominant tribes and civilizations. **********The practice knows no class or religious boundaries. Most prevalent among Muslims, it is also performed by Christians and followers of traditional African religions. The practice is more widespread among the illiterate, but it is also common among the educated. **********The nature of the cutting, the reasons for it and the age at which it is done vary greatly by region and ethnic group. **********The practice involves amputating some or all of the external genitalia -- the clitoris, the small genital lips and the large ones -- diminishing a woman's ability to experience sexual pleasure. It can also cause serious health problems, including hemorrhaging and infection. **********Typically, the cutting is done by traditional village women without anything to dull the pain. But sometimes, when midwives or nurses are brought in to do the job, they apply a local anesthetic. **********Many believe that cutting helps insure a girl's virginity before marriage and fidelity afterward by reducing sex to a marital obligation. Often, people follow the custom simply because it has always been done. **********''Children are born and the parents do it,'' said Awa Kone, a Malian washerwoman in Abidjan, who plans to take her baby daughter, Kadia, to an exciser in the near future. **********In the Horn of Africa -- Djibouti, Somalia, the Sudan and parts of Ethiopia -- the most severe and harmful form of cutting, infibulation, is practiced. **********In this procedure, the clitoris and some or all of the small genital lips are cut away. Then an incision is made in the large lips so the raw surfaces can be stitched together, covering the urethra and most of the vagina. Only a small opening, as tiny as a matchstick or as large as a small fingertip, is left to pass urine and menstrual blood, said Nahid Toubia, a Sudanese surgeon who is an associate professor at Columbia University. **********Infibulation comes with its own set of rationales. Some men say the artificial tightness heightens their sexual enjoyment. The smoothness of the scar is found esthetically beautiful. And the stitching itself forms a chastity belt of flesh. **********There is a common thread to all forms of cutting. Economic realities underlie the practice. Women typically have no way to survive without a husband. Parents insist on the rite so their daughters are marriageable. **********''People do know the health risks,'' said Ellen Gruenbaum, a medical anthropologist at California State University, San Bernardino. ''They have seen people get sick. On rare occasions, a girl might die. But you will not change people's minds by preaching to them or telling them they're primitive. They undertake the risks for reasons important to them.'' **********After the cutting, more pain lies ahead. Women who have endured the more extreme forms of the practice have particularly agonizing and complicated deliveries. The scarring narrows the vaginal opening and makes the flesh inelastic, doctors and midwives say. The pressure of a baby's emerging head often causes grave tearing of the vagina. **********Women who bear a child in their villages without a doctor to widen the vagina surgically sometimes arrive torn and bleeding at the Maternal Health Center in Man. On occasion, the tearing goes up into the urethra and bladder, down into the anus, as well as side to side. The women must then be sent to a hospital in Abidjan for surgery. **********Clautilde Yenon, a midwife at the health center, tried to think of a way to convey the excruciating damage. Finally, she had an idea. She picked up a sheet of paper and ripped it into jagged pieces. **********The Policy **********Official Reluctance To Oppose Custom **********Ivoirian officials, working in skyscrapers that form Abidjan's sawtoothed profile, talked a good deal in interviews about the evils of genital cutting, but then conceded that their ministries have done little to put words into action. **********The Ministry of Public Health is planning a campaign to educate people about the health consequences of the practice, often referred to here as excision and sometimes as female circumcision, but there is as yet no budget or staff to carry it out. **********Narcisse Ehoussou, an obstetrician who heads the ministry's reproductive health program, told this story to explain the slow pace of change: **********''A French doctor of public health once went to western Ivory Coast. He was horrified by what he saw, people with goiters on their necks. When he returned, he asked, 'Why don't you study this?' He was told, 'We don't study it because it is normal.' For women, excision is normal. **********''You have to be patient in Africa. Just as it was difficult to convince people to accept family planning, so it is with excision.'' **********It is not surprising that the Ivoirian Government is loath to take on genital cutting, despite the existence of laws that could be used to stop it. Like most African countries, the Ivory Coast is composed of many ethnic groups. Some practice it. Others, including that of President Henri Konan Bedie, the Baule, do not. There is generally great tolerance for differing traditions, and a reluctance to disturb the sometimes uneasy political balance. **********''A judge's role is to maintain public order, but by combating excision, he would disturb public order,'' said Mr. Fofana, of the Justice Ministry. ''We cannot impose the law suddenly. The law we have was inspired by the French colonizers. It does not take account of customs.'' **********Such views aggravate Tomam Constance Yai, a speech therapist for deaf children and the Ivory Coast's leading crusader against genital cutting. ''For our Government, violence against women is not a public disturbance,'' she said ironically. **********Ms. Yai, whose grandmother was an exciser, founded the Ivoirian Association for the Defense of Women's Rights four years ago. It is a grand name for a small group of volunteers who fight ingrained cultural practices like forced marriage, polygamy and genital cutting. **********With wily charm, Ms. Yai is pushing the Government to act, careful not to favor the aggressive prosecution of excisers or offending parents. Such tactics, she says, would only drive the practice underground. Rather, she wants to bring an educational campaign to the Government-controlled television stations, as well as schools, hospitals and clinics. **********International pressure gives her group what little strength it has, she said: ''If it were only our association, our Government would ignore us. They would say we're just a small group of foolish women.'' **********So far, the pressure has mainly taken the form of verbal denunciations at United Nations gatherings. In Beijing, at the Fourth World Conference on Women, Hillary Rodham Clinton called it a human rights violation ''when young girls are brutalized by the painful and degrading practice of genital mutilation.'' **********Some human rights groups maintain that Western governments should link foreign aid negotiations with progress on the issue. But in the Ivory Coast, diplomats from the United States, which provides no direct aid to the Ivoirian Government, though it is supporting an AIDS research project, and France, the country's former colonial ruler and biggest aid donor, are reluctant to press the Ivoirian Government on the issue. **********''It's a matter principally for local society to determine the extent to which these practices are to be tolerated,'' said Thomas G. Hart, a spokesman for the United States  Embassy in Abidjan. **********Emmanuel Gagniarre, a spokesman for the French Embassy in Abidjan, said:  ''This is a marginal problem. It's important, but to feed people is probably more important. I don't think it can be an issue when negotiations take place on aid provided to African countries.'' **********The Ceremony **********Sudden Agony, Then Celebration **********In Man, a girl's rite of passage culminates in a day of joyous, enveloping pageantry. But the powerful pull of belonging to the group does not always overwhelm private doubts about the intimate consequences of the practice. **********Jean-Baptiste Bleu, the waiter who plans to have his daughter cut, said he has slept with women who have not been cut and married one who has. A woman who has been cut is difficult to arouse, the sex often dry, he said. Yacouba men talk among themselves about how to excite their wives -- what places to caress, what words to whisper. **********Without equivocation, he said, sex with an uncut woman is much better. ''She is happy, joyous,'' said Mr. Bleu, who is 39. **********Still, he believes the cutting is a duty. His daughters must endure the rite courageously, without showing their pain or fear, he said. **********His wife, Yvonne, 31, said she will defer to his wishes, but she despises the practice because it deprives women of sexual sensitivity. ''It is up to my husband,'' she said. ''We live in Africa. The man makes the decisions about the children.'' **********Several other women whose families rent rooms around the same courtyard as the Bleus pulled up a chair to join the talk. Not all were as emotionally torn. **********Margarite Lou, 31, fondly remembered the celebration that followed the rite -- the lavish gifts, the applause of the villagers, the feast. And she lustily asserted that she very much enjoys sex, despite having undergone one of the more extreme forms of cutting. Even her scar is sensitive, she said. **********Mrs. Lou dismissed notions that the cutting is harmful to a woman's health, passing on an old wives' tale. ''It's easier to give birth if you're excised,'' she said. ''There are no lips to close the opening of the vagina.'' **********Twelve-year-old Marthe Bleu was then playing across the courtyard, as innocent of the bawdy talk that day as she is of sex itself. For her, womanhood beckons. And genital cutting is the portal she must walk through to enter it. **********''I feel my friends are better than me because they have been cut down there,'' she had said earlier, her hands twisting in her lap. ''It's very difficult, but I want to do it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/16/business/worldbusiness/IHT-australia-will-back-asia-caucus.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Richardson", "pub_date": "1996-03-16", "snippet": "In a significant change of its policy toward Asia, Australia said Friday that it no longer objected to moves by Malaysia to form an East Asian Economic Caucus..Such a group, consisting exclusively of East Asian countries, has been opposed until no...", "word_count": 921, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Australia Will Back Asia Caucus", "print_headline": "Australia Will Back Asia Caucus", "body_text": " **********In a significant change of its policy toward Asia, Australia said Friday that it no longer objected to moves by Malaysia to form an East Asian Economic Caucus. **********Such a group, consisting exclusively of East Asian countries, has been opposed until now by both Australia and the United States on the grounds that it could weaken the region's only trans-Pacific association, APEC, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. **********Their opposition has been a major factor in Japan's reluctance to support the caucus, which is intended to bring East Asian countries together for regular consultations on trade, development and other economic matters. **********Analysts said the decision by the newly elected conservative government in Canberra to drop Australia's opposition to the proposed caucus would make it easier for Japan to join and more difficult for the United States to continue to raise objections to the proposal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/23/your-money/IHT-briefcase-fidelity-brokerage-goes-electronic.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-23", "snippet": "Fidelity Brokerage, the international discount stockbroking arm of the eponymous Boston-based fund manager, has set up an Internet site for private investors..

Since 1985, Mr. Dai pointed out, China's economy has grown by an average of 10.3 percent each year, a stunning figure by any measure. **********''Looking at the present economic situation, I can say definitively that China's restrained monetary policy has proven a success,'' Mr. Dai said, as reported in a state-run newspaper called The Financial News. **********Mr. Dai's comments came together with the news that October retail prices grew by only 4.7 percent compared with a year earlier, the lowest monthly increase since 1992. That brought speculation among economists that China may again cut interest rates -- it has done so twice already this year -- sometime in the next few months. **********Mr. Dai credited China's three-year austerity program with achieving the drop in inflation, which peaked in 1994 at 24 percent, a figure that Chinese leaders worried might cause public unrest. **********Economists almost uniformly predicted a tight money policy aimed at controlling inflation would kill China's blockbuster growth rate, but the authorities seem to have achieved the ''soft landing'' they sought, with healthy growth and low inflation. **********At the same time, China's foreign exchange reserves have grown to more than $100 billion, Mr. Dai said, also far higher than anyone predicted. **********Behind all these rosy numbers lurk deep uncertainties in China's economy. **********In the midst of a wrenching transition from a planned to a market economic system, China is saddled with an immense and inefficient state-owned sector, chronic underemployment and common confusion about the future of the state's official ideology, which despite all signs to the contrary is still socialist. Virtually half of China's state-owned industrial enterprises lose money, with much of the remainder breaking even and only a small minority actually recording profits. **********But Chinese officials and economists seem to take some pleasure in having proved their skeptics wrong, at least in the short term. **********''You have to recognize the overall success of the macroeconomic policy in the last two years,'' said Xu Hongyuan, an economist at the State Information Center in Beijing. ''The nation's 10 percent growth rate is steady, and by international standards it's quite high.'' **********Mr. Xu said falling prices were caused mostly by an improving farm sector, where the combination of a bumper harvest and expanded food imports had eased domestic food prices, which make up half of the retail price index. **********Joan Zheng, an economist at J. P. Morgan in Hong Kong, said that China's agricultural performance had tended to be cyclical: any time there is a weak harvest, as in 1994, the authorities go to some lengths to reverse it, offering incentives to farmers to increase production and increasing imports of wheat, corn and rice. **********Ms. Zheng said she had detected a gradual easing of China's tight monetary policy, but that increased Government spending had not affected the inflation rate as much as low food prices. **********A Shanghai-based economist, still puzzling over the latest growth and inflation figures, said: ''These two numbers don't seem to fit. It really surprised me how far the inflation rate has fallen. The general consensus had been that inflation would be climbing again by the end of the year, but it's still falling.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/14/business/company-news-weyerhaeuser-calls-off-deal-with-roseburg.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;WEYERHAEUSER CALLS OFF DEAL WITH ROSEBURG", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;WEYERHAEUSER CALLS OFF DEAL WITH ROSEBURG", "body_text": " **********The Weyerhaeuser Company terminated its agreement to sell its Klamath Falls,  Ore., holdings to the Roseburg Forest Products Company, Weyerhaeuser said yesterday.

AT&T is also expected to reconfirm  its commitment to working with Lotus to make future versions of Notes operate more efficiently over public telephone networks. **********The announcement is an attempt to repair the strained relations between AT&T  and I.B.M. -- each is among the other's largest customers -- following AT&T's announcement on Feb. 29 that it was canceling Network Notes. AT&T said it was canceling the service, which connected Notes users over AT&T's telephone network, because it had been made obsolete by the rise of the Internet. **********The cancellation gave Notes a black eye at a time when Lotus was aggressively repositioning the software as complementary to the Internet rather than an expensive alternative. **********Notes is sophisticated software that lets organizations share information that is constantly kept up to date. Network Notes was designed to extend the reach of many Notes users by allowing them to connect to Notes data bases over AT&T phone lines, much as people connect to the Internet.    AT&T also planned to create dozens of \"virtual businesses\" serving a growing  number of Network Notes users. But while AT&T was spending millions -- the company would not disclose the exact amount -- readying its private network and  refining its elaborate business plan for Network Notes, use of the Internet mushroomed. **********A separate team within AT&T that was preparing to start businesses that would offer access to the Internet and operate sites on the World Wide Web for small and medium-sized companies suddenly looked like it had the brighter future. **********\"It's not surprising that they pulled out because there was a certain level of confusion in AT&T's approach,\" Dave Marshak, a senior software analyst at the Patricia Seybold Group in Boston, said. **********But even as AT&T cited the Internet as a reason to cancel Network Notes, several competing services have experienced strong growth, and Lotus has signed  up 14 other telecommunications and computer companies around the world to offer  Notes networks. **********\"In their mind, they viewed it as an either-or when they didn't have to,\" Mr. Marshak said, referring to AT&T's view of Notes and the Internet. **********The next version of Notes, which is expected to be released by the middle of  the year, is much more closely integrated with the Internet, allowing organizations to run their internal networks on Notes while simultaneously operating sites on the World Wide Web. It also allows users to gain access to Notes data bases using a Web browser, software currently used by millions of people to navigate the World Wide Web. **********AT&T recently rolled out its Internet access offering, which has received intense interest, and the company is currently experimenting with a service that develops Web sites for businesses. **********Although today's announcement is expected to be vague about how AT&T will use Notes in the future, the software could allow the company to recreate a service  like Network Notes as well as offer the other Internet-based services it has planned. For example, the new software is expected to give hundreds of AT&T customers the ability to create their own Web pages. **********John Petrillo, AT&T's executive vice president of strategy and new service innovation, is expected to be joined in today's announcement by John M.

American officials do say they know the Chinese company that sold the equipment  to Pakistan. **********The Administration decided not to impose sanctions, officials said, because  the Chinese promised not to transfer nuclear-related items in the future, reconfirmed their commitment to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and agreed to consult with Washington on export control policies and other proliferation issues. **********The shipment in question was small -- $70,000 worth of devices called ring magnets costing $14 apiece, sold beginning in June 1994 -- but the decision not  to impose sanctions for the sale was politically charged. **********It capped a week in which China policy was the major point in the Presidential campaign. Senator Bob Dole, who has supported Mr. Clinton's broader policy of unrestricted trade with China, immediately criticized today's decision. **********As recently as three weeks ago, senior Administration officials were convinced that the Administration would impose some form of sanction on China for the transfer of the magnets. They are being used to make enriched uranium in a Pakistani installation that is subject neither to inspection nor to normal international safeguards. At that time an official said the Administration would have to impose sanctions at least on the Chinese company involved because American \"credibility\" depended on China's understanding that \"actions have consequences, and that we mean what we say.\" **********At the same time, the Administration is considering imposing about $2 billion in economic sanctions on certain Chinese exports to the United States unless China fulfills promises made last year to stop producing pirated copies of copyrighted American software, music compact disks and videos. **********While officials say they are concerned about the deterioration of Washington's relationship with Beijing, they were at a loss to explain how announcing drastic sanctions on a trade issue one day and choosing to forgo sanctions on a nuclear proliferation issue the next could be seen as a consistent policy toward an emerging superpower. **********Senior officials said today that the two decisions were entirely separate. They added that the timing of the announcements had nothing to do with Mr. Dole's statement on Thursday, in a speech on Asia policy, that he supported Mr.  Clinton's decision to separate the issue of renewing China's \"most favored nation\" trading status from other issues like its human rights performance. **********In a statement today, Mr. Dole called the timing \"hardly coincidental,\" pointing out that it came a day \"after I spoke on the shortcomings of the Clinton Administration in Asia.\" **********The White House dismissed that speech today as \"kerfuffle\" after deploying Vice President Al Gore on Thursday to send the same message. **********Mr. Dole said the Administration \"was too slow to address proliferation concerns and too quick to reject targeted sanctions, for example on firms controlled by the Chinese People's Liberation Army involved in proliferation activities.\" **********Mr. Dole said China's promises \"must be matched by performance.\" What he found most troubling, he said, was that today's announcement exempted China's nuclear cooperation with Iran, which has been another area of concern. **********There is a separate, ongoing investigation of reports that China sold missiles and missile parts to Iran, items that may violate China's 1994 promise  to adhere to a missile technology control system, officials said. But there is no evidence so far that the reports are true, they added. That issue would not be considered one of nuclear cooperation, however. **********Administration officials said that while Teheran accepts international oversight of nuclear development, Washington tries to discourage anyone from cooperating with Iran on nuclear issues, however legal. **********Other Congressional reaction, with most legislators gone for the weekend, was mixed, with support for the decision coming from Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California. She said China's agreement to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons or unsafeguarded nuclear installations \"is the keystone for non-proliferation throughout Asia.\" **********China has made other promises and not kept them: not to pirate American software and music, for instance, or not to use prison labor to produce exports. **********Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said in a statement: \"We have seen the Chinese Government repeatedly promise to halt the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and repeatedly break those promises. Now, the Administration seems to have settled yet again for an empty promise.\" **********But American officials said today that China was moving toward an acceptable  international standard of nuclear controls and that its adherence would be carefully monitored. **********Officials today emphasized what they described as their success in getting China to promise specifically that it would not transfer ring magnets or provide any other \"assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities,\" a position the Chinese will confirm in their own statement. **********All together, the Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said, \"What we got is what we would have sought from the Chinese to remove sanctions had they been imposed.\" **********State Department officials said Mr. Dole's speech did not delay today's announcement or the separate trade-sanction decision. They said agreement with the Chinese was reached only this morning after nearly day-to-day exchanges since Mr. Christopher met the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, on April 19 in the Netherlands. **********Mr. Christopher nearly concluded a deal late that night with Mr. Qian, senior officials said today, but did not complete if before he had to depart on a weeklong Middle East shuttle mission. Until that meeting, the officials said, they fully expected to impose sanctions against at least the Chinese company involved, the Chinese Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Government-owned China National Nuclear Corporation. **********Asked about charges that the decision was delayed for Mr. Dole's speech or the piracy decision, Mr. Burns said: \"Unfortunately, we were not so artful. We almost had this agreement April 19, and we would have liked to announce it then.\" **********But when Mr. Christopher decided that \"senior level\" officials in the Government were not aware of the magnet transfer, it meant that a 1994 nuclear non-proliferation act, which calls for harsh Export-Import Bank sanctions if proliferation is \"willful,\" were not fulfilled."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/17/world/canada-senses-fragility-in-realm-s-new-coin.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1996-03-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 487, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Canada Senses Fragility in Realm's New Coin", "print_headline": "Canada Senses Fragility in Realm's New Coin", "body_text": " **********Canadians are smacking it against concrete walls, hammering it, boiling it, burning it and freezing it.

Corporations compete. But do whole economies compete? Writing in Foreign Affairs magazine two years ago, Paul Krugman of Stanford University labeled the idea \"a dangerous obsession\" used to rationalize government intervention on behalf of special interests and, more specifically, to justify trade protectionism. **********He was not the only mainstream economist to reject the competition metaphor.  And the World Economic Forum, a Swiss-based foundation underwritten by big business that has published an annual \"competitiveness report\" since 1979, took  the criticism to heart. The organization dropped its association with the Institute for Management and Development in Lausanne, Switzerland, and turned to Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute for International Development,  for a make-over. \"We wanted to take a second look at the competitiveness debate, as well as to give our members more practical information about investment opportunities,\" said Lobna Freih, a spokeswoman for the forum. **********While \"The Global Competitiveness Report 1996,\" just published, is unlikely  to silence all the skeptics, it does bend the idea of competitiveness to fit modern growth theory. Most intriguing, of course, is the new, improved list showing which countries have the right stuff. **********In previous competitiveness reports, economies were ranked by a blizzard of criteria, with some (gross domestic product, foreign capital inflows) looking suspiciously like the effect of whatever was meant by competitiveness rather than the cause. In the latest, Mr. Sachs formally defines competitiveness as \"the ability of a nation's economy to make rapid and sustained gains in living standards.\" This fits the common-sense Darwinian concept of capacity to thrive in a global economic environment, yet avoids the misleading \"zero sum game\" aspect of the competition metaphor in which one county's success must come at the expense of others. **********Next Mr. Sachs pruned away the most subjective inputs in the \"competitiveness index,\" putting more weight on such objective measures as average tariff rates,  savings as a percentage of G.D.P. and numbers of telephone lines per capita. Where objectivity was not possible, the report used the findings from surveys of international business executives so that assessments of the \"security of property rights\" and \"international experience of senior management\" were at least grounded on the perceptions of many, rather than on the hunches of a handful of researchers. **********And the winners? Singapore ranks first, with Hong Kong, New Zealand, the United States, Luxembourg and Switzerland following. Russia is the caboose of the 49 economies rated, with Brazil, Venezuela, Hungary and India helping to pull up the rear. **********A number of patterns are evident here. First, with the exceptions of the United States and New Zealand, the top-ranked countries have \"small and very open economies that specialize in providing trade and financial services to the world.\" **********Another group, \"Anglo Saxon\" economies -- New Zealand (ranked No. 3), United  States (4), Canada (8), Australia (12) and Britain (15) -- do far better than one might expect. Mr. Sachs attributes this to their flexibility, not to mention their resistance to the bear hug of social democracy and the accompanying inclination to solve every problem with state intervention. **********The Asian miracle economies rank highly, but perhaps not as well as their last few decades of supersonic growth would suggest. Taiwan (9), is followed by  Malaysia (10), Thailand (14) and South Korea (20). Many affluent economies do relatively poorly: Japan (13), the Netherlands (17), Germany (22) and France (23) are clustered in the middle. \"This relatively low ranking reflects in part  the fiscal, financial and employment problems now confronting the social welfare states of Europe,\" the report concludes. **********The key to these new rankings is remembering that they are driven by a strong theoretical vision. The index is intended to predict future capacity for growth, not celebrate past success. In effect, the Sachs researchers are betting that long-term growth largely turns on openness to trade, commitment to free markets, investment in technology and human skills, rule by law and stability. From this perspective, some economies that have done relatively well in recent years  will either have to shape up or eventually accept mediocrity. At the top of this warning list is China (36). Indonesia (30), the Czech Republic (35) and Italy (41) would presumably share China's fate. **********Those who want a second opinion can, fittingly, turn to the competition. The  Institute for Management and Development is churning out its own ratings, with the United States first, Japan fourth and Germany 10th.

Investors who need a steady income stream should opt for a global bond fund, a balanced fund or one that holds convertible securities, Mr. Wainer said. Some good ones, in his opinion, are the Lazard International Bond Fund, the Warburg World Bond Fund and the GT Global Bond Fund. **********Investors should avoid the tendency in countries, such as Britain, where stocks carry high dividend yields to go with an equity fund, he said. The income generated is usually much less than that of a bond fund, and the volatility can be much greater. **********Stocks are fine, though, for those seeking capital growth. Mr. Wainer recommends global equity funds, more so than funds targeting only one's home country. Some that he thinks highly of are Gan Worldwide, Templeton Global Growth and Guinness Flight Global Equity. **********Anyone out for pure speculation \u2014 maybe you figured your aunt wouldn't leave you a penny, and easy come, easy go \u2014 can try a global emerging-markets fund, perhaps Pictet Emerging or Genesis Emerging, or else a fund that offers leverage: a warrant fund, say, or a hedge fund. **********He noted that hedge funds tend to be open only to those with a lot of money to play with, although with $7,500 a speculator might be able to buy a single share in Leveraged Capital Holding, a fund run by the Rothschild organization in Switzerland that invests in hedge funds such as George Soros's renowned Quantum. **********The universe of funds is so expansive that picking one can be a complicated undertaking. \"You're spoiled for choice because there are literally hundreds around,\" Mr. Wainer said. **********To whittle that number down, he advised, \"go to a publication that gives rankings and tables and come up with one that meets your objectives.\" **********Consulting an investment adviser is another option. But for such a meager amount, an investor can expect only about half an hour of an adviser's time, for which he will expect to take part of the fund's front-end load, perhaps 1.5 percent or 2 percent, an amount that is \"probably money well spent if you don't feel comfortable picking a fund on your own.\" **********Laurie Laner, a certified financial planner with Financial Designs Inc. in Minnesota, said that before she recommended any investments to the recipient of a tiny windfall, she would take stock of his financial situation to make sure the money could not be put to better use outside the markets. **********\"The first assumption would be that this person doesn't have significant debt and has enough cash in the bank so that he can afford to invest,\" she said. Someone paying 14 percent interest on a credit-card balance, for instance, would be better off paying down the debt than risking the money in a stock or bond fund. **********If investing the money proves suitable and income is desired, Ms. Laner's first choice for an American would be a bond fund that is as diversified as possible, buying high-grade corporate paper as well as lower-quality, high-yield debt. Ideally, the fund would hold bonds with a range of maturities and perhaps some foreign bonds, too. **********For capital growth, Ms. Laner would recommend a global equity fund that invests in large companies, for these have been proven \"more consistent performers over time\" than smaller companies. **********As for speculation, she was hesitant to suggest anything truly offbeat, and many such investments \u2014 some hedge funds, for instance \u2014 are forbidden to retail investors under U.S. regulations. **********\"I don't do any super-high-risk stuff, but when I meet an aggressive-growth investor, I put him in a U.S. aggressive-growth fund,\" typically one that buys shares in smaller companies, she said. Ms. Laner might also counsel buying an emerging-markets fund, especially one that invests in the Pacific, a region she described as \"a really good buy.\" **********Tom Buck, a financial consultant with Merrill Lynch, has the same warm regard for Asia, which he called \"clearly the fastest-growing segment of the world's economy. There is risk there, but you could put in a dollar and in 10 years have the potential for it to be worth $10.' **********The advantage of an Asia-Pacific fund is that \"you can put money in and not have to worry about managing it,\" he explained. Other speculative investments, such as technology shares, precious metals and natural resources, must be watched carefully for fear of missing a market turn. **********For those interested in capital growth, Mr. Buck would seek out a stock fund whose manager is aiming for \"consistency of performance, rather than trying to make a return of the highest magnitude in any given year.\" **********He favors value-oriented portfolios, in which price-earnings ratios are below the market average and below the companies' earnings growth rates. He would prefer below-average price-to-book ratios, as well, and above-average dividends. By limiting the search to funds that meet those criteria, \"the universe of several thousand funds can be narrowed down to a handful,\" he said. **********For income, the key is to find a fund with a low expense ratio that buys only government or investment-grade corporate bonds and does not use derivatives to boost yield. A low expense ratio is especially important, he said, because \"a difference of a couple of tenths of a percent can have an enormous impact on yield over time.\" **********Even better than buying a fund, he said, is buying an individual bond. \"I know exactly when the bond comes due, when the [interest] comes due and how much I'm going to get,\" he said. **********The diversification that a fund can offer to equity investors makes it safer than shares in a single company, few of which can be deemed completely secure. With bonds, however, some individual issues are as safe as any investment imaginable. Their prices may fluctuate with interest rates, but at maturity there is every reason to believe that the debt of the best companies will be repaid in full. **********\"Bond money is safe money,\" Mr. Buck said. \"I'd rather be more cautious and know what I have than take greater risks and not know what I have.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/23/world/protest-leader-in-indonesia-is-relieved-of-party-role.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Mydans", "pub_date": "1996-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 598, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Protest Leader In Indonesia Is Relieved Of Party Role", "print_headline": "Protest Leader In Indonesia Is Relieved Of Party Role", "body_text": " **********Indonesia's most prominent political opposition figure, Megawati Sukarnoputri, was ousted today from her party's leadership by rival members, leaving her supporters uncertain over their next move. **********With the blessing of the Indonesian Government, the rival members reinstated  Ms. Megawati's predecessor as party chairman at a meeting in the western city of Medan, setting the stage for a possible confrontation with her supporters, who continued to occupy the party headquarters in Jakarta. **********Ms. Megawati, the daughter of Indonesia's late President Sukarno, denounced  the rival meeting as unconstitutional and said, \"I will continue to fight for democracy and uphold the people's sovereignty.\" **********But without the position of party leader, Ms. Megawati would not have legal standing to run for President in elections scheduled for 1998, and her supporters said her political options were limited. **********The reinstated party chairman, Suryadi, said he hoped to keep Ms. Megawati in a prominent position in the party, but her supporters said she would not accept  a compromise. **********In recent weeks, Ms. Megawati, 49, has raised an increasingly vocal challenge to the leadership of President Suharto, who has ruled Indonesia since taking power from Mr. Sukarno in 1966. **********In six presidential elections, he has been the only candidate of all three Government-sanctioned parties, including that of Ms. Megawati, the Indonesia Democratic Party. **********True opposition parties are not allowed in Indonesia, and Mr. Suryadi, who like many Indonesians uses one name, said today that he did not want his party to become \"the enemy of the Government.\" **********Ms. Megawati had been leading the party in that direction, threatening last week to mobilize her supporters and saying that if she chose, she could paralyze the country by bringing millions of people into the streets. **********But on Thursday, when 5,000 of her supporters demonstrated in central Jakarta to protest the rival party meeting, soldiers with batons choked off the demonstration, sending dozens of people to the hospital and sobering their leaders. **********\"It was a shock,\" Laksamana Sukardi, the party's treasurer and a Megawati loyalist, said on Friday. \"We need to pause and save some logistics and energy.

He is already on trial in a separate case, charged with having authorized the bribing of tax officials who were inspecting his media group, Fininvest. **********Mr. Craxi, 62, was once the strongman of Italian politics and served as Socialist prime minister from 1983 to 1987. Today he is the quintessential symbol of Italy's discredited former political class. **********Having been convicted in other corruption trials in Milan, he is now living in luxurious self-imposed exile at his villa in the Tunisian seaside town of Hammamet. Mr. Craxi, whose brother Antonio Craxi was among those indicted Friday and charged with receiving some of the Fininvest money, has been sentenced in absentia to jail terms totaling more than 25 years in other trials. **********The indictments handed down Friday, although not a complete surprise, nonetheless rank as being among the most spectacular set of criminal charges filed since the graft-busting Milan judges began their wide-ranging investigations of leading Italian businessmen and politicians in 1992. Judge Maurizio Grigo, who made the ruling at a closed-door committal hearing in Milan, set the start of the trial for Nov. 21. **********On Friday night, Mr. Berlusconi dismissed the indictment as \"a trial that evidently has a political aim, and namely to eliminate me as the leader of the opposition.\" He described the money transfers as \"a normal commercial operation\" and said the payments were made to a Tunisian film producer named Tarak ben Amar. **********Word first leaked some months ago that prosecutors were looking into allegations of an elaborate transfer of Fininvest funds to Mr. Craxi though a network of offshore banks and companies. On Friday, the indictment made it clear that Mr. Berlusconi is accused of permitting payments by Fininvest of 10 billion lire ($6.5 million), channeled to Mr. Craxi in 1991 through a Fininvest-linked offshore company, All-Iberian, and by way of accounts held at Swiss Bank Corp. in Lugano and the Trade Development Bank in Geneva. **********Over the years, the self-made media tycoon and billionaire has repeatedly denied allegations by political opponents that in exchange for payments to Mr. Craxi's Socialist Party, the Fininvest group obtained a raft of special favors, including important legislation allowing him to build and maintain a television empire that today controls half of the national market. **********The allegations of a link between Mr. Berlusconi and his close friend Mr. Craxi had become so public and widespread in Italy that when word of the inquiry leaked, the august Corriere della Sera newspaper began an article with the word \"Bingo!\" **********Mr. Berlusconi is virtually the only politician on the Italian scene who still defends the discredited Mr. Craxi. The former Socialist prime minister was best man at the media mogul's second marriage, and in the 1980s the two men and their families spent New Year's Eves partying at Mr. Berlusconi's villa near Milan. Recently, Mr. Berlusconi denied claims that Bettino Craxi served as his secret adviser and helped him plan to found Forza Italia, the political party and vehicle staffed with Fininvest executives that catapulted him into the prime minister's office for seven tumultuous months in 1994. **********Since 1992, Mr. Berlusconi's Fininvest group, another member of his family and a handful of his top executives, have faced a total of 27 arrests, 26 indictments and 3 convictions. The charges have ranged from fraud to an alleged attempt by Mr. Berlusconi's brother Paolo to blackmail Judge Antonio Di Pietro, the former prosecutor who first investigated the Berlusconi group. **********The charges filed Friday \u2014 of fraudulent accounting practices and illegal political contributions \u2014 come just ahead of the expected start of trading on Monday in the shares of Mediaset SpA, Mr. Berlusconi's television company.

Based on what Belgrade has done to date, the officials said, Washington owes Yugoslavia about $1 million. **********The reluctance of the United States to make good on its offer -- issued when the treaty was being negotiated -- is understood by European diplomats to arise out Washington's unhappiness with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. Mr. Milosevic's harsh reaction to protests against his decision to annul the results of elections last month has been condemned by Washington. **********The American mission to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which oversees the treaty, declined to comment on the failure of the United States to make the payments to Yugoslavia. **********While Yugoslavia has more than met its obligations under the arms control accords, the Bosnian Serbs have not, diplomats and military officers said. **********Officials said the Bosnian Serbs are trying to keep twice the number of tanks and 50 percent more heavy artillery pieces than they are permitted under the accord.

They were, for example, to have destroyed 40 percent of the artillery and 20 percent of the tanks above what the treaty allowed by the end of this month. **********The Muslim-Croat Federation is behind in meeting its obligations because of a dispute between the Muslims and Croats over which of their armies has to turn over the weapons to be destroyed. **********The greatest concern, however, is focused on the Bosnian Serbs. **********To begin with, they underreported the number of weapons in their arsenal when the war ended. The Bosnian Serbs said, for example, they had 1,348 pieces of heavy artillery, according to a report prepared by the security organization. But NATO intelligence concluded they had between 2,200 and 2,950. **********More troubling to the officials monitoring the treaty is the manner in which the Bosnian Serbs have interpreted treaty provisions that allow the parties to exempt from destruction those weapons that are intended for export, are used in research and development, or will be placed in museums. **********The Bosnian Serbs assert that 338 of their tanks and 800 of their heavy artillery fall within those exemptions. If allowed to stand, that would leave the Bosnian Serbs with 475 tanks, instead of the 137 ceiling set by the treaty."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/30/business/president-out-as-vw-seeks-gm-truce.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1996-11-30", "snippet": "Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, whom General Motors Corp has accused of stealing thousands of secret company documents when he left GM to join Volkswagen in 1993, resigns as president of Volkswagen; his lawyers say Lopez wants 'to concentrate on ...", "word_count": 1267, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "President Out As VW Seeks G.M.

That call, on June 21, 1993, may well have been the beginning of the end of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua's career as a top executive at Volkswagen A.G. **********Mr. Lopez, whom General Motors has accused of stealing thousands of secret company documents when he left G.M. to join Volkswagen in 1993, resigned as president of Volkswagen today. His lawyers said Mr. Lopez wanted ''to concentrate on expected legal proceedings'' -- a civil suit brought by General Motors in the United States as well as criminal charges that are expected to be filed soon by German prosecutors. **********It remains to be seen whether Mr. Lopez, who is 55, will be found guilty of industrial espionage, as General Motors has contended. But the cartons found in the Wiesbaden house have now led prosecutors and General Motors to evidence of widespread secret shipments of G.M. documents, late-night shredding parties and at least one big effort to transfer material from G.M. floppy disks and paper documents into Volkswagen computers. **********Volkswagen executives are now showing signs of panic about the prospects of a court trial in the United States, and are scrambling to reach an out-of-court settlement with G.M. **********A person close to VW's board, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the company was horrified by the prospect of VW's chairman, Ferdinand Piech, being forced to defend himself in an American court on accusations of racketeering and industrial spying. The same person expressed the hope that General Motors would be equally concerned about damaging its own image in Europe. **********''This is very frightening both to G.M. and to us,'' the person close to the board said. ''We fear that unless there is a settlement, this could really develop into economic warfare. If the discovery process and the trial goes on, there is no question that this could lead to a very, very bad situation.'' **********At a minimum, the Lopez case  threatens to severely wound Volkswagen's public image, just when the German car maker is showing strong growth in profits and sales after years of poor performance. **********Volkswagen's shares gained 2.3 marks today in trading on the Frankfurt exchange, closing at 615.6 marks. **********The chairman of VW's supervisory board, Klaus Liesen, met with the General Motors chairman, John G. Smale, and a board member, Thomas H. Wyman, in September, although the talks evidently made no progress. VW board members are continuing to make informal contacts with G.M. on a frequent basis, hoping that the departure of Mr. Lopez will open the path to some sort of agreement. **********For General Motors, the Lopez case has become a campaign for corporate revenge. Before he quit, Mr. Lopez had been one of General Motors' most visible and treasured stars, the man credited with sharply cutting the auto maker's costs and revolutionizing the way it bought its parts. Since losing Mr. Lopez to its German rival, General Motors has spared little effort to investigate, litigate and publicize what it describes as a brazen act of corporate back-stabbing. **********Today, General Motors offered little sign of being willing to let bygones be bygones. **********''The resignation of Lopez, which has been overdue for more than three years, cannot compensate for the substantial damages,'' said a statement issued by the company's Adam Opel subsidiary in Germany today. The statement accused VW's top management of a ''systematic cover-up'' for three years. **********If General Motors wins its suit in Detroit, Volkswagen could be forced to pay billions of dollars in compensation. That prospect grew more realistic on Tuesday, when a Federal judge in Detroit ruled that General Motors could sue VW under racketeering laws and claim triple the amount awarded by a jury. **********In 1993, when the police responded to Mr. Andersson's call, they found a cache of documents in the Wiesbaden apartment that included internal G.M. studies, cost information and a report entitled ''Strategic Business Plan Global Outsourcing.'' That soon led to a sweeping search of Volkswagen headquarters, Mr. Lopez's  home in Germany and VW's guesthouse, where Mr. Lopez had set up copying machines, shredders and a small staff to sort through papers. **********Volkswagen, which originally denied that it had obtained any information from General Motors, now admits that it received some of that material. But the company asserts that it had nothing to do with Mr. Lopez's efforts, that the information did not reach VW executives outside Mr. Lopez's group and that VW never used the information. **********However the case develops, VW will have a hard time disentangling itself from the activities of Mr. Lopez. G.M.'s lawsuit against Volkswagen contains a long chronology of Mr. Lopez's activities before and after he jumped over to the German car company. **********The documents found in the Wiesbaden apartment came directly from General Motors, but they were only the beginning. Once German police found the cartons, they searched Volkswagen headquarters, its computers, its offices and the homes of Mr. Lopez and his associates. According to G.M.'s complaint, Mr. Lopez had set up an elaborate document-processing operation at one of Volkswagen's more remote offices in Germany and installed a mainframe computer, 15 computer work stations and other equipment to transfer data from G.M. disks and documents to Volkswagen computers. **********The complaint also recounts the discovery of 20 cartons of General Motors documents, which the company says Mr. Lopez had shipped from Detroit to Spain at the time of his job switch. Those cartons were shipped on an airplane owned by Volkswagen, according to the complaint. **********G.M. also retraced Mr. Lopez's movements on an almost daily basis between February 1993, when he started negotiating with Volkswagen, and the time he quit General Motors on March 10. Based largely on interviews with scores of General Motors employees, many of whom helped prepare documents for shipping to Europe, the complaint draws a vivid portrait of Mr. Lopez collecting information voraciously at G.M. at the time he was in deep negotiations with VW over a new job. **********Mr. Lopez, the complaint says, demanded vast quantities of information about G.M.'s purchasing structure, its feasibility study for a revolutionary new factory that was code- named Plant X and even pictures of new automobile designs. **********At one point, the complaint says, Mr. Lopez ordered G.M. employees to translate large volumes of documents into German and then arranged to have those documents shipped to Europe. **********Volkswagen denies that its top management conspired with Mr. Lopez, but the company cannot deny that it adamantly supported the executive at every turn in the three-year conflict with General Motors, and that it refused to back down even after it became clear that Mr. Lopez and his followers had retained control of a big collection of G.M. documents. **********Not only did Volkswagen defend Mr. Lopez, but it also used a battery of lawyers to keep G.M. from taking legal action at every available opportunity. VW unsuccessfully tried to prevent G.M. from pursuing its lawsuit in Detroit. It also went to court in Germany, again unsuccessfully, to block G.M. from talking about its allegations here. And most recently, it sought -- again unsuccessfully -- to prevent German prosecutors from sharing their information with the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation. **********Even today, Volkswagen officials refrained from even hinting at any criticism of Mr. Lopez or acknowledging any improprieties.

Still, many lawyers were surprised when Judge Kocoras threw out the settlement, reversing a preliminary approval he gave in February. **********In asking Judge Kocoras to summarily dismiss the case before trial, drug makers had argued that they had done nothing more than respond to the pressures  of a competitive marketplace.

Evidence that such discrimination had occurred was a basis for going  to trial, he ruled, and the lack of any promise to end it was his main reason for rejecting the settlement. **********\"No commitment exists on the part of the settling defendants to bring about the fairness in opportunity which we believe the law requires,\" Judge Kocoras said in his opinion on the settlement. **********In a separate ruling, the judge granted a motion to dismiss six drug wholesalers from the suit. **********A fair shot at discounts is far short of what many retailers want -- one price for all. Indeed, it is very much in doubt whether many of the thousands of drug retailers that are having trouble competing as the health industry concentrates will ever achieve the influence over consumers needed to get the discounts. Still, groups that opposed the settlement were elated. **********\"It's a whole new ballgame in which manufacturers now have to demonstrate in  court that they don't have unfair, anticompetitive pricing practices,\" said Phillip Schneider, a spokesman for the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, a group also based in Alexandria that represents 135 chains owning 30,000 pharmacies. **********Drug companies said they had not yet had a chance to study the judge's ruling, but denied any conspiracy in setting prices. \"We have done nothing wrong, and we aren't part of any alleged conspiracy,\" Brian McGlynn, a spokesman for Pfizer Inc., told Bloomberg Business News. Judge Kocoras's ruling was a setback for Michael Freed and Perry Goldberg, well-known class-action lawyers who had negotiated the agreement with the drug makers. They had argued that the settlement was a good one because the payout -- a modest $10,000 for each class member after legal fees -- still added up to the biggest total by far in an antitrust case that had not been based on prior Government action. They also said that Judge Kocoras did not have the power to order the changes in pricing practices many retailers wanted. **********Neither Mr. Freed nor Mr. Goldberg returned calls seeking comment today. **********Fay Clayton, a Chicago lawyer who represented retailers in the case, said that some defense lawyers, whom she declined to identify, had already contacted  her suggesting negotiatons for a new settlement. **********\"I'm confident we can work this out,\" Ms. Clayton said. \"We are not looking for a ton of money. All my clients want is a level playing field.\" **********Those that had tried to settle the charges included many industry giants like Merck, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Glaxo Wellcome and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Marion Merrell Dow Inc. and Johnson & Johnson were among the larger companies that had  declined to settle. **********\"This is pretty much of a non-event for investors,\" said Paul A. Brooke, who  follows the industry for Morgan Stanley & Company. He said that many companies had already set aside money to cover the expected costs of settling the litigation. **********He also said that the trial of the complex pricing issues would have taken place in any case because so many plaintiffs had already chosen to sue separately, and that the conflict might take years to resolve. **********The pharmaceutical industry also faces a Federal Trade Commission investigation of its pricing, begun after the settlement had first been reached, and separate suits by large drugstore chains, grocery-store pharmacies, and about 3,500 independent pharmacies that had chosen to stay out of the class action. Some suits have broader antitrust claims than those filed by the independent retailers that would have been covered by the settlement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/06/business/company-reports-minnesota-mining-mfg-co-mmmn.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 224, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY REPORTS;MINNESOTA MINING & MFG.

The Q ratio, devised by James Tobin, the Yale economist who won a Nobel prize for his work, is a ratio of the total market value of stocks and bonds compared with what it would cost to replace the assets of America's corporations. **********There are good data on this since World War II, when the Federal Reserve began calculating the numbers on an annual basis. On average, stocks and bonds sold for about a 30 percent discount to what it would cost to replace the companies' assets. **********But now those financial securities sell for at least 70 percent more than the replacement cost. That level has never been seen before, and to some analysts, it is a warning of excessive overvaluation. **********Andrew Smithers, a British economist and proprietor of Smithers & Company, a  pension consulting firm, is sounding the loudest alarm. \"Professor Tobin received a Nobel prize for his work, and the U.S. stock market may thus be said  to be making a bet of approximately $3 trillion that he should return his laurels,\" Mr. Smithers said in a report to clients. \"I expect him to be justified in keeping them.\" **********But Mr. Smithers, in an interview, conceded that there was no way to know just when the bubble might burst. The Q ratio, he said, was a good valuation measure, not a way to time the stock market. **********Barton Biggs, the chief strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company, agrees. \"It  is an indication that stocks are very risky, because they are very expensively priced,\" he said. **********Mr. Biggs said he had studied the numbers, and the only thing he could come up with to possibly modify them is that they do not take into account the value  of franchises and brand names, which perhaps are worth more now than before. Certainly, one could duplicate every asset of the Coca-Cola Company, from bottling plants to office desks, without creating a company as valuable as Coca-Cola if one did not get the right to use the name as well. **********Mr. Tobin's work showed that the profits on invested capital, measured by its current value, should return to normal levels eventually, simply because figures well away from normal will produce an investment boom. Eventually, all that investment will create competition, eroding whatever was producing high rates of return. **********And what does Mr. Tobin think about all this? He said that he had not seen Mr. Smithers' work but that the current Q ratio did seem to imply that stock prices are higher than they ought to be. **********\"Another implication is that it ought to generate an investment boom,\" he said. \"You don't have to sell much of your firm to get the money you need for an investment project.\" **********It is conceivable that the current figures are exaggerated because the replacement costs are underestimated. And it is also true that while a lot of companies are selling stock to the public, as would be expected if prices really are ridiculously high, some are also buying stock back and making acquisitions for cash. Neither would seem reasonable if valuations were that extreme. **********The figures for the Q ratio are computed annually by the Federal Reserve, with the 1995 figure due out soon. Morgan Stanley estimates it will be about 1.71, and adds that if a figure were to be computed now, taking into account just how much the stock market has risen, it would be around 1.8. That is, assets now sell on Wall Street for about 80 percent more than it costs to make them. **********If one assumes that the stock market will eventually fall back to the norm of about 70 percent of replacement value -- or a ratio of 0.70 -- that implies a stock market drop of about 60 percent. That would leave the Dow Jones industrial average at less than 2,500 points. **********Mr. Smithers said he had estimated Q values back to the 1920's and had concluded that the stock market was considerably more overvalued now than it was in 1929. **********To Mr. Biggs, the Q ratio is a good reason to cut back on American stocks, and substitute foreign ones. To Mr. Smithers, even foreign stocks may not be immune to the consequences of what he thinks will be a huge crash. **********A major reason stocks have gone up, of course, is that American investors have done well in stocks and do not see other investments as offering high returns. Real estate has not boomed recently, and interest rates on bonds and bank deposits are far less than where they have been. **********That logic, it turns out, has been compelling even to one who might be expected to be especially impressed by Mr. Tobin's Q ratio. What, Mr. Tobin was  asked, had he done with his own money? **********\"I haven't taken it out of the market, if that's what you're asking,\" he replied, adding that he thought investor psychology was an important consideration. And anyway, he added, \"the alternatives don't look all that attractive.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/12/world/chaos-in-burundi-could-sow-misery-next-door.html": {"writer_name": "James McKinley", "pub_date": "1996-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1055, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chaos in Burundi Could Sow Misery Next Door", "print_headline": "Chaos in Burundi Could Sow Misery Next Door", "body_text": " **********When Burundi's divided Government recently asked neighboring countries to send troops to help quell ethnic violence, it represented the first breakthrough in a deadly three-year stalemate between Hutu and Tutsi political leaders. **********In response to Burundi's call, six heads of state met last month and agreed to create a security force from neighboring countries to protect officials, civil servants, public institutions and communications centers in the country, which is led by a Tutsi Prime Minister and a Hutu President. **********But the solution is likely to unravel unless moderates can find a way to make the idea of foreign peacekeepers acceptable to Tutsi hard-liners. **********For centuries the Tutsi have been the ruling class here, and their leaders see any intervention as a threat to their wealth and power. The current round of Hutu guerrilla raids and attacks by the Tutsi-led army, which have killed 150,000 people, were ignited when a Hutu became the country's first elected President in October 1993, and Tutsi soldiers kidnapped and killed him. **********More is riding on the peace plan than just Burundi's future, diplomats say. If Burundi slips further into chaos, it could spill into Rwanda, its neighbor to the north, which has the same ethnic mix and has still not recovered from the massacres that took 500,000 lives. **********The danger is that an ethnic war between Hutu and Tutsi in Burundi and Rwanda could engulf the region, sending hundreds of thousands more refugees into Tanzania and Zaire, where 1.7 million Hutu are now living in camps along the borders. **********That fear is apparently lost on some Tutsi politicians in Burundi who have decided to draft their own plan to present to the African officials for approval, a fact that has slowed the process. And each day that passes without agreement on the peace plan has given Tutsi leaders in Burundi more time to establish opposition. **********For instance, thousands of Tutsi civil servants recently marched in the streets calling President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya a traitor for agreeing to a foreign force and demanding his resignation. **********In the center of the controversy is Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo, a Tutsi who once adamantly opposed foreign peacekeepers, but has since changed his stance. Leaders of his Tutsi-dominated Uprona Party then accused him of treachery, and so the Prime Minister has tried to distance himself from the plan, insisting that any foreign force be under the command of the Burundian military. He has also portrayed the plan as a way to help the army defeat the rebellion. **********\"The way I see things, this assistance will just be here to fill in the deficit we have in protecting the population, and not to replace the national army,\" he said. \"The rebels, instead of fighting the national army, have decided to massacre people, and because the population is so spread out, the army has not been able to protect every family.\" **********But from the perspective of Hutu political leaders, the Tutsi-led army is as  guilty of massacres as Hutu rebels are. The Hutu are unlikely to accept any plan that does not give peacekeepers the power to halt atrocities by Government soldiers. **********Even with all the obstacles, there are some reasons for hope, Western aid officials say. To begin with, there is the change in position by Mr. Nduwayo and the Defense Minister, Fermin Sinzayiheba, who has come to support the agreement. **********Why the change of heart? One reason is the shattered economy. After three years of guerrilla war, the Burundi treasury is in such poor shape that 40 percent of its revenues come from taxes on locally brewed beer. It has only about $60 million in reserve, about enough to last until December. Indeed, the only people making money in Burundi are arms, gold and heroin smugglers, who would probably like to see the hostilities continue. **********At the same time, American and European aid, which had represented a quarter  of Burundi's gross domestic product, was cut off two months ago after visits from high-ranking officials. **********\"There have been clear statements over the last few months that Western donor countries were able to help, but were unable to do this unless there is very quickly a minimum of stability and security,\" said one relief official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. **********European and American diplomats here have also made it clear that they will not recognize a Tutsi government that takes power through a coup. The West has also made it known it will not allow Burundi to turn into another Rwanda. The implicit message has been that a Damocles sword of military intervention is hanging over the Burundi Government's head, so it may prefer to invite foreign troops in before it is forced to accept them. **********Prime Minister Nduwayo said as much. \"We preferred this kind of formula to military intervention from an international force because we know that the neighboring countries know much better the problems here and also because we believe in regional cooperation,\" he said. **********Some Tutsi leaders are also recognizing they cannot win the war. Despite having a 20,000-strong army, the Tutsi have been unable to curb Hutu guerrillas  based in Zaire from gaining control of northern provinces. Neither have they been able to keep the rebels from sowing terror in other parts of the country. **********Furthermore, demographics are against the Tutsi. They are outnumbered four to one, and the anti-Tutsi sentiment in the country has only grown with each reprisal carried out by the army against Hutu villages. **********Similar attempts by foreign troops turned into disasters in Liberia and Somalia, where the peacekeepers became drawn into the fighting. **********The danger of the same thing happening in Burundi is high, and some army officials are already saying they will fight any foreign force not under their command. **********Even the main rebel group has said it will consider the peacekeepers as enemies. The rebel leader, Leonard Nyangoma, a former Interior Minister, may think he has more to gain in a fight than peace talks. **********\"If this intervention force is imposed on the Government or if it is a foreign force coming to replace the army, I have doubts about the capacity of such a force to bring the country back to peace,\" former President Pierre Buyoya said. \"Unless this force has the full support of the national leadership, you can be sure that it will be no solution at all. This is likely to bring about more confusion.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/24/business/general-magic-is-planning-to-introduce-new-products-for-the-internet.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "1996-06-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 400, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "General Magic Is Planning to Introduce New Products for the Internet", "print_headline": "General Magic Is Planning to Introduce New Products for the Internet", "body_text": " **********General Magic Inc., which intended to reinvent computing but missed out on the rise of the Internet, plans to introduce several products on Tuesday that will refocus the company on the global computer network. **********General Magic, whose investors include the AT&T Corporation, Motorola Inc., Apple Computer Inc., the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation and the Sony Corporation, set out when it was founded in 1990 to develop an operating system  and a telecommunications language. **********The original vision was to create a new generation of hand-held \"personal intelligent communicators\" and a digital telecommunications system that would permit personal software \"agents\" to perform tasks for mobile computer users. **********But General Magic executives now acknowledge that by focusing on the company's own proprietary vision of the future, they failed to capitalize on the rise of the Internet. **********\"We've concluded we have to redirect our technology there,\" said Robert Kelsch, the president and chief operating officer of General Magic. \"We still believe that we can add value to the Internet.\" **********The company plans to announce that it has developed a version of its Telescript language for use on World Wide Web server computers.

It means ''developing an overall packaging of the network to build a relationship with viewers, so they will come to expect certain things from us,'' said Alan Cohen, executive vice president for the ABC-TV unit of the Walt Disney Company in New York. **********That, he said, means defining the network so that ''when you're watching ABC, you'll know you're watching ABC'' -- and to accomplish it in a way that appeals to the primary ABC audience of youngish urbanites and families with children. **********For the most part, the network branding binge is aimed at capturing the attention of that most demographically desirable audience so coveted by advertisers, consumers ages 18 to 49. **********But there are some variations: CBS is trying to lure back older viewers; NBC is trying to portray itself as more urban and single-friendly (think of ''Friends''); the two newest networks, WB and UPN, hope to gain favor with a younger, often black, audience in big cities, where their affiliates are concentrated, and Fox is trying to broaden its appeal beyond its trademark young brash image by playing up new programming like the Super Bowl. **********To push those brand identities, the six networks have all assembled a slew of slogans and elaborate promotional campaigns. Fox promises a ''Super season''; CBS bids a fervent ''Welcome home'' to its traditional audience after a disastrous season spent courting younger viewers who avoided flops like ''Central Park West,'' and NBC keeps asserting the merits of ''Must see TV.'' **********The broadcast networks are also trying to forge brand images for certain nights with thematically similar programs. NBC, a unit of the General Electric Company, is peddling a Saturday night of three melodramas about the paranormal meant to appeal to sophisticated urbanites. ABC is rejuvenating ''T.G.I.F.,'' four Friday sitcoms aimed at children and families. UPN has two separate nights of ''Back to Back'' comedies and dramas. And CBS is selling ''America's night of television,'' three schmaltzy Saturday shows. **********The ardor with which branding is being embraced underscores just how high the stakes are for the networks as they grow anxious to lure eyeballs back to the set. **********The four largest networks -- ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox -- have suffered ratings erosion, losing viewers precipitously to cable channels and, to a lesser degree, UPN and WB. The four networks' share of the prime-time audience in 1995-96 fell to 61 percent, a record low, compared with 65 percent in 1994-95. **********That loss is especially perilous because the networks have taken advantage of the robust demand for commercial time among consumer marketers by aggressively raising ad rates. The networks' decoupling of ad rates to market share has not gone unnoticed by cable television executives, who are intensifying their pitches to Madison Avenue. **********Indeed, cable advertising revenue has been growing strongly; for the first six months of this year, the national cable networks took in $2.1 billion in ad revenue, up 25.7 percent from $1.7 billion in the corresponding period a year ago. **********Not everyone is a fan of branding. Critics point to the difficulty of linking disparate programs on a single network. Take ABC: it wants viewers for edgy dramas like ''N.Y.P.D. Blue''; slick sitcoms like ''Spin City,'' a new series starring Michael J. Fox, and fluffy favorites like ''America's Funniest Home Videos.'' **********The networks ''are overdoing it,'' said Walter Staab, chairman and president at the SFM Media Corporation, a New York agency that buys commercial time for advertisers. He said that the promotional spots the networks are running are ''detracting somewhat from the impact of our clients' commercials.'' **********Gene DeWitt, president at DeWitt Media, another New York media agency, agreed that ''a lot of the money branding networks is wasted.'' But he called brand-identification campaigns for specific nights ''a great idea because they give people a hook that they might remember.'' **********Yet network branding has met with some success, especially among the broadcasters' cable rivals. Networks like CNN, ESPN and MTV have drawn viewers almost as much for their catchy branding promotions as for their focused programming. **********Branding made its mark on broadcast TV in the late 1980's as Fox, a unit of the News Corporation, began developing an in-your-face image with promotional ploys that celebrated raucous sitcoms and flashy nighttime soap operas. **********''When people look at schedules, they say, 'That's a Fox-like show,' '' said Stacey Marks-Bronner, executive vice president for marketing at Fox in Beverly Hills, Calif. The strategy worked, drawing viewers 18 to 34 and 18 to 49. **********NBC followed earlier this decade, aiming at a similar audience, though perhaps more urbane. NBC shrewdly branded several popular sitcoms -- and by extension, the network's entire schedule -- as ''Must see TV'' with playful promotions that mix humor and celebrities with a nostalgic comeback for the NBC peacock. **********''We have tried to give our network an attitude of being a little bit smarter, a little bit riskier, a little bit funnier,'' said Vince Manze, senior vice president for advertising and promotion at the NBC unit of the General Electric Company in Burbank, Calif. **********''Everyone is doing it now,'' he added. NBC, which won the ratings race for the 1995-96 season, was the only large network to have increased viewership from the 1994-95 season. **********To try to duplicate that feat this year, the NBC promotional juggernaut is in overdrive. More than twice as many NBC commercials ran during the Summer Olympics as for the next largest advertiser, Coca-Cola. **********''We feel it's important to 'produce' the network,'' said John Miller, executive vice president for advertising and promotion and event programming at NBC. ''We want to give viewers a sense of place throughout each night.'' That is why ''Must see TV,'' which originally described a sitcom block on Thursdays, has been expanded to cover Tuesdays and Wednesdays, too. **********UPN is touting a ''Back to back'' block of comedies, many featuring black casts, on Mondays and part of Tuesdays. The theme is echoed for a block of dramas on Wednesdays. **********''Branding is extraordinarily important because the landscape from a competitive standpoint is so much more complex,'' said Joe Passarella, senior vice president for marketing and advertising at UPN, a joint venture of Chris-Craft Industries and Viacom Inc. in Los Angeles. **********CBS is so busily branding that the network has been the object of pointed jokes on two of its own shows. On ''Late Show With David Letterman'' Wednesday, Mr. Letterman mocked the ''Big comedy Monday'' slogan being used to peddle a block of four sitcoms starting with ''Cosby.'' Mr. Letterman claimed CBS was also hawking ''Really big comedy Wednesday'' and a Friday of ''Del comedia muy, muy hilarioso.'' **********And on the season premiere Monday of ''Murphy Brown,'' Murphy and her colleagues caught Stan Lansing, the fictitious head of CBS, watching a cartoon on WB. **********''It's funny and their network has that cute little singing frog,'' he said. ''Maybe we should spice up our mascot. But it's an eye.'' **********Suddenly, he had an idea. ''Wait!,'' he cried. ''We could call it Blinky . . . Blinky, the tap-dancing eye!'' **********CBS's ratings fell the most last season as the network, which is owned by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, lost 13 percent of its audience in a futile effort to appeal to younger viewers than its primary audience of 25-  to 54-year-olds. **********''Our objectives were noble,'' said James A. Warner, who, as president of the CBS Television Network in New York, is its real head. ''But we way overshot the target. So this year, our message is 'Welcome home,' to the CBS tradition of outstanding television, to a warm, trustworthy place, to the stars you know and like.'' **********Those stars include Bill Cosby, who won an unprecedented two-season, $50 million commitment from CBS for ''Cosby.'' The initial ratings were favorable: the debut episode, against less-than-strong competition, dominated its Monday time slot and helped CBS win the night. **********''Cosby'' is perhaps the season's most-promoted series and is being featured on display trucks that cruise Los Angeles and Manhattan, with promotional posters that change every five seconds; on free videocassettes offering a ''sneak peek'' of the season, and in a sweepstakes offering prizes of MCI long-distance phone calls. **********Those promotions show how willing the networks have become, as they court viewers, to experiment beyond traditional tactics like TV spots and ''tune-in'' advertisements. **********There is advertising in movie theaters, fast-food restaurants and on the Internet, as well as on cable and radio networks. There are mailings, posters, billboards, brochures and buses painted with the faces of series stars. There are tie-in promotions with big advertisers and contests with prizes like Pontiacs and walk-on roles in popular series. **********About the only come-on that's missing, it seems, is an offer of a job branding a network for next year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/21/business/bias-suits-against-wall-st-firms.html": {"writer_name": "Barry Meier", "pub_date": "1996-11-21", "snippet": "Three female employees of Smith Barney sued company in Federal court last May, charging discrimination and sexual harassment, and 22 more current and former employees from across country joined that action last month; women claim that their compla...", "word_count": 1294, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bias Suits Against Wall St. Firms", "print_headline": "Bias Suits Against Wall St. Firms", "body_text": " **********When the Rev. Jesse Jackson called on Texaco Inc. last week to urge the oil company to address racial discrimination, he arrived in the glare of television lights. But three years ago, a similar visit to Smith Barney Inc. received scant publicity. His workplace concern then: allegations of not only racial, but also sexual, discrimination made by a politically connected investment banker at one of Wall Street's biggest brokerage firms. **********Not long after, Smith Barney dealt with the issue by quietly paying $1.35 million to settle claims by Marianne Camille Spraggins that she had been humiliated and discriminated against because she was black and a woman. Ms. Spraggins, a high-profile managing partner at the firm, had been a fund-raiser for David N. Dinkins, the former New York mayor. **********The expensive settlement, however, did not end discrimination complaints at Smith Barney. And now they are no longer being made behind closed doors: in May, three female employees sued Smith Barney in Federal District Court in Manhattan, and by last month 22 more current and former employees from across the country had joined that action or a second lawsuit filed in California. **********Along with claims that the company -- a unit of Travelers Group Inc. -- had denied them promotions, the women accused male brokers of routinely subjecting them to abuse and unwanted sexual advances. When they complained of harassment, some of the women said, executives often ignored them; when the firm did investigate, it disclosed their identities prematurely, exposing them to retaliation. **********Smith Barney will not comment on the specific allegations, but rejects any suggestion that it tolerated sexual harassment or discrimination, a spokesman, Bob Connor, said. He said the company investigated all complaints and took appropriate action, but company officials said they could not disclose the number of complaints they had received or actions they had taken. **********''Our goal is to create an environment that is as free of discrimination and harassment as possible,'' Mr. Connor said, adding that there were high-ranking women in all levels of the firm's operations. **********Every so often a discrimination case takes on larger-than-life dimensions because of a smoking gun like the tapes on which Texaco executives discussed destroying documents requested for a racial discrimination case. But the kind of charges now surrounding Smith Barney, slowly unfolding for years amid competing claims and counterclaims, are more typical. **********Piercing to the factual heart of such claims is particularly difficult on Wall Street, where discrimination cases are heard not in the open forum of a courthouse, but in the closed-door proceedings of security-industry arbitration panels. Only those cases in which decisions are reached become public -- and few, it appears, make it through the process before being settled. **********While they wait for a Federal judge to decide whether to grant class-action status to their claims, however, the women at Smith Barney are opening Wall Street's doors by speaking out. **********In an interview this month, for example, Lisa Mays said her problems at Smith Barney began soon after she started work in 1989, as a wire operator at a branch in Walnut Creek, Calif. Starting work at 5:30 A.M., she typically found herself alone in the office with one broker. **********One day, Ms. Mays said, the broker suddenly cornered her, slammed her against a wall and tried to rip off her skirt while he unbuttoned his pants. The attack was halted by the arrival of a co-worker, Stanette Goepel. **********''I was really out of it for a long time,'' Ms. Mays said. ''I couldn't talk to anyone about anything. I wouldn't eat my lunch. I won't get up to go to the bathroom; I just did my work.'' **********When she finally told the branch manager about the incident months later, he said she was ''taking it wrong'' and that the broker ''would not have gone all the way,'' according to court papers filed by Ms. Mays and other plaintiffs. **********Her problems did not end there. Last year she transferred to a Smith Barney office in Larkspur, Calif., as an operations manager. According to her complaint, the office's manager referred to women as ''bitches,'' suggested that they had ''cyclical'' moods and told Ms. Mays to ''lay down and take it'' when brokers complained to her about office matters. **********Mr. Connor said Smith Barney would not comment on Ms. Mays's claims; the broker declined to comment and the office manager referred questions to Mr. Connor. **********Securities industry records show that cases have been filed against nearly every major brokerage firm. But while the aggressive world of Wall Street is often said to be rife with male harassment of women, there are few statistics to support the perception. **********Among the arbitration cases that were resolved and became public in the last two years, for example, there were only 26 discrimination complaints by women, most of them decided against the complainant, according to Richard Ryder, editor of the Securities Arbitration Commentator, an industry newsletter in Maplewood, N.J. **********That figure barely indicates the scope of the problem, according to several plaintiffs' lawyers active in discrimination and harassment lawsuits. ''About 90 percent of complaints we handle are settled before they are submitted for arbitration,'' said Judith Vladeck, a lawyer in New York. ''The problem is endemic.'' **********In 1994 the National Association of Securities Dealers studied the arbitration system and found it basically sound, said Linda Fienberg, the N.A.S.D.'s executive vice president and chief hearing officer for arbitrations. The process, she added, is also far less costly than litigation. **********But a 1994 study by the General Accounting Office, the research arm of Congress, found that the arbitrators assigned to discrimination cases did not appear to have any legal expertise in the area. In addition, 80 percent of arbitrators were white men, with women making up only 11 percent. **********At Smith Barney, the allegations range from officewide harassment, as claimed at a branch on Long Island, where female employees say they were groped and humiliated in a clubhouse-like ''Boom Boom Room,'' to individual cases accusing not only brokers but also a high-ranking investment banker. **********Following the company's investigation of the Long Island case, the branch manager was relieved of his duties and subsequently retired. **********According to the California suit, Ms. May wasn't the only woman to have problems in the Walnut Creek branch. **********Ms. Goepel, who started working as a receptionist at the office in 1990, contended that the same broker who reportedly attacked Ms. May frequently asked her about her favorite sexual position and would call her seeking ''phone sex.'' **********Ms. Goepel said in court papers that she repeatedly complained about the broker to her superiors, including two divisional managers, but no action was taken to investigate the matter. **********Ms. Goepel said she quit Smith Barney in 1994 and was now working at a brokerage firm where the atmosphere was less hostile toward women. ''I was just a single parent, trying to keep my act together and not be harassed,'' she said. **********Besides brokers, one leading investment banker at Smith Barney has been accused of harassment. **********In case filed last year in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Alicia DeGaetano charged that her boss, Frederick Hessler, a managing partner, made frequent sexual advances and suggested that her job advancement was tied to her response. **********Over a period of several months, court papers state, Mr. Hessler asked her out and tried to entice her to take out-of-town trips with him, court papers indicate. **********Finally, Ms. DeGaetano complained about Mr. Hessler to Smith Barney's legal department. She was subsequently told that company had found no evidence to support her allegations. **********''We found that her claims were without merit,'' Mr. Connor said. Mr. Hessler referred questions about the case to Mr. Connor. **********As with most harassment and discrimination claims involving Wall Street, the facts surrounding Ms. DeGaetano's claims may never be known. After she sued, a judge ordered the case removed from court and sent to a securities-industry panel for arbitration, where it remains."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/13/business/company-briefs-809977.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-08-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********NEWPARK RESOURCES INC., Metairie, La., completed its purchase of the marine waste-collection business of Sanifill Inc., Houston, for $70.5 million. **********MORGAN PRODUCTS LTD., Williamsburg, Va., a maker of building products, agreed to buy Tennessee Building Products Inc., Nashville, a building products company with annual sales of about $47 million.

It now focuses almost exclusively on inflation, and to bond traders growth equals inflation, and inflation reduces the purchasing power of the principal and interest payments received on bond investments. This, in turn, reduces demand for bonds and lowers the prices people are willing to pay for them. **********Short-term traders therefore dump bonds at the first signs of rising prices for commodities, weakened government resolve to cut deficits or a mere hands-off signal by the Federal Reserve Board that it might not cut short-term interest rates. **********Their next marker will come with the producer price index on Thursday. A rise of 0.4 percent will be taken as a signal to sell bonds again at even lower prices. **********Since the start of the year, as prices of Treasury securities have fallen steadily, the yield on the benchmark 30-year issue has risen almost one full percentage point. Although the yield slipped to 6.83 percent Tuesday from 6.87 percent Monday, many analysts have predicted it would reach 7 percent soon. **********No wonder stocks are taking a beating. With average dividends on the Standard & Poor's 500 stocks at record-low yields of about 2 percent, bond returns look more attractive every day. Especially when the Dow's gain of 1,875 points since the start of 1994 is equal to the gain of the past eight years, said Stephen Langan of Nichols, Santina & Lerner, who last month predicted the Dow would drop a whopping 500 points in April because \"this can't last.\" **********But the short-term bond traders have forgotten that their actions may become a self-fulfilling prophecy and automatically slow the economy, warned Geoffrey Bell, a New York investment adviser and executive secretary of the Group of 30, a bankers' study group. **********\"The bond market now is doing what the Fed used to do and has become its advance guard,\" he said. \"As interest rates go up, demand for housing, autos, and other interest-sensitive goods will go down. It is a self-correcting process for the economy. We continue to be in a disinflationary environment.\" **********He also warned that Europe could be dragged deeply into the economic doldrums if it stood aside and permitted rising U.S. rates to permeate global markets instead of actively fighting back by lowering rates, starting with the Bundesbank. **********Wall Street nevertheless sees strong inflation warnings in rising prices of oil, wheat, corn, and gold. \"Very premature,\" snapped Anir Van Banerji, senior economist at Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle Research, whose leading inflation index rose 0.4 percent in February from March. **********The index expresses direction of inflation rather than its strength, and throughout 1995 it had been going down. All that is happening, he said, is \"a dissipation of disinflationary pressures.\" In other words, after a full year, air has finally stopped hissing out of the economic balloon and nothing more. **********Wall Street follows the Commodity Research Bureau index 17 commodities because it tracks futures prices, and agricultural futures have pushed it up nearly 5 percent this year. Columbia uses the Journal of Commerce's index, which is heavily weighted with industrial materials and has remained fairly steady. **********Moreover, said Michael Aronstein of West Course Capital, none of these indexes take account the shift in business practice in which \"everyone becomes a hero by holding no inventory.\" Sudden demand for crude oil has pushed up prices for immediate delivery by nearly $5 a barrel this year, but that can evaporate in days, he warned. Oil bought on six-month contract can be bought for far less and those prices do not show up in the index. **********Aside from highly volatile food and energy prices, said Rosanne Cahn, CS First Boston equity economist, \"nothing's going up.\" Moreover, she said, even if interest rates are going up, \"it made hardly any difference to the stock market when it last happened in 1994.\" **********During that year, short-term rates doubled, but stock prices declined only 4 percent as measured by monthly averages. By contrast, in past soft economic landings like this one, rising interest rates bought a 15 percent decline in stock prices. The difference is the underlying shift toward higher rewards in the capital markets than the labor market, she said, and that is not going to change soon."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/15/business/behind-the-scenes-computer-critters-way-beyong-mr-ed.html": {"writer_name": "Ty Ahmad-Taylor", "pub_date": "1996-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 546, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Behind the Scenes;Computer Critters: Way Beyong Mr. Ed.", "print_headline": "Behind the Scenes;Computer Critters: Way Beyong Mr. Ed.", "body_text": " **********It takes several years of training to teach a lion to not bite the trainer's  head off while it is in the animal's mouth.

Doug Smythe, the computer graphics sequence supervisor for the film, said that additional work was done with computer puppets, much like the frogs in the Budweiser beer commerical. **********The whole digital animal tradition may have started with the MCA/Universal film \"Babe,\" which featured talking barnyeard animals and the work of the Thythm and Hues computer effects house.

Creating animals with hair and human-like abilities (monkeys drive a motorcycle in one scene) was a leap forward from that older technology. **********THE MANE **********The mane was especially hard to do in the computer realm because its intricate detail is difficult to draw in 3-D.

There is also a searching mechanism for regulations and standards, which contains the detailed rules used to enforce the act. **********A search for \"lighting and manufacturing\" yields information on inspections, equipment requirements, electrical standards and penalties. For instance, standard number 1926.56 lists minimum illumination requirements (in foot-candles) for construction areas, and standard number 1926.405 (a)(2)(ii)(B) directs: \"Conductors shall be run as multiconductor cord or cable assemblies or  open conductors, or shall be run in raceways.\" Obviously, the lawyers at Acme Widget are going to have to read through some of these regulations. **********Other Federal agencies, like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration, allow computer users to search for laws or the regulations and guidelines and items published in the Federal Register. **********There are also two major sites to find related studies and reports published  by the Federal Government.  Fedworld is a home page set up by the National Technical Information Service, an agency that is part of the Technology Administration of the Department of Commerce. The agency, which sells its information, is a source for business, scientific and technical reports, surveys and data bases. Once a product is found, it can be ordered by telephone, mail, fax or over the Internet. **********The second site is the Government Information Locator Service, which bills itself as an on-line catalogue of information resources. A search on this page yields the name of the Federal agency that gathered the information, a description of the document, and how to get it. **********Finally, there is the Government Printing Office page. The page has a searching mechanism for the monthly catalogue of United States Government publications. When a document is chosen, the researcher can find the nearest Federal depository library through which it can be obtained. The site also provides the catalogue information for a publication and the closest Government  Printing Office bookstore. **********Many of these Federal Web sources are linked. But, if Betty Boss wants sites  that offer a broader look at the Government, many universities and public-policy research institutes offer excellent pages. **********Among these are the Federal Web Locator, which is run by the Villanova Center for Information Law and Policy, and the United States Government information page of the Joseph Bartunek 3d Law Library of Cleveland State University."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/04/business/kodak-introduces-low-priced-digital-camera.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1996-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 342, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kodak Introduces Low-Priced Digital Camera", "print_headline": "Kodak Introduces Low-Priced Digital Camera", "body_text": " **********Continuing an industry effort to create a mass market for digital cameras, the Eastman Kodak Company introduced a product yesterday that the company expects to sell for less than $350. **********That price would be half the previous lowest for Kodak's digital cameras, and far below the models selling for up to $10,000 that Kodak produces for professional photographers. **********Instead of using photographic film, digital cameras capture an image as a digital file that can be stored, edited and transmitted by computers. **********Electronic cameras have gone into wide use in journalism and industrial photography because the images are instant and can be transmitted quickly over telephone lines. **********But they have made hardly a ripple in the consumer market, if only because even the most basic cameras have been priced above $500 until recently. **********Earlier this year, Epson and Casio each introduced digital cameras with a suggested price of $499, and the Casio model, the QV-10, is being advertised by  some stores in New York at $399.95. **********Kodak introduced its $350 camera, the DS-20, yesterday at the Comdex computer show in Chicago.

The trade publication Advertising Age even declares it \"the marketing event of the century,\" as advertisers spend an estimated $5 billion worldwide on Olympic-related campaigns, promotions and events. That includes the $675 million worth of commercial time -- 20 hours of spots -- that NBC has sold during 171.5 hours of Summer Games coverage. **********As a result, the 250 or so marketers that have agreed to be sponsors, licensees or suppliers of the 1996 Games are in a mad scramble to find ways to stand out amid that advertising overload. And they must also figure out how to fend off the pesky efforts of so-called ambush marketers that exploit Olympic and athletic imagery to create perceptions among consumers of official ties that do not actually exist. **********\"The clutter will be so enormous, I'm not sure the public walks away with any distinctive view of you,\" said David F. D'Alessandro, senior executive vice president of the John Hancock Life Insurance Company in Boston. Hancock paid $40 million to be a worldwide Olympic sponsor. **********Even though \"we find that extraordinarily beneficial,\" Mr. D'Alessandro said, \"I'm to a point where I no longer believe a sponsor should buy any time on the games.\" **********Rather, he added, marketers probably ought to concentrate their Olympic-themed campaigns before and after the actual event. So while Hancock will run regular commercials during the Olympics, a special 90-second spot produced in-house -- a paean to American athletes set to the Judy Collins version of \"Amazing Grace\" -- will appear one time only, during the opening ceremonies. **********The Coca-Cola Company, the largest single Olympic advertiser, is spending an  estimated $250 million on activities before, during and after the Games. That includes $62 million worth of commercial time on NBC to run an unprecedented barrage of 100 different spots, created by more than a dozen agencies, for brands like Coca-Cola Classic, Diet Coke and Sprite as well as celebrations of the opening and closing ceremonies. **********\"We're trying to be unique in the approach we take to make sure we don't just become one more sponsor,\" said Sergio Zyman, senior vice president and chief marketing officer of Coca-Cola. He attributed a 17 percent increase in second-quarter net income from the corresponding quarter last year, which Coca-Cola announced yesterday, to an extensive pre-Olympic campaign. **********During the Games, the Coca-Cola blitz will feature what Mr. Zyman called \"just-in-time advertising\": 17 commercials created fresh daily, presenting highlights of events and promoting themed pitches like \"world sports\" and \"sounds of refreshment.\" The company is also blanketing Atlanta, its headquarters city, with everything from vending machines to \"cooling zones\" that will spritz sweaty fans with water. **********Yet even mighty Coca-Cola has been ambushed in its hometown, Mr. Zyman said,  as \"Gatorade is sampling product on the streets.\" That sports drink, marketed by the Quaker Oats Company, competes against Powerade, the Coca-Cola brand that is  the official Olympic sports drink. **********Quaker is only one marketer without official ties to the Summer Olympics that is pursuing an ambitious ambush agenda, despite attempts by Olympic officials to end what they describe as parasite marketing. The Blockbuster Entertainment unit of Viacom Inc. is promoting a \"Games of summer sweepstakes\" -- video games, that is. And a print ad for Gucci watches uses five colored rings evocative of the Olympic symbol, though Swatch watches are the official Olympic timekeepers. **********The most relentless Atlanta ambusher is Nike Inc., which in a campaign by Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., has appropriated almost every Olympic element except the weird-looking mascot Izzy. Reebok International Ltd. is the official Olympic licensee and supplier. **********A Nike magazine insert asserts, \"If you can't stand the heat, get out of Atlanta.\" A television commercial declares: \"You don't win silver. You lose gold.\" The campaign even dares to mock the concept of official sponsorship by proclaiming: \"We don't sell dreams. We sell shoes.\" **********\"We feel strongly we haven't misappropriated anything,\" said Keith Peters, a  spokesman for Nike. \"We're not an Olympic sponsor and we're not trying to create an impression we are. **********Dave Fogelson, a spokesman for Reebok, said: \"It's a nonissue as far as we're concerned. It's a given the major shoe companies all have an involvement.\" **********\"There are benefits to being involved officially,\" he added, such as Reebok's role in the giant Coca-Cola Olympic City exhibit, open from Memorial Day through Labor Day, and \"a very nice retail presence\" at the Centennial Olympic Park. The main focus of Reebok's program is the outfitting of athletes of more than 50 national Olympic committees. **********One marketer known as an Olympic ambusher, the American Express Company, is quiet -- so far. **********If Visa International, an Olympic sponsor, does not \"use the Olympics to bash a competitor,\" said John Hayes, executive vice president for global advertising  at American Express in New York, Amex will forgo such ploys as a campaign that appeared during the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona.

By enabling callers to make  these calls across borders, the International Telecommunication Union hopes to rouse this business overseas. **********Dozens of countries allow consumers to dial toll-free and pass the charges along to the recipient of the call. But the numbers generally only work domestically. If you are in Brussels, for example, and you want to buy a plane ticket to New York on Delta Air Lines, using its toll-free line, you would have  to know its toll-free number for Belgium. Until recently, you would also have had to dial Belgium's toll-free prefix. **********To eliminate this jumble of numbers and prefixes, the International Telecommunication Union has opted to use the American \"800\" prefix worldwide and to assign companies one toll-free number that works anywhere. So a caller in Brussels would need only to dial 800, plus an eight-digit number. The organization adopted an eight-digit system because the United States has already used up every possible seven-digit number with an \"800\" prefix. On March 1, AT&T and other carriers began assigning new toll-free numbers with an \"888\" prefix. **********\"I think this will generate increased demand for international toll-free numbers,\" said Susan G. Mirbach, the president of Belgacom North America, a unit of Belgium's state telephone service. **********Toll-free service has grown into a vast and lucrative business in the United  States since it started in 1967. AT&T estimates that \"800\" numbers account for 40 percent of the traffic on its network, or 80 million calls a day. The telephone companies collect about $10 billion in revenue from this business every year. **********The plan is not without its pitfalls, Ms. Mirbach said. The agency, which is  based in Geneva, plans to assign \"800\" numbers on a first-come, first-serve basis, starting in February. Because American companies are well-versed with the \"800\" system, she said some foreign companies were afraid the Americans would \"monopolize the good numbers.\" **********The uniform toll-free number will also enable American telemarketing companies to expand abroad: 1-800-FLOWERS, the floral delivery service, plans to begin marketing throughout Europe. **********One thing 1-800-FLOWERS will not be able to do is use its vanity telephone number abroad.

Her husband, Ted, is a drug rehabilitation counselor. Together they make a decent income, but not enough to simply say yes when their younger son, Ben, announced he wanted to go to Choate Rosemary Hall, a  boarding school with a blue-chip reputation and a price tag of more than $22,000 a year. **********So they applied for financial aid, and received an award that covered half of Ben's costs for his freshman year. The following years, his aid was increased to meet three-fourths of the cost because by then Ben's older brother had entered a private college. **********''I would say to anybody who wants to go to a school like that, just go for it,'' said Mrs. Haley, whose son graduated last year and now attends Amherst College. **********During the last few years, sending your child to boarding school -- that fabled realm of quaint buildings around a picturesque green; steam tables loaded with mysterious, clotted entrees, and well-weathered teachers wielding big academic sticks -- has become surprisingly attainable for people like the Haleys. Dismayed by the paucity of middle-income students on their campuses, the nation's boarding schools are widening the array of financial-aid options for people who know they are not rich enough to pay outright and have long presumed they were too rich to receive help. **********The eligibility rules vary from school to school, but many families with substantial salaries are receiving help. At Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, N.H., for example, middle income now refers to people earning  between $60,000 and $120,000 a year. This year, 70 of the 331 financial-aid awards went to students whose families fell into that category. The Emma Willard School in Troy, N.Y., gave aid to 46.7 percent of its 270 students. Nearly all the families who received that aid reported incomes of more than $75,000. **********At Concord Academy, a coeducational school in Concord, Mass., 23 students whose parents earned $60,000 or more received awards that averaged $12,000 apiece. At St. George's School in Newport, R.I., someone whose parents earned $145,000 still got a break on the cost this year. **********''There's no income cutoff because there are so many variables,'' said Jay Doolittle, director of admissions and financial aid at St. George's. ''If you make $100,000 and you have three or four children at tuition-paying schools, you could easily qualify for aid.'' **********High fees, now as high as those at many colleges, and attributed to unavoidables like salaries, heating bills, technology and deferred maintenance, are one reason that  boarding schools are offering a more generous helping hand. The median annual cost, including tuition, room and board, has risen  from $10,195 in the 1985-86 school year to $19,850 in the 1995-96 year, according to the National Association of Independent Schools in Washington. That is a 94.7 percent increase in dollars, and a 37.1 percent increase after inflation is taken into account. **********Particularly in the 1990's, these numbers can unnerve a group that admissions directors call ''the emotional middle class.'' **********These people earn far more than the Government's definition of middle income. Children in families earning $35,000 a year would receive automatic free rides at a typical boarding school. But while many middle-class families could and did send their children to boarding school through the 1970's, these days many more of them balk. They worry about an insecure job market, another four years of tuition at college and the specter of a penny-pinching  retirement as traditional pensions vanish. **********Boarding schools are worried, too --  about losing their socioeconomic diversity. In some institutions, enrollments have started to resemble barbells, with the wealthy clustered at one end and the woefully deprived at the other. Over the last decade, the same concern has propelled many colleges to award merit scholarships to even out their enrollments. **********At Choate Rosemary Hall, ''we definitely want to avoid having just the haves and the have-nots,'' said Charlotte Murphy, the school's communications director. ''It's an issue that all the schools are hearing and are concerned about.'' **********At Exeter, trustees were hearing complaints at alumni cocktail parties that tuition had spiraled beyond many people's means. A comparison of middle-class enrollment in the 1950's and in the 1990's found a definite discrepancy, said Rick Mahoney, the director of financial aid at the school. ''We still had a spread, but we felt the middle-income group was less well represented here than they were 40 years ago.'' **********Thomas Hassan, Exeter's admissions director, said: ''It's part of our charter that this place shall ever be open to youth from every quarter. We want to get all kinds of kids. It's just healthier.'' **********THE schools, eager for the best students, know they face tough competition. ''Our biggest competitors are the public high schools, for which the price tag is zero,'' said Trudy Hanmer, Emma Willard's director of admissions and associate head of school. Moreover, ''it is not an expectation that middle-income families are going to pay for high school,'' she said, and when they do they ''typically pay for education out of discretionary income, not out of trust funds.'' **********For all these reasons, boarding schools have set aside more money in the last few years for the middle class. In 1994, for instance, Exeter began offering more aid to families with incomes of $60,000 to $120,000, Mr. Hassan said. **********Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., with a $6.7 million aid budget, recently increased its middle-class support too. In the 1992-93 school year, 52 families with incomes greater than $80,000 received aid from the school; this fall, 140 such families will. **********The schools, which generate their financial-aid money from endowment earnings or annual campaigns, can often be generous with both the size and number of awards. After all, they are making them for just three or four years, not 14 as with schools that run from prekindergarten through grade 12. Choate, for example, gave an average award of $14,000 to middle-class students this year, while at St. George's the average was $11,900. (But never say ''scholarship'' in talking about the new largess. The somewhat cumbersome ''need-based financial aid'' is preferred.) **********One beneficiary is Amanda Cohen, an Exeter senior from Sacramento, Calif. The school covers about three-quarters of the  $20,000 tuition. ''Let's put it this way,'' said her father, Ned, a deputy counsel for the California Legislature. ''I don't make enough to send Amanda to Exeter. But we made the decision that we would afford it, and that she would go.'' **********His daughter, he added, has flourished. ''They work them to death,'' he said, approvingly. ''I think she's gone through four years of sleep deprivation.'' **********Besides outright grants like Amanda's, monthly payment plans are offered by most schools to help those without ready chunks of cash. For a $70 annual fee, Concord Academy will deduct a monthly payment directly from parents' checking accounts, said Rachel Countryman, the school's director of financial aid. **********Schools can also steer families to low-interest loans. Knight College Resource Group, which administers many monthly payment plans, offers through many schools  a low-interest, variable-rate loan pegged to the 13-week Treasury-bill rate. **********For many families, aid ends up being a combination of grants, loans and payment plans. ''In general, we will meet about 80 percent of a family's need,'' said James F. Ventre, financial aid director of Phillips Academy. ''And then we will help them come up with the other 20 percent.'' **********Nevertheless, many middle-class parents are too embarrassed to acknowledge that they cannot afford boarding school. Many also believe that to check the box next to the question ''Are you applying for financial aid?'' is to deal a death blow to their child's chances for admission. **********Charles Pittman, an advertising manager from Charlotte, N.C., battled those anxieties when he applied for aid to send his son, Tony, to Andover in 1989. ''I thought at this stage of my life I should have been better prepared,'' he said. ''But I don't think you can prepare for this unless you make tons of money.'' **********Since then, he has sent his two daughters there, too. His youngest, Mauresa, is a senior who manages the football team. She said that once she enrolled, she felt no different from anyone else on campus. ''Nobody asked, and nobody brought it up,'' she said. **********PARENTS might be surprised at how many boarding-school students receive aid. At Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Mass., for instance, only about two-thirds of the families pay full tuition and ''most of them were born into it,'' said Bill Cumming, the admissions director. The remainder receive financial aid or use monthly payment plans. **********Parents need to squelch their reluctance  and check the box when they apply, Mr. Cumming said. After all, what is more painful: a little honesty now or a huge humiliation later? **********''I don't want to get blindsided in the middle of someone's junior year by a phone call from the father, saying 'I've tapped everything I have, I can't come up with the money, and he won't be coming back,' '' Mr. Cumming said. ''It's not the best thing for the child.'' **********Some schools have revised the aid process to help eliminate embarrassment and worry. At Concord, all parents receive information about financing options along with the application packet. **********Concord also handles all aid requests on a sheet of paper apart from the rest of the application. ''We've started not to have a box per se,'' Ms. Countryman said. ''We were concerned about keeping the two processes separate.'' At many schools, just who is getting help is a closely held secret as well. Gone are the days when scholarship students had to help out in the dining hall. **********Despite all this concern and generosity, however, there is no guarantee that asking means you will receive. Only a handful of schools -- Deerfield is one -- call their admissions need-blind, and even they acknowledge that their resources are not so bottomless that they never turn down someone who needs help with tuition. **********''There are a lot of families who may well qualify for financial aid but won't get it because the school doesn't have a big enough financial-aid budget,'' said Meade B. Thayer, director of financial aid services for the National Association of Independent Schools. The approach may differ: a Concord applicant may be accepted and not receive aid, while Deerfield tries not to accept someone who needs aid unless the money is available. But the point is that there is not enough cash to go around. **********Parents should not conceal assets, however, because while the schools may be more supportive, they are often vigilant in checking the truth of applications. **********''Some people think it's a hiding game, but these days it's real easy for us to find out about other information,'' said Mr. Ventre, of Phillips Academy. ''They do have to provide tax returns, and we have C.P.A.'s here who are trained to look things over.'' **********While aid is clearly welcome, it hardly means easy street for the middle class. **********''We haven't been on a real vacation in a long time,'' Mrs. Haley said, ''and we drive old cars.'' **********Mr. Pittman said, ''It's the sacrifice we've opted to make, to give our children the best education possible.'' With financial aid, he added, the boarding-school experience becomes manageable. **********''It stretches you,'' he said, ''but at the same time, it doesn't bankrupt you.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/05/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-osram-sylvania-chooses-mullen.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-01-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Osram Sylvania Chooses Mullen", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Osram Sylvania Chooses Mullen", "body_text": " **********Osram Sylvania Inc. in Danvers, Mass., a unit of Osram G.m.b.h. of Germany, said yesterday that it had named Mullen Advertising in Wenham, Mass., to handle  advertising for its consumer specialty lamp and industrial commercial lighting divisions.

And many of them have been wrong about stocks for nearly a decade. **********Simply put, the biggest risk to individual investors in recent times has come from not being invested in the market. **********An investor in a mutual fund that matched the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, among the most watched market indicators, would not have suffered an annual loss of more than 5 percent in any year since 1977. Seven times in those 18 years, the annual return on the S.& P. 500 exceeded 20 percent, assuming all dividends were reinvested. **********Four times, there were back-to-back gains exceeding 15 percent, and in three  of those four, the second year was better than the first. **********In all but two of the 18 years -- 1981 and 1990 -- investments gauged by the  S.& P. 500 made money. Even in 1987, when stocks took a frantic tumble, falling  22 percent in one day, the S.& P. index finished the year with a gain of 5 percent. **********None of which means that investors are assured of double-digit returns in 1996, or even single-digit returns. But the outlook for stocks for the rest of the decade -- a decade in which inflation has all but died, interest rates have  been tame and the economy has continued to chug along -- appears sound at this point. **********So it should be of little surprise that more money than ever poured into mutual funds that invest in American stocks in 1995. So good was the year that the previous record, set in '93, was broken in November, with a full month to be reported. **********Over the next five years, the chances are that those investors will make money. In the shorter term, however, \"investors could be disappointed if they jumped in for the first time in the last quarter of 1995,\" said John C. Bogle, chairman of the Vanguard Group, the country's second-largest mutual fund company after the Fidelity group. \"Investors certainly have been informed about the rewards of investing,\" he said. \"I wonder if they have been well enough informed about the risks.\" **********One of the greatest risks the market faces this year is likely to be that all those individuals who plunged into the market recently will flee if results in the first half do not measure up to their expectations. **********\"I'm concerned about the growing illiquidity in the marketplace,\" said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services, which tracks mutual fund performance. \"The capital of the big Wall Street firms is not growing at the same rate as the capital invested by institutional investors,\" including mutual funds. **********That means that Wall Street, which often has been able to absorb selling pressure when investors might be inclined to panic, might not be as much of a cushion during sharp declines, Mr. Lipper said. **********Wall Street is not the only place where liquidity has been drying up. \"Household liquidity is down considerably over the last several years,\" said Byron R. Wien, portfolio strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company. \"Individuals do not have the money to keep up the pace of mutual fund investments they have over the last few years.\" **********In addition, Mr. Wien warned, \"debt burdens have hampered consumers' willingness to spend,\" which could prove to be a bigger drag on the economy than some people anticipate. \"That was one of the reasons that Christmas retail sales were so disappointing,\" he said. **********BUT far from Wall Street, where the horizons are broader and individuals pay  less attention to wrangling in Washington and the nuances of economic pronouncements, many investors remain positive about prospects for growth from the big engines of the economy -- capital goods and machinery makers. **********\"I think the environment of low interest rates and inflation that propelled the market over the last year should continue in the first half of '96,\" said Alan B. Lancz, an investment adviser in Toledo, Ohio, who also writes a stock-picking and economic newsletter. **********Mr. Lancz, who last year included the media giants CBS, Time Warner and Times Mirror among his favorite stocks, this year sees the greatest potential in several companies engaged in more basic industries, which should benefit from lower interest rates around the globe. **********Among them, Mr. Lancz said, are Imperial Chemical Industries and Hanson P.L.C., two British conglomerates; the Lubrizol Corporation, a producer of engine oils and fluids, and two Canadian energy concerns, TransCanada Pipelines  and Westcoast Energy. **********In the second half of the year, the Presidential and Congressional elections  are likely to drive economic and financial concerns and to have unpredictable effects on certain stock sectors. In January 1992, few on Wall Street would have predicted that Bill Clinton would be elected President, much less anticipated the wringer that stocks of health care companies would be put through in concern over the President-to-be's proposals for medical care. **********So while the outlook is positive for people who truly are long-term investors, with expectations of staying around for five years or so, the only certainty in the short term is that past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investors hoping for another year of better-than-30-percent gains in stock prices are likely to be disappointed. But fearful investors who stay on the sidelines will probably be worse off."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/14/business/business-digest-001287.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 574, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Liggett Breaks Ranks, Settling Tobacco Suit The Liggett Group, the smallest of the nation's five major cigarette companies,  broke industry ranks, agreeing to settle a huge class-action lawsuit.

But a definitive peace agreement formalizing the end of hostilities between the armed forces and leftist guerrillas has yet to be concluded, leaving the country uneasy and impatient. **********The Government and the rebel leaders have been negotiating sporadically for five years in an effort to bring an end to a conflict that has killed more than 100,000 people since it erupted in 1961. **********The talks were stalled until this spring, when the rebels declared a cease-fire and the new President, Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen, responded by ordering the armed forces to halt all offensive operations. **********''We are in an intermediate situation,'' Rolando Moran, a rebel commander, said in an interview in El Salvador in late July. ''The war has not ended, but we have proclaimed the political struggle as the means to revolution, because we recognize that armed struggle is no longer feasible.'' **********Mr. Moran praised Mr. Arzu, saying he had put into effect ''changes that are very important and significant,'' most notably ''changes that herald a reconversion and modernization of the armed forces.'' **********The situation now, Mr. Moran added, should not be called a truce, but rather ''a suspension of hostilities'' with the prospect of a final peace agreement ''in just a few months.'' **********In the meantime, the two sides continue testing their adversaries and accusing each other of shifting forces in an effort to take advantage of the de facto cease-fire. **********Just recently, guerrillas briefly took over a market a few blocks from the Presidential Palace, distributing leaflets, forcing vendors to listen to a tape-recorded speech of their program and drawing complaints from a military spokesman of a ''provocation.'' **********At the same time, there has been a surge of kidnappings and other violent crimes, which many Guatemalans blame on the armed forces as well as the rebels. With the guerrillas having stopped collecting the ''war taxes'' that they imposed on businesses, and the army being pushed out of sidelines like drug and timber smuggling, both groups are said to be eager to reap one last bonanza before a peace agreement is signed. **********Before that can happen, several points must be resolved. Among them are the size of the armed forces, now with more than 40,000 men, in a postwar Guatemala and what the army will do once its ''counterinsurgency'' function disappears. **********The question of granting amnesty to those accused of killings and other human rights abuses in the civil war is proving even thornier, Guatemalan officials and foreign diplomats say. The military has been responsible for most of the deaths, but rebel leaders must be exempted from sedition and treason charges if they are to take part in politics. **********Many human rights groups oppose any amnesty for the military, and several prominent human rights campaigners, including Rigoberta Menchu, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, have formed a group called Alliance Against Impunity. In addition, mass graves are now being uncovered, fueling public demands that former and present members of the armed forces high command be held accountable. **********Since taking office in January, Mr. Arzu has taken several steps to weaken the power of the military, which after relinquishing formal control of the country a little over a decade ago had dominated three civilian Presidents. He has purged several generals, made more than 250 changes in local command postings, withheld promotions of other senior officers and ''in general greatly advanced the principle of civilian supremacy,'' one diplomat here said. **********Most recently, Mr. Arzu, a conservative businessman, approved legislation depriving military personnel of the right to be tried by special military tribunals when they are charged with common crimes. As a result of that June measure, nearly 350 cases in which soldiers face charges are being transferred to civilian courts. **********But problems in that area remain. In late May, for instance, a judge was criticized by human rights groups here and abroad after he ordered the release of 8 soldiers charged with the massacre last October of 11 peasants who had settled, with United Nations support, in the village of Xaman after returning from years of exile in Mexico. **********Nevertheless, Guatemalan and foreign analysts maintain that a last-minute collapse of the peace talks is extremely unlikely. For one thing, expectations are now so high, and Guatemalans so tired of war, that a breakdown would be a political disaster for Mr. Arzu and the guerrillas, leading to ''a plague on both your houses'' attitude among the people."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/09/world/it-s-moving-day-and-the-antelope-are-up-in-the-air.html": {"writer_name": "James McKinley", "pub_date": "1996-09-09", "snippet": "Last-ditch effort by Kenya Wildlife Service to save hirola antelope from extinction by transportion them by air from scrubby desert region of Garissa near Somali border to Tsavo National Park runs into opposition from local political leaders, as w...", "word_count": 1203, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "It's Moving Day, and the Antelope Are Up in the Air", "print_headline": "It's Moving Day, and the Antelope Are Up in the Air", "body_text": " **********The airplane dropped out of the twilit sky above the savanna just in time, only minutes before darkness enveloped the dirt airstrip. It taxied quickly to a flatbed truck huddled in the gloom at the runway's end. A side-door sprang open. **********A moment later, Dr. Richard Kock climbed out of the single-engine Cessna Caravan, cradling in his arms a baby hirola antelope. Drugged and masked, the little animal looked fragile and lost in his arms. It was one of the last of its kind. **********''We made it!'' yelled Dr. Kock, a veterinarian. ''This is it. That's the last of them.'' **********Rangers from the Kenya Wildlife Service lugged two more adult female antelopes out of the plane, loaded the animals onto the flatbed and ferried them to a nearby corral, where they would sleep off the sedative before being released. **********In a last-ditch attempt to save the hirola from extinction, Dr. Kock and rangers airlifted 33 of the rare, sand-colored antelope in August from the scrubby desert region of Garissa near the Somali border to this national park. **********It was not an easy operation. The rangers struggled with the logistics of catching and transporting the antelope, and local political leaders, Kenyan citizens who are ethnic Somalis, filed a lawsuit that halted the project twice. **********In court, politicians led by Abdikadir Sheik Hassan, the Garissa council chairman, accused the wildlife service of stealing a precious natural resource. The animal, they said, was ''a good omen and a gift from nature.'' **********''Its translocation to another far-off land will bring disaster to the people and their livestock,'' the lawsuit said. **********On the last day of the airlift, a judge in Nairobi, Justice Gideon Mbito, agreed. He banned the wildlife service from taking any more animals from the Arawale Natural Reserve, a park managed by the local council. **********The ruling did not stop the project, since many of the antelope were being caught outside the reserve, but it could doom future attempts to save endangered species in Kenya if it stands up on appeal, wildlife officials said. **********Among other things, the judge ruled that the wildlife service does not own the wildlife, nor does it have the final authority over its management. The ruling added that the people who use the land are entitled to its flora and fauna. **********Kenya has lost 60 percent of its wildlife in the last 10 years because of poaching and the encroachment of people on the wild lands. The only animals increasing in numbers are those species the wildlife service has relocated to national parks and aggressively protected, like the rhinoceros and the elephant. **********''If the ruling stands, then I'm afraid that's the end of the game,'' said Dr. Kock, who is chief veterinarian adviser to the wildlife service and chairman of the task force to save the hirola. **********But Ahmed Isaak Hassan, a lawyer representing the Garissa council, said the council's aim was only to force the wildlife service to protect the animal where it now lives. ''What we are arguing is that they should first try to conserve the animal it its natural habitat,'' he said. ''It is a very sacred animal among the Somali community.'' **********By last count, only 306 of the hirola were living in their natural habitat between the Tana River and the Somali border. Another 57 were barely surviving in the Tsavo Park. They are the descendants of a dozen animals that were brought to the park in 1963 as part of an earlier attempt to save them. **********But the gene pool of the Tsavo group is too small to allow it to survive over the long run, researchers say. The only way to save the species is to bring new members to the Tsavo herds before poachers destroy the remaining hirola in Garissa.  ''Our aim is to inject some new blood,'' said Wilbur Ottichilo, the deputy director for biodiversity. **********One reason the antelope has declined is the general lawlessness of the Garissa region. Since civil war broke out in Somalia in 1990, armed gangs have terrorized the area, stealing from herders and poaching wildlife. The scientists and rangers on the project had to travel under heavy guard. **********The rangers also had to contend with the anger of some local villagers, who were convinced by their leaders that the removal of the hirola was a bad omen. On one occasion, the rangers were stoned and assaulted in the village of Bura Bura. **********''These people are criminal in my opinion,'' Dr. Kock said of the local politicians. **********Beyond the political troubles, wildlife officials were faced with the logistical nightmare of trying to capture and transport wild animals nearly 200 miles. A helicopter was used to drive the wild antelope into nets. Then the animals were sedated, blindfolded and taken by truck to a small plane. **********Scientists say the hirola is an evolutionary relic that first appeared about 15 million years ago and is believed to be a progenitor of some more modern antelope, like the hartebeest and the topi. According to fossil evidence, it once roamed as far south as the Cape of Good Hope and as far north as Somalia. **********Also known as the hunter's antelope, the hirola has long curved horns like the Impala, a sandy hide, and pronounced scent glands under the eyes. Its anatomy is suited to harsh conditions, and it can live on very little water for weeks. **********In 1976, there were 14,000 of the hirola in Kenya, living mostly along the Tana River and in the Garissa region, scientists said. The first blow to the population came in the early 1980's, when poachers killed off most of the elephants, which used to clear the land of thorn bushes and make room for grazers. **********Then, between 1983 and 1985, a rinderpest epidemic brought in by cattle herders killed off more than half the antelope in the region. Finally, the civil war and upheaval in Somalia in the early 1990's took its toll. As a flood of refugees and fleeing troops crossed the border into Kenya, thousands of the antelope were killed for food. **********By 1993, 2,000 hirola remained. Two years later, a census found only 306 left in Garissa. They were scattered in small groups of six or seven over 45,000 square miles of bush. Unless the animals are moved, they will be extinct within two or three years, wildlife officials said. ''Each of these pockets will gradually disappear, like bubbles,'' Dr. Kock said. **********The morning after the last flight, researchers finished putting radio collars on a few of the animals to track them, opened up the gate of the corral and chased seven antelope out. For a few minutes, the hirolas stood still in the vast Tsavo morning, as if stunned to find themselves in such a grassy place. **********Their noses worked the wind coming down over the grassy flat lands dotted with Acacia trees, performing the calculus of scent and survival.  Behind them, Dr. Kock clapped and whooped, encouraging them to go into their new world. **********The antelope loped off. They moved tentatively at first, then picked up speed. Their tails bobbed away into the flat lands that were the same tawny color they were. Soon, the bush swallowed them up, as if they were not creatures of flesh and blood at all, but spirits belonging to the land itself."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/08/business/giving-and-getting-in-return.html": {"writer_name": "Sana Siwolop", "pub_date": "1996-12-08", "snippet": "Charitable remainder trusts, which allow donors to generate a steady stream of income by making a charitable donation, are growing in popularity (M)", "word_count": 680, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Giving, And Getting In Return", "print_headline": "Giving, And Getting In Return", "body_text": " **********When giving to charity, you can often get something in return besides a tax deduction. Some charities invite you to black-tie dinners, give you a book bag or tickets to an event. There is also a way to make money by giving. **********That is the logic behind charitable remainder trusts, which let you generate a steady stream of income by making a charitable donation. **********It works like this: You create the trust either through a lawyer or an institution like a bank, brokerage firm or charity. The trust is financed with cash or something that can be turned into cash, like stocks, bonds or property. Those assets are sold, and because the trust does not have to pay capital gains tax on the appreciation of the assets, the trust receives the full value and reinvests the money, usually in something that produces a high rate of income. Who gets that income? You do, often for the rest of your life. After you die, a charity you designated will receive all the money left in the trust. **********The benefits are many. Although you give up a sizable asset, you get a charitable tax deduction and a steady income for years from the full value of the asset. Your heirs avoid estate taxes on the money. And you benefit the charity. **********Charitable remainder trusts have been growing in popularity. Robert F. Sharpe Jr., president of an endowment development consulting firm in Memphis, estimated that the number of these trusts have doubled in the last five years, to 50,000, and that they contain at least $20 billion in assets. **********But the trusts are not necessarily straightforward to set up or administer, and the ways some trusts are used has caught the attention of the I.R.S. **********Here are some of the rules: The trusts are allowed to generate income either for a period of up to 20 years, or for the life span of its beneficiary, usually yourself. You still have to pay taxes on income distributions from the trust, and the tax amount depends on whether the distribution comes from ordinary trust income (usually interest and dividends), capital gains or the trust's principal, in which case the income is tax-free. **********Most charitable remainder trusts come in two flavors. **********One type provides annual income at a fixed rate that is set either as a percentage (no less than 5 percent) of the initial fair market value of the assets in the trust or as a fixed amount, say $5,000. Another type provides distributions that are recalculated each year based on a trust's annual value on a certain date. With these trusts, investors cannot change the percentage of their distribution, but they have the potential to increase their income if the value of the trust has risen. **********There are variations on these two types of charitable remainder trusts that are technically legal, but whose charitable intent the Internal Revenue Service has been questioning. For example, in 1994, the agency issued a warning that it wasn't keen on accelerated charitable remainder trusts, which some taxpayers have set up to pay annual distributions that are often as high as 80 percent. **********To meet these payments, these trusts almost always have to dip into principal, which gives the beneficiary tax-free income, since distributions of principal are not taxed. And because the principal is being drained, there is often little money left for the charity. **********The I.R.S is also looking into charitable remainder trusts that are set up to defer the income distributions to later years, such as when a beneficiary retires and his or her income tax rate is lower. **********John H. Gardner, director of estate planning at KPMG Peat Marwick's national tax office in Washington, said the I.R.S. might be getting ready to issue regulations concerning accelerated trusts as well as those that defer income. A spokesman for the agency said it was continuing to study the issue. **********''Basically,'' Mr. Gardner said, ''the I.R.S.'s position is that the assets of these trusts are being manipulated to benefit the income beneficiaries, and the trustee really should be benefiting the charity beneficiary.''

Those countries already had open-skies agreements with the United States. **********American Airlines and British Airways officials declined to comment yesterday. **********People familiar with details of the two airlines' plans, however, said they would announce an alliance in which they would market and sell seats on each other's flights, pool revenues on trans-Atlantic traffic and link frequent-flier programs. **********The goal of the alliance is to create more choices for consumers, so that travelers will be able to call American, for example, to book a flight to a far-flung destination, even though a portion or all that trip might be flown on  British Airways. With a network that extends to many continents, the airlines hope to draw passengers away from competitors. **********And those competitors have become increasingly powerful as they have entered  into alliances of their own, like those linking United and Lufthansa, and Northwest and KLM. **********There is also much at stake for the United States and British Governments. For the British, an open-skies agreement would give the nation's domestic airlines more access to United States markets. **********For the United States Government, an open-skies agreement with Britain would  cap a strategy it has pursued for many years to export the notion of deregulated skies to Europe. In recent years, for example, it has signed open-skies agreement with 11 European countries. Holdouts have included France, Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Britain. **********With Heathrow as their crown jewel -- a gateway for 54 million travelers last year -- British officials have had considerable leverage in talks with American  negotiators. **********But as other United States and European airlines form alliances, they have made airports in Frankfurt and Amsterdam and in other cities popular alternatives, threatening Heathrow's lock on much of the international traffic.  The British Airways-American Airlines announcement will give both sides a way to revisit a thorny issue. **********\"It offers a significant opportunity for the U.S. Government to obtain a long-sought goal,\" said Daniel M. Kasper, an aviation consultant with Coopers &  Lybrand, \"and for the British Government to put an amicable end to what has been an increasingly sore point in the U.S.-U.K. relationship.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/17/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-2-consultants-joining-to-form-a-company.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-07-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 101, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;2 Consultants Joining To Form a Company", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;2 Consultants Joining To Form a Company", "body_text": " **********Alvin Achenbaum, a longtime agency consultant and executive, is joining Pete  Bogda, president and managing principal of the M/A/R/C Consulting Group, to form a consulting company, Achenbaum Bogda Associates. **********Achenbaum Bogda is being formed by the merger of Achenbaum Associates, a consulting company in New York owned by Mr. Achenbaum, with M/A/R/C Consulting, which Mr. Bogda is acquiring from the M/A/R/C Group in Dallas.

Such a procedure in a multiple pregnancy, known as selective termination, is not unusual when a fetus is discovered to be unhealthy or abnormal. **********The woman in this case was not identified, but it is known that she is a 28-year-old single mother who already has one child. No other details about her were disclosed. **********There was an outcry from anti-abortion groups last week when the Government ordered the destruction of 3,000 unclaimed human embryos in fertility clinics in keeping with a law stipulating that frozen embryos cannot be kept for more than five years without specific requests from the parents. **********The doctor who agreed to carry out the abortion and others who supported it asserted that the decision was ''no different from any other abortion,'' in the words of Dr. Vivienne Nathanson, the head of the board of ethics at the British Medical Association. **********But anti-abortion groups here and in Italy, where there was much shock last week over the frozen embryo case, have offered money to the woman to give birth to both twins and give one up for adoption. **********The decision was first reported over the weekend by The Sunday Express in a front-page interview with the woman's gynecologist, Dr. Phillip Bennett of Queen Charlotte's Hospital in London. He said the abortion of one fetus was the solution he had proposed to the woman when she told him she could not continue the pregnancy if it meant having two children. **********After the report appeared, other British dailies and television gave the story prominent coverage. A wide range of commentators expressed revulsion, with some calling the decision ''uncivilized,'' ''horrific'' and ''abhorrent.'' **********A spokeswoman at Queen Charlotte's Hospital said that Dr. Bennett had not been in the hospital today and that there would be no comment on the case, which she called ''a private matter between the doctor and his patient.'' **********The spokeswoman, Nuala O'Brian, declined to say whether the abortion had been carried out, but other knowledgeable people said it had not. **********Dr. Bennett told The Sunday Express that he had performed 3,000 abortions in the last 10 years and as many deliveries. Having suggested that he knew the sex of the babies, he said, ''Killing one healthy twin sounds unethical, but my colleagues and I concluded this week that it would be better to terminate one pregnancy as soon as possible and leave one alive than to lose two babies.'' **********The doctor faced a deluge of requests for interviews today but was not available for further comment. **********Ms. O'Brian would not say whether the woman had been informed of offers of financial aid to carry the pregnancy to term, saying such information would have to be communicated by the doctor to his patient. **********The technique of abortion in this case would involve piercing the selected fetus with a needle, Dr. Bennett said in the interview with The Sunday Express. That fetus is then carried for the full term of the pregnancy, ''although it shrivels and mummifies'' in the womb, Dr. Bennett said. **********Among of the unanswered questions in the case are how the doctor selects the fetus to be aborted and whether the woman is told the sex of that fetus. **********British law permits the termination of a pregnancy up to the 24th week. The law allows wide latitude on the reason for terminating a pregnancy, considering that a woman's request motivated by a psychological rejection of childbearing is acceptable ground for abortion even if there would be no health risks to the mother or child. **********After 24 weeks, the law permits an abortion if there is a physical abnormality. **********''Although technically it meets the criterion under which abortion is legal in this country, it is so close to abortion on demand,'' Harry Coen, acting editor of The Catholic Herald newspaper, said in an interview. ''At this stage, in this case particularly, it sounds to me like selective murder. I mean, we know they have aborted healthy babies before, but to leave one and kill the other is abhorrent.'' **********Some anti-abortion activists and charity groups have offered money and adoption as incentives to the woman to give birth to both twins. **********Life, a British national charity with 35,000 dues-paying members and 135 offices around the country, said it was deluged with offers of help and could immediately offer the woman upward of $16,000 from donors who had called today. An Italian anti-abortion group said it would offer monthly stipends and adopt one of the babies after birth. **********''A lot of people who have been taking things for granted and leaving such matter to the state are suddenly shocked about it and beginning to question the ethical and spiritual void that creates such dreadful developments,'' said Nuala Scarisbrick, a trustee of the group, which was founded in 1970. **********''We are not trying to bribe the woman, just save the twins,'' Ms. Scarisbrick said in a telephone interview. ''We have made the offer to Bennett but have received no response.'' **********The Roman Catholic Church, which deplored the destruction of frozen embryos last week, said the case of selective abortion might again set off a national debate over the whole issue of terminating pregnancies. **********''What it seems to have done is brought to the public a short, sharp shock,'' said Nicholas Coote, assistant secretary of the Catholic Bishops Conference of England and Wales. **********''In this country basically what happens is if you go to a doctor and say, 'I don't want to take this pregnancy to term because I can't cope,' the doctor can make the decision to terminate it, even if it is a perfectly healthy fetus,'' Mr. Coote said. ''Until now it was easy to look away, but this case has brought the full implications of such an act to people's attention.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/22/business/an-old-wall-street-pro-s-voice-in-the-campaign.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1996-09-22", "snippet": "Treasury Sec Robert E Rubin's is being credited with making the economy Pres Clinton's strongest argument for re-election; his influence has been felt in everything from tax policy to the budget to economic foreign policy and he has succeeded in h...", "word_count": 4385, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "An Old Wall Street Pro's Voice in the Campaign", "print_headline": "An Old Wall Street Pro's Voice in the Campaign", "body_text": " **********A FEW years ago President Clinton's political advisers were fuming about Robert E. Rubin's relentless focus on satisfying America's bond markets, fearing that his insistence on cutting the Federal deficit would prove politically disastrous for his boss. But history gets rewritten quickly in Washington. And now some of those same advisers, rejoicing in the latest poll results, argue that the bond markets were in fact a proxy for a majority of American voters, who seem to have decided, in the last weeks of the campaign, that Bill Clinton deserves credit for his handling of the economy. **********Whether the markets and the voters are truly in sync won't be clear for 44 more days. But there is little question that the 58-year-old Treasury Secretary, once viewed as a political novice from Wall Street, is regarded in Washington these days as a man who, with a mix of cunning and luck, has worked some quiet economic magic for President Clinton. **********When the Democratic candidate declares at every campaign stop that he will endorse only ''targeted tax cuts that are fully paid for'' by budget cuts -- an effort to cast Bob Dole's call for a 15 percent reduction in every American's taxes in the most unfavorable light -- the words have a familiar ring. Mr. Rubin has been using a similar phraseology for two years. **********Working out of the limelight, Mr. Rubin's Treasury has also generated a host of Mr. Clinton's campaign-year mini-initiatives that create big headlines but cost relatively little -- including, most recently, the proposal to end the capital-gains tax on all but the biggest profits from selling a home. **********Perhaps just as important, Mr. Rubin, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company,  has time and again sidestepped land mines that could have blown up Mr. Clinton's best case for re-election: his handling of the economy. After the Administration got off to a rocky start with the Federal Reserve, he developed a close relationship with its chairman, Alan Greenspan, over private breakfasts every Thursday morning. And three times in the last 20 months, he has headed off potential political disasters. **********He was the engineer of a risky bailout of Mexico that, while wildly unpopular at the time, appears to have worked, with three-quarters of America's $12 billion in loans already paid back, ahead of time and ahead of the election. With a mix of stealth and good fortune, he helped guide the dollar back from the dead before it could send interest rates surging. And, in the heat of the budget battles last winter, he outmaneuvered Republicans in Congress who were trying to force the White House to accede to their budget demands by cutting off the Treasury's borrowing authority. Stepping up the pressure day by day, Mr. Rubin portrayed them as zealots who were threatening to put the United States into default. They surrendered. **********''I'm working on the supposition that good economics can also be good politics,'' Mr. Rubin said recently in his office at the Treasury, tipping back his chair under the portrait of a more fiery predecessor, Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury Secretary. Flashing something between a grimace and a smile, Mr. Rubin added, ''I'll admit that not everyone believes that.'' **********He says that he has mostly been playing defense for the President. ''The last two years have been more of a balance of preventing bad things from happening,'' he said. ''We've had to focus a lot of resources on stopping untoward things. It's not exactly what I imagined.'' **********Mr. Rubin has been skirmishing with more than just Republicans. He frequently found himself at odds with Dick Morris, a fellow longtime resident of the Jefferson Hotel in Washington, who as Mr. Clinton's image maker sought far bigger, flashier tax cuts in case Mr. Dole's appeal took off. Mr. Morris resigned last month and moved out of the Jefferson after a supermarket tabloid photographed him on the hotel's balcony with a prostitute. (Mr. Rubin's staff joked that their boss is so focused on his work that they believe him when he says he was oblivious to the late-night happenings across the courtyard.) **********For the most part, Mr. Rubin has sought to control the debate within the Administration by gently controlling the process. **********Before the Democratic National Convention,  Mr. Rubin helped to torpedo one of Mr. Morris's ideas -- a deep cut in capital gains taxes on investments in inner cities -- arguing that it would create ''minimal economic activity.'' Instead, he used the National Economic Council, which he once directed, to come up with a series of less costly urban initiatives. Among them was a tax credit for employers to hire longtime welfare recipients, as well as tax incentives for private investment in community development banks and for venture funds that back projects in low-income communities. The measures sound good in a campaign speech, and their cost would be only $430 million. **********And Mr. Clinton's proposal to allow homeowners to pocket up to $500,000 in capital gains on the sale of their homes tax-free began as a $4 billion program; by the time it emerged from the bowels of the Treasury, the price had come down to $1.4 billion. **********In fact, while it is difficult to overstate Mr. Rubin's influence on everything from tax policy to the budget to economic foreign policy, he has hardly won every argument. This summer, he advised President Clinton not to sign the welfare bill; he was overruled. A month earlier he was clearly uneasy with the Administration's imposition of sanctions against foreign companies that do business with Cuba, arguing that it was an extraterritorial use of American law that would undercut efforts to win cooperation with key economic allies and trading partners, including Canada, Mexico and Britain. Mr. Clinton went ahead, though with watered-down sanctions that will not go into effect until next year, if ever. **********And Mr. Rubin is certainly not without his critics in this capital -- especially those who contend that his low-key, self-deprecating manner masks a sharply political use of the Treasury. **********In the spring, Republicans became so outraged by his maneuvers to keep paying the Government's bills despite Congress's refusal to raise the national debt limit that they talked briefly about impeaching him. (Mr. Rubin responded by suggesting that his wife, Judy -- who makes no secret of her disdain for Washington life and spends most weeks at their Park Avenue apartment in Manhattan or at their estate in Westchester County -- would happily testify on the Republicans' behalf.) **********But Republican hopes of arguing that Mr. Rubin was raiding Government pension funds and juggling the books were dashed a few weeks ago when a study they ordered from the General Accounting Office concluded that Mr. Rubin's manipulations were legal. **********Last week John B. Taylor, a chief economist of the Dole campaign, took a different tack, arguing that Mr. Rubin's description of the Clinton tax proposals as ''fully paid for'' is ''ridiculous.'' **********He said the Clinton tax cuts would last only a few years and would be revoked if Government revenues were insufficient. **********But even Mr. Rubin's harshest public critics often concede in private that it is difficult to make attacks on the Treasury Secretary stick. Over time he has developed a reputation for bringing a focus and a force of logical argument to the White House. And after the Administration's failure in its first two years to develop a working relationship with Republicans in Congress -- a lapse that Mr. Rubin counts among his biggest political mistakes -- he has been more successful than almost anyone else in the Cabinet at massaging the Republican majority and turning their divisions to his political advantage. **********These days, Republican leaders act as though they suspect they will be dealing with Mr. Rubin for some time. That was particularly evident last Tuesday, as Mr. Rubin got out of a Secret Service limousine and entered the Capitol for a brief meeting with a committee that controls the Treasury's budget. **********The Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Bill Archer of Texas, who last winter accused Mr. Rubin of courting ''a constitutional and legal crisis'' over the debt ceiling, caught sight of the Treasury Secretary from afar. **********''Bob!'' Mr. Archer yelled, trotting up to greet him. ''I don't think this election is over yet, but if Clinton is re-elected.  . . . '' Standing in the hallway, the two men proceeded to talk about ideas for next year, as if it were just about over. **********A Special Credibility **********It is sunrise along the New Jersey Turnpike and Bob Rubin is racing to a breakfast meeting with real estate developers, Wall Street investors and local entrepreneurs near Newark Airport. He is bleary eyed from six trips back and forth between New York and Washington in the last 48 hours. The final leg, at midnight after a hastily called meeting in the Oval Office about the Cuban sanctions, was aboard a private Cessna jet he leased at his own expense -- a luxury he indulges in often to save time. (''It's one of the only moments when you realize this guy not only signs dollar bills, he has $100 million of them in the bank,'' a Treasury official who works with him quipped.) **********To prepare for his talk he is flipping through the papers, reading about Bob Dole's summertime embrace of big tax cuts and supply-side economics. Mr. Rubin has taken pains not to publicly attack the Republican candidate -- he carefully edits himself, saying that there ''is a tradition of keeping Treasury secretaries one step away'' from politics -- but he has made it abundantly clear to many that he doesn't think Mr. Dole believes in his own tax plan. **********He comes as close as he ever does to a direct political attack after an introduction at a Newark hotel by Representative Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, the Democratic candidate who is in a tight Senate race. Mr. Rubin starts into his familiar patter that every tax cut ''must be fully paid for, with no gimmicks.'' **********''There's no magic to this,'' he says. ''Do you really want to explode the deficit, and put America back where we were when we inherited this mess?'' Even a few Republicans in the audience applaud. **********The entire White House economic team employs this remember-the-Reagan-era argument, but Mr. Rubin brings a special credibility to it with business audiences. He was a deficit cutter before it was fashionable in the Clinton White House. And his 26 years at Goldman, Sachs lend an authority to his pitch. Often, in the presence of Republican business leaders, he doesn't try to win new votes so much as neutralize the opposition. **********''Let's face it, many of these people will never vote for a Democratic President, no matter what I say,'' Mr. Rubin said on the way to one recent fund-raiser. ''But even if they don't support the President because they are Republicans, if they have the confidence we are handling the fundamentals right, they won't energize against us.'' **********The strategy is working. Not only do polls show that many more Americans are giving the Administration credit for its handling of the economy -- a recent New York Times/ CBS News poll showed the figure at 55 percent, up from the 30's a few years ago -- but many business executives who would reflexively vote Republican seem to be sitting on the sidelines. **********In public speeches, Mr. Rubin appears far more comfortable than when he first arrived in Washington. But he never seems entirely happy at the podium or on television. His mind often races ahead of his sentences, and a result can be long asides that water down otherwise pungent insights. By his own admission, he has never learned his boss's skill in spinning anecdotes. (Reached at his home the day a plane crashed with Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown on board, Mr. Rubin, who worked with Mr. Brown for years, could not think of any incidents that gave insight into the man. ''Call Mickey,'' he said, referring to Mickey Kantor, who a few weeks later became Mr. Brown's successor. ''He's good at that.'') **********So as the campaign enters the final stretch, other members of the economic team, from Mr. Kantor to Laura D'Andrea Tyson, are taking the economic message to the Rotary Clubs and local radio stations. As Mr. Rubin's successor in running the National Economic Council and his most frequent ally in the White House, Ms. Tyson, a University of California at Berkeley economist, is particularly adept at reducing economic complexity to simple sentences. The White House, for obvious reasons, never misses an opportunity to put her in front of women's groups and university audiences. In some ways, she has become the more visible of the two. Mr. Rubin seems perfectly happy with the arrangement. **********''What's remarkable about him is that he's got so little ego, and that's not something you see often in Washington,'' said W. Bowman Cutter, who worked closely with Mr. Rubin for three years until he left the Administration to return to investment banking. **********Mr. Rubin's style -- working the inside, minding the office -- stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken by predecessors like Lloyd M. Bentsen and James A. Baker 3d. Both viewed the Treasury as a place for high diplomacy and savored the constant world travel and the pomp and ceremony. **********Mr. Rubin dislikes all of that. His aides know that 24 hours before most foreign trips, he will question whether he could accomplish the same results on the phone. As Treasury Secretary, he has yet to visit Tokyo, the world's next-biggest financial center; apart from obligatory foreign summit meetings, he has limited his travel to a one-week tour through Indonesia and India and a weekend in South America. ''I guess I see the job a bit differently,'' he said recently. ''My job is to stay in Washington and run the Treasury.'' **********So it is not uncommon to see Mr. Rubin on the third floor of the Treasury, his sleeves rolled up and his tie at half-mast, startling some deputy assistant secretaries by showing up in their offices with friendly but penetrating questions. His focus is so tight that others in the Administration often laugh at how he can filter out other pleasures in life. Ms. Tyson remembers walking through the White House one day with Mr. Rubin and hearing Aretha Franklin practicing for a concert that night for the President. Ms. Tyson wanted to linger and listen. Mr. Rubin asked: ''Who's Aretha Franklin?'' **********As a result of his single-mindedness, Mr. Rubin has immersed himself in parts of the Treasury his predecessors rarely touched, especially the law-enforcement agencies: the Customs Service, the Secret Service and the troubled Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. With little publicity -- and limited success so far -- he has used money-laundering laws to put more heat on Colombian and Mexican drug dealers. **********Recently, following a longtime interest in urban issues, he pushed the Treasury into the nation's ghettos in hopes of bringing some market rationale to the crazy quilt of Federal housing and development projects. In July, he showed up in a section of Los Angeles where investment bankers rarely tread: A burned-out lot, surrounded by warehouses, where businesses are still trying to rebuild from the Los Angeles riots in 1992. He was pressing an Administration proposal to use tax incentives to draw manufacturing back into ''brownfields'' -- abandoned, polluted inner-city lots. **********On the same trip, he started talking about a Treasury effort to package public and private loans for low-income housing and small businesses, and sell them as securities on the secondary market in a way that would get the cost off Washington's books. ''These are experiments in using the markets to recycle scarce resources, so that what little money we have left in the budget for these kinds of projects can go further,'' he said. **********The Mexico Gamble **********Robert Edward Rubin may be low key, but he is filled with restless energy. He was eager to get out of his hometown, Miami Beach, where his father was a successful real estate investor and lawyer. At Harvard College he majored in economics and tried to convince himself he wanted to be a lawyer. But after a week or so at Harvard Law School he quit, left Cambridge, Mass., and headed off to the London School of Economics. He returned to law school at Yale, and on graduation went to practice corporate law at Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton in New York. It wasn't for him. **********Two years later he mailed out resumes to investment houses and soon jumped to Goldman, Sachs. By the 1970's, a Democrat in a sea of Republicans, he began raising money for Democratic Presidential candidates, while despairing that the party's old, big-government ideology could steer it off the rails. **********At Goldman he was fascinated by every detail of every deal; a colleague remembers getting called with questions during Thanksgiving dinner and during the second half of the Super Bowl. Mr. Rubin's mentor was Goldman's chief, Gus Levy, whose photograph occupies the center of a wall of pictures in his office, surrounded by the usual Bill-and-Hillary shots. He learned the brutal arbitrage business, and still occasionally tells stories of deals that went bad. All of this prepared him for the riskiest international investment of his life: Mexico. **********The outlines of the Mexican bailout are now familiar: When the newly Republican Congress refused to go along with an Administration plan to keep America's southern neighbor from default, Mr. Rubin urged the President to go it alone, using funds under the control of the Fed and the Treasury. If Mexico collapsed, Mr. Rubin feared, it could trigger a run on emerging markets around the world, from Brazil to Hong Kong. But the move cast the United States into a dangerous new role, that of the world's financial peacekeeper, its emergency lender. **********So to discourage other countries from depending on Washington, Mr. Rubin set extraordinarily tough standards for Mexico to get its house in order -- so tough, his critics contend, that it threw millions of Mexicans into unemployment. Today, Mr. Rubin admits that he spent months tortured by the fear that even with the tough requirements, private investors might not return to Mexico. Quietly, he stationed a Treasury agent there to make sure the government was really sticking to its austerity plan. **********Mexico is hardly out of the woods yet. But Mr. Rubin is. Private investors crept back in. And by this summer the Mexican Government -- partly to save money and partly to pay back a President it owed so much -- refinanced its debt by issuing bonds to private investors -- unthinkable a year ago -- and repaid the Treasury three-quarters of the borrowed money. Republican critics who had lambasted the bailout were silenced. **********''Can you imagine what would have happened if this had failed?'' Rubin said one day at the Treasury, putting his hands over his eyes. ''We would have spent the whole fall at hearings,'' answering questions about how billions of American dollars were lost. **********Taming Currency Traders **********Mexico was still boiling when Mr. Rubin faced his second potential political disaster: the fall of the dollar to below 80 yen. **********For Mr. Rubin, this was more familiar territory: he had supervised the currency traders at Goldman, and he knew both the fiscal and political risks. ''These kinds of occurrences are not without consequences,'' Mr. Rubin said. A declining dollar tends to drive investors out of American stocks, bonds and Treasury debt, putting pressure on the Federal Government to raise interest rates. ''It would take a while to show up, but I'm certain it would have happened,'' he said. **********Mr. Rubin did not add the obvious: high interest rates would have reversed the Federal Reserve's loosening of credit over the last year and undermined the President's argument that life has become easier for consumers because rates have fallen. Moreover, Mr. Rubin was haunted by the memory that in the Carter Administration, a weak dollar came to symbolize a weak America. ''I knew we couldn't let that happen again,'' he said. **********Wherever any Treasury Secretary goes, the dollar lurks over him. His airplane, President John F. Kennedy's old Air Force One, is equipped with encrypted communications equipment so the Treasury chief can order currency interventions -- the nuclear strikes of the 1990's -- from 30,000 feet. A flying wedge of wire-service reporters trails his every move, seeking the stray comment that could affect billions in transactions. **********Sometimes these reporters get lucky. Early in the Clinton Administration, Mr. Bentsen flipped off a casual remark that the United States was not as concerned about a weak dollar as it was about a stronger yen. Within seconds, the markets became convinced that the Clinton Administration would not defend the dollar, the yen soared, and Mr. Bentsen never again opened his mouth without a script. **********Mr. Rubin knew that getting the dollar back up would require discipline, patience, considerable stealth and luck. **********His first move was to impose an ironclad rule that he would be the only one in the Administration ever to talk about the dollar, the loquacious President included. Then he repeated, mantralike, that ''a strong dollar is in the interest of the United States.'' He mouthed this so often for so long that even his colleagues began to tease him about it. Mike McCurry, the Presidential press secretary, couldn't help himself during the Group of Seven summit meeting in Lyons, France, this summer. Stopping by the Treasury's early-morning staff meeting he smiled and said, ''Bob, let me make sure I have this right: a strong dollar is in the interest of the United States, right?'' **********''No, no, no,'' Mr. Rubin said, playing along. ''Repeat after me: It's in the interest of the United States that the dollar remain strong. There's a difference. Now, next week I'll teach you about 'stronger.' '' **********''Oh, no,'' Mr. McCurry responded, retreating from the room. ''I can't handle that.'' **********But words alone don't do the trick. Mr. Rubin's first, tentative efforts to bolster the dollar with the coordinated help of Japan and Germany failed; the intervention was washed away by investors who knew that the governments did not have the resources to outbid them. So he and his deputy, Lawrence H. Summers, a former Harvard economist who has become a considerable power in his own right in the Administration, retreated for months. Then, when the dollar had fallen off the front pages and the market's attention was elsewhere, they ambushed the currency speculators, ordering the Treasury to buy dollars. The idea was to sow so much uncertainty about the Treasury's tactics that no big speculators or hedge funds would risk being caught with a huge position in yen that could cost them millions if the Treasury intervened. **********''You can't outgun them,'' one of Mr. Rubin's close colleagues said. ''But you can teach them to fear you.'' Mr. Rubin smiled, Cheshire cat-like. ''Yeah, I've heard some people say that,'' was all he would say about it. By this summer, the dollar was back to 110 yen -- and Detroit was complaining it was so high that it was hurting car exports. **********The 'Tensest Moment' **********Mr. Rubin had a free hand in fighting the dollar war; the President almost never got involved. It could not have been more different from the battle that truly tested him, an enormous game of chicken over the budget. This was less familiar ground for the former Wall Street trader, and on more than one occasion, aides say, his cool veneer cracked. **********His mission was to protect the President from a classic Washington political ploy. Drawing from the Democratic playbook of the 1980's, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his fellow Republicans warned that if President Clinton refused to sign the Republican budget, Congress would refuse to raise the Federal debt limit, the restriction on the Treasury's ability to borrow. That meant dallying with default: if the Treasury could not borrow, it could not pay Social Security and Medicare benefits, as well as billions in Treasury bonds that were coming due. **********Mr. Rubin's task was to convince Republicans that they would bear the election-year blame for default -- and the risk to America's rating as the world's safest investment -- while simultaneously assuring the markets he would never allow a default to happen. **********Making both arguments required a good deal of footwork -- and, in Republican eyes, considerable duplicity. In public, Mr. Rubin declared, ''It is unthinkable that the United States would default for the first time in its history.'' In private he, Mr. Summers and the Treasury's general counsel, Edward S. Knight, designed a series of moves to liquidate Government pension funds that hold Treasury bills. Once those funds were turned into cash or cash equivalents, they no longer counted against the Government's borrowing limit. But the law was murky on how far he could go, and Mr. Rubin had to keep up the juggling act for months, pushing the law to its limit. **********Eventually, Mr. Rubin effectively threw the steering wheel out the window: He declared that he had run out of financial tactics, and that if Congress wanted to bear the blame for default, that was Mr. Gingrich's problem. Mr. Gingrich's troops had to decide whether he was bluffing. Already stung by the public reaction to shutting down the Government during the winter, they backed off. Mr. Clinton never had to choose between signing a budget he didn't want and threatening the fiscal credibility of the United States. **********''This was Bob's tensest moment,'' Ms. Tyson said. And in the end, he helped Mr. Clinton appear to be taming the Republican Congress's excesses -- just the image on which the President is campaigning. **********A Bond for the Middle Class **********But between now and Nov. 5, Mr. Rubin will be busy using the power of the Treasury to improve his boss's prospects. On Wednesday, in Pittsburgh, he and the President will introduce a new kind of Treasury bond, the first to carry yields that are adjusted for inflation. The bonds are designed for middle-class savers who fear that inflation could eat into their savings, and will be cast as part of the Clinton Administration's effort to make it easier for Americans to plan for their children's college educations and their own retirement. **********In effect, the bonds are a kind of marriage of family values and Economics 101. If inflation stays low, the innovation could save the Treasury hundreds of millions of dollars in interest payments. But inside the White House, they aren't known as Clinton bonds; they are called Rubin bonds."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/25/world/un-says-that-serbs-renewed-expulsions.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-06-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 207, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

As one of 72,000 managers offered the company's buyout, I chose to accept it, but it was a hard decision: I spent  nearly 10 years as an AT&T employee, but far longer as part of the Bell System.  I am, you see, an unheralded, fading demographic -- an AT&T brat. **********As longtime AT&T employees, both my parents paved the way for my career. My two sisters also did stints with the company years ago; my older sister even met her husband in the cafeteria -- he's now a salesman for AT&T in Manhattan. There was a time when most of us even worked in the same building. If you were a financial adviser, you might say my family has consistently lacked diversity in  its employment portfolio. This point was driven home when my mother, brother-in-law and I received the voluntary severance package offered to managers early in December, thus beginning a month of agonizing. **********Our long history provides the context for that anguish. The first to join the company was my father, who started at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., in 1965, when he was 25 and I was 2. As a college recruiter for the company, he was always inviting people home for dinner, so I met many of his smiling recent hires as I grew up. His closest friends were also employees -- we spent two weeks at a lake each summer with another AT&T family (two of the children also became employees). My younger sister's godparents came from the company, too. **********My father spent the majority of his working life at Bell Labs, where he marveled at the freedom and creativity of that unique technical environment, in  which the bearded gurus wandering the hallways got much more respect than staff. Become an engineer, he said again and again. The techies have it made. **********Dad rose to become a human resources manager advising top-level technical management. When I was in high school, his executive friends would pull me aside during their visits and ask what I was going to do with my life. Be an engineer, I said, knowing it was what they wanted to hear. I painted their houses, even caddied for them on the golf course, and let them help my father groom me for a  technical job at AT&T. **********Indeed, I started college at the University of Delaware as a would-be engineer. And I nodded my head when one of my father's colleagues offered me a temporary job working with computers during a winter break. But that bleak month was so boring that I spent it in the Bell Labs library reading Kurt Vonnegut books (notably \"Player Piano,\" about what happens to society when everything is  automated). I later ditched electrical engineering for the liberal arts. **********And so I was happily writing papers on Joyce and Dostoyevsky as my parents struggled through the aftermath of AT&T's breakup in the early 1980's. But come  graduation, I was out on the street, wondering what I could do. After many disenchanting and frustrating interviews on Wall Street, I let my father help me get a temporary job in an AT&T software testing lab. **********Six months later, I landed a full-time job at the labs as a technical assistant in network planning. This followed a tip from my mother, who had joined the company years before to help pay for tuition bills. **********Despite my best intentions, I found myself exactly where I swore to my parents I would never be -- working for AT&T as a full-fledged employee. I was even promoted and sent to get my master's degree in computer science, and I soon found myself a software designer in the most prestigious technical organization  in the world. **********Even so, every few years I would tell my father I was ready to leave. Whatever excuse I gave him -- a Ph.D. program or a possible job in Europe -- Dad's response was as reliable as the dial tone. I should stay, he said, because AT&T is a good place: it offers great benefits and a good salary, and the company needed people like me. I'd make a great executive, he said. To him, the  company wasn't a job; it was a way of life. His way of life. How could I reject  that? **********I didn't. I stayed and exciting things did happen for me. I became a project  manager. And I gained confidence traveling and giving presentations to corporate vice presidents, foreign delegations and even Congressional staff members.    MEANWHILE, I closely watched my father's career. In the 80's, he had become an integral part of an organization embracing the latest quality principles. He  would come home thrilled by a talk by Deming or a team-building exercise in the  woods. But three years ago, after years of restructuring, cutbacks and growth, his job function was eliminated. A surplus employee, he moved to another part of the company, but by then his enthusiasm had waned. **********After 30 years at AT&T, my father retired early last year. Even before I rejected an opportunity to go into a management training program, I knew I wanted to avoid what I had observed firsthand: the feeling of obsolescence that  my father and his friends experienced after a lifetime of power. The loss of identity was painful and real. **********It was troubling for me to see a man who had personally hired, nurtured, and  promoted a hundred people -- and whose contributions were honored at a wedding-reception-size retirement dinner -- have so few contacts outside the company. It shaped my decision to go part-time -- four days a week -- two years  ago. With the extra time, I taught technology courses to teen-agers and teachers, did some freelance writing and wrote a novel and a technical book. It  was a thrill to meet so many people who did not wear the AT&T badge. **********And the company has been hugely supportive of my extracurricular endeavors. The idea of a career path, in the old Bell System sense, has long been obsolete. In recent years, inside and outside the company, the message has been strong: You must take your career into your own hands. **********But no matter how excited I was about the outside opportunities, I felt my stomach sink last September when I watched Robert E. Allen, the chairman, announce AT&T's \"trivestiture\" -- its breakup into separate companies dedicated  to communications services, computers and networking products. Three hundred of  us were crammed in the atrium of our offices in Middletown, N.J., watching the announcement on the video monitor, making nervous jokes. We knew it would change our lives irrevocably. **********When the voluntary severance packages finally arrived at the beginning of December, my family equilibrium was broken by the stress. My mother, brother-in-law and I went off on an emotional roller coaster that made the approach to the holidays sleep-deprived and surreal. **********My brother-in-law never got close to applying -- he was in the middle of a large sales deal whose commission made even thinking about leaving impractical.  But my mother and I were both teetering throughout the extremely short, ill-timed decision period. Some days it seemed we would both take it, other days not a chance. But most of the time we were somewhere in between, discussing the  pros and cons in our daily phone calls. **********It was painful to see my mother's emotional strain. On good days, she would get excited by the possibility of using her lump sum -- about six months' pay -- to pursue her avocation as an artist; and she would be glad to avoid the uncertainty that would be sure to come after the buyout and layoffs. But on bad  days, she would worry about giving up her paycheck and, even more, about leaving a position as a personnel administrator, where she was well-respected and productive. She kept asking me what she should do. There aren't many opportunities, she feared, for someone her age. **********As Christmas approached, she knew she wouldn't be able to prepare for the holidays under the strain of deliberation, so she effectively deferred her decision until the last minute. Smiling calmly shortly before the Dec. 29 deadline, she told me she had decided to stay and see what the new year would bring. **********It turned out that the timing of the severance package was much more auspicious for me, given the surge of interest in the Internet, my technical expertise. Even so, the possibility of accepting the buyout didn't seem real until I asked for my father's advice. I expected to hear the same litany of reasons why the company needed people like me, but instead he told me it might be time to move on to other challenges. **********IT was a defining moment in our relationship. Over the years we had argued about the issue of corporate loyalty. I would ask why anyone should be loyal to  a legal entity. You have to be, my father would answer, frustrated with my irreverence to his lifelong ideal. Now, though he acknowledges that the AT&T of  religiously loyal lifetime employees is gone, he still struggles with what's next. To him, a corporation based on anything but long-term, personal loyalty doesn't make sense. **********Unlike my father, I tend not to personalize the restructuring effected by corporate management. I have no doubt the new companies will succeed, that the lean-and-mean AT&T triplets will capitalize on new information-age opportunities, and I am envious of my colleagues who will lead the way. **********Even so, with my father's blessing, I chose to take the buyout. My colleagues were shocked at first, but then they realized that I had been preparing for my departure all along. They were the ones, after all, who had been telling me that I should pursue my writing or that I would make a good entrepreneur. **********In fact, I have been greeted with so much support and good will that it has increased the painful feeling that I am leaving home. The corporation of my parents did, after all, pay for my education and help me become a successful adult. At times, I wish I could stay in the secure arms of Ma Bell, but she no longer exists. So now it is time for me to make my own way in the world."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/07/business/excerpt-from-the-speech-by-greenspan.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-12-07", "snippet": "Excerpt from speech by Federal Reserve Chmn Alan Greenspan (S)", "word_count": 299, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Excerpt From the Speech by Greenspan", "print_headline": "Excerpt From the Speech by Greenspan", "body_text": " **********Following is an excerpt from a speech by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, given at a dinner in Washington sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research on Thursday night: **********But where do we draw the line on what prices matter?

But what about futures prices or more importantly prices of claims on future goods and services, like equities, real estate or other earning assets?

We can see that in the inverse relationship exhibited by price-earnings ratios and the rate of inflation on the past. But how do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade? And how do we factor that assessment into monetary policy? We as central bankers need not be concerned if a collapsing financial asset bubble does not threaten to impair the real economy, its production, jobs and price stability. Indeed, the sharp stock market break of 1987 had few negative consequences for the economy. But we should not underestimate or become complacent about the complexity of the interactions of asset markets and the economy. Thus, evaluating shifts in balance sheets generally, and in asset prices particularly, must be an integral part of the development of monetary policy. **********The public examination of Federal Reserve actions extends well beyond our stewardship of monetary policy. Our overall management of the Federal Reserve System should, and does, come under considerable scrutiny by the Congress."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/30/news/cups-pots-and-ritualshong-kong-museum-traces-all-the-tea-in-china.html": {"writer_name": "Vaudine England", "pub_date": "1996-07-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1839, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cups, Pots and Rituals:Hong Kong Museum Traces All the Tea in China", "print_headline": "Cups, Pots and Rituals:Hong Kong Museum Traces All the Tea in China", "body_text": " **********HONG KONG\u2014                     Whatever differences exist between the British and the Chinese, one belief has never been challenged by either: a cup of tea is more than just a cup of tea. **********Little wonder, then, that Hong Kong is home to the Flagstaff House Museum of Tea Ware and that collecting teapots is a favorite pastime of a select and wealthy fraternity. **********The core of the exhibit \u2014 more than600 pieces of teaware dating from the Western Zhou times (11th century B.C. to 771 B.C.) until the 20th century \u2014 was donated by Dr. K.S. Lo and it is located in Hong Kong Park, which was recently expanded. **********These works of art are displayed along with explanations of different tea-making techniques in what was formerly the office and residence of the commander of the British forces in Hong Kong.This attractive building, constructed between 1844 and 1846, has been restored; new wings of the museum were built to match what is the oldest domestic building in Greek Revival style in Hong Kong. **********The museum is dedicated to the arts associated with Chinese tea.Through the study of the exhibitions, the viewer can start to learn how to decipher old tea rituals, which encompass aesthetics, medicine and philosophy. **********The reason that philosophy also plays a role, explains the museum's assistant curator, Grace Kwok, is that \"many potters were under the patronage of literary scholars.\"Pottery would feature inscriptions of a favored verse by the scholar-patron, for example, or at least the names of great thinkers of the time. **********Traditional tea emporia in Hong Kong still boast of their ties to ancient rituals.The Chan Chun Lan Tea Merchants' emporium, for example, dating from 1855, was renowned as a gathering place for the colony's literati.Along with the fancy tea available, there was also mah-jongg and opium. **********In Flagstaff House, there are works of extreme delicacy and beauty with each object dedicated to the tea leaf.Taking pride of place is a fine set of \"month cups,\" a set of 12 small bowls with flared sides. Experts debate whether these cups were in fact used more often for wine than for tea. **********Each is decorated with the flowers relevant to each month, while on the back is a finely painted verse extolling the beauty of the bloom and its season. **********Examples of such sets of cups have been sold to collectors in recent years. Pola Antebi, a specialist in Chinese ceramics at Christie's in Hong Kong, says prices for similar sets of month cups have been rising. **********In 1985, a set sold in New York for $143,000.Three years later, another setfetched $464,550, and in March 1991, Christie's Hong Kong sold a set for 6.16 million Hong Kong dollars (about $800,000) **********\"It is very rare to get a complete set,\" said Ms. Antebi. \"But even the singles are highly collectible. They are very finely potted, they are exquisite.\" **********Before the Tang Dynasty in China, (618-907), tea was regarded as a medicine rather than a daily drink.The leaves would be put in any old cooking pot, perhaps mixed with ginger or leeks, and brought to a boil. **********But then the connoisseur Lu Yu(circa 760-800)wrote \"Chajing,\" or \"Classic of Tea,\" in whichhe expounded on the methods of making powdered tea, a mixture of dried and ground leaves added to salted boiling water and ladled into bowls. **********By the time of the Sung Dynasty (960 to 1279), tea-making was further refined into the whipped tea method.Boiling water was poured onto tea powder and beaten with a bamboo whisk with the intent of making as much froth as possible. **********By the time of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), the practice of steeping tea had developed. **********The significance of the new tea-making methods was that each new stage required additional utensils. From the use of normal cooking vessels, tea-making progressed into a ritual requiring a large variety of bowls and teapots. **********In the Ching Dynasty (1644 to 1911), for example, a new refinement to the drinking process was developed in which lids and stands were added to little tea cups.The result was a small dish to hold the cup, which had a narrow base to steep the tea and a wide mouth for ease of drinking, topped by a lid. **********The lid kept the tea warm, but also helped hold off errant tea leaves that would otherwise be swallowed along with the tea. **********The value of itemssuch as the month cups at Flagstaff House, which date from the Kangxi period (1662-1722) of the Ching Dynasty, rests in the delicate painting and workmanship rather than in the material used. **********The highly popular Purple Clay wares from Yixing, the pottery capital of China, are an exception.The material used is the primary attraction.The clay is often of fine grain, is highly malleable and has a high iron content. **********These qualities give it a remarkable plasticity but prevent it from being thrown on a pottery wheel. So Yixing wares have to be handmade. To highlight the clay itself, Yixing wares are usually not decorated with verse or painting.As a result, the focus is on originality of shape. **********Many examples of Yixing pottery can be seen at the museum. A potter named Gongshun pioneered the treatment of the special clay and his seal is found on an interesting six-lobed teapot from 1513. **********The key criteria of value for teaware are the age of the pot, its rarity, and the presence of the potter's name or seal. Even then, says Ms. Antebi, the variations in price can be immense and sometimes puzzling. **********In 1988, one variety of teapot sold for about $13,000.By 1992, its price had surged to about $21,500.In 1993, subtle variations in the pot for sale led to a slip in price to about $15,000.In 1994, another sold for about $4,500 **********On the other hand, there is a man who unfurls a small rug on a central Hong Kong pavement in the evenings, selling small Yixing teapots.

Another 26 soldiers were missing and believed to have been kidnapped by the rebels. **********Military spokesmen said it was the greatest loss of life by the army in a single rebel attack since the guerrillas began battling the Government nearly 40 years ago. Because it occurred in an isolated, densely-forested area, news of the attack did not reach the rest of the country until Saturday afternoon. **********Military spokesmen said the guerrillas used rockets and grenades in that attack as well as in other strikes in 10 different locations, where the rebels targeted police and army installations in small towns and destroyed public buildings and banks. **********The authorities attributed the attacks to members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by the Spanish acronym FARC. The group, one of the oldest guerrilla factions in Latin America, was once a pro-Cuban Marxist movement. But Cuba's support for FARC waned in the mid-1980's, and it has been years since the group has stated its exact goals, aside from opposing the Government. **********In the last decade, the group has stepped up its kidnappings for ransom and has become involved in Colombia's drug trade by extorting money from coca growers and drug traffickers to protect their crops and routes from the authorities and by operating its own drug-processing laboratories. Both of those lucrative businesses have allowed FARC to grow considerably in recent years. **********The attacks come at a time when the Government of President Ernesto Samper faces generalized unrest. Thousands of peasants, farmers and workers have been clamoring for greater economic investment and social programs that Mr. Samper promised during his 1994 campaign but, they say, has yet to deliver. Since mid-July, about 130,000 people have been involved in demonstrations around the country. **********The unrest is widely attributed to Mr. Samper's weakness and loss of credibility after being exonerated last June of charges of drug-related corruption by a Congress that faces similar accusations. Polls show that most Colombians distrusted the congressional decision and that Mr. Samper and his aides have lost the leverage needed to keep the country under control. **********In what is seen as an effort to placate the United States, Mr. Samper has embarked on an ambitious coca eradication program that seeks to wipe out more than 67,000 acres of illegal crops this year. The plan has met its fiercest resistance in regions like Putumayo. **********A week ago a Government commission met with peasant leaders in Putumayo and signed an agreement in which the Government pledged to increase social programs and investment in the area in return for an end to the protests. While spokesmen for the peasants said the accord guaranteed that coca crops would not be forcefully eradicated, Government officials denied that their eradication program had been compromised. **********In the ensuing confusion, analysts worried that the Government was making hasty promises in an attempt to buy time and stave off further trouble. ''All this makes one conclude that the agreement in Putumayo, rather than deactivating a time bomb, has temporarily put off an explosion,'' wrote Semana, a Bogota weekly. **********Indeed, the scenes witnessed in Putumayo echo what happened in December 1994, when the Government first announced its eradication program. Violent protests ended only after the Government agreed to make investments worth $1 million  in the region. **********''The credibility of those agreements inspires doubts,'' wrote Enrique Santos Caldera An, a columnist for El Tiempo newspaper, at the time. He add that if the Government did not honor its commitments soon, ''it would not be surprising if in six months these areas are again up in arms.'' **********Military leaders have said the protesters are being manipulated by guerrilla leaders who want to protect one of their main sources of livelihood. Yet demonstrations have also included thousands of farmers who grow legal crops, as well as transportation workers in Bogota who are asking for pay raises. **********The attacks this weekend appear to have ended any immediate chances of peace negotiations with guerrilla groups. Besides the FARC, two other left-wing guerrilla groups, the National Liberation Army and the Popular Liberation Army, are active in Colombia."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/16/business/company-news-spinoff-of-sprint-s-cellular-unit-gets-tax-free-status.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;SPINOFF OF SPRINT'S CELLULAR UNIT GETS TAX-FREE STATUS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;SPINOFF OF SPRINT'S CELLULAR UNIT GETS TAX-FREE STATUS", "body_text": " **********The Sprint Corporation said yesterday that it had passed the last hurdle to spinning off its cellular-telephone business by getting approval from the Internal Revenue Service to make the spinoff tax-free for shareholders.

Eddie Waiters had been wooing the same woman since the ninth grade and, on a recent leave from Bosnia back home in Chicago, he finally won her heart. Like any good boyfriend, he calls often. But being here in Bosnia presents a problem that became evident the other day after he had chatted with her, happily, for about two hours. **********The problem? ''About, ah, $160?'' said Private Waiters, 21, straining to guess what his most recent call cost. **********But in all he is doing well compared with what he was spending  when he first arrived in Bosnia in January: He managed to get his last bill down to $650 -- not bad considering that the first month here, he paid $1,300 of the $2,000 he earns each month to AT&T. **********''You just get lonely out here,'' he said. ''You need someone to talk to. It gets you through the days, sometimes.'' **********There are only so many games of dominoes to play, James Bond films to watch or romance novels to browse through -- yes, there are stacks of them here -- on a peacekeeping mission during which 15,000 American troops are kept cooped away from the potentially dangerous distractions of local towns and cities. **********And with the peril from the former warring factions mercifully low so far, many soldiers see only one threat they have difficulty defending themselves against: the high cost, and constant temptation, of calling home. **********After a half-hour call to a girlfriend in Germany from this hilltop camp in Serb-controlled territory, Specialist William J. Hunt 4th, 26, of Wilmington, Mass., said he worried more about AT&T than about the Serbs or Muslims. ''AT&T is winning the war,'' he said. **********At another American camp several miles to the northwest, where the sign on the AT&T tent once read, ''House of Debt,'' Sgt. Ralph Middlebrooks Jr., of Dayton, Ohio, gave an irritated look when the subject of the phone company was raised. **********''I walk by that AT&T tent every morning, and just keep walking by,'' Sergeant Middlebrooks said, adding grouchily that he reaches out to touch his family via daily letters. ''They aren't getting my money.'' **********This is an issue of some touchiness for AT&T, which has an exclusive contract to provide telephone services for the troops in Bosnia and under no circumstances wants to seem like it is gouging the men and women who risk their lives so far away from their families. **********As it has done in other places where American troops are stationed, like Korea or the Persian Gulf, the company rolled early into Bosnia to set up satellite dishes and phones at every United States post of any size. That cost money, said Kelly Sratmore, a spokeswoman for AT&T in New Jersey, as does what she said is exceptionally high-quality service: Each call, whether it is aimed at Paramus, N.J., or Berlin, is beamed back to the United States, to English-speaking operators, over lines remarkably free of static or interference. **********There are cheaper but far more cumbersome alternatives. Many soldiers say they try to call home on  military phones, which provide a free connection to the military base closest to the person called, but have a lot of static and often require a long wait in line. The call can then be channeled from the base to a private long-distance carrier for a fee. **********Ms. Statmore declined to elaborate on the financial aspects of AT&T's operation, but said ''There are a lot of factors wrapped into the service we are providing and it is very much in line with costs.'' **********She added that the rates are discounted, and have actually gone down for soldiers since March. But it is still easy to see how soldiers run up bills quickly and why one lieutenant colonel ordered signs put up next to the phones. ''WARNING!'' the signs read. ''Manage your money: Indebtedness is punishable under Article 134, U.C.M.J.,'' the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The sign goes on to note that the penalties for reneging on one's debts can include a bad-conduct discharge and six months in jail, although military officials here said they were not aware of any problems that severe. **********In scores of interviews with soldiers, many reported bills of $500 or more a month, and there was much undocumented talk of bills as high as $2,000. **********The cheapest approach is to enroll in a special AT&T savings plan for the military, at a cost of $5 a month, and to call home only on Saturdays or Sundays. That costs 99 cents a minute. On weekdays, the cost is $1.14. Using a regular AT&T card costs $1.75 for the first minute, $1.50 for each additional minute, plus a $2.50 surcharge, on any day of the week. **********But those rates apply only to calls to the United States. The home bases of most American soldiers in Bosnia are in Germany, and to call families there, the price rises to $1.49 a minute on weekends with the military discount and $1.64 on weekdays. With a regular AT&T card, the cost is $3 for the first minute, $2.75 for each additional minute and the same $2.50 surcharge. **********To call collect to the United States, as Pfc. Nathan Cox, 20, learned recently when he reversed the charges to his parents in Davenport, Iowa, for an hour, is a painful $7 a minute. **********Many commanders here recommend that their soldiers buy pre-paid calling cards from AT&T, which come in denominations of $20, $40 or $60. The rates are uniform all week long -- $1.06 a minute to the United States, and $1.80 to Germany -- and help keep soldiers on budget because they cannot talk indefinitely. **********Every camp with AT&T phones has an on-site technician, and the one at the camp here in Vlasenica, Matt Barbani, 65, tries to impart a little grandfatherly advice. He said he tells the troops to use only pre-paid cards, or to have an operator cut in after a set number of minutes. **********But he said the young soldiers, especially, have trouble budgeting their time and money, and he has seen many bills mount up because of arguments or a troubled marriage. **********''I found a receiver broken in half one day,'' Mr. Barbani said. ''I imagine he was upset. It upset me too because these guys have guns.'' **********Mr. Barbani, by the way, has to pay the same rates as anyone else when he calls his wife in Vienna, Va., at least two times a week. **********''I try to keep it to 10 minutes,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/09/world/israel-s-parties-open-election-campaign-with-slick-ads-focus-security.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1996-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1345, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israel's Parties Open the Election Campaign, With Slick Ads and a  Focus on Security", "print_headline": "Israel's Parties Open the Election Campaign, With Slick Ads and a  Focus on Security", "body_text": " **********The Israeli political race burst into Israeli homes today as the major parties opened their television campaigns with a slick cascade of doves, babies, jingles and slogans, all focused on a single issue -- security. **********The images were not particularly subtle, and the endless variations on \"peace\" and \"security\" often sounded much alike, but nobody needed to be told that the choice they offered was one of the most crucial that Israelis have been asked to make in many years. **********Prime Minister Shimon Peres, 72, assumed the role of national father-figure  in the Labor Party spots, mingling happily with hundreds of bright-eyed adolescents who listened spellbound to his tales of peacemaking and broke into song. \"We're all with you with tears and happiness,\" they sang. \"Peres, we're all with you.\" **********Mr. Peres's predecessor, Yitzhak Rabin, the general-turned-peacemaker who has become a national icon since his assassination six months ago at the hand of a young religious nationalist, appeared often in the snappily edited spots, establishing a connection that is expected to figure prominently in the Labor Party's campaign. **********Benjamin Netanyahu, the 47-year-old Likud challenger, took a more sedate tack, standing in a dark suit in an oak-paneled study as he laid out his basic line of attack. **********\"Peres tried it his way, putting security in the hands of Yasir Arafat,\" he intoned, building steadily up to his campaign jingle: \"Netanyahu: making a secure peace.\" **********Unlike Mr. Peres, whose spots never mentioned Likud or Mr. Netanyahu, the Likud's ads repeatedly attacked the Prime Minister as a dove who would divide Jerusalem, barter away the Golan Heights and compromise Israel's security. **********Smaller parties also unveiled their television spots, joining in what will be a nightly ritual through the election on May 29. Under Israeli election law, television campaigning is limited to the last three weeks before the election, during which time the Central Election Commission parcels out time every evening among the competing parties, according to their size. **********On opening night today, Labor and Likud each had four spots, while the liberal Meretz had two, and two religious parties had one spot each. **********The same election laws also bar all the candidates, including Mr. Peres, from appearing on regular television programming from now through the election. They  can be shown only if they appear at official events, but not speaking or being interviewed. **********While these procedures have been around for several elections, this one is the first in which Israelis will vote directly for the Prime Minister, rather than only for a party, as in the past. That has focused the campaign largely on  the personalities of Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Peres. If the first day's ads were not too rough, both parties made clear that things would get much tougher as the election drew near. **********Also in contrast to the past, when the debate was over the basic ideology of  the Israeli state, the peace agreements reached with the Palestinians and with Jordan over the last four years fundamentally changed the debate, dividing the nation into those who want to continue down Labor's road and those who are afraid that it would only undermine their security further. **********That has made this race a virtual referendum on how to proceed with the peace negotiations, throwing supporters as diverse as the Clinton Administration and Mr. Arafat behind Mr. Peres, and prompting Islamic militants opposed to peace to seek his ouster. Other issues have been pushed to the distant background. **********With the country split roughly half and half, the outcome is expected to hinge on about 100,000 undecided voters in the center. It is after them that both Mr. Peres and Mr. Netanyahu have gone, with the dovish Mr. Peres seeking to toughen his image, and the hawkish Mr. Netanyahu insisting that he is for peace, albeit on tougher terms than Labor. **********Polls show the candidates only about four percentage points apart now. That promised a close race, and one that could be swayed if new security crises erupted in the final three weeks. **********Though the race has been officially under way now since Mr. Peres moved the elections up from October to May three months ago, a series of crises -- first a spate of bus bombings, then the incursion into Lebanon -- have kept campaigning  muted. But every move by the Prime Minister, from his stern response to the bombings to his decision to stage the operation against Hezbollah guerrillas in  Lebanon, has been scrutinized by the press, the opposition and the electorate through the prism of the campaign. **********That the Lebanese operation has brought international reproach on Israel has  mattered far less in public opinion than what it showed about Mr. Peres's readiness to be tough with the Arabs in the name of security. **********Against this backdrop, the television spots represented the initial tactic of each party on how best to secure the wavering mass at the center. **********Mr. Peres's approach was to draw his links to the slain Mr. Rabin, to President Clinton, to King Hussein and to his long experience and, most important, to suggest that future generations will live in a better Israel through his peace. **********Accordingly, the Labor ads were full of mothers hugging children and youths flocking to Mr. Peres. In one scene, an infant stares at his sad-faced mother, while the child's thoughts are narrated: \"Mom, why are you sad? Do you imagine me as a soldier one day?\" The child then turns to his father and continues, \"Tell her when I grow up, there won't be wars; tell her on May 29 to vote for the person who makes peace.\" **********The spot then concludes with dazzling snatches of prosperous, modern Israelis in convertibles, on tractors, in nightclubs, while youths sing the campaign song, \"We feel strong with Peres, strong and healthy.\" **********The Likud's ads were geared to a more nationalistic message, all of them opening with an athlete running with an Israeli flag, from which darts a white dove. Most of them continued with assaults on Mr. Peres. **********The most captivating sequence showed a pane of glass breaking. \"Who said whether the Israelis want it or not, Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine?\" the narrator asks, and a piece of glass falls out to reveal uniformed legs. **********\"Who promised to fight terrorism?\" it continues, and the rest of Mr. Arafat is shown. **********\"Who is cut off from reality and relies on him?\" goes the final question, and the rest of the glass falls out to reveal a smiling Mr. Peres walking alongside  Mr. Arafat. **********Along with the spots, Mr. Netanyahu also released the Likud party's long-awaited position on peace and security issues. The statement declared that  a Likud government would honor existing agreements and would continue negotiations toward a peace agreement, but it also said it would allow the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, oppose the establishment of a  Palestinian state and give the Israeli Army \"complete freedom of action\" to fight against terror. **********That formulation, and in particular the intention to lift the freeze on settlements, marked a fundamental change in the understandings on which the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have taken place so far, and it is not likely that the Palestinians would agree. **********For his part, Mr. Peres has sought to demonstrate that Mr. Arafat has cracked down on extremists and has lived up to his obligations, among other things by changing the Palestinian charter to excise articles calling for the destruction  of the Jewish state. At the same time, Mr. Peres has tried to delay sensitive actions, for instance by suspending Israeli withdrawal from Hebron until after the election. **********Mr. Peres has also had to soothe Israeli Arab voters who have threatened to boycott the election in protest against the Lebanese operation and restrictive measures against Palestinians. **********To restore their critical votes, the Prime Minister announced that he would appoint an Arab minister to his Cabinet, and that he would probably release Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the militant Hamas group, who has been held in Israeli prisons for seven years and who has lately called for an end to terror.

He says that since private pension plans were made widely available in Britain in the late 1980s, investors have become more enthusiastic about deciding how their pension money is invested. **********\"The market here is more advanced and more diverse than in other European countries, mainly because other European equity markets are less developed than in Britain,\" he says. **********But he warns that pension investors running their own portfolios need to be certain of their reasons for doing so.\"It's a tempting idea to have freedom and control over your investments,\" he says. \"But dealing costs can be high and diversification low. Running a relatively small portfolio could be self-defeating.\" **********At the other end of the scale are investors who prefer to build their pension portfolios from scratch. These are usually either high-net-worth investors or people who have already amassed a large fund for their retirement. **********Few choose to manage their own investments purely for fun, says Mr. Young.Usually they are looking for a strategy that traditional pension fund managers are unable to provide. **********\"Take pension funds in Britain for example,\" he says. \"Almost all of them are invested 90 percent in British stocks.But to get real growth you ought to invest internationally.If you're getting 8 percent growth in China, what's the point of sticking with 3 percent in Britain?\" **********He dismisses the argument by some fund managers that keeping assets and liabilities in the same currency is preferable to risking adverse shifts in currency values: **********\"It depends on what country you plan retiring to, but it certainly doesn't wash in Britain.The chances of sterling soaring in value are extremely remote.In the meantime, people invested in some emerging markets are getting the benefits of high growth plus currency appreciation.\" **********Building a private pension portfolio also allows investors to consider a broader range of investments.Private client advisers say they are frequently asked to include collectibles and other valuable assets, such as yachts andracehorses, as part of their clients' pension arrangements.However, tax rules usually exclude anything other than traditional equity and debt instruments as tax-qualifying pension investments."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/18/business/business-digest-862398.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-10-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 483, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Blue Chips Set Records, But Nasdaq Retreats 9.03 **********Blue-chip stocks set their third record of the week.

Mr. Chubais said that whereas 75 percent of Russia's economic activity is now generated in the private sector, \"Zyuganov's idea is to create the opposite situation, where at least 75 percent of property will be renationalized or confiscated.\" **********Mr. Chubais said he had witnessed \"international businessmen, some my friends, dancing around Zyuganov here in Davos.\" This Swiss alpine resort is where the World Economic Forum holds its annual meetings, which have become a business mating-dance for a thousand of the world's capitalist and governmental elite leavened with a sprinkling of cultural figures. **********Mr. Chubais read out what he said were policy statements of Mr. Zyuganov's Communist Party that called for reversing privatization and nationalizing such sectors as energy and banking. **********Mr. Zyuganov, during his own presentation here Sunday, rejected suggestions that he would renationalize and promised to defend private property rights, improve the climate for investment, and fight escalating crime and corruption. In an interview with the International Herald Tribune, he held out an olive branch to the leading democracy candidate, Grigori A. Yavlinsky. **********On Monday, however, Mr. Chubais portrayed the Communist leader as a wolf in sheep's clothing, saying: \"There's a Zyuganov a for foreign use and a Zyuganov for domestic consumption.\" **********Mr. Yeltsin, who has come under increasing political pressure from the left as well as the right for the government's economic policies and has seen his popularity plummet, chose the manager of the state-owned Lada vehicle factory, to succeed Mr. Chubais. **********Despite his dismissal, and fears that Mr. Yeltsin will end the program of economic reforms and privatization long championedby Mr. Chubais, hesaid he hoped the International Monetary Fund would not hold back on$9 billion in planned loans."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/07/business/new-software-seeks-end-to-long-waits-on-internet.html": {"writer_name": "Laurie Flynn", "pub_date": "1996-10-07", "snippet": "Users of World Wide Web are often frustrated by interminable delays in retrieving software and graphics; Marimba Inc will introduce new software, called Castanet, for distributing information much more quickly over Internet; analysts say Castanet ...", "word_count": 503, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Software Seeks End To Long Waits on Internet", "print_headline": "New Software Seeks End To Long Waits on Internet", "body_text": " **********Marimba Inc., an eight-month-old company, will formally introduce new software today for distributing information much more quickly over the Internet. **********The new software, called Castanet, tries to solve one of the major remaining obstacles to the Internet's future commercial growth: reducing the interminable delays in retrieving software and graphics that can make the experience of using the World Wide Web a frustrating one. **********Castanet, which consists of several programs, provides for a system of  ''channels'' by which only selected, or updated, information and graphics are sent down from Internet servers to individual computers on a ''time release'' basis. Whereas users who currently want to view information must wait while entire images, sets of data or applications are retrieved, Castanet users need only  retrieve the entire set of data once, updating as needed. **********Initially, Castanet will work only with programs written for Sun Microsystems' Java language, but it is eventually expected to support other programming languages. **********''There's a lot of waiting, and a lot of repeat traffic on the Internet,'' said Marimba's president, Kim Polese, who founded the company with several colleagues from the original team that created Java at Sun. ''We're working on how to take Java to the next level.'' **********Other companies are also developing systems for gathering information over the Internet. Pointcast Inc., for example, automatically retrieves such information as stock quotes, news and sports scores, but these come from specific sources like Reuters. But Marimba's Castanet appears to have broader applications than such programs. **********Many new-media companies are already working with early versions of Castanet to create programs they say they would not have tried before. MGM Interactive, for example, a division of MGM United Artists, said it was using Castanet to start a series of entertainment Web sites that involve a continually changing story  line. AT&T New Services Strategies has said it is already using Castanet to help it design new communications devices that interact with the Internet. **********But while Castanet could significantly improve the performance of  software on the Internet's World Wide Web, the software may have an  even bigger impact on the way software is managed on private corporate networks, some analysts say. **********Distributing and tracking software throughout large corporations is an expensive and time-consuming problem for computer systems departments, and one that only promises to become more complex. Castanet helps automate the process by providing an efficient way for computers on a network to retrieve and distribute new versions of software, mostly during off hours. **********''Probably their largest opportunity is focusing on the most immediate  and difficult issue: software distribution to corporate users,'' said Hubert Delany, director of Internet research at the Gartner Group, a market research company in Stamford, Conn. ''It's a huge problem.'' **********Yet while the young start-up has enjoyed significant attention, its success is by no means insured, Mr. Delany said. Particularly in the corporate market for software management, Marimba could face considerable competition, he said. **********Based in Mountain View, Calif., Marimba was created with a $4 million investment from the JavaFund, a $100 million venture capital fund."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/02/business/contract-settlement-averts-wider-strike-at-general-motors.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1996-11-02", "snippet": "General Motors Corp and UAW announce agreement on new three-year labor contract, averting national strike against world's largest auto maker and likely bringing an end to greatest labor unrest in American automobile industry since 1970; negotiator...", "word_count": 851, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Contract Settlement Averts Wider Strike At General Motors", "print_headline": "Contract Settlement Averts Wider Strike At General Motors", "body_text": " **********The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union announced an agreement early this morning on a new three-year labor contract, averting a national strike against the world's largest auto maker and likely bringing to an end the greatest labor unrest in the American automobile industry since 1970. **********Negotiators did not settle a three-day strike by two local unions, but a resolution of those walkouts seems likely very soon. **********The deal, which is subject to a ratification vote by 215,000 G.M. workers, bears a strong resemblance to contracts that the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation have already signed with the U.A.W. The contracts are intended to make the Detroit auto makers' stop the long shrinkage of their work forces while still letting them reduce their labor costs and compete more effectively with non-union factories that Japanese and European auto makers have built in the South. **********Each auto maker agreed to keep overall employment close to current levels, although with a few escape clauses, such as in case of recession. The employment guarantees slightly reduce the incentive for auto makers to rely on outside suppliers, since they will have to pay their workers anyway. **********The union even gave the auto makers an incentive to hire more workers, by allowing them to pay somewhat lower wages in any auto parts industries they may enter. Ford has already begun a broad review of what parts can now be manufactured in-house to make use of the lower wages. **********But the auto makers, notably G.M. and Ford, gained a little more flexibility this autumn to sell a handful of unprofitable auto parts factories. And while the union won wage increases that will exceed the inflation rate by a couple percentage points a year, it was not as aggressive in demanding pay increases as it has been in some previous labor contracts negotiated during prosperous times in the auto industry. **********Stephen P. Yokich, the U.A.W.'s president, announced the new labor contract at about 2 A.M., saying: ''We have it. We're happy about it.'' **********The Canadian Automobile Workers, a separate union, has already reached deals with Chrysler and G.M. and is trying to reach an agreement with Ford by next Monday. A short strike there cannot be ruled out, but few industry experts expect a prolonged walkout. **********So while there may still be a few isolated walkouts at G.M. factories in the months' ahead, today's agreement seems likely to end months of conflict that pitted a more militant American labor movement against the nation's biggest companies in a struggle over corporate downsizing and outsourcing. G.M. is the nation's biggest company in terms of sales, while Ford is the second largest and Chrysler is the ninth largest. **********G.M.'s sprawling empire of assembly plants and auto parts factories, which produce a little over 1 percent of the nation's economic output, has suffered three massive strikes this year. A 17-day strike last March at two brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, forced G.M. to close most of its North American assembly plants and temporarily lay off 177,000 workers. **********A three-week strike by G.M.'s Canadian workers that ended on Oct. 23 also produced heavy layoffs, as severe shortages of auto parts idled many American factories. G.M. said today that 19,000 of its American workers still have not been able to return to their jobs because of the lingering effects of that strike. **********The latest strike, and potentially the most costly of all, began on Tuesday evening when 7,500 U.A.W. workers walked out at G.M.'s most profitable assembly plant and at one of its most important truck parts factory. Because G.M.'s truck factories have been running at full speed and have scant supplies of spare parts, the latest strike quickly affected other operations. G.M. closed four highly profitable assembly plants that make pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, and idled another 11,000 workers. Outside companies that make parts for G.M. also began temporarily laying off thousands of workers. **********Auto analysts put G.M. combined losses from these strikes at about $1.3 billion in foregone after-tax profits. By comparison, only 46 publicly traded American companies earned more than $1.3 billion in all of 1995, a year of record corporate profits. The strikes have also cost the Federal Government as much as $600 million in taxes that G.M. would have paid on these profits. **********G.M. may recoup half its losses by asking workers to put in a lot of overtime in the months ahead, Wall Street experts said. **********Tonight's settlement came after Labor Secretary Robert E. Reich had publicly urged both sides today to strike an agreement. Mr. Reich said that Labor Department officials had tried to ''make sure that all parties know that there is a national interest at stake, that we hope and encourage them to reach a settlement.'' **********But it was unclear that Mr. Reich's efforts had affected the timing of tonight's deal. Labor Department officials also told union leaders and company executives that Federal mediators were available if needed. But both sides' negotiators declined the offer, following an auto industry tradition in which union and company officials have prefered for decades to deal with each other with no outsiders present."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/10/business/business-digest-769398.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-08-10", "snippet": "Busines Digest column of major news stories", "word_count": 580, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Cigarette Maker Ordered To Pay Damages for Cancer **********A Florida court ordered the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, the maker of Lucky Strikes, to pay a record $750,000 to Grady Carter, 66, who got lung cancer after 44 years of smoking. **********It was only the second time the tobacco industry has been ordered to pay damages in a liability case, and the company's lawyer said an appeal was likely.

Together they had a daughter. **********He endured countless parents pressing Pooh books into his hands and asking for an autograph; in return he asked for a donation for his favorite charity, Save the Children. **********His father died in 1956, and Mr. Milne remained silent about the effect of the series' immense popularity on his life until 1974, when he published \"The Enchanted Places.\" It was followed by \"The Path Through the Trees\" in 1979 and \"The Hollow on the Hill\" in 1982. **********Mr. Milne described his father as a man who used his small son's youth to stave off his own middle age. **********\"When I was three, my father was three,\" he wrote. \"When I was six, he was six,\" adding \"he needed me to escape from being 50.\" **********He said his father kept his only child at a distance: \"His heart remained buttoned up all through his life.\" **********He also resented the confusing of his childhood with popular legend, and he himself could not remember whether it was the real or fictional Christopher Robin who invented the game of \"Pooh sticks,\" dropping sticks from a wooden bridge into a flowing stream. **********Nonetheless, he was not averse to invoking his own name when he found a cause was worthy, like his efforts to protect Ashdown Forest, which was used as the setting of some of his father's stories. **********He is survived by his wife and daughter.

I.B.M. dropped to fourth from third rank, with its market share holding steady at 10.1 percent. **********Toshiba Ltd. was fifth, and the Compaq Computer Corporation came in sixth place. While Compaq rose from seventh place last year, its market share climbed  only a tad to 3.8 percent from 3.7 percent, Dataquest said. **********Until a couple of years ago, the Japanese personal computer market was a backwater. Prices were high, technological advance was slow and personal computers were not catching on as they were in the United States and Europe. Each vendor had an original design, fragmenting the market. **********But in the last couple of years, the second-largest PC market in the world has undergone a vast transformation. All vendors except NEC and Apple have coalesced around the so-called I.B.M.-compatible standard used in the rest of the world. Prices have plummeted and sales have soared. **********Dataquest, which is based in San Jose, Calif., said PC shipments rocketed 71  percent last year to 5.7 million machines, a number that might be a bit higher than estimates by other market researchers and companies. In monetary terms, the market grew 46 percent, to 1.3 trillion yen, or about $13 billion. **********The event that caused the change was the \"Compaq Shock,\" when Compaq entered  the market in 1992 with machines selling for half the price of equivalent Japanese models. The Dell Computer Corporation quickly followed with similarly aggressive pricing. **********But that shock awoke the sleeping giants of Japan, who reacted by trimming down and slashing their prices. Most aggressive was Fujitsu, which basically bought market share by selling machines at a loss. Fujitsu was in a position to  do that because it was making big profits in computer memory chips. **********NEC, which long held more than 50 percent of the Japanese market, saw its share drop to 40 percent in 1995, despite a 46 percent gain in shipments to 2.28 million units. NEC disputes Dataquest's figures and maintains that it still holds half the market. **********The new vigor of the Japanese vendors has made it hard for the Americans to gain market share, although the American shipments have been rising healthily because of the growth of the overall market. **********Apple, which has a significantly higher market share here than in the United  States, saw its shipments in Japan rise 58 percent, to 810,000 machines in 1995, Dataquest said. However, the severe price competition has knocked the profits out of Apple Japan, contributing to the recent financial difficulties of its parent company. **********Despite the tougher going, newcomers like Gateway 2000, Packard-Bell and Hewlett-Packard are now mounting efforts to sell PC's in Japan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/03/business/californias-proposition-211-vital-protection-for-investors.html": {"writer_name": "Jake Petrosino", "pub_date": "1996-11-03", "snippet": "Jake Petrosino article backs California referendum that would remove legal barriers to class-action suits in cases involving stock fraud and would hold corporate directors and officers personally liable when juries award damages; drawing (M)", "word_count": 786, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "California's Proposition 211: Vital Protection for Investors", "print_headline": "California's Proposition 211: Vital Protection for Investors", "body_text": " **********THE trustees of five large California pension plans have endorsed a referendum on Tuesday's state ballot that would remove prohibitive legal barriers to class-action lawsuits in cases involving stock fraud and would hold corporate directors and officers personally liable when juries award damages. **********It was right for these trustees to support the measure, known as Proposition 211. It was right not only because they have the responsibility to preserve and protect the retirement assets of employees of Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Fresno, Alameda and San Mateo counties, but also because it will help millions of individual investors protect their retirement assets. **********Anyone with responsibility for protecting and preserving retirement assets, be it a huge pension fund or your 401(k) program, has an obligation to endorse the principles of Proposition 211. Securities fraud costs Americans $40 billion a year, according to the Justice Department. No investor -- institutional or individual, large or small, sophisticated or naive -- is immune. **********Indeed, William McLucas, the director of the enforcement arm of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has testified before Congress that securities class-action lawsuits are ''essential'' to maintain protection for investors. **********Meanwhile, the fight over Proposition 211 has evolved into a battle between investors, who need strong protections, and corporate interests that want lower standards of liability for wrongdoing. **********Corporations chant false battle cries for the media. The measure, they say, would encourage frivolous lawsuits or predatory-strike suits whenever a company's stock drops. **********They blow their charging bugles, sounding the notes of factual misstatements: Companies will leave California, they say. Directors and officers will resign, they add.  And the flow of information between corporate management and securities analysts will dry up because corporations will be afraid that their own projections about performance will come back to haunt them. **********Opponents go so far as to contend that Proposition 211 would reduce the number of initial public offerings by high-technology companies, which would fear being exposed to a greater degree of liability. **********Of course, it's all balderdash of mythic proportions; it just isn't true. **********A study by the University of California at Berkeley business school of all listed shares that declined 20 percent or more in price over five-day periods from 1988 through 1990 found that in the 589 cases only 20, or 3.4 percent, resulted in lawsuits against the companies. **********And over the last 20 years, the courts have deemed only one securities class action to be frivolous. If filing meritless cases has become the new national pastime, why haven't we heard of thousands of cases? **********The facts are that the number of securities class actions has averaged only 300 a year for more than 20 years. The administrative office of the Federal courts recorded 305 securities class-action lawsuits filed nationwide in 1974 and 290 filed in 1994. The statistics also show that suits are filed against approximately 120 companies annually, out of more than 14,000 public corporations reporting to the S.E.C. **********In fact, Proposition 211 seeks to discourage frivolous lawsuits even further by establishing the highest preventive standard for any state court system in the United States: the proposal mandates that California courts require the plaintiff in a lawsuit that is found to have no merit to pay the defendant's full expenses. **********And Proposition 211 allows corporations to buy insurance for any liability. Directors' and officers' liability policies already cover them for exposure not indemnified by the corporation. The S.E.C., however, has declared that indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities laws is against public policy. The courts already uphold this position. **********The quantity of information flowing from management to the public and to securities analysts will not be stanched under Proposition 211, but the quality is likely to improve. The measure simply requires that forward-looking statements be made on a reasonable basis of fact and good faith. Is there anyone who would condone statements made on an unreasonable basis and in bad faith? **********As for companies that might be reluctant to go public because it might reduce their ability to get away with wrongdoing, perhaps they should remain privately held. **********Consider the statements Charles Valdes, the chairman of the investment committee of the California Public Employee Retirement System. Although Calpers, the nation's largest pension fund with $100 billion invested on behalf of a million Californians, has remained officially neutral on Proposition 211, a number of its trustees have criticized the campaign against the referendum. **********''The opponents of Proposition 211 behave in the same way a corporation behaves when it deceives investors,'' Mr. Valdes said at a news conference last month.

Outside the gates of the complex, closed for four years, heavily armed soldiers patrol and the dirt roads leading to the heart of the mine are blocked with land mines. **********This mining complex is believed by residents here and Western officials to be the central collection point and hiding place for thousands of corpses that remain from the Bosnian Serbs' campaign of \"ethnic cleansing\" in northwestern Bosnia. **********The Bosnian Serbs, according to non-Serb miners in the town, are exhuming the remains of victims from numerous mass graves in the area and transferring the bodies to this mine, where they are often mangled in old mining equipment, doused with chemicals and reburied under tons of debris in the open pits. **********The effort to collect the bodies in one central location began late last year, but has picked up as NATO troops move into the area, the townspeople say.  Two American reporters who passed through the gate of the mine and attempted to  make their way by foot toward one pit were arrested by the Bosnian Serb police on Saturday, held for the day, then expelled from the territory. **********Senior British commanders, stationed in the mining town with the NATO force,  say British patrols sometimes find corpses, usually badly decomposed, only to have the bodies whisked away by the Bosnian Serbs, often within hours. They speculate that some of these bodies are from executions carried out last fall by paramilitary forces led by Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan. Others, they say, may date back four years to one of the earliest waves of ethnic killing in  the Bosnian conflict. **********\"Everyone seems to be in a hurry to cover their killings,\" said one senior British commander, who asked to remain unidentified. \"There are bodies all over  this place. We go in to houses and find floorboards ripped up and holes in the basement. They are working very hard.\" **********The Ljubija mine is seen by human rights officials abroad as one of the keys  to documenting the killings in this part of northern Bosnia. Investigators believe the mine, along with a group of suspected mass graves near the Serb-conquered town of Srebrenica, will help prove whether the Bosnian Serbs carried out a deliberate, well-planned policy of genocide against Muslims and Croats living in this region. **********\"There was a lot of killing in Ljubija,\" said Ivan Zvonimir Cicak, the head of the Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights. \"We think there may be as many as 8,000 bodies in the mine. We have eyewitness testimony from people who saw the bodies. On top of the bodies they dumped lime. This is probably the largest mass grave in Serb-held Bosnia. **********\"We look at the mine as the key to saving Bosnia. We must show that there was a systematic campaign of genocide, and to do this we must get to Ljubija and Srebrenica.\" **********NATO forces so far show no inclincation to approach the mine or interfere with the Bosnian Serb soldiers there. **********\"Our job is to separate forces, not look for mass graves,\" said Lieut. Col. Benjamin Barry, the commander of the British forces, whose headquarters are a mile from a pit that is said to hold thousands of bodies. \"I don't have the resources to go looking for them. It would be a diversion of soldiers from our main goal.\" **********Those who live in the area, all of whom insisted that they not be identified, said the main pit used to bury bodies is near Stara Rijeka, about five miles south of Ljubija. **********While the exact location of the mass grave site remains unconfirmed, there is much circumstantial evidence that such a grave site exists in the mine area. **********Residents in the town report that during the summer of 1992, busloads of Muslims and Croats, including women and children, went through the gates of the  mine. **********But unlike the Muslims and Croats delivered to the three main concentration camps in the area -- Omarska, the Keraterm tile factory and the railway station  in Trnopolje -- no one ever returned from the Ljubija mine. The mine, townspeople said, was never used as a detention camp, but only as an execution and burial site. **********\"The buses would go in day and night,\" said one resident of the town. \"They were filled with people. They always came back from the mine empty. We heard shooting day and night. At first we heard single shots, then we began to hear lots of automatic fire. This went on for over two months.\" **********Croats who live near the St. Ana Chapel, about 300 yards from the suspected burial pit, said that for several weeks in 1993, they were not permitted by the  Bosnian Serbs to leave their homes or even peer out the windows. **********\"Even the Serbs were not permitted to graze their goats in the area,\" said a  66-year-old retired Croatian miner. \"We heard the sounds of many heavy trucks on the road to the pit. When we were finally allowed back outside, the pit looked different. It was full of dirt. There were earthen barricades around the  pit.\" **********Another Croat who lives near the site said she saw dozens of pairs of sports  shoes on a road near the pit. **********\"These were the kinds of shoes our young men wore,\" she said. **********In the fall of 1992, after news reports about the camps, the Bosnian Serbs disbanded the detention centers. But last fall, as the war began to turn against them, townspeople say, the Bosnian Serbs moved to begin to collect bodies from other grave sites and dump them in a central pit in the Ljubija mine. Residents  say bodies were also collected from various pits in the mine and transferred to  one central location. **********Some who live near the mine said that it was sealed off for a month last fall and that large numbers of Bosnian Serb troops and local miners were used to transfer the bodies to one central pit. **********None of townspeople interviewed admitted to taking part in this, but many residents told identical stories they said they had heard from neighbors and friends who worked in the mines. According to these reports, the bodies were often mangled by machinery used to crush iron ore and were further disfigured by chemicals. And late last year detonations resounded through the town that local  residents say sent tons of earth over the stacks of remains. **********\"If you go near the site you are killed,\" said one resident. \"It is strictly  off-limits. There are guards around the pit day and night. There are lots of land mines there.\" **********The Government offensive this fall was halted just a few miles from the Ljubija mine. Government officials said they had hoped to push their forces into the mining town to capture the mine site. They said much of their reluctance to  halt their offensive was due to their failure to take this objective. **********Despite the presence of NATO troops in the mining town, investigators from The Hague say they are still being refused permission to enter the area around Prijedor. Ljubija is 12 miles south of Prijedor. **********\"There were certainly thousands killed at various camps around the Prijedor area,\" Graham Blewitt, the deputy prosecutor for war crimes at The Hague, said in a telephone interview. \"We have never had access to the area.

But the announcement, coming after years of government denials of any possibility of a link, is likely to focus new attention on this mysterious and previously obscure group of diseases. **********In Britain the disease is believed to have started in sheep, which it afflicts in a form known as scrapie. Until the practice was banned in 1989, British farmers fed rendered sheep parts to cows as a protein supplement, and the disease is believed to have infected cows only through improperly treated sheep parts in this food. **********In sheep, cows and humans, the disease takes the form of slowly attacking the brain, giving it a sponge-like consistency as nerve cells are destroyed. Because the human form of the disease can take many years or even decades to develop, it is possible that many more cases will materialize in Britain than those so far apparent. The scientists who advised the British Government are concerned that the handful of cases identified so far could be the beginning of a larger epidemic. **********Since 1986, when the outbreak of mad cow disease was detected in Britain, many countries have set up monitoring systems to detect it.American officials say that outside Britain, mad cow disease has turned up only in the 10 countries to which Britain exported cattle in the 1980's. In six of those countries, including Canada, the disease did not spread from imported cattle to ones already living in the countries. **********For surveillance, the United States Department of Agriculture is relying on standard techniques used by British health officials. From 1990 through 1995, the department tested 2,660 cattle brains and found evidence of mad cow disease  in none, said Dr. William D. Hueston, a leading expert on the disease at the department. **********The Department of Agriculture has kept careful watch on the 499 cattle imported from Britain before the 1989 ban but has found no cases of mad cow disease. The 116 surviving cattle are still being monitored. **********But at least one expert does not share Dr. Hueston's confidence. He is Dr. Richard F. Marsh of the University of Wisconsin in Madison, who has done research on a disease of mink that resembles mad cow disease. Dr. Marsh notes that scrapie exists among sheep in America, and that sheep offal is sometimes fed to cows here. He would like to see more sophisticated and systematic testing of cows to be sure that mad cow disease is not present. **********\"The fact that we have no reported cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy  in this country is a false sense of security because it is not based on sufficient testing,\" Dr. Marsh said, referring to the scientific name for the disease. \"If the United States ever gets mad cow disease, we will have the same kind of reaction that occurred in Britain.\" **********The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not actively monitor for  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is difficult to diagnose in any case. Epidemiologists say at least a small rise in cases could occur without being noticed. **********Concerns about sheep-to-cow transmission have also risen in the Federal Food  and Drug Administration, which regulates animal feed. In 1994 the agency proposed banning the use of certain sheep offal, a move that was opposed by large segments of the agricultural industry. The agency took no action after risk-assessment studies indicated \"that having such a rule will not provide any  value,\" said Dr. Stephen F. Sundlof, an agency official. But the proposal is now being re-examined in light of the British Government's finding, Dr. Sundlof said, and he expects a decision soon. **********Major sheep producers have voluntarily agreed not to render adult sheep and sell the rendered products for feed in ruminants and cattle. But Federal officials said it was \"very difficult\" to verify compliance. Dr. Sundlof noted that even if a ban was carried out, there would be no absolute assurance that farmers were complying, in part because there is no way to test a rendered product for sheep parts. **********Dr. Hueston said the Department of Agriculture has carefully studied the sheep-to-cow transmission possibility but has been unable to verify it in the United States, either in theory or practice. Scrapie-infected tissue collected from sheep in this country has been injected into the brains of cattle without causing the damage typical of mad cow disease, suggesting the scrapie agent that infects American sheep may differ from that of British sheep. **********\"With all the work we have done in the United States so far, we have not been able to recreate a disease that fits the bovine spongiform encephalopathy picture,\" Dr. Hueston said. **********The Agriculture Department thus sees no reason for alarm or no threat to the  $36 billion American beef industry. **********There is no evidence from any country that scrapie can be transmitted directly to people who eat lamb or mutton. **********Besides animal feed, another concern of the Food and Drug Administration is the medical products derived from cattle tissue and organs.  The human version of the disease was shown in 1968 to be transmissible through injections and transplants of infected tissue, like corneas or growth hormone, then obtained from the pituitary glands of cadavers. Some three dozen marketed drugs are derived from cattle tissue and organs, and hundreds more contain fractions of cow blood. Gelatin, derived from cow hooves, is an ingredient of many drugs and  is used to make capsules. **********To prevent risk of infection by the mad cow disease agent, the Food and Drug  Administration prohibits the use of bovine material from countries afflicted with mad cow disease. In addition, Dr. Carol Vincent, a Federal Drug Administration official, said the agency did not consider gelatin to be a problem because \"the manufacturing process would reduce or eliminate the agent,  if it is present.\" Dr. Vincent said \"it is terribly unlikely that gelatin is going to be a source for\" mad cow disease. **********The British scientific committee concluded that gelatin could safely be used  in pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food. **********Nevertheless, the World Health Organization urged last year that a meeting of specialists be held to develop guidelines to minimize the risk of transmitting the agents causing spongiform brain diseases through drugs and medical devices. The meeting is being planned for next fall, but no date has been set. **********Scrapie, mad cow and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are maladies of unknown cause. The infectious agent seems too small and hardy to be a virus. A leading theory is that abnormal variants of a certain protein cause the diseases. These theoretical variants, known as prions, are thought to convert their normal counterpart proteins into the abnormal form. Since the normal proteins are conjectured to form part of the surface of nerve cells, prion infections show up as brain degenerative diseases. Prions, however, are still conjectural entities. **********Worldwide, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease affects about 1 person in a million, on  average, each year. Doctors know little about how it is spread. While it usually affects older people, a striking factor in the cluster of 10 recent cases in Britain is that the victims were younger than 42, and some were in their teens. **********The British scientific committee that advised the Government said a previously unrecognized and consistent disease pattern had come to light, although one that fell short of clear proof of a link between the cow and human  diseases. **********\"In the absence of any credible alternative, the most likely explanation\" of  how the Britons contracted Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is that they were exposed to mad cow disease before the British government's ban on feeding sheep offal in 1989, the committee said. It added that though the number of cases was small, they were a \"cause for great concern.\" **********The British Government believes that the chain of transmission of the disease from sheep to cows has now been broken. It is now thought that an important sanitary step in the preparation of sheep parts was omitted during the 1980's. The epidemic of mad cow disease, which peaked in the early 1990's, presumably arose largely from cattle that were infected up until the 1989 ban. Some cows may have been infected since then through lack of compliance with the ban, but the government's position is that younger cows are now essentially free of the disease. **********In humans, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease can resemble Alzheimer's. It produces progressive apathy, irritability, dementia, balance problems and severe muscle spasms. **********Humans and scrapie-infected sheep have co-existed for centuries and there is  no evidence that scrapie is directly transmissible to humans from eating lamb or mutton or that Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease could be a manifestation of scrapie  in humans."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/16/business/hanson-reports-tripling-of-profits.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-08-16", "snippet": "Hanson PLC says its profits almost tripled to $1.1 billion in its third quarter, and sales were up 11 percent, to $4.6 billion (S)", "word_count": 123, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hanson Reports Tripling of Profits", "print_headline": "Hanson Reports Tripling of Profits", "body_text": " **********The British conglomerate Hanson P.L.C. said yesterday that its profits had almost tripled to more than $1 billion in its third quarter, helped by the sale of several of its businesses.

Munro, the chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm. That view, he said, is of an economy that is \"prosperous but not booming, with remarkably little in the way of price  pressures.\" **********Salomon Brothers told its clients today that the Fed would probably hold rates steady next week, \"reflecting relative contentment with the present economic and inflation backdrop.\" **********But the outlook for the rest of the year remains extremely unsettled, analysts said. While the current debate is whether the Fed will have to raise rates at some point, there is also the possibility that an expected economic slowdown this fall might provide an opening for the arguments of those business  executives, economists and politicians who contend that Fed policy is too tight. A rate cut, these people say, would bring stronger growth with little risk of inflation. **********The last time the Fed acted -- it reduced the Federal funds rate by a quarter-point, to 5.25 percent, in late January -- the central bankers apparently failed to anticipate the strength of the first-quarter rebound in growth. Those signs of strength produced a sharp run-up in long-term interest rates this year and rekindled fears, so far unfulfilled, of greater inflation. **********The Fed's actions will come under even greater scrutiny than usual in coming  months. Not only will the Presidential campaign leave the Fed open to being second-guessed in an intensely partisan atmosphere, but the renomination of Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman is being held up by Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, a Democrat. **********Mr. Harkin, who contends that Mr. Greenspan is sacrificing economic growth to an overemphasis on stamping out inflation, is holding out for an agreement by the Republican leadership to allow a full Senate debate on monetary policy and a recorded vote, rather than the planned voice vote, on a third four-year term for Mr. Greenspan. Mr. Greenspan's nomination is expected to be approved by a wide margin once it comes to a vote, and he continues to serve in an acting capacity until then. **********The holdup has also frozen the nomination by President Clinton of two new Fed members: Alice M. Rivlin, currently the Administration's budget chief, and Laurence H. Meyer, an economic forecaster. They will not take office until confirmed. **********Amid the debate over the Fed's role, there are also growing pleas from the business community for the Fed to consider that growth may not be as robust as it seems. **********In a survey by the Business Council, a group of chief executives from 100 of  the nation's largest corporations, nearly half the respondents said it was harder to raise prices in their industry than it was six months ago, and only 9  percent said it was easier. Many said their own sales figures did not reflect any significant economic quickening. **********Almost half the respondents urged the Fed to stimulate the economy by cutting rates. \"There is absolutely no inflation,\" said John F. Welch Jr., the chairman  of the General Electric Company. **********\"We don't see industrial prices or labor pressures\" driving inflation upward, Mr. Welch said. **********Edgar S. Woolard Jr., the chairman of the Du Pont Company, said the Fed should hold rates steady at its meeting next week, but that it should then \"err  on the side of testing inflation\" later in the year. **********Fed officials have been indicating that they see no strong case for a change  in short-term interest rates, barring some new evidence of overheating. **********\"I don't see any driving forces at this time that would take growth on a greatly accelerated path from the trend growth picture that we have been looking for for some time,\" a Fed governor, Edward W. Kelly Jr., said last week. **********But Fed officials said they were keeping a close eye on wages, which could start rising faster if the current 5.4 percent unemployment rate dips further. They said they were also watching energy prices, which have jumped sharply in recent months but have now started leveling off, and food prices, which could be driven up by rising grain prices. **********While Fed officials said they were not altering their views on inflation, they also gave some indications that they were looking into whether the economy  currently has a greater capacity for noninflationary growth than the statistics  may indicate.

And the loan was well in excess of the bank's $50 million internal limit, Gordon Layfield 3d, Signet's senior executive vice president, said yesterday. **********Signet had intended to sell the $31 million of the loan in excess of its limit to other banks, Mr. Layfield said. And it now expects to get back a significant part of the loan from funds that have been recovered. **********Still, banking experts say, Signet's experience underscores the importance of traditional discipline at a time that competitive pressure is tempting banks to  stretch ever further in search of profit. **********\"This always happens,\" said Thomas K. Brown, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. \"People who make loans out of policy learn that those loans come back to bite them.\" **********The $81 million was only part of more than $300 million in loans that the F.B.I. says a former employee of the Philip Morris Companies, Edward J. Reiners, obtained fraudulently over two years from eight banks. On Tuesday, the F.B.I. arrested Mr. Reiners, charging him with weaving a complex tale of a secret Philip Morris project that required the money to lease computers to develop an alternative to cigarettes. **********Of course, it is impossible to completely prevent fraud or other unexpected losses. But the other banks involved in the apparent scheme, like Nationsbank, the Bank of Montreal and Corestates Financial, are far larger and better able to withstand a financial shock than Signet. **********The bank, with assets of $11 billion, does not number among the nation's 50 largest. And the $81 million loan represents 9.4 percent of its equity. The legal lending limit is 15 percent of equity, or $128 million in Signet's case -- although most banks seek to keep loans far below their legal limit. Put another  way, $81 million represents 38 percent of Signet's pretax profit last year. **********Signet officials said that the size of the loan appeared to be justified by the stability of Philip Morris, with which they believed they were doing business. \"We are dealing with what we thought was a Fortune 100 company with an outstanding rating,\" Mr. Layfield said. **********Yet in this case, the deal may well have been too good to be true. Companies  as big as Philip Morris rarely borrow from any bank, let alone one as small as Signet, typically choosing to instead go to Wall Street, where they can tap investment banks' and brokerage houses' substantial bond and commercial-paper offerings. When they do borrow from commercial banks, companies of this size pay rates so low that the banks often make loans at a loss to try to get other, more profitable business from those companies. **********So it would have been unusual for Signet to get any business from Philip Morris, especially so much that Signet had to arrange a syndicate of other lenders. And this sort of syndication activity was highly unusual for Signet, which, analysts say, should have perhaps been another warning sign. **********\"That loan should have had more scrutiny, especially for something of that size,\" said Livia S. Asher, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. \"The big question is  what is going on with their internal controls.\" **********Mr. Layfield flatly rejected the suggestion that there was any flaw in Signet's controls. \"I don't think there is any evidence that the system broke down,\" he said. \"When you are involved in a fraudulent transaction of this nature, with this degree of sophistication, I'm not sure any bank has the systems that could always protect you.\" Mr. Layfield added that there was no evidence that any Signet employees were involved in the apparent fraud. **********In retrospect, there were some relatively simple acts in the oversight process here that might have uncovered fraud. The scheme unraveled last week when an executive at the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, another lender involved, contacted Philip Morris to verify a document that purported to authorize the loans and was told that the signature was a forgery and the documents were not valid, the F.B.I. says. **********Banking experts say that no matter how complex the financial world becomes, the basic rules of banking still apply, such as \"know your borrower.\" **********\"For any kind of big credit exposure, it's very important for the lender to go out and personally check the tires,\" said Rodgers L. Harper, a corporate-loan expert with the First Manhattan Consulting Group. \"You want to meet the guy in his office to have a sense he's on the up-and-up, and if it's a big deal, you want to meet several people.\" **********Standard & Poor's, the debt-rating agency, said yesterday that it was considering lowering Signet's bond rating -- already just BBB-, one rung above junk-bond status. **********\"The ultimate financial costs to Signet include not only direct credit losses, but also legal expenditures and collection-related costs, which are also unquantified,\" S.& P. said in a statement \"Additionally, issues related to Signet's risk-management process need to be clarified.\" **********And other analysts said the incident underlined uncertainty about a move by Signet into uncharted territory with a consumer product known as Loan-By-Check.  Signet is mailing bank checks for $7,500 to consumers nationwide; by endorsing and cashing the check, the consumer agrees to an installment loan. **********Still, Signet is widely considered to have some of the most advanced computer technology for evaluating and making consumer loans, and some investment brokers, including Goldman, Sachs and J. P. Morgan, have reiterated their buy recommendations on the company's stock despite the fraud case. **********The case comes at a time government regulators and banking leaders have begun to worry that lending standards have become too lax. Last week, Tom Ripke, chairman of Robert Morris Associates, a trade group for commercial lenders, called for tighter standards. **********\"Trading lower underwriting standards for improved loan growth can lead to serious problems in future quarters and years,\" he wrote to 3,000 banks. Among the issues Mr. Ripke raised was whether banks were making more exceptions to their own policies. **********\"Experienced bank credit officers are concerned,\" he said in a statement released with the letter. \"We have a feeling, an intuition, that C.E.O.'s need to be extra vigilant, especially in these good times, to insure sound credit quality standards are maintained.\" **********The bankers' graveyard is filled with institutions that did not ask enough questions in the face of what seemed to be lucrative opportunities, banking experts say. Most notably, fraudulent oil-patch loans distributed by the Penn Square bank in Oklahoma ultimately forced a Government bailout of Continental Illinois. **********The Penn Square case raised another issue that may emerge for Signet: the role of banks that buy into loans originated by other banks. The contracts in such deals are clear that each bank is responsible for conducting its own due-diligence investigation and credit analysis of a borrower. **********But, in practice, bankers often make decisions quickly to take part in syndicated loans, especially for companies like Philip Morris that are household names, and they often depend on the lead bank to conduct most of the investigation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/03/business/international-briefs-bundesbank-declines-to-change-key-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 68, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Bundesbank Declines To Change Key Rates", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Bundesbank Declines To Change Key Rates", "body_text": " **********Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, left its key interest rates unchanged yesterday.

Wiles", "print_headline": "MUTUAL FUNDS;INVESTING WITH: Christopher H. Wiles", "body_text": " **********THE current stock market, dipping and swaying as it is, \"is our kind of market,\" says Christopher H. Wiles, manager of the Federated Equity-Income fund. \"It's like shopping in a nice jewelry store and all of a sudden they've got a blue-light special on Rolex watches.\" **********But that doesn't mean Mr. Wiles is taking undue risk. In fact, equity income  is the most conservative style of stock investing, and Mr. Wiles considers it his job to keep as much risk out of the Federated Equity-Income fund as he can. **********There are three principal risks in managing an equity portfolio, and I avoid two of them,\" Mr. Wiles said. He characterized the first as market timing, which he shuns by typically holding a minimal 2 percent or 3 percent of the $508.2 million portfolio as cash. The second, he said, is \"trying to forecast what sectors are going to be the hottest.\" Since that's impossible, he asserts,  his portfolio is sector neutral, matching the industry weightings of his benchmark, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. **********\"The third risk is company risk, or picking individual securities, and that's the risk I'm willing to assume,\" he said. \"I try to ignore the market's noise and focus on the best securities.\" **********That approach has rewarded shareholders of the fund, which has been run since its inception in 1986 by Federated Investors of Pittsburgh but carried the Liberty name until April. Before Mr. Wiles took it over in 1991, the portfolio consistently lagged behind its peers, by an average of a quarter percentage point a year. Over the last three years, through Thursday, the class A shares performed 1.2 percentage points better than the fund's peers, according to Morningstar, the fund researchers. And in the five years through June 30 since Mr. Wiles became manager, the class A shares have topped their rivals by an average of three points annually, said Matthew Muehlbauer, research manager of the Value Line Mutual Fund Survey. **********\"He tends to hold 60 issues so he can keep up his intensive research,\" Mr. Muehlbauer said, referring to the relatively few holdings. **********Mr. Wiles says he picks stocks based on four qualities: good corporate management, high return on equity, attractive valuation and what he called \"some secular growth characteristics.\" He likes stainless steel at the moment, he said, because the demand for it is growing more rapidly than for ordinary steel. **********He also looks for relatively high, and growing, dividends. Equity-income funds generally offer higher yields than other stock portfolios. The Federated fund typically holds 30 to 35 percent of the portfolio in convertible securities, which yield more than common but can be exchanged for it later. **********He noted a convertible issued by Sun America Life Insurance, a leader in the  annuity business. The convertible is yielding 4.2 percent, more than four times  the common stock's 1 percent. If Sun America's common rises 25 percent, the convertible will rise 24 percent, Mr. Wiles said, but if the common falls that amount, the convertible will probably drop only about 10 percent. So on a move of this size, \"you get almost all of the upside potential of the stock and less  than half of the downside,\" he said. **********Taking advantage of the buying opportunities in the current market gyrations, Mr. Wiles has reduced cash to 1.5 percent of assets, adding to positions in beaten-down companies like AT&T, and creating new ones for other battered securities, like MFS Communications, a long-distance reseller, and SCI Systems,  a maker of electronic components. **********A Stake in Steel **********One of Mr. Wiles's biggest positions is in Allegheny Ludlum, the industry leader in stainless steel. Because stainless does not rust, it has a longer life expectancy than ordinary steel, and its use is increasing in high-consumption industries like automobiles and construction. \"Their earnings have been growing  around 15 percent a year,\" he said of Allegheny Ludlum, \"and I expect growth over the next five years to average 13 percent to 14 percent.\" **********Allegheny Ludlum is acquiring Teledyne, an even larger producer of high-end specialty metals, predominantly for the aerospace industry. Although the deal is for stock, Mr. Wiles said it would not be dilutive but would instead add substantial earnings per share. **********The steelmaker also buys back shares periodically. At the current price of $18.50 , the stock is yielding 3.5 percent. **********A Toy Story Another of Mr. Wiles's top picks is Tyco Toys, a distant and out-of-favor competitor to Hasbro and Mattel. While the shares of those two companies trade at 1 and 2 times, respectively, their annual sales per share, Tyco's share price is just 25 percent of sales. The stock closed Friday at $4.875 a share. **********Tyco is a potential turnaround, Mr. Wiles said, and new management took over  earlier this year. Tyco is a leader in two toy types, remote-controlled cars and the small model cars it sells under the Matchbox name. The new management is seeking stock-car racing tie-ins for these lines. **********\"If they're successful with the turnaround, the stock should trade into the $8 or $9 range,\" Mr. Wiles said. \"If they're not, we feel it would be a very attractive acquisition candidate, again around the $8 level.\" **********The manager sees relatively little risk in Tyco stock, in part because the company sold almost $100 million of convertible preferred stock last month, using the proceeds to pay down debt and bolster its balance sheet. Indeed, the Federated fund bought Tyco in the form of that convertible, which is now trading at $5.50 a share and has a coupon of 8.25 percent until it matures in 2000, when it must be exchanged for the common. **********Mr. Wiles said the strong link to the common meant his investment reflected his basic outlook for the company. **********When the Smoke Rises **********The Federated fund's No. 1 holding, at 2.8 percent of assets, is Philip Morris, now at the center of the national debate over tobacco. \"If I told you about this company's numbers,\" he said, \"and didn't talk about what it does for  a living, you would say, 'Wow! That sounds really good.' \" **********Philip Morris, which owns Miller Brewing and Kraft Foods as well as cigarette brands, \"is No. 1 or No. 2 in every market they serve,\" Mr. Wiles said. \"Their expected earnings growth for the next five years is 16 percent,\" he added, but their current price-earnings ratio, based on 1996 estimated earnings, is 13. Coca-Cola, which has the same kind of brand-name power in its markets, trades at a multiple of 30 times 1996 estimated earnings, he noted. **********\"Absent the controversy, this would be a $250 stock,\" he said of Philip Morris, which closed Friday at $102.125 . \"It won't get that kind of value, considering the risks, but I think it will get to the $130 to $140 area.\" **********The risks, of course, are that a court might find Philip Morris and other cigarette makers liable for the cancer deaths of their customers. Mr. Wiles noted that Philip Morris had never lost such a lawsuit. **********Philip Morris has been buying back shares and has raised its dividend an average of 18 percent in each of the last five years, to a current yield of nearly 4 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/07/world/divided-bosnia-city-s-croats-agree-to-honor-vote-results.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1996-08-07", "snippet": "European Union extracts agreement from defiant Bosnian Croat politicians to honor local election results, thus allowing European reconstruction efforts to continue in battered and divided city of Mostar; map (M)", "word_count": 1055, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Divided Bosnia City's Croats Agree to Honor Vote Results", "print_headline": "Divided Bosnia City's Croats Agree to Honor Vote Results", "body_text": " **********After weeks of intense haggling, the European Union extracted an agreement today from defiant Bosnian Croat politicians to honor local election results, thus allowing European reconstruction efforts to continue in this battered and partitioned city. **********The deal was greeted with relief among State Department officials. They worried that the repudiation of municipal polling results -- in this case favoring Bosnian Muslims over Bosnian Croats -- would set an unacceptable precedent for the nationwide elections scheduled for next month. **********But European officials who have been administering Mostar for two years acknowledge that the agreement was partly a face-saving mechanism. **********The heavy lobbying needed to resolve a seemingly minor issue included a White House lecture from President Clinton to the President of Croatia, Franjo Tudjman, to push the stray Bosnian Croats into line. That does not bode well for the future of the larger Bosnian-Croat Federation, officials here said. **********Mostar, a traditional exemplar of Bosnian tolerance, was riven by ''ethnic cleansing'' during the war between Bosnia's Muslims and Croats. The city was supposed to come together during the European Union's tenure here. **********A reunited city, it was hoped, would be the paragon for the federation, which is intended under the Dayton peace accords to be the counterweight to the Bosnian Serbs' self-styled republic, in a multi-ethnic Bosnia. **********But with Mostar split along ethnic lines and virtually none of the refugees who were uprooted by the fighting here returning to their homes, the city looks like anything but an uplifting model. **********The European Union threatened to pull out of Mostar if the Croats did not agree to ratify the election results. But the European Union is at the end of its work here anyway. **********In its remaining five months, the union is set to spend about $25 million, completing projects but not starting new ones, said the spokesman in Mostar, Dragan Gasic. Already, senior officials like engineers and economists are leaving, he said. **********When the union officials leave in December they say they will hand over all responsibilities to the joint municipal council that the Croats have tried to make inoperable. **********The European Union has poured more than $200 million into Mostar, rebuilding war-shattered schools, hospitals, water systems and traffic lights. At the peak of activity, more than 350 Europeans worked here, including 180 European police officers supervising trial inter-ethnic police patrols. **********Nestled in a mountainous canyon, with the jade-green Neretva River flowing through it, Mostar has about 60,000 residents about evenly divided between Muslims and Croats. The internationally admired 400-year-old stone Mostar bridge, which spans the river at its narrowest point, was pummeled by Bosnian Croat artillery and remains at the bottom of the river. **********A thin, swaying walkway put up by the European Union, perhaps a symbol of the frayed state of affairs here, replaces it. **********In the western side of the city, controlled by the Bosnian Croat politicians, some 7,000 Muslims remain, although demobilized Croatian soldiers continue to throw Muslim families out of their homes, Western officials say. **********On the eastern side of the city the inhabitants are virtually all Muslim, many of them evicted from their homes on the west side during the 1993 war. The European officials, who have been struggling to persuade Bosnian Croats to agree to joint city projects with the Muslims, say the most difficult task has been psychological healing. It mostly has not been accomplished. **********''When it comes to tangible projects -- bridges, schools -- obstacles are rare,'' said Howard Fox, a British adviser to the inter-ethnic police force. ''When you demand spiritual unification like a police force or a city council, the will to unify disappears. The idea of recreating the old Mostar is an idea of nostalgia.'' **********Many Muslims and Croats agree with this outsider view. They say that in many ways the two cultures are springing away from each other, intent on preserving separate identities. Both sides are becoming self-sufficient -- with working telephones, their own police forces, separate schools, different license plates and distinctive currency. So there appears to be less and less need for people to cross into each other's territory. **********Election day on June 30, when many uprooted Muslim residents now living on the east side of the river returned to their old polling places on the west side, was the first time there was significant movement of people across the boundaries. **********But it was only because of a security blanket provided by NATO-led troops that there was so much traveling and virtually no incidents of violence, election monitors said. **********And the reception in old neighborhoods was often frigid. A young woman who was one of the few pedestrians walking across the city's dividing line today said she had returned for the first time since the war to her old address for the election. **********''When I came to vote, the people who pushed me out were in the polling place,'' she said, refusing to give her name. ''They knew what they had done, and when they saw me they were not pleased.'' **********She said she visited the west side to organize business for her store almost daily but made her meetings there as brief as possible. ''After the elections I thought I would feel safer,'' she said. ''But I am afraid. I don't think I would get any help if I were attacked.'' **********After 18 months of trying, the European Union gave up on the idea of inter-ethnic schools. The two sides now have separate schools with separate curriculums in social studies, history and music. On the west side, the courses are taught in Croatian; on the east side in a language being forged as Bosnian. **********''I've always said that if people want to have their own nation and language, they should have it,'' said Jure Musa, the minister of education, sports and culture in West Mostar. ''And that's what we are doing here.'' **********The situation in the city was summed up well by the Mostar Arts Festival last month. **********Akis Brkic, 60, a sculptor who has lived in the city all his life, was showing his wood and stone works in a gallery on the east side of the city today. More than 100 visitors came to the opening day of his exhibit, he said. **********''I live for the day when the city won't be divided,'' Mr. Brkic said. ''We had hoped for Croatian artists to participate in the festival -- just like it used to be. But they didn't come.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/01/business/sorting-out-ups-and-downs-of-the-nasdaq.html": {"writer_name": "Laurence Zuckerman", "pub_date": "1996-07-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1144, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sorting Out Ups and Downs of the Nasdaq", "print_headline": "Sorting Out Ups and Downs of the Nasdaq", "body_text": " **********Has the summer technology slump returned to Wall Street? **********The slide in the Nasdaq composite index earlier this month convinced many analysts that the annual selloff -- conspicuous by its absence last year -- was  back. **********But then technology stocks rallied on Thursday and Friday, sending the index back up nearly 3 percent since Wednesday's close. That is still down more than 5 percent, however, from the Nasdaq index's record-high close on June 5. **********\"We've seen this dance before,\" said Laura Conigliaro, a computer hardware and software analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York. \"People get fed up and say, 'I never want to see these stocks again' and a lot of good stocks get thrown out with the bath water. Then it all comes back. Sometimes it gets as bad as people throwing out a stock one week and then buying it back the next.\" Some of that bounce may have been at work late last week, when the stocks of several technology companies, including Hewlett-Packard, Digital Equipment and Storage Technology, largely recovered after falling steeply earlier in the week. For most of the 1980's and into the early 90's, many investors would sell off their technology holdings in the late spring, when corporate spending on computers and other equipment slowed, and would begin buying again in the fall,  when capital spending picked up. The striking exception came last summer, when anticipation of Microsoft's Windows 95 software operating system and the expectation of record Christmas-season sales of personal computers lifted the entire sector to new heights. At that time, many analysts talked about a new level of sustained demand for key components like semiconductors, ending that industry's painful boom-and-bust cycles. But almost as soon as those words were uttered last fall the bottom fell out of the chip market. And yet, by early June, investor infatuation with technology stocks in general had helped send the Nasdaq index to new heights. Then came what looked suspiciously like a return of the summer slump. **********For 8 of 10 trading sessions in mid- and late June, the Nasdaq Composite fell and other high-technology stock indexes plunged with it. Analysts attribute the  selloff mainly to investors who had believed predictions that a weak first quarter for technology companies, like computer and disk drive makers, would be  followed by a strong recovery but who had finally abandoned that hope. Some analysts argue that if the high-tech slump is back this year it is for reasons that have little to do with the technology industry's old pattern of seasonality. Rather than a summer slump, they say, the recent downturn may be largely a result of an inventory glut that is the hangover from last year's technology binge. According to this version of events, the story began in 1994, when surprisingly  strong sales caused many personal computer companies to run out of vital components. Fearing a repeat in 1995, and whipped up by the hype surrounding the August introduction of Windows 95, PC makers began double- and triple-ordering components in the spring of 1995. That led to record sales for many suppliers, setting off a big round of investment in new plants to meet the heavy demand. But when sales of computers turned out to be merely strong, not spectacular, many companies were left with large inventories of components. \"We had hoarding mentality last year because the lead time on chips was 15 to 20 weeks compared to 4 to 6 weeks in normal times,\" said Tom Kurlak, a semiconductor analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company in New York. Executives at semiconductor and disk drive makers who thought the excess inventory would be used up by the end of the first quarter have been unpleasantly surprised. While sales of personal computers have remained strong,  sales of components have stayed weak, indicating that there was a lot more excess inventory than many people believed. \"The scale of the inventory problem was quite a bit larger than people thought,\" said Drew Peck, an analyst with Cowen & Company in Boston. \"You can find excess  inventory in every nook and cranny of the PC business throughout the world.\" Over the last few weeks, several technology companies, including the chip makers Advanced Micro Devices and Cyrix and the disk drive maker Quantum, have issued statements warning that they will not be meeting Wall Street's earnings estimates for the quarter that just ended. Other companies, especially memory chip makers like Samsung, Hyundai and Texas Instruments, have announced that they are suspending expansion plans or cutting production. At the same time, analysts have cut estimates for the more established technology stocks, like I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard, and Digital Equipment, in advance of their second-quarter earnings because of reportedly weak sales in Europe. In addition, a strong dollar, which contributes to weak overseas sales,  also makes overall earnings appear weaker because they are calculated in dollar  terms. The resulting decline in technology stocks began to pick up its own momentum earlier this month as fund managers moved to bail out of the stocks before the end of the month so that the quarterly snapshot of their holdings seen by investors would not include a heavy exposure to the declining technology sector. But now that such window dressing has come to an end, will technology stocks begin to pick up again? If the Nasdaq closes of last Thursday and Friday are any indication, the recovery may have already begun. But many analysts think that the next quarter will also be weak. Still, they are optimistic that the business will start to recover toward the end of the year and will be strong in 1997. \"This is the final give-up phase in this down cycle,\" Mr. Kurlak of Merrill Lynch said. \"This summer should represent the bottom. Inventory liquidation has  gone as low as it can go.\" However, the only company he is recommending is the Intel Corporation, the maker of more than 80 percent of the microprocessors that form the heart of personal computers. Mr. Kurlak said that Intel was six months ahead of schedule reaching mass production of its new Pentium Pro chip, which he predicted would help drive a new round of computer sales to corporate buyers starting next year. That, in turn, should lift personal computer makers like Compaq Computer, I.B.M. and Dell Computer. **********Other analysts agree, but they warn that a recovery for the memory chip industry, which is plagued by overcapacity, may be a long time in coming. That should help makers of personal computers and cellular telephones, who use many of the chips, pull out of the current slump later this year. \"The memory chip business will suffer for a quite a while,\" said Mr. Peck, the Cowen & Company analyst, added, \"but my sense is that the rest of the technology industry will return to normalcy.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/21/business/national-semiconductor-to-cut-170-additional-jobs.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-08-21", "snippet": "National Semiconductor Corp, struggling with falling computer chip sales, to cut 170 more jobs, mostly in California; will take $280 million to $320 million charge against earnings in current quarter (S)", "word_count": 76, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR TO CUT 170 ADDITIONAL JOBS", "print_headline": "NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR TO CUT 170 ADDITIONAL JOBS", "body_text": " **********The National Semiconductor Corporation said yesterday that it would cut 170 jobs, mostly in California, as it struggles with falling sales of its computer chips.
